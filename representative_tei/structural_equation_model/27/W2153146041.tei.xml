<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The present study addressed the relationships among professional efficacy, emotional exhaustion, and job characteristics (job demands and job control) in the context of a two-wave panel study among 828 Dutch police officers. Based on the demand-control model, we expected that high demands/high control would be positively related to professional efficacy, and that high demands/low control would be related to high levels of exhaustion. Moreover, we hypothesized that high levels of exhaustion would lead to lower levels of professional efficacy and that high levels of efficacy would lead to low levels of exhaustion. Structural equation modelling largely supported these predictions. High demands were longitudinally related to high levels of efficacy and high levels of exhaustion; high control was longitudinally related to high levels of efficacy. Further, efficacy and exhaustion were indeed mutually related. Finally, high levels of exhaustion were longitudinally related to high levels of demands. We conclude that there are complex, yet theoretically, and practically interpretable relations among efficacy, strain and work characteristics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Self-efficacy refers to people's 'beliefs in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to produce given attainments' <ref type="bibr">(Bandura, 1997, p. 3)</ref>. As such, self-efficacy has been found to positively impact outcomes such as job search behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Van Hooft, Born, Taris, Van der Flier, &amp; Blonk, 2004)</ref>, job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(McNatt &amp; Judge, 2008)</ref>, and task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">( Judge, Jackson, Shaw, Scott, &amp; Rich, 2007)</ref>. Interestingly, whereas self-efficacy beliefs have often been studied as personal resources that affect work behaviours and attitudes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Judge et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Schwarzer &amp; Hallum, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Van Hooft et al., 2004)</ref>, research focusing on the antecedents of job-related self-efficacy as an outcome in its own right is substantially less prevalent.</p><p>One exception is the stream of research on job burnout. The most-often used instrument to assess burnout, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Maslach, Jackson, &amp; Leiter, 1996)</ref> construes this concept as a syndrome of three theoretically distinct dimensions: emotional exhaustion (a measure of job-related strain), depersonalization (a way of coping with strain by distancing oneself from the source of that strain), and (lack of) professional efficacy (a measure of job-specific self-efficacy; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Maslach, 2003)</ref>. Theoretically, Maslach considered lack of professional efficacy to arise in response to high levels of exhaustion and depersonalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Taris, Le Blanc, Schaufeli, &amp; Schreurs, 2005)</ref>. As especially exhaustion is systematically related to high levels of job demands and low levels of job control (De Lange, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Taris, Kompier, Houtman, &amp; Bongers, 2003</ref>; for a review), this approach suggests that high demands and low control may indirectly lead to lower levels of job-specific self-efficacy, through elevated levels of exhaustion and depersonalization. However, at present the support for this reasoning is weak <ref type="bibr">(Taris et al., 2005)</ref>. Moreover, as the idea that burnout should be conceptualized as to include efficacy has severely been criticized <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kristensen, Borritz, Villadsen, &amp; Christensen, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Shirom, 2005)</ref>, it is unlikely that future research in this tradition will substantially further our understanding of the relationships between job characteristics and self-efficacy.</p><p>The present study, therefore, examines the relationships between job characteristics and self-efficacy from a different viewpoint. Drawing on <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Karasek and Theorell's (1990)</ref> dynamic version of the demand-control (DC) model, we propose that specific combinations of job demands and job control will promote the acquisition of new skills and knowledge (i.e., learning), and that high levels of learning will lead to higher levels of job-related self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Karasek, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Taris &amp; Kompier, 2005)</ref>. Below, we first provide a theoretical framework for our study, leading to a set of hypotheses concerning the relationships among work characteristics (job demands and job control) and professional efficacy (as a direct outcome of learning). These hypotheses are then tested using longitudinal data from 828 Dutch police officers.</p><p>Job characteristics, learning, and self-efficacy Contemporary theories on the relationships between work characteristics and outcomes such as learning behaviour and self-efficacy (e.g., action theory; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hacker, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> or the DC model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Karasek &amp; Theorell, 1990)</ref> propose that high (but not overwhelming) job demands and high job control are conducive to learning. In turn, higher levels of learning will promote the development of feelings of mastery and self-efficacy.</p><p>The DC model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Karasek and Theorell's (1990)</ref> DC model assumes that job environments can be characterized in terms of two dimensions: psychological work demands and the amount of control workers have to meet these demands. In the DC model, these two dimensions are crossed, yielding four archetypical jobs. Workers in low control/high demands jobs cannot respond optimally to the high demands of their job. On the one hand, this leads to high levels of strain; on the other hand, the lack of control means that workers cannot try out different ways of dealing with these demands, meaning that they have little opportunity for learning and development <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Karasek, 1998)</ref>. In turn, this implies that workers in such jobs should display relatively low levels of self-efficacy. However, if high demands occur in conjunction with high job control, workers will be able to deal effectively with these demands, thus, protecting themselves from excessive strain. As the workers possess high levels of control, they can experiment with different ways of dealing with the demands in their jobs. Learning will result, in turn leading to high levels of mastery and efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Karasek &amp; Theorell, 1990)</ref>.</p><p>Workers in low demands/low control jobs will experience low levels of strain, due to the absence of high demands. As incumbents of such jobs have little opportunity to exert control over their work situation, they have little opportunity for learning and personal development; consequently, feelings of mastery and efficacy should be lower than in high demands/high control jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Karasek, 1998)</ref>. Finally, in low demands/high control jobs low levels of strain are expected because workers can easily deal with the demands of their jobs. As job control is high, workers in such jobs can explore different ways of dealing with their job demands, which fosters learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bandura, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Karasek &amp; Theorell, 1990)</ref>. However, the absence of challenge (due to low demands) means that these jobs at best offer only moderate opportunities for acquiring new knowledge and skills, meaning that levels of self-efficacy and mastery should also be moderate.</p><p>Whereas the DC model has generated an impressive number of empirical studies during the last 30 years, the large majority of this research has concentrated on the model's implications for employee strain and ill-health. For example, virtually none of the studies reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Van der Doef and Maes (1999)</ref> or De <ref type="bibr">Lange et al. (2003)</ref> considered learning or learning-related outcomes such as self-efficacy <ref type="bibr">(Taris &amp; Kompier, 2005)</ref>. Therefore, the current study was designed to shed more light on the associations among self-efficacy, strain, and job characteristics.</p><p>Task characteristics, strain, learning, and self-efficacy: Three sets of hypotheses The DC model can be summarized as three sets of propositions. First, high demands and low control lead to high levels of strain. Previous research has largely supported these predictions, albeit somewhat more strongly for demands than for control <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(De Lange et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Van der Doef &amp; Maes, 1999, for reviews)</ref>. A recurrent issue here is whether the simultaneous presence of low demands and high control yields lower levels of strain than would be expected on the basis of the main effects of these two concepts, that is, can high control 'buffer' the adverse impact of high demands on worker health? If so, the statistical interaction of demands and control should account for an additional proportion of the variance in strain, beyond what is already accounted for by the main effects of these variables. Although previous research has not consistently supported this idea <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(De Jonge &amp; Kompier, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Taris, 2006)</ref>, the available evidence suggests that demands and control may indeed interact statistically, although this interaction usually accounts for only a small proportion of the variance in strain and may be dependent on a variety of third variables. Based on these notions, for the present study, we propose that job demands will be positively associated with strain (Hypothesis 1a), and that job control will be negatively associated with strain (Hypothesis 1b). Moreover, demands and control will interact statistically, such that the adverse effect of job demands on strain will be stronger for workers with low control than for those with high control (Hypothesis 1c).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task characteristics, learning, and efficacy</head><p>The second set of hypotheses is that high demands and high control lead to high levels of learning and self-efficacy. These ideas have been addressed in relatively few studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-efficacy and work characteristics 457</head><p>Based on an extensive literature review, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Taris and Kompier (2005)</ref> located 18 studies that focused on learning-related concepts in the context of the DC model, yielding 30 tests of the reasoning that high demands and high control would be beneficial for employee learning and especially the outcomes thereof (although many studies included more than one criterion variable, learning was not directly assessed). No less than 19 of these 30 tests supported the predictions of the DC model, showing optimal outcomes for high demands/high control jobs. Further, most of the remaining studies revealed optimal outcomes for those reporting high control; in these cases, high job demands were usually irrelevant.</p><p>Although this evidence suggest that particular combinations of demands and control may indeed promote or hinder learning and, thus, self-efficacy, it should be noted that only few of the studies discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Taris and Kompier (2005)</ref> actually focused on efficacy or mastery as outcome variables. This is unfortunate, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Karasek and Theorell (1990)</ref> consider these concepts the most tangible and important outcomes of learning, next to performance improvement. Further, most of the studies (14 out of 18) retrieved by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Taris and Kompier (2005)</ref> employed a cross-sectional design, meaning that little is known regarding the causal direction of the effects under study. This is a serious concern, as job characteristics and worker behaviour and well-being may mutually influence each other (e.g., De Lange, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Taris, Kompier, Houtman, &amp; Bongers, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Tucker et al., 2008)</ref>. Even worse, the few longitudinal studies in this area tend to yield mixed results. For example, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cunningham et al. (2002)</ref> found that incumbents of high demand/high control jobs felt more efficacious regarding a possible job change, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Holman and Wall (2002)</ref> reported that job demands were largely irrelevant and that levels of efficacy were highest in high-control jobs. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brown (2005)</ref> reported that job control was unrelated to learning behaviour; instead, high workload affected the time spent on learning negatively, thus, failing to corroborate the reasoning that high levels of control lead to high levels of learning, which in turn lead to high levels of self-efficacy.</p><p>Summarizing, as yet the evidence concerning the learning/efficacy-related predictions of the DC model is inconclusive, because (a) efficacy has rarely been considered as an outcome variable in this line of research, (b) the study designs do not usually allow causal inferences, and (c) because the few relevant findings are at odds with each other. Thus, at present it is still unclear whether particular combinations of job demands and job control promote or hinder employee self-efficacy. As the findings discussed above do not strongly confirm or reject the DC model as applied to learningrelated outcomes such as mastery and efficacy, for the time being, we expect that both job demands (Hypothesis 2a) and job control (Hypothesis 2b) will be positively associated with self-efficacy. Moreover, demands and control will interact statistically, such that the positive effect of control on efficacy will be stronger for those experiencing high demands than for those with low demands (Hypothesis 2c).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The relationships between learning, efficacy, and strain</head><p>The third set of hypotheses concerns the relationships among learning, efficacy and strain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Karasek and Theorell (1990)</ref> suggest that an effect of strain on efficacy may be accounted for by assuming that high levels of strain restrict a person's ability to learn solutions to new problems, in turn leading to lower levels of self-efficacy. Unfortunately, they do not specify the processes accounting for this association. It appears that at least two mechanisms could link high strain to low levels of learning and self-efficacy. First, the psychophysiological mechanism assumes that long-lasting high levels of stress may result in damage to the hippocampus, a brain area involved in learning and memory, with associated memory deficits. Research in this field has shown that experiences in the form of traumatic stressors may have long-term effects on the structure and function of the brain, which may impede learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bremner, 1999)</ref>, ultimately leading to lower levels of self-efficacy. Second, the cognitive-energetic mechanism suggests that high levels of stress reduce the effectiveness of information-processing, which is crucial in the early stages of skill acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Holman &amp; Wall, 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hockey (1997)</ref> proposed that individuals use performance-protection strategies under the influence of high environmental demands, including the narrowing of attention and shifting to simpler, already automatized strategies to get the job done, in order to maximize the costperformance trade off (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hacker, 1998)</ref>. This suggests that high levels of stress will inhibit experimenting with new ideas, thus, reducing learning and levels of self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Warr &amp; Downing, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>As regards the effects of learning and self-efficacy on strain, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Karasek and Theorell (1990)</ref> propose that learning leads to a 'broadening [of] the range of confrontable challenges at work <ref type="bibr">' (p. 93)</ref>. This is expected to translate into higher levels of selfefficacy; workers whose skills, knowledge, and competence has increased are likely to be aware of the fact that they can now deal more effectively with the demands of their job than before <ref type="bibr">(Taris &amp; Kompier, 2005)</ref>. Following appraisal theory, it can be argued that self-efficacy affects levels of strain; workers who are confident that they can deal with the challenges in their jobs will experience lower levels of strain than those with low levels of efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr">cf. De Lange, Taris, Kompier, Houtman, &amp; Bongers, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Compelling as these ideas may seem, to the best of our knowledge only two studies have examined the relationships between strain and learning/efficacy in the work context. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Parker and Sprigg (1999)</ref> found that high levels of mastery (a measure of workrelated efficacy) were cross-sectionally associated with low levels of strain. In their partly longitudinal study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Holman and Wall (2002)</ref> tested various models for the relationships among job characteristics, learning and strain. Using skill utilization as a proxy of learning, they concluded that learning and strain were mutually and longitudinally related; however, for self-efficacy and strain no such associations were found. Given these somewhat ambiguous findings (at least regarding the relationship between strain and efficacy), the strongest conclusion that seems warranted is that strain and self-efficacy may well mutually impact each other. Thus, we expect that high strain will be associated with low levels of self-efficacy (Hypothesis 3a), and that high self-efficacy will be associated with low levels of strain (Hypothesis 3b).</p><p>Further, based on appraisal theory, we expect that high levels of efficacy will alter workers' (perceptions of their) work environment <ref type="bibr">(e.g., De Lange et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)</ref>. Having faith in one's abilities to deal adequately with whatever might occur at the job may lead to a change in one's (perceived) job demands; whereas the tasks to be executed may actually not be different, workers will presumably consider these tasks as less demanding and requiring less effort. Therefore, high levels of selfefficacy will be associated with lower levels of job demands across time (Hypothesis 3c). Similarly, workers who are confident that they can address their tasks in a variety of ways will experience higher levels of job control across time, in that they have more freedom in deciding how to deal with their tasks. Thus, high levels of efficacy will be associated with higher levels of control across time (Hypothesis 3d).</p><p>Conversely, we expect that high levels of strain may affect workers' (perceptions of their) work environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(De Jonge et al., 2001</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Spector, Zapf, Chen, &amp; Frese, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Zapf, Dormann, &amp; Frese, 1996)</ref>. For example, already-strained and fatigued workers may have to expend extra effort in order to execute their normal tasks at a satisfactory level <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hockey, 1997)</ref>, meaning that they may consider these tasks more demanding than would normally be the case. Alternatively, workers may use the amount of strain they experience as a source of information on their work situation (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schwartz &amp; Clore, 2003)</ref>. If they experience high levels of strain, they are likely to conclude that their demands are too high and that they have inadequate control to deal adequately with these demands. This suggests that high levels of strain will result in higher job demands (Hypothesis 3e) and lower levels of job control (Hypothesis 3f) across time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A summary model</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> summarizes the hypotheses to be tested in the present study. The four main variables in our study are job control and job demands (as the two central task characteristics in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Karasek and Theorell's (1990)</ref> DC model), professional efficacy and emotional exhaustion. Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bandura (1997)</ref>, our measure of professional efficacy focuses on one's beliefs of being competent, effective at getting things done at work and feelings of job-related efficacy (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Maslach, 2003)</ref>. Job-related strain is measured in terms of emotional exhaustion, a subscale of the MBI <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Maslach et al., 1996)</ref>. Emotional exhaustion refers to fatigue, feelings of being overextended and depleted of one's emotional resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Maslach, 2003)</ref>, and thus represents the affective dimension of strain. Although other measures of strain are available, we felt that this measure was especially appropriate for assessing job-related (rather than general) strain. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows that the task characteristics are presumed to longitudinally affect levels of emotional exhaustion as well as professional efficacy. Further, exhaustion and efficacy will affect each other mutually across time. Finally, exhaustion and efficacy will longitudinally affect (perceived) task characteristics. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The data used in this study were collected as part of a two-wave longitudinal survey on the aetiology of mental health complaints among Dutch police officers. At the first wave of the study (Time 1), a random sample of 10,000 employees was drawn from the Dutch population of police officers, of which 5,277 officers (53% response) completed a structured questionnaire addressing work characteristics, health and background variables. Of these respondents, 2,732 (52%) also agreed to participate in the follow-up study, which was to be conducted 1-year later (at Time 2). Analysis of variance revealed several differences between the Time 1 scores of those who said they would participate at Time 2 and those who expressed no interested in participating in the second wave of the study (the non-response group, N ¼ 2; 545). Women and those with lower salary levels were less often interested in participating than did men and those with higher salary levels. This result matches with earlier findings on non-response in longitudinal research (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Taris, 2000)</ref>. Furthermore, in the response group higher scores on emotional exhaustion and lower scores on professional accomplishment were observed. This suggests that those with high levels of burnout complaints at Time 1 considered it more important to participate at Time 2 than those with fewer complaints. Of the 2,732 officers who said they were willing to participate in the Time 2 study, those who reported serious burnout complaints at Time 1 (as measured with the MBI -General Survey, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schaufeli &amp; Van Dierendonck, 2000)</ref> were not contacted for further participation, as their data would not offer much insight into the onset of burnout (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kasl &amp; Jones, 2003)</ref>. To determine whether the level of burnout complaints was high, a comparison was made with an independent representative sample of the Dutch workforce <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Schaufeli &amp; Van Dierendonck, 2000)</ref>. Officers with a 75th percentile score or higher on all three burnout dimensions were excluded. This resulted in a target sample of 1,667 participants who did not report serious burnout symptoms at Time 1.</p><p>From these 1,667 participants, a random sample of 1,000 officers was contacted for the Time 2 wave. Of these, 828 officers (82.8% response) returned a completed questionnaire. The final sample, thus, consisted of 828 police officers for which we had longitudinal data for both time points (85% male, M age ¼ 42:08, SD ¼ 7:83; 12.5% held a college or university degree, whereas virtually all other participants had attended police school). Eighty-three percentages were employed in executive police work (46.2% base police force, 13.3% research squad, 4.0% foreign police, 2.8% traffic police, and 17.0% other), and 16.7% were in the administrative or technical support services. On average, the participants had worked for 10.3 years in their current position, SD ¼ 8:4 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Job demands were measured with four items from a Dutch adaptation of the psychological demands scale of the job content questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Karasek, Brisson et al., 1998)</ref>, including 'do you have to work very fast?', 'Do you have much work to do' and 'On average, do you have sufficient time to finish all your work?' (reversed; zero ¼ 'no', one ¼ 'yes'; Cronbach's alpha was .74 for both study waves). Job control was measured with nine-items. One of these was derived from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Karasek et al. (1998)</ref>; three were borrowed from a Dutch stress questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bergers, Marcelissen, &amp; De Wolff, 1986)</ref>; the remaining five items were drawn from the NOVA-WEBA <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dhondt &amp; Houtman, 1997)</ref>.

Typical items are 'I feel used up at the end of the work day', 'I feel burned out from my work', and 'Working all day is really a strain to me' (0 ¼ 'never', 6 ¼ 'always ðeverydayÞ', Time 1 alpha was .87, Time 2 alpha was .85).</p><p>Professional efficacy was measured using the six-item professional efficacy scale of the MBI -General Survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Schaufeli &amp; Van Dierendonck, 2000)</ref>. This scale refers to feelings of competence, efficacy, and achievement in one's work. Typical items are 'I have accomplished many worthwhile things in this job', 'At work, I feel confident that I am effective at getting things done', and 'At work, I am full of self-confidence' (0 ¼ 'never', 6 ¼ 'always ðeverydayÞ', Time 1 alpha was .77, Time 2 alpha was .71).</p><p>Finally, in this study, we controlled for participant age, gender, level of education, salary level (a proxy for job level), and experience, i.e., the number of years that the participant had worked in the type of job they presently held.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>Invariance of the scales across time Five sets of preliminary confirmatory factor analyses (CFA, Jo ¨reskog &amp; So ¨rbom, 2002) were conducted to examine whether the factor structures of the scales used in the present research were invariant across time, following the procedure described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Taris (2000)</ref>. First, we fitted an overall CFA model for our measures (Model 1a). For each time point, we specified a model containing four latent factors, with the items of job demands, control, emotional exhaustion, and professional efficacy as the observed indicators of these four factors. The latent factors were allowed to correlate within each time point. Using multigroup analysis, we computed the fit of this model across both time points (Model 1a). Model fit was assessed using the chi-squared test, as well as the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) and the non-normed fit index (NNFI). Values of .08 and lower (for RMSEA) and .90 and over (for NNFI) signify acceptable fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Byrne, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> presents the fit indices for Model 1a, showing that this model fitted the data acceptably well (RMSEA , :08 and NNFI . :90). Thus, at both time points a four-factor model accounted reasonably well for the associations among the items. To test whether the loadings of the items were the same across time, these were constrained to be equal for both time points (Model 1b). As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows, the fit of this model did not deteriorate as compared to Model 1a, Dx 2 ðdf ¼ 20; N ¼ 828Þ ¼ 7:49, p . :99, meaning that the factor loadings could be assumed to be equal at both time points. Additionally, for each scale (i.e., job demands, job control, job strain, and professional efficacy) a separate CFA was conducted, examining whether the factor loadings of this scale were equal for Times 1 and 2. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> presents the relevant fit indexes (Models 2a-5b), showing that for all four concepts a one-factor model applied at both time points, and that the factor loadings of these models did not differ significantly across time (none of the Dx 2 s was statistically significant, and all NNFIs and RMSEAs were acceptable). Scale scores were obtained by summing the respective items, and these were used for the main analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main analysis</head><p>A longitudinal extension of the model presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>  presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> were measured for both study waves, there were two sets of variables (i.e., the variables as measured for Times 1 and 2, respectively). Further, we created a demands £ control interaction term for Time 1 following the guidelines of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aiken and West (1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">see Cortina, Chen, &amp; Dunlap, 2001)</ref> for an extensive discussion of estimating interaction terms in SEM). All (errors of) variables within each wave were allowed to correlate. Conceptually, this implies that we hold no specific hypotheses concerning their interrelationships, other than that these variables may be associated.</p><p>One may argue that the study hypotheses (as presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) could also apply within waves, and that we should therefore test our hypotheses within each wave as well. However, testing cross-sectional relationships does not provide strong evidence regarding the causal direction of effects; therefore, we did not bother to specify within-wave hypotheses and decided to focus directly upon the longitudinal part of our data set.</p><p>Further, for all Times 1 and 2 pairs of variables (e.g., Time 1 job control and Time 2 job control), the Time 1 measure of the variable was included as a predictor of the Time 2 measure of the same variable. This accounts for possible (and likely) across-time stability in the scores on our variables. Finally, the lagged counterparts of the effects presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> were added to our model, together with lagged effects of the demand £ control interaction term on emotional exhaustion and professional efficacy. Actually, only this set of effects interests us here, in that these effects inform us about the degree to which Hypotheses 1a-3f can be retained. As the reliabilities of the scales involved were acceptable to good, we did not use latent variables.</p><p>In order to simplify our analyses and the interpretation thereof as much as possible, the analyses were conducted with a matrix of partial correlation coefficients as input, partialling out the background variables age (measured in years), gender, level of education (a six-category scale), salary level (six categories), and experience (in years). Whereas these variables may be related to the concepts under study (and, hence, should be held constant), they are not of interest in this study. In this vein their effects could be controlled for, without incorporating these variables explicitly into the SEMs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The initial model, including all effects presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> as well as effects of the demand £ control interaction on emotional exhaustion and professional efficacy, fitted the data well, x 2 (N ¼ 828; df ¼ 4Þ ¼ 3:54, RMSEA ¼ :00, NNFI ¼ 1:00. Inspection of the separate parameter estimates revealed that several effects did not differ significantly from zero. Most importantly, none of the effects of the demand £ control interaction term reached statistical significance (Hypotheses 1c, 2c not supported). The model was re-estimated after omitting this interaction, x 2 (N ¼ 828; df ¼ 2Þ ¼ 2:96, RMSEA ¼ :024, NNFI ¼ :99. Again, not all effects included in this model differed significantly from zero. These were omitted, yielding a chi-squared value of (N ¼ 828; df ¼ 7Þ ¼ 4:81, RMSEA ¼ :00, NNFI ¼ 1:01, suggesting that this model could be accepted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work characteristics, exhaustion, and efficacy</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> presents the standardized maximum likelihood estimates for the final model. To facilitate interpretation, the main findings presented in this table are presented graphically in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows, the Times 1 and 2 stability effects range from .43 (for emotional exhaustion) to .60 (for job control). The magnitude of these effects is within the range reported elsewhere for 1-year intervals (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Taris, De Lange, Kompier, Schaufeli, &amp; Schreurs, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Of more interest are the lagged effects shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Hypotheses 1a/b concerned the effects of job demands and job control on emotional exhaustion. The present results show that whereas high demands were longitudinally related to higher levels of exhaustion (a standardized effect of .08, p , :01, Hypothesis 1a confirmed), job control was unrelated to exhaustion (Hypothesis 1b not supported). Further, according to the DC model, high levels of demands and high levels of control should be associated with high levels of professional efficacy. Although job demands were unrelated to efficacy, there was a significant positive effect of control on professional efficacy (an effect of .07; Hypothesis 2a not supported, Hypothesis 2b confirmed).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exhaustion and efficacy</head><p>As regards the relationships between emotional exhaustion and professional efficacy, we found that high levels of Time 1 exhaustion were associated with lower levels of efficacy at Time 2 (an effect of 2.06, p , :01, Hypothesis 3a confirmed). Consistent with Hypothesis 3b, high Time 1 levels of efficacy were related to low levels of exhaustion at Time 2 (an effect of 2.06, p , :05; Hypothesis 3b confirmed). Further, we expected that emotional exhaustion and professional efficacy would be longitudinally related to changes in workers' (perceptions of their) task characteristics. There was little support for these ideas; only high levels of exhaustion were longitudinally related to high demands (a standardized effect of 2.09, p , :01; Hypothesis 3e confirmed; Hypothesis 3c, d, and f not supported).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present study was designed to shed more light on the associations among job characteristics, strain, and work-related self-efficacy. Drawing on <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Karasek and Theorell's (1990)</ref> DC model, we developed three sets of hypotheses. The first of these concerned the effects of work characteristics (job demands and job control) on levels of emotional exhaustion. Consistent with previous findings (e.g., De <ref type="bibr">Lange et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Van der Doef &amp; Maes, 1999)</ref>, high levels of job demands were related to an increase in levels of exhaustion. The prediction that high job control would be negatively related to levels of exhaustion was not supported, however. The second set of hypotheses focused on the relationships between work characteristics and professional efficacy. Although high control was indeed conducive to feelings of professional efficacy, there was no direct longitudinal association between efficacy and job demands. Thus, in the present study demands and control were differentially related to exhaustion and professional efficacy; whereas control was related to efficacy (but not to strain), demands were related to strain (but not to efficacy). This pattern of effects agrees with the conclusions of two review studies on the strain and learning-related implications of the DC model. De <ref type="bibr">Lange et al. (2003)</ref> reviewed 19 high-quality longitudinal studies on the relationships among demands, control, and strain, reporting that job demands were usually more important in determining stress and strain than job control. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Taris and Kompier (2005)</ref> found in their 18-study review that high job control was virtually always related to higher levels of motivation, self-efficacy, and learning, but that the association between demands and these outcomes was 'considerably less ambiguous' (p. 141). In this sense, the current findings are consistent with earlier findings that demands and control tend to be differentially related to different types of outcomes. This idea was taken further by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bakker and Demerouti (2007)</ref> in their demand-resources model. They proposed a dualprocess model for the relationships among demands, resources (such as control), strain (exhaustion), and motivation (professional efficacy). According to their model, chronically high demands will be draining one's energy which results in high levels of exhaustion, whereas high control will increase worker motivation and foster personal growth, learning, and self-efficacy. These two processes operate largely in isolation (demands and resources may interact in affecting outcomes, but these effects tend to be weak, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Xanthopoulou et al., 2007</ref>; the present study did not provide indications for a demand £ control interaction effect either).</p><p>The third set of hypotheses concerned the relationships among efficacy, emotional exhaustion, and task characteristics. As expected, high levels of exhaustion inhibited feelings of efficacy, which is in line with previous notions that high strain may have adverse effects on the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bremner, 1999)</ref> and that strained workers may rely on triedand-tested ways of doing their tasks, rather than to invest effort in learning how to increase their effectiveness on the job <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hockey, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Taris &amp; Kompier, 2005)</ref>. Conversely, feelings of efficacy (as a possible outcome of learning) inhibited levels of exhaustion, which supports the notion that greater knowledge, skill and efficacy enable the individual to deal more effectively with work demands, thus reducing strain <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(De Lange et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, we proposed that high levels of efficacy or exhaustion could affect workers' (perceptions of their) task characteristics <ref type="bibr">(cf. De Lange et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Zapf et al., 1996)</ref>. Although we replicated De Jonge et al. <ref type="bibr">'s (2001)</ref> finding that high levels of strain related longitudinally to higher task demands (which is consistent with <ref type="bibr">Spector et al. 's (2002)</ref>, stress creation hypothesis and Schwarz and Clore's ( <ref type="formula">2003</ref>) feelings-asinformation hypothesis), professional efficacy was not directly related to changes in the (perception of the) task characteristics. One explanation for the lack of effects of professional efficacy on task characteristics is that highly efficacious workers take on more difficult tasks, even if they remain in the same job. Thus, executing their tasks will require more or less the same effort across time, meaning that their perceived job demands (and, perhaps, their job control as well) does not change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study limitations</head><p>Four limitations of the present study must be discussed. Firstly, our findings are based on a specific sample (828 Dutch police officers); moreover, this sample was selected on the basis of their scores on two of the study variables (emotional exhaustion and professional efficacy). This raises two issues, namely (i) potential restriction of range effects and (ii) potential problems regarding the degree to which our findings apply to other professions. As regards the first problem, due to our selection procedure police officers experiencing very high (low) levels of exhaustion (professional efficacy) at the first wave of the study were not included in our sample (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Van Hooff et al., 2005)</ref>. Moreover, our sample is homogeneous in terms of the type of jobs involved (mainly police officers in non-management jobs). It is possible this has led to restriction of range effects, resulting in conservative estimates of the associations involving exhaustion and efficacy, but also reducing the magnitude of the correlations among the other study variables (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Thus, part of the effects reported here may be stronger in more heterogeneous populations. As regards the degree to which the present findings can be generalized to other professions, the present sample of police officers certainly involves a unique and in many respects idiosyncratic selection of jobs. A priori, this would suggest that there is a strong need to replicate our findings in other professions. However, on second thoughts, we believe that this problem might be somewhat less serious than it would appear to be. The models tested in this research were based on theoretical insights that should apply to all professions; moreover, our findings partly replicate results obtained for other types of jobs. Although, we subscribe to the idea that it is important to broaden the empirical basis for the propositions forwarded in this study, there seems little reason to assume that the results obtained for other professions will diverge strongly from the findings presented here.</p><p>A second potential limitation derives from the fact that all data were obtained from self-reports, meaning that common method variance (CMV) may have biased our findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Spector, 2006</ref>, for a qualification of the need to control for CMV). We believe that it is unlikely that CMV has severely affected our results, for two reasons. First, whereas it is possible that CMV (e.g., in the form of memory effects and the wish to provide answers that are consistent with each other) has affected the within-wave correlations, it would seem unlikely for such mechanisms to strongly affect the across-wave associations. As the present study focuses exclusively on these across-wave relationships, we expect the findings presented in this research to be fairly robust with respect to CMV. Secondly, if CMV would indeed have inflated the associations among the variables in the present study, these should be consistently high <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Spector, 2006)</ref>. Inspection of the within-wave correlations presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows that this is not the case. These correlations range from an insignificant .06 to a moderately strong .36. This pattern of correlations thus suggests that CMV does not threaten the validity of our findings.</p><p>Thirdly, this study examined the relationships among work characteristics, strain, and self-efficacy in the context of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Karasek and Theorell's (1990)</ref> DC model. In this model, the relationships between work characteristics and efficacy are accounted for in terms of the acquisition of new skills and knowledge: the combination of high demands with high control is presumed to result in learning, in turn leading to high levels of efficacy. However, the present study did not measure whether the participants had actually acquired new skills and knowledge on their jobs, meaning that the correctness of our underlying reasoning (that learning is the process connecting task characteristics to self-efficacy) could not be checked. This is an important limitation, in that as yet little is known about the task-related factors that promote or hinder learning (cf. <ref type="bibr">Taris &amp; Kompier, 2005)</ref>. Therefore, future research should address these relationships more closely, using measures that specifically focus on the acquisition of new skills and knowledge rather than employing proxy variables for learning.</p><p>A final limitation of the present research concerns the magnitude of our findings. Apart from the Times 1 and 2 stability effects, the standardized longitudinal effects presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>/Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> are small. This questions the relevance of our findings; effects may be statistically significant, but do they have practical implications as well? We argue that they have: firstly, the small effects reported here are common in longitudinal research, owing to the fact that these designs typically relate change in the outcome variables (i.e., after controlling Time 1 measures of these outcomes) to the explanatory variables. However, as many phenomena studied in occupational health research (including emotional exhaustion and professional efficacy, cf. <ref type="bibr">Taris et al., 2005)</ref> tend to be rather stable across time, there is often little change in the outcomes to be accounted for, resulting in small effect sizes for the explanatory variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Taris, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Taris &amp; Kompier, 2003, for discussions)</ref>. Secondly, the explanatory variables will not usually immediately affect the outcome variables; a certain time has to elapse for the explanatory variables to affect the outcomes maximally (e.g., De <ref type="bibr">Lange et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Zapf et al., 1996)</ref>. However, the interval between the waves in a particular study will not usually correspond exactly with the underlying 'true' causal interval <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Taris, 2000)</ref>. For example, control may affect strain, but over a different (shorter or longer) time period than the 1-year interval studied here. The effects of the explanatory variables will then be underestimations of their 'true' causal effects.</p><p>Moreover, it is possible that different time lags apply for different sets of variables, making it difficult to detect differential processes using the same time lag: a time lag that is optimal for one process is not necessarily good for another. The best strategy to circumvent these problems is to use a multiwave design in which data are collected at many short-spaced intervals during a relatively long study period. However, this is practically often not feasible due to financial considerations and the lack of willingness of organizations and workers to comply with a demanding design (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Taris, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zapf et al., 1996 for discussions)</ref>. Thirdly, the longitudinal effects reported here may be quite small, but the underlying processes they represent may well work during one's whole lifetime as a worker. Just as drops of water may dent a stone in time, chronic exposure to high demands may ultimately lead to high levels of strain (or low levels of efficacy, etc.) across time. All in all, we feel that to discard the findings presented here, as being practically irrelevant would miss the opportunity to make a difference in the workplace.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study implications</head><p>The present study extends previous work in this area in several respects. First, we have provided additional material regarding the effects of work characteristics on occupational well-being, showing that especially control is positively related to feelings of professional efficacy. As yet this issue has rarely been examined longitudinally, and in this sense, we believe that our findings provide an important contribution to the small body of knowledge in this area. Second, our study confirmed <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Karasek and Theorell's (1990)</ref> notion that strain (emotional exhaustion) and professional efficacy (as an outcome of learning) mutually influence each other. Although earlier cross-sectional research was consistent with the notion that strain inhibits efficacy and vice versa (among others, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Parker &amp; Sprigg, 1999)</ref>, our study is among the very first to show that these concepts affect each other longitudinally (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Holman &amp; Wall, 2002)</ref>. In effect, the present study provides the strongest support for the learning and efficacy-related predictions of the DC model (including the relationships with strain) to date.</p><p>All in all, our findings show that there are complex, yet theoretically and practically well interpretable relations among work characteristics, exhaustion, and efficacy. Practically, our findings underline the importance of growth, development, and learning in the workplace. Acquiring new skills and knowledge may be conducive to performance and feelings of efficacy, but high levels of efficacy also appear to reduce levels of strain. In this sense, promoting development, learning, and efficacy may also be effective in reducing strain and the organizational-level consequences thereof. Our results suggest that especially interventions targeted towards increasing job control may have a beneficial effect on feelings of efficacy. However, as these effects were relatively small in the present study, it may be more effective to boost skill development, learning and efficacy in a focused way, e.g., by increasing workers' opportunities to attend training and courses. However, to obtain the beneficial effect of efficacy on strain it would seem desirable that these training and courses are related to workers' task demands. Although it may be fun to attend a course that contributes to one's personal growth or development, it is unlikely that such courses will enhance one's task-relevant skills and knowledge. As the beneficial effect of learning and efficacy on strain will only be obtained if the course contributes to one's skills, courses that do not specifically address one's task demands may from an organizational point of view be considered a waste of scarce resources.</p><p>Scientifically, the present research shows that job characteristics (especially job control) may promote the development of higher levels of self-efficacy. This is an important finding, in that self-efficacy has been linked to many organizational phenomena, including performance <ref type="bibr">( Judge et al., 2007), job satisfaction, and</ref><ref type="bibr">turnover (McNatt &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Judge, 2008)</ref>. Theoretically, these relationships may be accounted for by assuming that the presence of job control leads to higher levels of learning, in turn resulting in higher levels of self-efficacy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hacker, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Karasek &amp; Theorell, 1990</ref>). However, it appears that at present this explanation has not been tested thoroughly using appropriate (longitudinal) designs. Although the findings obtained so far (including the results presented above, and those reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Holman and Wall (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Parker and Sprigg (1999)</ref>) are largely in line with this reasoning, as yet it is unclear whether learning (i.e., the acquisition of new skills and knowledge) is indeed the process linking task characteristics to self-efficacy. Thus, future research should examine this reasoning more closely.</p><p>Further, our results underline the need for more research on positive work outcomes such as learning and professional efficacy. Generally speaking, the present research suggests that especially studying the combination of positive (efficacy) and negative (emotional exhaustion) outcomes may be worthwhile, as these do not occur in a vacuum but may very well affect each other. Specifically, our results show that efficacy and exhaustion are mutually related. Although this is consistent with already extant theoretical notions in occupational health psychology, the behavioural, affective, and cognitive mechanisms underlying this association are still unclear. Future research into these mechanisms may reveal under which conditions particular effects may be obtained. It would seem likely that such research would blend insights from cognitive social psychology with those obtained in educational and learning psychology, thus, enriching the theoretical basis of current models in work psychology for the effects of task characteristics on exhaustion and professional efficacy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
