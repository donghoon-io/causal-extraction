<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Gifted education has been on the agenda of general education as it has increased rapidly in recent times. In this area, besides student characteristics, teacher characteristics, guidance and psychological counselling and guidance, education programs have also been created on how to train these children. There are many discussions about how these training programs should be, and it is explained that the training program prepared for the gifted should have some features. Real gifted education programs should also have high social validity and studies should be conducted on their effectiveness.</p><p>In addition, the education model prepared for the gifted should be theoretically testable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Sak (2010)</ref> opened up for discussion what the standards of the programs developed for the gifted should be and the characteristics of the real gifted education program. Besides, one of the main problems of gifted education in Turkey is the lack of education program.</p><p>Education Program for Gifted Bridge with University (EPGBU), developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tortop (2013)</ref> to fill the gap in this area;</p><p>With its curriculum components in five different fields and 120 educational achievements, it is a program that can be implemented not only for Turkey but also worldwide.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EPGBU Model Structure</head><p>In developing countries, it is seen that most of the gifted children's potential is directed to academic fields (such as medicine, engineering) in line with both the guidance of the families and the preferences of the children. This situation causes the educational needs of gifted children in the academic field to arise. Turkey is one of the examples of this situation. In the Science and Art Center (SAC) model of the Ministry of National Education of Turkey (MoNET), gifted children are mostly supported in the academic field. EPGBU was put forward with the idea of evaluating the situation of universities having the necessary infrastructure for the education of gifted children. EPGBU is therefore a university-based program.  <ref type="bibr">(Tortop, 2018)</ref> The social validity of the EPGBU training program, which was put forward by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tortop (2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tortop ( , 2015) )</ref> for gifted educa on in the academic field, was found to be high. In addition, in the structure of EPGBU consisting of 5 components; Scientific Creativity, Self-Regulation Skills in Learning Science, Thinking Skills, Scientific Research and Process Skills, History and Philosophy of Science.  <ref type="bibr">(Tortop, 2018)</ref> EPGBU has chosen the educational content necessary for the education of a gifted student in the academic field as gifted young scientists, on the axis of the theories of giftedness. "Self-regulated learning skills" for motivation and commitment to the task in all theories, the skills a scientist uses while carrying out his scientific research, research skills, "creativity" or creative thinking skill in all theories, and "self-regulated learning skills" found in Renzulli and Sternberg's theories. In order to develop the field of wisdom", it is necessary to determine the educational attainments related to fields such as "history and philosophia of science".</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Model</head><p>In this study, since it was aimed to model the different characteristics of the students studying in Science and Art</p><p>Centers, the research was descriptive and the survey model was chosen as the design <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Buyukozturk et al, 2011)</ref>. In the study, the model made by showing the interactions of the variables with each other with a diagram is called the path analysis technique. Path analysis can be done in two different types: observed variable and latent <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bryne, 2010)</ref>. Within the scope of this study, gifted students; Since the variables that determine the features such as self-regulation skills in science learning, scientific research and process skills, knowledge of the history of science and philosophy, thinking skills and scientific creativity are an observable variable, the type of path analysis made with the observed variables was chosen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Equation Modelling</head><p>The definition of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) can be made as follows. A theoretical model, framed or designed by a researcher, is testing the compatibility of the hypothesis in the light of the obtained data <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Schumacker &amp; Lomax, 2010)</ref>. In fact, it is a hypothesis testing technique, the researcher describes and tests the relationship between the observable and latent variables in the model he developed with the collected data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path Analysis Process with SEM</head><p>First of all, with any of the statistical package programs for the analysis of the path analysis technique with SEM, which are; Lisrel are programs like AMOS, variables need to be defined. In the path analysis process, it is decided whether the analysis will be done with observed variables or latent variables. After this stage, if the path analysis is to be done with observed variables, the variables should be defined with rectangles, and if it will be done with latent variables, they should be defined in the statistical package program with ellipses or circles. While performing the analysis, data is obtained from the correlation matrix of the variables in the data set if the analysis is to be made over the observable variables, and from the scale items of the latent variables if the analysis is to be made with the latent variables. After that, the probability of the hypothesis model is tested. In the model testing process in path analysis, the primary goal is to examine the fit of the model between the data obtained from the sample, with the criteria described as Goodness Fit Indices and giving an idea about the model fit. While testing the model with the data obtained from the sample, a difference arises and this is expressed as a residual. We can formulate it as follows; "Data = Model + Residual" . Here is the data; scores of observable variables taken from the sample, model; hypothesis about the situation based on the relationships between the variables, the remainder; It is the difference between the model presented as a hypothesis and the fit of the observable variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bryne, 2010)</ref>. The smallness of the remainder indicates the fit between the hypothetical model and the data set. In this respect, the model is interpreted as the better. There are the following stages in the SEM process; Defining the model, Estimating the model, Examining the fit of the model, Correcting the model. Identification of the model; It includes the researcher's tasks such as deciding which of the parameters will be constant or zero. Therefore, the researcher should place the model he considers theoretically and the variables in the model very well. An important issue to be considered at this stage is that the sample or data set is a certain number <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bryne, 2010)</ref>. Estimation is made with the covariance matrix statistical program of the sample regarding the parameters that are considered as constant or zero in the model. The purpose of this estimation is to test the difference between the population covariance matrix formed by the sample and the population covariance model created with the parameters in the model with the null hypothesis. Likewise, the smaller the difference, the stronger or better the fit between the model and the data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bryne, 2010)</ref>. and the data obtained by examining them according to certain criteria. There are many compliance statistics within the framework of SEM, some of which are as follows; Chi-square, the main purpose of this fit statistic is to test the fit of the universe covariance matrix and the sample covariance matrix. The number of samples is important for this statistical analysis <ref type="bibr">(Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 1989)</ref>.</p><p>Standardised Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) is a criterion for examining the standardized differences between the variance and covariance of the variables measured in the studied model. It is formulated by calculating the square root of the difference between the sample covariance matrix and the hypothesis covariance model. As the SRMR value approaches 0, it indicates good fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bryne, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hooper, Coughlan, &amp; Mullen, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) is a criterion that shows how complex the model is in terms of degrees of freedom. The cut-off point for RMSEA is recommended as .06. Being below this value indicates a good fit in model tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bryne, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Distefano &amp; Hess, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hoyle, 2000)</ref>. It is expected that the lower limit RMSEA value of the tested model is close to 0, and the upper limit RMSEA value does not exceed 10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hooper, Coughlan, &amp; Mullen, 2008)</ref>. AGFI -GFI (Goodnes of Fit Index) is a substitute for the chi-square test. is the test. It indicates the overall amount of covariance between observed variables calculated in the model under test. If this criterion is over 90, it indicates a good fit of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bryne, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hoyle, 2000)</ref>. CFI (Comparative Fit Index) is a criterion based on comparing the covariance matrix estimated by the model under test and the covariance matrix of the model tested with the null hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hoyle, 2000)</ref>. A value above .90 for this criterion indicates a good fit of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bryne, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hoyle, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>NFI (Normed Fit Index) is a criterion based on the comparison of the chi-square value of the tested model with the chi-square value of the zero model <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hooper, Coughlan, &amp; Mullen, 2008)</ref>. The NFI value of the tested model indicates acceptable fit for between .80 and .95, and perfect fit for &gt;.95 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>. Non-normed Fit Index (NFI); It is a criterion based on comparing the chi-square / degree of freedom ratios of both the observed model and the zero model.</p><p>A value above .90 indicates a good fit of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bryne, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hoyle, 2000)</ref>]. These fit statistics serve to examine the fit of the tested model with the data set by considering certain aspects. In general, it is necessary to look at all of these statistics, not just one.</p><p>Correction of the model; If the estimated covariance matrix in the model does not sufficiently match the sample covariance matrix, this model needs to be revised. In this process, it may be necessary to draw a path in the model or to delete an existing path. In this process, operations are performed on a criterion known as the modification index. Here, the change in the chi-square value of any path added to the model gives clues to the researcher. What needs to be done is to determine the paths that provide the highest decrease in the chi-square value of the model and define them to the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Group</head><p>The study group of the research consisted of a total of 102 gifted and talented 60 girls and 42 boys attending the 6th, 7th and 8th grades who were studying at the Science and Art Center in Manisa and Diyarbakır during the 2016-2017</p><p>and 2017-2018 academic years. created a child.</p><p>Information of the students in the study group in this study is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific Creativity Test</head><p>The "Scientific Creativity Test" developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hu and Adey (2002)</ref> and adapted into Turkish by Kadayici( <ref type="formula">2008</ref>) was applied to determine the scientific creativity levels of the students. The test, which consists of seven open-ended questions, measures all sub-dimensions of the process (imagining, thinking), character (fluency, flexibility, originality)</p><p>and product (technical product, science, science phenomenon, science problem), which are the main dimensions of the Scientific Creativity Construct Model. . Each question in the test measures multiple sub-dimensions. The answers given to the questions are scored in terms of fluency, originality and originality. In order to ensure the construct validity of the test, factor analysis was carried out by <ref type="bibr">Kadayifçı (2008)</ref> to ensure the construct validity of the test, and it was determined that the test measures a main factor and the factor load of all questions is more than 0.300. The reliability coefficient of the test developed by Hu and Adey was calculated as 0.89. The reliability coefficient of the test adapted to Turkish by Kadayifçı ( <ref type="formula">2008</ref>) was calculated as 0.735.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific Epistemological Beliefs Scale</head><p>When we look at the literature, it is seen that the scientific epistemological beliefs scale created by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Conley et al., (2004)</ref> is mostly used in studies conducted with secondary school students and field-oriented scientific epistemological beliefs in science <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ozkok, 2005)</ref>. From this point of view, a 26-item five-point Likert-type scientific epistemological beliefs scale, which was originally developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Conley, et al., (2004)</ref> for the primary school group consisting of 5th grade students, and adapted into Turkish by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kurt (2009)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Problem Solving Inventory for Children</head><p>The problem solving inventory for children was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Serin, Serin and Saygili (2010)</ref> to determine the level of self-perception of secondary school students regarding problem solving skills. The scale consists of 3 sub-dimensions and 24 items. The sub-dimensions of this scale consist of confidence in problem solving skills, self-control and avoidance factors. 12 items of the scale were designed for "Confidence in Problem Solving Skills", 7 items for "Self-Control" and 5 items for "Avoidance" factor. This scale, developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Serin, Serin and Saygili (2010)</ref>, was applied to a total of 568 students in eight primary schools. As a result of the factor analysis, the Cronbach Alpha reliability coefficient of the inventory was determined as 0.80. Each item was categorized as "Never", "Rarely", "Sometimes", "Often" and "Always" in the scale created in a five-point Likert type. Evaluation, "I never act like this (1)", "I rarely act like this (2)", "I act like this sometimes (3)", "I often act like this (4)", "I always act like this (5) " was designed and scored. Evaluation of negative items is "I never act like this (5)", "I rarely act like this (4)", "I sometimes act like this (3)", "I often act like this (2)", "I always act like this ( It is rated as "1)". <ref type="bibr">Serin, Serin, and Saygılı (2010)</ref> arranged the items as 32 positive statements and 32 negative statements, a total of 64 statements <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>. As a result of this arrangement, the final version of the scale was developed as 24 items. While the maximum score that the student can get from this scale is 120, the minimum score he can get is 24.</p></div>

For the reliability study of the scale, it was applied to 300 students with similar characteristics. With the ITEMAN program, 5 items with low reliability were removed from the scale. As a result of this arrangement, the final version of the scale was developed as 31 items. The test consists of scientific process skills, "Observing" (2 questions), "Space/Time relation" (3 questions), "Classification" (3 questions), "Using numbers" (3 questions), "Making measurements" (3 questions). question), "associating" (3 questions), "Prediction" (3 questions), "Controlling Variables" (3 questions), "Interpreting data" (2 questions), "Creating a hypothesis" (3 questions), "Defining"(1 question) and "Experiment" (2 questions). The content validity of the test was provided by taking expert opinions, and the KR-21 reliability coefficient was found to be 0.81. Its validity and reliability were tested and the internal consistency coefficient Cronbach alpha value was found to be 0.77. In the test, 1 point is awarded for each correct answer. Therefore, the highest score that can be obtained from the test is 31.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Critical Thinking Assessment Rubric</head><p>In this study, the reading passage (How Will We Choose the Astronaut?) developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Schreglmann (2016)</ref> was applied to determine the development of students' critical thinking skills. This reading passage, which was prepared in accordance with the sixth grade levels of secondary school, was created by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Schreglmann (2016)</ref> with the help of relevant field experts, and a draft text was created. During the pilot study, 10 sixth grade students were asked to read the reading passage and answer the related questions in 1 class hour. After this process, each student was interviewed individually and they were asked to state their thoughts and suggestions about the reading piece. As a result of the suggestions received from the students, the reading piece was rearranged and took its final form. This reading piece, which took its final form, was taught to students within the scope of the research. Immediately after the reading passage was read, the students answered the above-mentioned six separate questions, after examining 5 different solution proposals related to this passage. The most interesting point here is that students are given multiple solutions ready together. The questions are based on the evaluation of ready-made solutions. These questions consist of open-ended questions. It contains indicators that will enable the evaluation of students' critical thinking skills. When the critical thinking assessment rubric is examined, it is seen that the measurement tool includes important critical thinking elements (defining the problem, making comparisons, suggesting a solution, identifying weaknesses and deficiencies, developing ideas, reflecting).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and Recommendations</head><p>There are models in our country regarding the education of gifted children. Among them, EPGBU is an example of university-based programs. It is very important to test the theoretical foundations of these programs experimentally. It is seen that scientific knowledge is constantly expanding, technological innovations are progressing rapidly, in today's information and technology age, activities in science are seen clearly in our daily lives, and science education is very important in people's planning for the future <ref type="bibr">(MoNET, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Science is a discipline in which gifted children can develop advanced cognitive learning situations such as problem solving, analytical, self-regulation, productive, questioning and critical thinking. In this context, the science education of gifted individuals should include interesting and interesting subjects, focus on understanding concepts instead of memorizing, make students feel that they have an active researcher structure, and develop scientific thinking skills by trying to make them love science <ref type="bibr">(Van Tassel-Baska, 1994)</ref>. One of the most important aims of science education is to discover and support students' interests and abilities in the field of science. Science education has a structure that covers the interest and level of gifted students well.</p><p>Gifted students are children who learn faster and in different ways than their peers. In this context, the education to be given to gifted children should be spread over a shorter period of time, the content should be more enriched, and the education/training programs should be differentiated and created with a new model. In this respect, it is important to create models for the training of gifted young scientists. In this study, the EPGBU model was experimentally tested with the structural equation model. There are studies on the social validity of this model. The purpose of examining social validity is to determine the sustainability of the education program <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Schwartz &amp; Baer, 1991)</ref>. By examining the social validity of the program, the values of various features of the program are found in the thoughts of the program participants, and the factors that may cause the students to leave the training program are determined. The social validity of the programs created for the education of gifted students is as important as the effectiveness of the programs.</p><p>The effectiveness of the program improves the academic success of the student and enables the development of inquiring and creative thinking skills. In this direction, it can be thought that the program is in realizing its scientific goals. As a result, even if the programs with social validity below the normal level are effective, their continuity and widespread effects may be lost for a while <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Sak, 2011)</ref>. When EPGBU is examined in terms of student opinions, it can be said that it is a program with high social validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Tortop, 2014)</ref>. In the light of the interviews with the teachers, about the EPGBU model; They stated that the students participating in the EPGBU program had characteristics such as exhibiting positive behaviors, spending their time productively, improving their research and observation skills, sharing what they learned, regularity, trying to be more successful <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tortop &amp; Ersoy, 2015)</ref>. These views show that the model is a model with high social validity.</p><p>In this study, in the structural equation model study on EPGBU, the values of fit indices in CFA for the Model were investigated and interpreted <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Byrne, 2011)</ref>. Statistical values for Chi-Square Fit Index (χ2), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Good Fit Index (GFI), Normized Fit Index (NFI), and Root Mean Errors of Approximate (RMSEA) statistical values were determined in the CFA application <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Byrne, 2011)</ref>. The fact that the χ2/df ratio is 3 or less, the GFI, CFI, NFI values are higher than .90, and the RMSEA significance level is less than .06 indicates that the factor structure of the model is compatible <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hoe, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kline, 1998)</ref>. Researchers stated that GFI, AGFI and CFI values of .90 and above are a good fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arbuckle, 2012)</ref>. RMSEA value of .05 is the critical value and values below are preferred <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hoe, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>When the results of the analysis in CFA were also examined, it was seen that the model was a compatible model. The criteria for testing the model are CMIN Index, RMR Index, GFI Index, Parsimony-Adjusted Criteria, CP Index, FMIN Index, RMSEA Index, AIC Index, ECVI Index, HOELTER. Fit index findings related to testing the model;  <ref type="bibr">Sak (2010, 13)</ref>, gifted children experience difficulties in this regard during their school years because they cannot receive the education that will fully meet the individual needs of gifted and talented individuals. Gifted children have problems such as unexpectedly low achievement, lack of attention, adaptive problems, and the desire to stay away from school <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Clark, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ozbay, 2013)</ref>. In order to provide out-of-school education support to gifted students in Turkey, the Ministry of National Education of Turkey opens Science and Art Centers and increases their number. Science and Art</p><p>Centers are the most popular institutions in the country where gifted students are educated.</p><p>It has been established as institutions that can develop the basic abilities and mental capacities of students. However, the fact that these institutions do not have differentiated programs to meet the interests and needs of students hinders their intended functioning. Şahin (2014) states that there is a need for sustainable education programs at a level that can meet the advanced education needs of gifted and talented individuals, an education staff that can effectively transfer these education programs, and a management staff that can evaluate education programs and teachers (Şahin, 2014).</p><p>There are a limited number of programs on the education of gifted students in Turkey. It is seen that these are shortterm programs. In this respect, quantitative and qualitative inadequacies regarding the education of gifted students stand out <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Sak, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Sak, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tortop (2013)</ref> states that the field of gifted education has been neglected for many years in Turkey, except for the limited implementations of only a few program types. He also states that there are two university-based educational program models in Turkey. He stated that one of them was EPGBU. In the creation of EPGBU, it was aimed to create a model suitable for Turkey, its infrastructure and culture by taking into account contemporary models related to gifted education. In EPGBU, it is a comprehensive university-based education program consisting of a unique combination of diagnostics, curriculum components, mentor training and student identification criteria. The EPGBU model is a three-stage education program in the form of academic calendars of 10-12 weeks on the basis of primary, secondary and high school <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Tortop, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tortop and Eker, 2014)</ref>. It is seen that the education programs applied for gifted students in Turkey are insufficient in the academic field and in raising scientists.</p><p>The EPGBU model is important in terms of eliminating these inadequacies and giving a different perspective to the education of gifted students. It is thought that the EPGBU model will make an important contribution to the deficiency in the field.</p><p>When the problems related to science education in Turkey are examined, it is seen that there are deficiencies in terms of practical orientation and mentoring. The content of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tortop (2015)</ref> mentoring concept; a guide showing the way to success for the student, a consultant for the decisions they will make during the development process, a model that they follow carefully in the field they want to educate themselves, an expert in a certain field, an educator to provide students with knowledge and skills, a friendly and reliable friend who establishes sincere relations with his student. stated that it is like <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Tortop, 2015)</ref>. According to some studies, students who have mentors are more effective at school, are less absent from classes, are more interested in school, have higher self-confidence, and are more likely to enter university than students who do not have mentors. It is seen that mentoring is one of the most productive methods in the education of students with special abilities. Many positive benefits of mentoring in talent training have also been noted in research <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Nash, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Siegle, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Torrance, 1984)</ref>. Giving mentoring practices online over the internet is expressed as e-mentoring. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Nash, 2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Single and Muller (2001)</ref> stated that mentoring is a natural relationship formed by helping a non-experienced person through electronic communication by an experienced person. EPGBU can be an effective program in talent development as it has an approach that includes mentoring and e-mentoring.</p><p>One of the studies on the training of gifted young scientists in Turkey is science high schools and social sciences high schools. However, serious criticisms about these high schools are also included in many studies. It does not provide any other education to students selected for science high schools, except for a few additional math and science courses compared to regular high schools. In addition, while it should provide an education that is individualized or differentiated according to the individual speed, interest and learning style of the student and that allows him to explore his creativity, it has become a single-level education in science and mathematics <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akarsu, 2004)</ref>. In line with the results of the research, the following suggestions can be made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations for Further Research</head><p>For this research, it can be suggested to re-evaluate the working status of the model by increasing the sample group of 102 people. In addition, it can be done by determining a wider sample for other regions in terms of socio-economic level in the sample of Turkey. In addition, the working status of the model for primary, secondary and high school student groups can also be tried. In our research, the epistemological beliefs scale was used for the history and philosophy of science dimension. Instead, the scale of the history and philosophy of science can be developed and the model can be tried again. The scale of critical thinking skills used is rubric, and the model can be tested by ensuring that it is suitabl e for a 4-point rating, but using a 5-point Likert-type scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations for Applicants</head><p>Experimental studies can be conducted on whether the EPGBU model is an effective model for the education of gifted young scientists. By creating thematic units related to all dimensions of the model with the integration of EPGBU gains within these thematic units, tests can be made with the effectiveness of the model. Sample applications related to the EPGBU model can be turned into projects under the leadership of the university or the Ministry of National Education of Turkey.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
