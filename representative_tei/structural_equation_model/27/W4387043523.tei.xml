<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The structural equation modelling has contributed significant advantages in understanding projects success, although comparably, it has incremented the complexity of the analysis; thus, this research aims to propose a measurement model of projects performance considering the impact that generates strategic and servant leadership. It was conducted an extensive literature review where four observable variables were documented regarding strategic leadership, four variables for servant leadership, and four variables that measure projects performance. Initial results allowed determining a model that will permit to measure the impact of the documented leaderships in projects performance. This research contributes to increment the scarce existing knowledge in the project management field, and to provide the organizations with a tool to sustain solid strategies, aiming to positively manage their decisions on team development towards to improve projects performance, and thus, its success.</p></div>

Besides, also it was found a typology with a higher number of studies known as strategic leadership (STL).</p><p>Strategic leadership has been widely accepted as a common and traditional kind, related to a relevant impact in the obtaining of competitive advantages; the importance of strategic leaders is based on the capabilities to create strategies and be able to manage the team aiming to transform their reality (or execute plans), therefore STL is associated with the ability to form, improve and maintain the capabilities of learning, changing and managing the way of think of the members of the teams they lead <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.

The success of a project is a common term in project management, but it turns polemic because of the vast approaches that try to define it; generally, project success is given by the results of a project. This can be interpreted as to accomplish (or not) all the project criteria established on the planning phase. Given concepts, are plenty diverse, from those focused on the fulfillment of the triple constraint (scope, schedule, and cost), or the views related to achievement of strategic objectives, even there are new approaches associated with to assess stakeholder satisfaction, where soft skills, such as conflict resolution, project data information networks, and effective communication, are important <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. According to Barclay and Osei-Bryson, one of the main problems in the assessment of project success is the traditional system that adheres to the cost, time and scope specifications; however it is interesting that a common point in which converge the most of the authors, is the importance of measure and to study the critical success factors (CSF) which have more incidence, understanding those factors as variables that affect the completeness and compliance of a project and thus its success. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>This article aims to propose a measurement model between servant and strategic leadership and their impact on projects performance through a structural equation modeling.</p><p>The relevance of this work relies on expand the existing knowledge in the project management field and giving the organizations a model with which they can manage their decisions on team development towards the increment of the performance of the projects they lead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Strategic leadership</head><p>When organizational context and strategic project management are analyzed, it is essential to refer the way of leading as strategic leadership (STL), meaning a leadership own of the organization and not leadership inside organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. STL has been widely accepted as a common leading perspective, which has significant effects on obtaining competitive advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Strategic leaders are able to design strategies for the organization and leading others to create new approaches for the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. This ability allows the management to balance resources, efforts, and people inside an organizational culture with innovation and adaptability capabilities, letting to reach the planned objectives and vision statements; in consequence, STL reflects the extent to which a leader thinks strategically about creating change and moving the organization in new directions or markets, and parallelly, influencing others to make it possible; this kind of leadership creates necessary strategic changes to affront the dynamic organizational context <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. According to Kumar and Singh, strategic leadership promotes the mission statement conscience and acceptance, as well it feeds a shared vision, guiding the formation and performance of work teams. The leader ensures all essential resources availability and manages the knowledge to achieve good commercials results <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Different perspectives have established the importance of strategic leadership for organizations, this field is essentially relevant because it carries part of the future of the companies, guides long term decision-making and build organizational culture. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. It should be clarified that this kind of leadership has two broad components involved; leadership itself and strategy, meaning that this approach has a defined direction towards organizational analysis with multiple factors; precisely, it has been recognized the need to study this perspective inside a complex system, adaptive and systemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Strategic leadership is one of the emerging knowledge areas that has shown evidences of an increasing level of scientific development, centering its attention in issues of directive teams inside organizations, referring to those members that decide the direction of their companies and who are in charge of people which need to be guided, thus, this kind of leadership demands the development of competences and specific abilities complementary to the usual supervision and direction of operations; also its complexity increases as it is ascended in the organizational structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Depending on the organizational hierarchy and authority, the interactions, communications, chain of command, and responsibilities are different; however, the factors to ensure that strategic leadership affects positively projects execution are common, centered in a) Long-term Holistic Vision, b) adaptability and fast learning, c) resilience, d) Learning by trial and error, e) stress management, f) critical thinking, g) emotional intelligence, h) mentoring, i) proportional increment of knowledge evolving from planning projects until its execution and from leading small projects until guiding more complex, j) human talent development, k) caring the organizational culture, l) developing learning abilities, m) change acceptance, n) supervision and control abilities, o) creativity and innovation, p) ethics, q) knowledge of the organizational contexts and costs of decisions, r) assertive communication, s) respect and discipline, t) delegate effectively, u) inspire, v) resource management, and w) leaders community <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>In this manner, gathering a variety of key factors, the strategic leader not only will make possible the organizational strategy, but will achieve it with the major positive acceptance from the project stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Servant leadership</head><p>Servant leadership seems to be the most promising and studied in the last few years, especially due to the holistic basis and widely focus adopted in comparison with another behavioral philosophies, as well as its significant effects on individuals, teams, their results and commitment, the organizational development and job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>According to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, it can be established that publications carried out on this field show a positive growing trend, what demonstrates a high interest; however, as Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates, the researches corresponding to the relation between servant leadership and projects performance present an oscillatory and scarce trend regarding number of published papers; such behavior can be interpreted as a research opportunity; actually, a review conducted by Eva et al. achieves the conceptual differentiation of the servant leadership among the literature and another seven variants of leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</p><p>Servant leadership is a variant of leadership based on ethics and moral of leaders, where they trend to prioritize the satisfaction of their followers needs, including employees, team members, clients and another stakeholders, instead of satisfying their own; an initial concept proposes a "servant as a leader" meaning that a leader is encouraged to be centered and focused on the growth and personal development of their followers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Some authors have been reevaluating and adjusting the definition, pointing to propose a leader as a person whose actions go beyond the financial success of his organization, acknowledging his moral responsibility to his followers <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.  Likewise, some studies define, based on a historical and holistic analysis, that servant leadership is a precise leadership approach focused on the others, which is manifested through the individual recognition and prioritization all along with its corresponding interests and necessities; SL is about exteriorize the own concerns of the leader and turning them into the interest of caring the others inside an organization; as an outcome, followers will be more committed with their responsibilities increasing the effectiveness of the results <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. This kind of leadership does not ignore the organizational performance; although, its priority always is going to be the personal development of the team members, servant leaders gives relevance to a long-term sustainable performance, supported by their followers in a balanced and natural way <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Projects performance</head><p>Project performance is a concept that is still not unified, as its success relies on different dimensions of performance as budget, schedule, quality of deliverables, and scope fulfillment among others, revealing that project performance is centered on measured results of a project, consequently, project success depends on the expected results of a specific project according to its environmental factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. According to Chou and Ngo, project success includes shortterm and long-term project objectives as controlling the schedule, satisfying clients requirements, commercial value as well as market share; indeed, authors propose to use the satisfaction of stakeholders to determine either a project performance is successful or not <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>Since the 1960s decade, researchers have tried to find the factors that determine success in a project with the triple constraint achievement as starting point; later on, the success criteria evolved, as reported in the state of the art, where authors added more variables, including the acknowledgment of the objectives of the client's organizations, satisfaction of final user and satisfaction of stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p><p>Given the above-mentioned, there is the importance of exploring such factors and variables of projects performance measurements, in such a way that makes possible to correlate its relevance in project management and their implications with leadership.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>Materials and methods Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> illustrates the designed methodology for this research which is based on two principles, the first one related with concordance and frequencies in the appearance of variables in scientific articles; and the second one, with the direct analysis of variables through specific research results.</p><p>Once, the measurable variables are determined (observable variables), associated with the latent variables (servant leadership, strategic leadership, and project performance), it can be proposed a measurement model carried out through structural equations modelling; such type is a multivariate statistical tool which combines the multiple linear regression with factorial analysis, allowing to study the relation that exist between observable and latent variables; also this technique is known as analysis of covariance structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. With the modeling stage done, it is later possible to prove the correlation that is generated (and not by chance) between observable and latent variables; such modelling methods are useful and are characterized for its assessment capabilities in multiples relations of dependence as well as for representing non-observable concepts considering measurements errors in the weight estimation process of the bonds between variables. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Due to the scarce results of scientific research on servant leadership, the principle of concordance and frequencies in the appearance of variables in scientific articles could not be applied, yet according to the proposed methodology, it was possible to document observable variables analyzing directly specific results of authors found in the recent state of the art <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3</head><p>Results and discussions Following the designed methodology, it was possible to determine the observable variables to measure the previous defined latent variables and with which it can be explained the impact on projects performance as shown below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Observable variables for projects performance</head><p>Regarding the latent variable of projects performance, it was followed a systematic method to document the most recent literature, and thus to find the main factors that affect the success of projects performance and subsequently verifying how to reach its measurement; such method is composed by three stages; the first one associated with the methodical exploration of bibliography, followed by a detailed data analysis, ending with the obtention of the observable variables.</p><p>The Methodical exploration of literature was carried out using the Scopus database using two search equations. Eq (1) used recognized terms related with the previous definition of CSF and was restricted to the last five years (2018-2022).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(TITLE (project AND management) AND ABS (performance) OR ABS (project AND success) OR ABS (success AND criteria) OR ABS (critical AND success AND factors) OR ABS (performance AND factors) OR ABS (performance AND criteria)</head><p>(1)</p><p>Similarly, using the same restrictions, eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) was set in terms of measurement variables for projects performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TITLE-ABS-KEY (project AND performance AND measures) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (performance AND criteria) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (project AND management)</head><p>(2) When eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) was used, it obtained 1212 relevant documents associated with CSF in projects, from which after the subsequent analysis, 193 terms directly related with the search objective were filtered, taking as valid those with a minimum frequency appearance of 30 occurrences (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).  Subsequently, using the same appearance frequency criteria, the most relevant factors were extracted as shown in the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>; the frequency was set as the factor appearance per document and not the number of appearances per document; also, the terms were restricted to controllable variables in a project management context. Regarding the planning factor (named as CSF 1), its ranking is a clear consequence of one of the critical phases of a project, corresponding to planning the scope, schedule, cost and the budget restriction, risks, and quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Close to it, it is found the Stakeholders management (named as CSF 2), containing the clients as one of the most interested parts and their insights; this grouping associates the acknowledgment about the right obtention and prioritization of requirements using agile frameworks in execution stages of a project <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. Both criteria are closely related, as a right stakeholders management relies on conflicts reduction which effects, when they appear, usually generate deviations with reference to planning; besides stakeholders mostly affect the planning stages and, in general, all the project life cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</p><p>The communication factor (named as CSF 3) becomes one of the key competences to maintain good relations with the stakeholders of a project, giving clear information that allows to know the right moments for decision-making, resolve discrepancies, manage requirements and to provide an understanding base towards the comprehension and results acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Communication becomes in the major facilitator of a good project team (name as CSF 4), that although it is part of the stakeholder's nucleus, it justifies a separate section, as the team members experience, their training, collaboration, and their roles and responsibilities directly impact the realization of any project, actually, they are attributed the term or not of the work <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><p>Knowledge management (named as CSF 5) is the last factor, which establishes the continuous improvement of the managerial processes and the knowledge transfer between the team members and the organization itself; its impacts have repercussions in the further team formation (as they are temporary), in the reduction of corrective actions and in the highly adaptation to a changing context <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>.</p><p>Afterwards, through eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), they were obtained 498 research works with 300 terms associated with measures of projects performance, from which were established as valid, those with a minimum frequency appearance of 5 occurrences (in a binary count, where it was counted the appearance per document and not the number of occurrences per reference), revealing 47 filtered terms.  Finally, using the same appearance frequency criteria, it was filtered the observable variables with the higher frequency within the state of the art with which is possible to measure approximately project performance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>), which terms are listed in the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>; each observable variable was correlated with a corresponding measurable term, taking as reference the documented literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>.</p><p>The predominant observable variable for project performance is the schedule (named as PPV 1); such dimension reveals the project capacity to successfully end within the budget inside the planned time interval <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Its correspondence with measurable terms is directly related with the schedule variance, which is estimated at specific monitoring points; and the schedule performance index, measuring the project progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>.</p><p>Concerning to scope, as the following observable variable (named as PPV 2), it measures the work completeness to deliver the project results as stated by the requirements; given the reason above, such measure is useful as it recognizes that changes in scope will generate changes in activities and thus, changes in the intrinsic characteristics of a project, meaning the quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>.</p><p>Likewise, success in project performance can be estimated through it risk assessment as the third observable variable (named as PPV 3); it is considered as an instrument that ease decisionmaking focused into maintain the project progress within the plan <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. The measurable terms for this variable are correlated to the materialization of risks (number of occurred events) and the proportion of risks that are effectively mitigated or avoided across the project life cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Finally, the last observable variable is the cost overrun (named as PPV 4); a common point to the sponsor, clients and management team is the importance of cost and budget management, as is a dimension that permits the realization of a project and for that reason there is the importance of maintaining the whole process out of overruns <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. It results prudent to recognize success in project performance through the cost variance in reference with planning and verifying constantly, the efficiency of funds administration <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</p><p>As a result, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows the latent variable of project performance, its critical success factors that have strong effect on its accomplishment and the observable variables with which are possible to measure it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Observable variables for servant leadership</head><p>Respecting to the observable variables for servant leadership, and according to the statement given in the methodology, due to the scarce results of scientific researches on this field, the principle of concordance and frequencies in the appearance of variables in scientific articles could not be applied, yet it was possible to document observable variables analyzing directly specific results of authors found in the literature review; having as a base the analyzed and well documented variables according to Stigter and Cooper, Jitpaiboon et al, Kaufman, Shenhar et al, Baccarini, and Inge and Maheshs, it were included in the model as shown in the Table 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>.

Values, trust, team spirit, innovation, and Job satisfaction represent a healthy organizational culture, that will have better probabilities of accomplishment of company's goals; it can be measured through values statement, presented conflicts derived from teamwork, job satisfaction metrics, and reports of mistreatment on workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>.</p><p>According to Fernández-Montesinos, within an accepted cultural framework, ethics are related with common Team Behaviors (named as STLV 4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. According to Fernández-Montesinos, within an accepted cultural framework, ethics are related with common team behaviors (named as STLF 4). To promote and outline right ethical guidelines will conduct to legitimize the actions of the strategic leader, increasing self-control and motivation, and thus, the team performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The strategic leader is the external and internal organization representative, whose conduct and example conduct the common good of their teams and company itself. Measuring such observable variable can be done through the existence of an ethics statement, political corporate social responsibility, reports of sanctions to the company and/or disciplinary sanctions to team members.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Measurement model outline based on structural equations modelling</head><p>Using as a basis the structural equations modelling, the proposed measurement model starts with a statement conformed by two hypotheses based on the literature referred above; that servant leadership (ξ1) affects performance in projects (η1) (named as Hypothesis 1 H1) and that strategic leadership (ξ2) affects performance in projects (named as Hypothesis 2 H2).</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>., the hypotheses construct a model made of latent variables that are not directly measurable, but once the observable variables were determined and analyzed for each latent variable as seen in Tables 2-4, it was possible to propose, theoretically, a measurement model schema regarding the impact of servant and strategic leadership on projects performance (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The referred model shows the weighted interactions between the observable variables for each latent variable (as seen in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>), as well as it permits to stablish a weighted relation between servant leadership, strategic leadership and project performance, as a manner to estimate the impact and prove the previous stated hypotheses H1 and H2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions and future work</head><p>This research shows the existence of studies carried out where leadership is an instrument of organizational improvement; within this behavioral widely field, there are found two types, servant leadership and strategic leadership, where consulted literatures conclude that exists a positive impact of these two leadership styles on the enhancement of project performance and, thus, in organizational performance. An accurate measurement of project performance needs to ensure the fulfillment of stakeholders requirements as well as the restrictions stated in the planning phase, centered in schedule, scope, risks and cost management, taking into account, that factors as team prioritization, team values, ethics, coaching, human talent, common team behaviors, organizational culture and leadership competencies, come from the leadership focus and directly affect the expected results of a project. It is expected to proportionate the organizations with practical tools coming from this kind of structural methods; it will allow the companies to focus their efforts on specific improvement factors for the teams that are involved in project execution, aiming to upgrade their own compliance indexes and thus projects performance.</p><p>As a further second stage of this research, we expect to apply the obtained model on our target population, aiming to estimate the weight of relations expressed through the structural model, using data gathering instruments to support the respective calculus and complete the model.</p></div>			</div>
