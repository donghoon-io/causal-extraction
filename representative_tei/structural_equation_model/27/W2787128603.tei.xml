<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The adoption of supply chain management (SCM) initiatives has for more than two decades been considered to be essential for ensuring sustainable performance and cooperation in buyersupplier relationships. The sharing of information between parties has been examined in many business studies as a key factor in SCM success. However, information is not always shared appropriately in supply chains (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Li et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhou and Benton, 2007)</ref>. Earlier research has identified the significant factors that disrupt effective information flows throughout the supply chain. These include: absence of communication standards; lack of trust; weak supply chain relationships; confidentiality concerns; insufficient top management support; unequal distribution of risks/costs/benefits; opportunistic information leakage/misuse, and uncontrollable supply chain dynamism <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fawcett et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhou and Benton, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Manatsa and McLaren, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In theory, partner organizations in a supply chain share goals and collaborate while seeking to achieve superior performance for the entire supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ha et al., 2011)</ref>. However, in practice, organizations, each existing in a specific business environment, face unique situations, have their own individual motives and tend to be self-interested (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nyaga et al., 2010)</ref>. In other words, their intentions and behaviours in collaborative supply chain relationships often vary according to their business environments and roles in that supply chain. Thus, information exchange in a supply chain might also depend on the business conditions faced by the firms in their markets as well as their roles (i.e., whether they are buyer or sellers) in the supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Whipple et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhou and Benton, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nyaga et al., 2010)</ref>. Accordingly, information is not always appropriately shared in supply chains (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Li et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhou and Benton, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Information sharing is the exchange of important information between partner organizations in a supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Heide and Miner, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhou and Benton, 2007)</ref>. In this definition, the term 'exchange' embraces both the inflow (i.e., receiving/accepting/demanding) and the outflow (i.e., giving/providing/distributing/delivering) phases of information sharing. Firms in upstream and downstream positions in the supply chain receive information from partners as information demanders while giving partners necessary information as information providers. Information inflow/outflow asymmetry on the part of a firm can hinder cooperation with a supply chain partner in that it can ruin mutual trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ha et al., 2011)</ref>. The bi-directionality (receiving and providing) of information flows, notwithstanding its importance or even the considerable research already completed on cooperative information sharing in the supply chain, is often overlooked. Specifically, analysis of the content and extent of bi-directional information sharing and organizations' relevant perceptions and behaviours is insufficient (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhou and Benton, 2007)</ref>. The present study examines selected dimensions of bi-directional information sharing in supply chains, the difference in buyers' perceptions when they receive information from suppliers versus when they provide information to suppliers. In this paper, the term 'bidirectionality' is defined as the two-way flow (i.e., inflow and outflow) of information between firms and their suppliers.</p><p>Social capital is a valuable asset stemming from the assessment of resources made available through social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>. The concept of social capital has been adopted in several SCM studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Krause et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lawson et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carey et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Villena et al., 2011)</ref> because it effectively explains inter-organizational relationships of supply chains in terms of resource sharing, information exchange, and knowledge sharing <ref type="bibr">(</ref>  <ref type="bibr">Ghoshal, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Inkpen and Tsang, 2005)</ref>. However, in-depth studies on how these dimensions are developed and how they affect buyer-supplier relationships or collaborative activities -including bi-directional information sharing -are insufficient.</p><p>Responding to the gaps in the literature, the present study empirically investigated the impact of social capital and its three dimensions (i.e., structural capital, relational capital, and cognitive capital) on balanced bi-directional information sharing. In addition, the present study regards relational capital as a mediator between the other factors of social capital and bi-directional information sharing. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to develop a framework to promote the equivalent perception on bi-directional information. We use inflow and outflow information sharing as a result variable in order to concentrate on the buying firm's different perceptions of information inflow and outflow. The research questions are as follows:</p><p>1. Are there perceptional differences between 'information inflow from supplier' and 'information outflow to supplier' when a buyer exchanges information with a supplier? 2. Does the development of social capital and its three sub-dimensions in a supply chain promote buyers' reciprocal perception with respect to the inflow and outflow of information? 3. Among the three dimensions (i.e., structural capital, relational capital, and cognitive capital) of social capital, which are significant to the balancing of perception between information inflow and outflow? 4. What type of information is transferred to the supplier and received from the supplier?</p><p>To answer the research questions, we first reviewed the literature regarding social capital theory and information sharing in the supply chain in the 'theoretical foundation' section. Based on this, we proposed a theoretical framework that explains the relationship between social capital and bi-directional information sharing in the 'conceptual model and hypotheses' section. The hypotheses developed to examine the proposed model were tested by the use of structural equation modelling, and the research methodology and data analyses are presented in the 'methodology' and 'analysis and results' sections. Concluding remarks and suggestions for practitioners and future research are presented in the 'discussion, implications, limitations and conclusion' section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social capital theory</head><p>Social capital theory has often been introduced to explain the benefit of social networks. For example, social capital is regarded as valuable assets or significant resources that are obtained through social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Granovetter, 1992)</ref>. Social capital theory has been widely applied to many studies in varied business contexts, including supply chain, operations, quality, personnel, and innovation management <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Krause et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lawson et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998)</ref> introduce three key dimensions of social capital; namely, structural capital, relational capital, and cognitive capital. Based on their discussion, many other studies have proved that those dimensions can affect collaborative activities and relationships between firms. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Li et al. (2014)</ref>  3 buyer firms may seek suppliers' interest when there is strong social capital in their relationship. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lawson et al. (2008)</ref> explored the effect of structural and relational capital on the buying firm's performance, and showed that development of social capital is essential in order to obtain access to the resources of a relational network. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Krause et al. (2007)</ref> examined the role of cognitive and structural capital in explaining a firm's performance in terms of flexibility, delivery, and quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carey et al. (2011)</ref> showed that relational capital mediates the effect of cognitive and structural capital on a firm's innovation performance. As many studies have shown, the three subdimensions of social capital have different natures and characteristics and, therefore, different effects on network-based mutual relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>. In this respect, rather than seeking an explanation of social capital theory as a whole, attention should be paid to the independent effects of the individual sub-dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Li et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Cognitive capital is represented by the shared representability, interpretation, and systems among members in the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>. Cognitive capital enables members in a social network to have shared recognition of certain information or situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Augoustinos and Walker, 1995)</ref>, thereby providing shared visions, objectives, and values to network members <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>. Such shared visions, objectives, and valueswhich create a collective understanding of cognitive capital -accrue the following benefits: improved cooperative relationships between buyers and suppliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(De Carolis and Saparito, 2006)</ref>; reduced possibility of misunderstanding between parties <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>; and prevention of information asymmetry problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Min et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Structural capital traditionally has been explained as the pattern of connections between members or organizations <ref type="bibr">(Nhapiet and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>. It is developed based on the simple idea of 'who would be connected to whom or how people can reach each other' <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>. Indeed, it is viewed from diverse perspectives and ranges <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carey et al., 2011)</ref> including network characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Burt, 2000)</ref>, information and knowledge sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Koka and Prescott, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lawson et al., 2008)</ref>, and the extent of social interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Oh et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>. In recent supply chain studies, structural capital has been related to social interaction or information sharing channels. Social interaction can become the channel for tacit sharing of knowledge and information <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carey et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cousins et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lawson et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Krause et al., 2007)</ref>. This type of channel -for instance, a vendor-managed inventory system <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Min et al., 2008)</ref> -can deliver codified information <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Krause et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lawson et al., 2008)</ref> such as technical communications to support supply chain activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Min et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lawson et al., 2008)</ref>. Previous studies, such as that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tsai and Ghoshal (1998)</ref>, thus demonstrate that structural capital can make possible superior performance in buyer-supplier relationships. For instance, social interactions based on structural capital enable active exchanges of information or knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carey et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cousins et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Krause et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lawson et al., 2008)</ref>. Structural capital, as the information sharing channel, also integrates supply chains through sharing of information systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Min et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Relational capital has been the most widely studied among the three dimensions of social capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lawson et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Min et al., 2008)</ref>, and refers to interpersonal relationships that develop through a history of interactions with each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Krause et al., 2007)</ref>. Relational capital has often been explained in terms of mutual trust, respect, commitment, and obligations between people or organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Putman, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Coleman, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>. The developed relationship based on respect and trust influences the members' behaviour to be more collaborative with each other, and thereby helps them to  <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Li et al., 2014)</ref>. In particular, trust, which is viewed as the 'goodwill between actors' <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Burt, 2000)</ref> and regarded as a key dimension of relational capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson and Narus, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Rousseau et al., 1998)</ref>, contributes to the development of inter-firm relationships by reducing opportunistic behaviours between firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Whipple et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>. Besides, some other characteristics of relational capital, such as commitment and the sense of reciprocal obligations, enable stronger mutual ties, leading to an improvement in relational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carey et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tsai and Ghoshal (1998)</ref>, in addition, address the fact that relational capital mediates the link between cognitive capital and structural capital, and, consequently, affects relational performance. However, cognitive capital, relational capital, and structural capital, as well as their inter-relationships, have rarely been investigated in the buyer-supplier context <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lawson et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carey et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Li et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>This study adopted social capital theory as a theoretical framework in which to explain the relationship between social capital and information sharing. Several previous studies have suggested that social-relational factors affect information transfer in supply chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adler and Kwon, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fawcett et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Li et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jing et al., 2011)</ref>. For instance, social interactions and shared IT infrastructure (structural capital) provided to members in the network become the channel for information sharing as well as the channel for the exchange of valuable resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Coleman, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>. Sharing of goals, culture, and values (cognitive capital) can provide a basis for relationships involving mutually cooperative exchange and sharing of cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Coleman, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">De Carolis and Saparito, 2006)</ref>. Relational capital based on trust leads to more open and honest mutual information sharing, consequently preventing the phenomenon of information asymmetry prevalent in inter-firm relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Li et al., 2014)</ref>. The current study therefore adopted social capital theory to discuss the collaborative relationship between buyer and seller firms in supply chains from social-relational perspectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adler and Kwon, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lawson et al., 2008)</ref>. In addition, based on the previous studies, we viewed that cognitive capital and structural capital can be antecedents to relational capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Inkpen and Tsang, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carey et al., 2011)</ref>. In doing so, it examined the structures of the three dimensions of social capital suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998)</ref> and their impact on bi-directional information-sharing behaviours (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bi-directional information sharing in supply chain</head><p>Information sharing is defined as the degree to which individual parties mutually provide information <ref type="bibr">(Heide and Miner, 1992, p. 275</ref>). In the context of SCM, information sharing refers to knowledge interactions and information exchanges that enable better transactional collaboration. Information sharing, thus, has been considered an essential element for successful SCM and, therefore, a critical element for the maintenance of efficiency, effectiveness, and competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Sahin and Robinson, 2002)</ref>. Some studies have emphasized that effective information sharing in a supply chain can be achieved through the adoption of advanced information technology as well as financial support <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Paulraj et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kim et al., 2005)</ref>. The effectiveness of information sharing is not limited simply to the issue of 'whether information is shared or not' but embraces even the issues of 'what types of information are shared' and 'when and how the information is shared' <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Li et al., 2014)</ref>. That is, consideration of the content and quality of information should be accompanied by investigation of effective  <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Zhou and Benton, 2007)</ref>. In traditional supply chain studies, the 'content' of shared information includes market demand, a production plan, and inventory. Meanwhile, the 'quality' of shared information refers to the accuracy, timeliness, adequacy, and credibility of that information <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Zhou and Benton, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Many researchers have asserted that many firms do not volunteer to share information and thus have suggested key factors in having them avoid voluntary information sharing <ref type="bibr">(Lie et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhou and Benton, 2007)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fawcett et al. (2006)</ref> identify confidentiality concerns, a lack of communication standards, a lack of trust, and weak supply chain relationships. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhou and Benton (2007)</ref> indicate that dynamism (i.e., the pace of change of both products and processes), which inevitably exists in supply chains, becomes a significant reason for reluctance to share information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Manatsa and McLaren (2008)</ref> posit that poor information sharing might be caused by the fear of an unequal distribution of risks/costs/benefits among the partners and the risk of information being divulged to competitors or used for opportunistic bargaining.</p><p>In addition, individual information-sharing parties' varying views and incongruent objectives can also obstruct information sharing. Studies have shown that the relationships within supply chains vary in accordance with the given environments, situations, and motives faced by each of the partner firms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nyaga et al., 2010)</ref>. Therefore, individual parties' intentions and resultant behaviours in the supply chain, certainly, can differ. Accordingly, previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">John and Reve, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nyaga et al., 2010)</ref> have found that a firm's perception of and behaviours in information sharing depend on the firm's role (i.e., whether the firm is a buyer or a supplier) in a supply chain. For instance, when assessing the level of relationship satisfaction, suppliers often focus on relational characteristics, whereas buyers focus on performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Benton and Maloni, 2005)</ref>. Suppliers think that timeliness of information is important for better operational planning processes, whereas buyers believe that accuracy of information is important for better reaction to problem occurrences <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Whipple et al., 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhou and Benton (2007)</ref> argue that, because the information provided by manufacturers to buyers (customers) differs completely in nature from that provided by buyers to manufacturers, it is imperative to identify and adopt variables for two-way information flows.</p><p>As many studies have defined information sharing in a supply chain as 'exchanges' of important information between partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Heide and Miner, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhou and Benton, 2007)</ref>, information sharing should embrace both directions of information sharing, receiving as well as giving, at the same time. Thus, firms need to investigate and analyze the differences of shared information between the inflow and outflow phases. That is, it is necessary to understand the directionality of information sharing and to balance the two flows for improved supply chain performance. They also need to assess the levels of quality and quantity of shared information for successful SCM.</p><p>As bi-directional information sharing is not only essential for supply chain cooperation and integrated performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Langfield and Greenwood, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bullington and Bullington, 2005)</ref> but also leads to collaborative relationships between buyers and suppliers <ref type="bibr">(Bullington and Bullington, 2005)</ref>, we presume that a firm having a balanced perception of giving information (information outflow) and receiving information (information inflow) assures successful information sharing. Conversely, we also presume that if a buyer or a supplier does not recognize the importance of bi-directional information sharing or is reluctant to share essential information, the partnership and the performance of the entire supply chain would deteriorate. 6 Therefore, we assume that firms seeking information sharing in supply chains might show perceptional differences between (1) the receipt of information (information inflow) and (2) its provision (information outflow). Existing studies indicate that, even though information sharing should be beneficial to cooperative relationships, firms providing information might be exposed to their partners' opportunistic behaviours, such as malicious use of the information for negotiations or disclosure to competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Zhou and Benton, 2007)</ref>. Therefore, firms often become reluctant or passive with respect to information provision to their partners. Several previous studies have suggested that social-relational factors affect information transfer in supply chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adler and Kwon, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fawcett et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Li et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jing et al., 2011)</ref>. The current study therefore adopted and modified social capital theory to investigate how such social relational perspectives enable balanced inflows and outflows of information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual model and hypotheses</head><p>Many studies have introduced key antecedents for the achievement of successful information sharing, including mutual trust, commitment, collaboration, communication, conflict, and relational uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Sheu et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhou and Benton, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Paulraj et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ha et al., 2011)</ref>. These factors are associated with social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Li et al., 2014)</ref>. Since social capital theory can effectively explain the relationships between firms in terms of social networks as well as social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lawson et al., 2008)</ref>, the present study applied the theory to its investigation into bi-directional information sharing between firms in a supply chain.</p><p>The goal of this study was to investigate the links of the three sub-dimensions of social capital (i.e., structural, cognitive, and structural capital) with information bi-directional flows (i.e., inflows and outflows). The relevant previous studies have indicated that cognitive capital and structural capital can be antecedents to relational capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Inkpen and Tsang, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carey et al., 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Links among the sub-dimensions of social capital</head><p>Structural capital explains the social interaction tie (or connection pattern) among members in a social network <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>. The tie is the degree to which members in a social network are mutually connected or the degree to which they know each other. This social interaction tie becomes the channel through which information and resources flow in network relationships as well as offering a motive to strengthen those relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Yu et al., 2006)</ref>. Social interactions of structural capital enable active information and knowledge exchanges <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carey et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cousins et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Krause et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lawson et al., 2008)</ref>. Structural capital in the forms of information-sharing channels can contribute to the integration of supply chains through shared information systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Min et al., 2008)</ref>. The forging and maintenance of links, socialization, and active interactions among members enable buyers to judge suppliers' levels of mutual trust and commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carey et al., 2011)</ref>. Furthermore, the experience of social relationships between organizations helps them to build mutual trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bell et al., 2002)</ref>. In this respect, the structural capital accumulated through social interactions and shared IT infrastructure enables the development of relational capital. Hence the following hypothesis linking structural capital and relational capital: Cognitive capital emphasizes that the sharing of goals, values, and normative behaviours between partners generates mutual trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Coleman (1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">1990)</ref> states that normalized sharing decreases the risk of free-riding and increases mutual trust. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barber (1983)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tsai and Ghoshal (1998)</ref> argue that sharing goals and values between partners develops mutual trust. Meanwhile, when there is mutual understanding between buyers and suppliers, relational capital is developed <ref type="bibr">(Adler and Kwon, 2000)</ref>.

Since members in a network, though mutually related, are independent entities, they can pursue their own independent gains instead of the entire network's profits. Independence is also applied to limited information sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Li et al., 2014)</ref>. Shared proprietary information can provide the other party with possibilities for opportunistic behaviours such as misuse of information or disclosure. As researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fawcett et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref> suggest, trust lowers the possibility of opportunistic behaviours and enables effective information flows between members in a social network. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sheu et al.

Questionnaires were sent to 1,600 medium-to-large South Korea-based manufacturing organizations sampled from a database of the 2011 Business Directory of Korcham (Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry). To ensure that respondents were knowledgeable on the overall supply chain relationships with suppliers, their managerial responsibilities were limited to the procurement and purchasing areas. The survey instrument was pilot-tested and validated through in-depth interviews with nine purchasing executives and five academic experts. It was then modified and developed further based on their opinions. Subsequently, three waves of  <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dillman, 2000)</ref>. As a result, 221 questionnaires were collected (13.8% response rate), though eleven of them were excluded due to a quality problem in the answers. The response rate seems slightly low, but due to increasing levels of survey fatigue among practitioners <ref type="bibr">(Tan and Wiser, 2003)</ref>, this response rate is consistent with those of similar supply chain studies in the area <ref type="bibr">(Alreck and Settle, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carey et al., 2011)</ref>. A non-response-bias test was conducted through a series of T-tests with key variables as well as demographic variables between the early and late waves of returned samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Armstrong and Overton, 1977)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>All of the survey items were developed through a review of the extant literature. They were measured on a 1-7 Likert-type scale (see Appendix I). The structural dimension of social capital was measured according to two sub-dimensions: information exchange and social interaction. The items for measurement of information exchange included 'IT capability for sharing information with partners (SC1),' 'IT capability for exchanging standardized information (SC2),' and 'IT capability for the existence of joint decision making (SC3).' Meanwhile, the items for social interaction included 'the existence of joint decision making (SC4),' 'the existence of regular communication (SC5),' and 'the existence of a joint benefit and risk management system (SC6)' <ref type="bibr">(Bowersox et al., 1999: 112-113;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Whipple et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ellinger, 2000)</ref>. The cognitive dimension of social capital included four measurement items: 'levels of agreement on what is in the best interests of the relationship (CC1),' 'shared business values (CC2),' 'shared goals for the businesses (CC3),' and 'shared ambitions and vision (CC4)' <ref type="bibr">(Griffith et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carey et al., 2011)</ref>.

The items for the measurement of bi-directionality of information flows were initially developed based on these studies, and subsequently were further improved via in-depth interviews with several procurement practitioners and researchers. As a result, five items were developed for the measurement of the information inflow part, including: 'production capacity information (II1),' 'order status information (II2),' 'knowledge about the product and materials (II3),' 'changes in delivery schedule (ii4),' and 'knowledge about the market (II5).' Four additional items were developed for the information outflow part, including 'production planning information (IO1),' 'future-demand forecasting information (IO2),' 'knowledge about the product and materials (IO3),' and 'product design specifications (IO4).'  <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Nunnally, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Churchill, 1979)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tests of hypotheses</head><p>We used structural equation modelling to test the hypothesized relationships among the latent variables. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">IV</ref> shows the results. The overall model fit was acceptable (NNFI=0.932; CFI=0.941; RMSEA=0.058, AGFI=0.826; and χ2=411.94 with df=241). Then, the hypotheses were tested via structural equation modelling. According to the results (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">IV</ref>), H1 and H2 were significant (p&lt;0.05), indicating the significant effect of both structural capital and cognitive capital on relational capital. Relational capital had significant effects on both information inflow and outflow, supporting H3-1 and H3-2. Both structural capital and cognitive capital had significant effects on information inflow (i.e., H4-1 and H5-1 were supported) but not on information outflow (i.e., H4-2 and H5-2 were rejected). </p></div>

The indirect effects are then tested for significance using confidence intervals. If the indirect effects are significant, mediation is inferred in the model. In the present study, we measured the significance of indirect effects by setting the number of sampling iterations (n=2,000). The direct and indirect effects between structural capital and information inflow (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">V</ref>) were found to be significant (p&lt;0.05), indicating partial mediation. The indirect effect among structural capital, cognitive capital and information outflow was found to be significant and the direct effect was found to be insignificant, indicating full mediation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study examined the impact of social capital on bi-directional information sharing. The impacts of the three dimensions (i.e., structural, cognitive, and relational capital) on bidirectional information sharing (i.e., information inflow and outflow) were mixed. Overall, the findings provide practitioners and academics with important insights into how the dimensions of social capital can be identified, designed and managed for successful bi-directional information sharing with suppliers.</p><p>Based on the present study's measurement development through to the in-depth interviews and exploratory factor analysis, the contents (i.e., measurements) of information inflow and outflow showed different perspectives (see <ref type="bibr">Appendix,</ref><ref type="bibr">F4 and F5)</ref>. These respective results reflect the dependence of the nature and quality of information exchange on the role: information provider versus information demander <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Whipple et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhou and Benton, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nyaga et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>We found that structural capital and cognitive capital positively influence the level of relational capital between buyers and suppliers. This is because the development of structural capital -based on social interactions and shared IT infrastructure -promotes common experience as well as trust-based relationships between buyers and suppliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bell et al., 2002)</ref>. In addition, the development of cognitive capital that facilitates the sharing of goals, visions and values help firms to foster trust, identification, and obligation within the inter-organizational relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carey et al., 2011)</ref>. Therefore, the development of structural and cognitive capital may be a necessary condition to develop relational capital. However, from the testing of the link between social capital and bi-directional information The buyer firms recognize that they can receive information effectively from suppliers when they develop structural capital and cognitive capital; this is in line with the findings of previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Coleman, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998)</ref>. That is, structural capital can become the channel for the sharing of key resources, and the active interactions between channel partners that result thereby can provide them with opportunities for better information exchange. The findings of this research also imply that cognitive capital can become the basis of mutual cooperation and shared thinking processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(De Carolis and Saparito, 2006</ref>) that enable partner firms to better appreciate the advantages of information exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Whipple et al., 2010)</ref>. While both cognitive capital and structural capital have positive effects on information inflow, neither has any significant effect on information outflow. That is, even if the buyer perceives that the supplier will provide information to them as part of their established structural capital (i.e., an IT capability for efficient sharing of information and joint benefit/risk-sharing systems) and cognitive capital (i.e., sharing of goals, visions, and values) in the relationship, still a buyer might be reluctant to provide information to a supplier. This could be because buyers want to avoid the risks of information leakage and their exposure to the opportunistic behaviours of their counterpart, such as harmful misuse of delivered information <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Manatsa and McLaren, 2008)</ref>. Moreover, the results indicate that structural and cognitive capital do not embrace that which is essential to participation in mutual exchange relationships: trust and reciprocity (relational capital). This is in line with earlier reports, suggesting that a lack of trust in relationships and weak supply chain relationships lead to a reluctance to share information <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fawcett et al., 2006)</ref>. Furthermore, such reluctance on the part of buyers might happen due to their own opportunistic, information-asymmetry-inducing behaviours in the relationship (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lambert and Pohlen, 2001)</ref>, which can eventually lead to unfair relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lambert and Pohlen, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ha et al., 2011)</ref>. These opportunistic-behaviour problems can be prevented through trust-building efforts, which are a key component of relational capital. Indeed, relational capital fully mediates the relationships between cognitive capital and information inflow, between cognitive capital and information outflow, and between structural capital and information outflow. That is, establishing relational capital in the relationship is the sole factor facilitating buyers' effective information outflows to suppliers, and is essential to the equivalency of bi-directional information sharing.</p><p>Firms' appreciation of bi-directional information sharing leads to mutually prosperous relationships with suppliers <ref type="bibr">(Bullington and Bullington, 2005)</ref>. Thus, if a buyer or a supplier does not recognize the need for bi-directional information sharing or is reluctant to share essential information with their counterpart, not only might the partnership be undesirably affected but so also, eventually, might the supply chain performance. As discussed, firms might show differences in their perceptions or behavioural patterns according to whether they are providing information or receiving information, based on the imperative to avoid their counterpart's opportunistic behaviours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial implications</head><p>One of the main managerial implications from our study is to identify that developing social capital in the relationship can contribute to bi-directional information sharing in a supply chain  <ref type="bibr">Shared values, missions, and goals (i.e., cognitive capital)</ref> between firms are highlighted in this study, as they can be antecedent to trust and reciprocity in the relationship. Through active interactions and communication on both the strategic and operational levels, practitioners can see what is in the best interests of their partners and can build common values and visions. From the investigation on structural traits in the study, companies can benefit from socialization and interactions through information systems (i.e., IT infrastructures) for information sharing. Thus, firms need to pay attention to how and how often they interact socially; fostering social interactions through social events and conferences with suppliers may prove beneficial.</p><p>Most of all, relational capital was found to be the only factor in the model that facilitates bidirectional information sharing. Therefore, development of mutual trust, respect, and reciprocity (relational capital) is key to avoid the occurrence of information asymmetry in the relationship. These relational characteristics can be developed through continuous exchange, with efforts made to maintain the relationship as collaborative and long-term instead of focusing on shortterm competitive relationships. In addition, as the development of relational capital is reliant on social and cognitive capital, the above-mentioned efforts for the development of social and cognitive capital will be the major contribution to fostering mutual trust and reciprocity in the relationship.</p><p>Practitioners need to understand that their partner may have different interests and situations, and consequently they may have different perceptions when they give and receive information. Efforts are needed to reduce the chance of such distorted information sharing, as this not only causes information asymmetry but also has a negative impact on partnership performance. When firms make an effort to understand their partners, and are committed to improving the collaborative relationship, this can promote the development of social capital in the relationship. By doing so, concerns about leakage or misuse of information will be lowered so a buyer firm can contribute to having a more balanced perception on the information sharing with the partner. In addition, to achieve successful bi-directional information sharing in the supply chain, buyer firms need to realize that their business's success is dependent on the success of their supply chains. Armed with this collective understanding of SCM, firms can create sound and enduring collaborative relationships with suppliers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future study</head><p>Even though the current study yielded valuable insights into social capital and bi-directional information sharing, it has limitations in its research methods. First, a cross-sectional survey, by its nature, might limit the depth of understanding of social capital, since relational behaviours between actors might be very complex and vary over time. Second, due to the static nature of the survey method employed, the causal relations therein could not be fully inferred. Longitudinal research settings would allow researchers to further explore the dyadic relationships between buyers and suppliers with regard to how social capital evolves through the relationship phases. Third, the data represent the buyer's side only in the dyadic relationship. Application of both the buyer's and the supplier's dyadic perspectives might provide for a better insight into, and understanding of, social capital and bi-directional information sharing.</p><p>We also suggest that future research investigates the nature of social capital in the wider context of supply chains. That is, it might extend the view to encompass triadic relationships 14 among a firm, its supplier, and its buyer, or multiple relationships among a firm and its multiple suppliers, as this would allow for more in-depth investigation of supply chains that are, by their nature, complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carey et al., 2011)</ref>. In future research too, social capital from the supplier's perspective would be more thoroughly examined. Further refinement of the measurement of bidirectional information sharing might also be of interest. Finally, with much of the recent research having focused on the positive effects of social capital, it would be beneficial to examine the degradation of social capital and the associated consequences (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Viella et al., 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The purpose of this paper is to understand how the development of social capital can promote buyer's bi-directional (inflow and outflow) information sharing. We examined buyers' perceptional differences in information sharing: when they receive information from suppliers and when they provide information to suppliers, and how such unequal perception in information sharing can be resolved by the level of social capital and its sub-dimensions. Our findings present an issue of unequal perception in providing and receiving information, and social capital's dimensions have a different effect on bi-directional information sharing. For information inflow, all facets of social capital were significant; for information outflow, however, only relational capital was significant. Given that relational capital is essential for balanced information sharing in buyer-supplier relationships, firms should pay attention to having social interactions and establishing shared goals and values with partners in order to promote trust and reciprocity in the relationship for maximum efficacy in information sharing.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>capital positively affects relational capital in the relationship with suppliers.</figDesc></figure>
