<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In order to analyze the relationship between entrepreneur psychological capital, creative innovation behavior, and enterprise performance based on the actual situation of Chinese enterprises and provide a theoretical basis for the application of entrepreneur psychological capital in enterprise innovation and performance development, in this study, 536 entrepreneurs from 517 enterprises in different fields in Anhui region were selected, and a questionnaire survey on the psychological capital of entrepreneurs, creative innovation behaviors, and corporate performance was conducted. A hypothesis model of the relationship between entrepreneur's psychological capital, creative innovation behavior, and enterprise performance was constructed. The correlation between entrepreneur's psychological capital, creative innovation behavior, and enterprise performance and the intermediation of creative innovation behavior were analyzed using multiple-regression model and structural equation model. The results show that there is a significant positive correlation between dimensions of self-efficacy (regression coefficient = 0.682, p = 0.000), toughness (regression coefficient = 0.526, p = 0.000), and enterprise performance; there is a significant positive correlation between the dimensions of optimism (regression coefficient = 0.471, p = 0.003), hope (regression coefficient = 0.590, p = 0.006), and enterprise performance; there is a significant positive correlation between entrepreneurs' technological innovation behavior (regression coefficient = 0.506, p = 0.000), business innovation behavior (regression coefficient = 0.562, p = 0.000), and enterprise performance; there is a significant positive correlation between entrepreneurial relationship acquisition behavior (regression coefficient = 0.632, p = 0.004) and enterprise performance. Taking entrepreneurs' creative innovation behavior as the intermediary variable, the authors conclude that the dimensions of entrepreneurs' self-efficacy, hope, optimism, toughness, and the standardized path coefficient of enterprise performance are significantly reduced; through the analysis of structural equation model, it is found that the fitting index of the model of entrepreneur's psychological capital, creative innovation behavior, and enterprise performance meets the fitting standard, which shows that both the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Psychological capital is a psychological resource that can play a positive role in promoting oneself, development, and the growth of enterprise performance, and it is a positive psychological state that individuals show in their work growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bouzari and Karatepe, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gray et al., 2020)</ref>. Psychological capital consists of four dimensions, namely, self-efficacy, hope, optimism, and toughness. In recent years, it has become the research object of many scholars in positive organizational behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Funken et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ma et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Sadq et al., 2020)</ref>. Through analysis on the online questionnaire and structural equation model completed by 215 science and engineering students in Indonesia, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mahfud et al. (2020)</ref> found that the relationship between psychological capital dimensions and entrepreneurial attitude orientation and entrepreneurial intention has a positive partial mediating effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kusumawardani et al. (2020)</ref> analyzed the entrepreneurial psychology of 352 female entrepreneurs in the Bali tourism industry using the theoretical framework of planned behavior and structural equation model, and found that psychological capital and entrepreneurship education indirectly affected entrepreneurial intention through the two intermediary variables of personal attitude and perceived behavior control. With the advent of the era of economic globalization, many enterprises are facing severe tests. As an important factor for the future development of companies, entrepreneurs also play a very important role in the improvement of corporate performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Li et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahmed et al., 2020)</ref>. As a result, the research on the psychological capital of entrepreneurs is beneficial to the long-term development of enterprises.</p><p>Creative innovation has always been a kind of breakthrough thinking pursued by people. For enterprises, the power of creative innovation is the long-term guarantee for the improvement of enterprise performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Rego et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rego et al., , 2017))</ref>. Since the end of the 20th century, China's economic and social transformation, entrepreneurship, and innovation economy have become the strategic focus of future development, and also the focus of many scholars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Domi et al. (2020)</ref> found in their survey of 211 Albanian tourism SMEs that innovation and innovation behaviors play an intermediary role in the relationship between enterprise synergy and performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kurniawan et al. (2020)</ref> conducted a questionnaire survey on 150 enterprise personnel in the creative industry and found that there was a significant positive correlation between knowledge sharing and absorptive ability and creative and innovative ability (p &lt; 0.05). The creative industry develops better by increasing knowledge sharing, absorptive capacity, and innovation capacity. At present, the mainstream understanding of creative innovation behavior is to regard creative capital as an abstract concept of creativity, and the research mainly focuses on countries and regions and other macro levels, with little involvement in entrepreneurs and individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Deligianni et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">He and Hui, 2020)</ref>. Therefore, the research on entrepreneurs' creative innovation behaviors is beneficial to the development of enterprises.</p><p>To sum up, the current research on the relationship between entrepreneur psychological capital, creative capital, and organizational performance is too macroscopic, and there are few reports on individual entrepreneurs. Based on this, 536 entrepreneurs from 517 enterprises in different fields in the Anhui region were taken as research objects, and a hypothesis model of the relationship between entrepreneur psychological capital, creative innovation behavior, and enterprise performance was constructed. The relationship between entrepreneur's psychological capital, creative innovation behavior, and enterprise performance was evaluated using multiple-regression model and structural equation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Yu et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>As the fourth largest capital in entrepreneurship, the psychological capital of entrepreneurs can directly affect every link in the process of entrepreneurship, which has attracted the attention of many scholars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baron et al. (2016)</ref> proposed that people who were attracted, selected, but persisted in starting a business may have a high bearing capacity, and psychological capital was positively correlated with subjective well-being based on the principle of attract-select-loss. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anglin et al. (2018)</ref> expanded the entrepreneurship literature to include positive psychological capital-the level of psychological resources of a person or organization, including hope, optimism, resilience, and confidence-as a significant signal of crowdfunding. It turned out that using positive psychological capital language can improve the performance of crowdfunding. They also looked at 1726 Kickstarter campaigns and found that entrepreneurs who delivered positive psychological capital had excellent fundraising performance. Enterprises need to create benefits to distribute benefits, so enterprise performance is also the most concerned issue in the process of entrepreneurship, and the role of entrepreneurs' own psychological capital on enterprise performance has attracted the attention of many scholars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Digan et al. (2019)</ref> conducted a sample survey of 369 female entrepreneurs of small and medium-sized enterprises in Gujarat, western India, and found that female entrepreneurs can cope with the challenges of self-employment through psychological capital, so as to obtain more corporate benefits from empowerment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baluku et al. (2018)</ref> studied the influence of psychological capital and autonomy on entrepreneurial performance using the self-determination theory and psychological capital literature. It was found that entrepreneurs were satisfied with the influence of psychological capital, autonomy, and their interaction with commitment and that psychological capital had significant influence on training and entrepreneurial performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Probst et al. (2017)</ref> studied whether the "psychological capital" of high-level structural leadership composed of hope, self-efficacy, resilience, and optimism can ease the relationship between job insecurity and performance of employees. The results showed that leaders with high level of psychological capital can reduce employees' sense of insecurity and improve organizational performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Edwards and Rowe (2019)</ref> constructed a framework for the relationship between psychological capital, employees' mental health, and corporate performance and tested the role of this structure in employees' mental health and job satisfaction. The results showed that the psychological capital of leaders can be used as a partial intermediary or a complete intermediary to increase the job satisfaction and mental health of employees, so as to improve the development of enterprise performance. To sum up, the current analysis on the effect of entrepreneur psychological capital on enterprise performance is a hot topic. An in-depth discussion on the relationship between the psychological capital of entrepreneurs, creative innovation behavior, and enterprise performance was explored to provide a theoretical basis for the practical application of psychological capital.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaire Design</head><p>In empirical research, questionnaire survey is a common research method used by scholars, which can easily and quickly obtain a lot of required data and has a certain degree of reliability. Therefore, according to the theoretical hypothesis proposed in this study and the relationship model of entrepreneur's psychological capital, creative innovation behavior, and enterprise performance, the variables to be measured are identified as entrepreneur's psychological capital, enterprise performance, and entrepreneur's creative innovation behavior. The scale tools are entrepreneur psychological capital scale, enterprise performance scale, and entrepreneur creative innovation behavior scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Entrepreneur Psychological Capital Scale</head><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, the questionnaire includes four dimensions: self-efficacy, hope, optimism, and toughness. Self-efficacy consists of six measurement items. The hope dimension includes six measurement items, the optimism dimension includes six  measurement items, and the toughness dimension includes eight measurement items. Richter's five points are used for each item: 1 for strongly disagree, 2 for disagree, 3 for neither agree nor disagree, 4 for agree, and 5 for strongly agree. The internal reliabilities of the four dimensions of self-efficacy, hope, optimism, and toughness and the overall scale are 0.81, 0.79, 0.86, and 0.89, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Laguía et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Enterprise Performance Scale</head><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, considering that there is no unified standard for enterprise performance, the following table was developed based on previous literature, and the scale adopted seven indicators for evaluation.

In terms of age, the optimism dimension of entrepreneurs under 30 years of age is significantly higher than that of entrepreneurs over 30 years old (p &lt; 0.05). The hope dimension of psychological capital of entrepreneurs under the age of 0 is significantly higher than that over the age of 40 (p &lt; 0.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spearman Correlation Analysis of Entrepreneur Psychological Capital, Creative Innovation Behavior, and Enterprise Performance</head><p>Spearman correlation was first used to analyze whether there was a significant correlation between the psychological capital of entrepreneurs, creative innovation behavior, and enterprise performance. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">7</ref>, the dimensions of entrepreneurs' self-efficacy and toughness are significantly correlated with enterprise performance (p &lt; 0.001); the dimensions of entrepreneurs' hope and optimism are significantly correlated with enterprise performance (p &lt; 0.05).

Among them, the correlation between technological innovation and enterprise performance is the strongest (r = 0.859).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical Research on Entrepreneur Psychological Capital and Enterprise Performance</head><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table">9</ref>, every dimension of entrepreneurs' psychological capital was taken as the independent variable, and organizational performance, age (under 30 years of age, 0; 30-40 years of age, 1; 40-50 years of age and over 50 years of age, 2; more than 50, 3), educational background (below high school education, 0; junior college, 1; bachelor's degree, 2; master or above, 3), and gender (male, 1, female, 0) were taken as dependent variables. The regression coefficient of selfefficacy and organizational performance is 0.682, which has a very significant positive correlation (p &lt; 0.001). Thus, the hypothesis "F12: entrepreneurs' self-efficacy dimension has a positive impact on enterprise performance" is true. The regression coefficient between optimism dimension and organizational performance is 0.475, which has a significant positive correlation (p &lt; 0.05). Thus, hypothesis F13 "entrepreneur's optimism dimension has a positive impact on enterprise performance" is true. The regression coefficient between the expected dimension and organizational performance is 0.590, with a significant positive correlation (p &lt; 0.05). Thus, the hypothesis "F11: entrepreneurs' hope dimension has a positive impact on enterprise performance" is true. The regression coefficient between toughness dimension and organizational performance is 0.526, showing a very significant positive correlation (p &lt; 0.001). Thus, hypothesis "F14: entrepreneur toughness dimension has a positive impact on enterprise performance" is true. The regression coefficient between educational background and enterprise performance is 0.543, showing a significant positive correlation (p &lt; 0.05). The relationship between variables was handled through the analysis of entrepreneur psychology scale and structural equation model. Self-efficacy was expressed by the English abbreviation SE, hope dimension is expressed by HO, optimism dimension was expressed by OP, toughness dimension was expressed by TO, and enterprise performance is expressed by PE.</p><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, self-efficacy, hope dimension, optimism dimension, and toughness dimension are external latent growth variables, and enterprise performance belongs to internal latent growth variables. In addition, there are 17 residual variables. The standardized path coefficient of selfefficacy and enterprise performance is 0.312, the standardized path coefficient of hope dimension and enterprise performance is 0.418, the standardized path coefficient of optimism dimension and enterprise performance is 0.361, and the standardized path coefficient of toughness dimension and enterprise performance is 0.454. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">10</ref> is the fitting index of the relationship model between entrepreneur psychological capital and enterprise performance. The X 2 fitting priority index (X 2 /df), the rootmean-square error approximation (RMSEA), the goodness of fitting test (GFI), the normalized fitting index (NFI), the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), the cross validity test index (ECVI), and the comparison fitting index (CFI) all meet the fitting standard, and the fitting evaluation is ideal.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Entrepreneurs are the beneficial implementers of entrepreneurial plans and activities, which determine the success of entrepreneurship. How to develop the psychological capital of entrepreneurs in the current competitive social background is an urgent problem to be solved. Therefore, the questionnaire survey method was combined with structural equation model analysis method to study 517 enterprises in different fields in Anhui region. First, it is found that the dimension of psychological capital toughness of males is significantly higher than that of females (p &lt; 0.05), which is the same as the research results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Digan et al. (2019)</ref>, suggesting that male entrepreneurs are better able to cope with stress and difficulties.</p><p>The self-efficacy of entrepreneurs with bachelor's degree, master's degree, or above is significantly higher than that of junior college, senior high school, or below (p &lt; 0.05), which is similar to the research results of Anokye and Asumeng (2019), suggesting that highly educated entrepreneurs have a higher degree of confidence in achieving their goals. The optimism dimension of entrepreneurs under 30 years of age is significantly higher than that of entrepreneurs over 30 years of age, and the hope dimension of entrepreneurs under 40 years of age is significantly higher than that of entrepreneurs over 40 years of age (p &lt; 0.05). This may be because entrepreneurs under the age of 30 are more unmarried, have fewer worries about starting a business, and are more optimistic, while entrepreneurs under the age of 40 are regarded as the golden age of entrepreneurs, full of hope for the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Nordin et al., 2019)</ref>. The dimensions of selfefficacy and toughness are significantly positively correlated with organizational performance (p &lt; 0.001), while the dimensions of optimism and hope are significantly positively correlated with organizational performance (p &lt; 0.05). This is consistent with the research results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wang et al. (2018)</ref>, suggesting that all dimensions of entrepreneur psychological capital can promote the improvement of enterprise performance, but the dimensions of self-efficacy and toughness have higher positive influence than the dimensions of hope and optimism. This may be because the dimension of optimism and hope is the self-confident expression of entrepreneurs themselves, which can promote entrepreneurs to carry out innovative activities but cannot guarantee the quality of activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lucky, 2018)</ref>. According to the analysis of the structural equation model, it is found that the fitting indexes of the relationship model between the entrepreneur's psychological capital and enterprise performance all meet the fitting criteria, which indicates that the model is supported. Thus, the hypothesis "F1: entrepreneur psychological capital has a positive impact on enterprise performance" is true.</p><p>In order to maintain the competitive advantage of enterprises in the same industry, entrepreneurs need to take risks, actively launch new products and services, and explore new markets, which requires entrepreneurs to have efficient creative innovation behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Asad et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Qian et al., 2018)</ref>. In this study, it is found that entrepreneurs' technological creative innovation behavior, business creative innovation behavior, and organizational performance have extremely significant positive correlation (p &lt; 0.001), while the standardized regression coefficient of entrepreneurial relationship acquisition behavior and organizational performance is 0.632, showing a significant positive correlation (p &lt; 0.05). This is consistent with the research results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Subramanian et al. (2019)</ref>, which shows that each dimension of entrepreneur's creative innovation behavior has a positive promoting effect on enterprise performance, but entrepreneur's technological creative innovation behavior and business creative innovation behavior have higher influence than entrepreneur's relationship acquisition behavior. This may be because although entrepreneurs can make use of divergent thinking to obtain a broader knowledge space in relation degree and complete the integration of various resources, they cannot directly promote innovation activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Obschonka et al., 2018)</ref>. In addition, the structural equation model analysis found that the fitting index of the model of the relationship between entrepreneurs' creative innovation behavior and enterprise performance met the adaptation criteria, indicating that the model was supported. Thus, the hypothesis "F2: entrepreneurs' creative innovation behavior has a positive impact on enterprise performance" is true.</p><p>In addition, after the entrepreneur's creative innovation behavior was regarded as the intermediary variable of the entrepreneur's psychological capital and enterprise performance, and the structural equation model was used to analyze and find that after the entrepreneur's creative innovation behavior variable was included, the dimensions of entrepreneurs' self-efficacy, hope, optimism, and toughness and the standardized path coefficient of enterprise performance were significantly reduced. This is basically consistent with the research results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Shin et al. (2018)</ref>, suggesting that the psychological capital of entrepreneurs can exert a positive effect on the performance of enterprises through the intermediary of entrepreneurs' creative innovation behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gonçalves de Lima et al., 2020)</ref>. This is because the psychological capital of entrepreneurs can stimulate the divergent thinking of entrepreneurs, enhance the ability of technological and business creativity and innovation, explore new profit models, and finally continuously improve the level of enterprise performance (Pierre <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Johnson et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Yan et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>By establishing the relationship model of entrepreneur's psychological capital, creative innovation behavior, and enterprise performance path, the authors analyzed the influence of various dimensions of entrepreneur's psychological capital, creative innovation behavior on enterprise performance, and the mediation of entrepreneur's creative innovation behavior on enterprise performance, providing a theoretical basis for the improvement of enterprise performance in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Shen et al., 2019)</ref>. However, due to the limitations of time and economic capacity, there is no clear standard for the measurement dimension of enterprise performance. The innovative performance was used to represent enterprise performance, which had certain ambiguity. Subsequently, the enterprise performance can be divided into dimensions to make the evaluation more accurate. In a word, both entrepreneurial psychological capital and creative innovation can promote the improvement of enterprise performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zheng and Liu, 2020)</ref>. The psychological capital of entrepreneurs can exert a positive effect on the performance of enterprises through the intermediary of entrepreneurs' creative innovation behaviors.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>F3:</head><label></label><figDesc>FIGURE 1 | The relationship model of entrepreneur's psychological capital, creative innovation behavior, and enterprise performance.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,122.61,389.50,348.00,294.36" type="bitmap" /></figure>
