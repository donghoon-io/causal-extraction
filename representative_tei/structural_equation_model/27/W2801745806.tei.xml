<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Theory of Planned Behavior</head><p>TPB is the theory used to explain the relationship between various variables and the purchase intention toward green products. TPB itself is the extension of the Theory of Reasoned Action -TRA <ref type="bibr">(Schiffman &amp; Kanuk, 2010, pp. 253-254)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Assael (2004, p. 226)</ref>, TRA and TPB models are frequently used to explain the relationship between beliefs, attitude, social influence, purchase intention, and consumer behavior toward certain object in marketing. TPB provides the posit that one's intention to behave in a certain way reflects one's attitude to a certain object, social influence, and perceived behavioral control -PBC <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>PBC helps TPB to improve its explanatory capability on intention and behavior to be better than TRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Madden et al., 1992</ref> Referring to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen (1991)</ref>, attitude toward behavior is one's evaluation about a certain behavior, whether it's favorable or unfavorable. Individual evaluation is the keyword for various definitions of attitude, which are listed by the researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Petty et al., 1997)</ref>. If someone is more favorable toward a certain behavior, then intention to behave in such a way will be higher. Next, subjective norm, as the second component, is defined as social pressure perceived by an individual to behave in a certain way <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. If the social support felt by individual is bigger, intention to perform such behavior will be higher. Finally, the third component of TPB is PBC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen (1991)</ref> defined PBC as a perception of an individual on the ease to perform a certain behavior. PBC is related positively to behavioral intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ajzen, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Meta-analysis results from Scalco et al.'s (2017) research shows that TPB is a robust model to explain consumer behavior on green products. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Riebl et al. (2015)</ref> also stated that TPB is an effective framework to understand consumption behavior among young consumers. Some previous researches, which used TPB to explain consumption behavior for green products among young consumers, also presented various findings. Yadav and Pathak (2016a) showed that three components of TPB positively influenced purchase intention toward green products. However, on other researches, subjective norm did not have significant influence on purchase intention toward organic food among young consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Yadav &amp; Pathak, 2016b)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Yazdanpanah and Forouzani (2015)</ref> showed that only attitude had positive influence on purchase intention toward organic products among young consumers. Therefore, based on previously discussed TPB frameworks, the following hypotheses are suggested:</p><p>H1: Young consumers' attitudes toward the green products positively influence purchase intention.</p><p>H2: Subjective norm positively influences purchase intention for green products among young consumers.</p><p>H3: Perceived behavioral control positively influences purchase intention for green products among young consumers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Extending Theory of Planned Behavior</head><p>Even though TPB is a robust and efficient model in explaining behavior, it can also be modified by adding other predictor variables to enhance its capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Conner &amp; Armitage, 1998</ref>).</p><p>The research findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Paul et al. (2016)</ref> showed that adding relevant variables in TPB model can enhance its explanatory capability and improve understanding on purchase intention toward green products. Therefore, environmental concern, environmental knowledge, and willingness to pay are used as the additional explanatory variables in this research model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.1.">Willingness to pay</head><p>Green products are generally perceived as more pricey compared to the conventional ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Smith &amp; Paladino, 2010)</ref>. Exorbitant price frequently hinders green products' consumption <ref type="bibr">(Aertsens et</ref>  argued that price attribute can be a significant consideration for young consumers in consuming green products. However, green products' consumers are not usually over-sensitive with regard to price <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Grankvist &amp; Biel, 2001)</ref>, because they understand the products' benefits, which are consid-ered equal to the premium price <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Padel &amp; Foster, 2005)</ref>. Consumers are demanded to be willing to pay premium price in order to consume green products <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Rana &amp; Paul, 2017)</ref>. The higher their willingness to pay, the bigger their intention to buy the green products <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Prakash &amp; Pathak, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The research findings of Yadav and Pathak (2017) proved that the positive influence of willingness to pay on purchase intention was not supported by empirical data. Referring the the discussion on the role of willingness to pay premium for green products, the fourth hypothesis is stated as follows:</p><p>H4: Willingness to pay premium positively influences purchase intention toward green products among young consumers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHODS</head><p>The research investigates causal relationship between variables using positivist and deductive approach <ref type="bibr">(Saunders et</ref>  The research data were gathered through primary data directly from the source and purposely found in order to seek the relationship between data and phenomena (Cooper &amp; Schindler, 2011, p. 90). The data were then gathered using purposive sampling technique and three hundred twenty-six bachelor degree students were sucessfully obtained as the respondents. They filled in the self-administered questionnaires and returned them after they completed them according to the instruction.</p><p>The data were then analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). It is a multivariate technique, which combines factor analysis and multiple regression and enables the researchers to test the causal relationship between latent variables at once <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2010, p. 634)</ref>. SEM modelling strategy applies the two-steps approach suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</ref>; Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA); and also hypotheses testing for the structural model between variables. The results and discussions shall be presented in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS</head><p>As the first step of SEM analysis, the researchers construct a measurement model (CFA  <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref>, CFA analysis results show that the standardized factor loading is recorded at 0.522 for all indicators. It means that all indicators are valid. The validity can also be displayed through AVE values of each variable, which are recorded at more than 0.4 value. After examining the validity, the researchers should also ensure all variables are reliable. The values of Cronbach's Alpha (α) and CR of each variable are above 0.7, which mean that all variables are reliable. Conclusively, the CFA model proves that the research data were obtained from the valid and reliable measurements.</p><p>After the research data are proved to be reliable and valid, the next step is to test the research hypotheses. The hypotheses testing is conducted by constructing structural model as the second step of SEM modelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988</ref>). The structural model analysis is started by examining the goodness of fit. The GOF value shows that the structural model in this research is favorable and can be interpreted further ( The results of structural model are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The structural model's results in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref> show that not all explanatory variables can influence the purchase intention toward green products among young consumers. Knowledge on the environment and its sustainability provides the largest influence in explaining the purchase intention toward green products. Young consumers' attention toward the environment and their attitude toward green products do not influence their purchase intention. Therefore, H1, H5, and H6 are not supported. These findings are different from those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Yadav and Pathak (2016a)</ref>, where all hypotheses were supported. The differences in research findings commonly happen and become an intriguing discussion topic, especially because the research setting is different.</p><p>The summary of hypotheses testing in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> showed that there are 3 unsupported hypotheses from 8 tested hypotheses. Consumers' attitudes toward green product did not influence purchase intention, so did environmental concern. Research findings about green products consumption are indeed varied. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stanislawski et al. (2013)</ref> proved that the three predictor in TPB such as attitude, subjective norm, and PBC have positive impact on purchase intention toward green products for the consumers in Japan after a major earthquake in 2011.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>This research intends to reveal the factors that influence the purchase intention of green products among adolescents in the context of developing country environment, Indonesia. Employing the essence of TPB, the result of this research provides more understanding about the factors influencing the purchase intention toward green products among Indonesian young consumers. The analysis on three hundred twenty-six empirical data proves that three out of eight hypotheses were not supported. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the young consumers' purchase intention toward green products is positively influenced by their level of knowledge on the environment and its sustainability, their willingness to pay, their subjective norm, and their perceived behavioral control, while the attitude and environmental concern do not influence the purchase intention toward environmentally-friendly products. The findings are fascinating to be discussed further.</p><p>The result provides theoretical contribution in explaining the purchase intention of green products, especially among young consumers in developing countries. In addition, the result supports TPB as a robust framework in describing the consumption behavior on green products, as stated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Scalco et al. (2017)</ref>. The addition of environmental concern, environmental knowledge, and willingness to the variables of TPB framework in this study contributes to a better explanation in understanding the purchasing intention of environmentally-friendly products, supporting the statement of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Paul et al. (2016)</ref>. Furthermore, future research needs to consider other explanatory variables that can theoretically influence the purchasing intention toward green products, for instances, product characteristics (van Birgelen et al., 2009), self-identity in the consumption of environmentallyfriendly products <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Yazdanpanah &amp; Forouzani, 2015)</ref>, and the consideration of PBC both internally and externally <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Ko &amp; Jin, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Practically, the result of this study gives a managerial insight to educate young consumers to care and preserve environmental sustainability by consuming green products. Through excellent education and marketing strategies, these young consumers are expected to more concern on their environment. A good level of environmental concern will enhance the positive attitudes on environmentally-friendly products that will ultimately and positively impact on purchase intentions. Future research needs to consider the impact of education in improving the positive attitude toward green products, both done in laboratory and field experimental. </p></div>
