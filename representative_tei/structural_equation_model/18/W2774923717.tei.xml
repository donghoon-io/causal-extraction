<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Indonesia becomes the first country with the highest transaction of e-commerce at South East Asia Area in 2016 with $245.86 billion in sales <ref type="bibr">(eMarketer, 2016)</ref> and it is expected to grow in the following years <ref type="bibr">(Statista, 2016)</ref>. The e-commerce popularity also supported from the fact that three of ecommerce C2C (Consumer-to-Consumer) website has become the most visited websites in 2017 <ref type="bibr">(ecommerceIQ, 2017)</ref>. The increasing popularity of e-commerce C2C also brings positive influences for the growth of Small-Medium Entreprises (SME) in Indonesia. Through C2C websites, individual sellers or SME have opportunities to broaden their distribution network and their market. Based on this mutual relationship, e-commerce C2C along with the involvement of SME could increase both of their sales.</p><p>Regardless of the benefit that e-commerce C2C offers and its positive effects on SME growth, hesitation of consumers to transact on the e-commerce websites still exist. The hesitations to transact are caused by the deception cases during online shopping and consumer also unable to try the product directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Razdan, 2014)</ref>. The emerging issues of trust on online shopping are occurring since the consumers unable to directly verified the products compare to direct transaction. Especially, in C2C Ecommerce, the platform usually play a mediating the role between sellers and buyers, customer's trust will be important in order to increase purchase intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kwahk, Ge &amp; Park, 2012)</ref>. Also, the previous study argues that trust is one of the important factors in e-commerce significantly which affects customer purchase intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen &amp; Ching, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Consumers' hesitation to purchase which arise from various problems in online shopping become an obstacle to the e-commerce growth. Therefore, a better understanding of purchase intention is essential for effective e-commerce usage, especially to know the customer's perspective towards C2C ecommerce and to understand consumer behavior to improve the company's business. This research investigates the success of C2C e-commerce from their ability to create purchase intention of the users to shop online. This study has a purpose to obtain factors influencing purchase intention of consumers in C2C e-commerce websites by investigating three C2C e-commerce companies in Indonesia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review</head><p>The intention to transact or purchase intention is defined as the intention of buyers to engage in the exchange relationship at shopping websites, such as sharing information, maintain business relationships, and create business transactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Zwass, 1998)</ref>. Intention to purchase online is based on the relationship between behavioral intention and actual behavior. Behavioral intention of individual to do action will determine the actual individual behavior. Thus, purchase intention to particular online shopping websites is a factor that predicts the actual behavior or the purchase decision of customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kim, Ferrin &amp; Rao, 2008)</ref>. The research observing online purchase intention is an appropriate measurement for intention to use the website because online transaction involves sharing information process and actual purchase so that online purchase intention will depend on many factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pavlou, 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)</head><p>Technology Acceptance Model theory was developed at 1989 by Davis which has a purpose of predicting the acceptance of system and behavior of users when using the system. TAM explains that individual behaviour when using a system is affected by perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Davis, 1989)</ref>. Previous studies also using technology acceptance model as a guiding theory such as in the field of online banking information systems acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chandio, Abbasi, Nizamani &amp; Nizamani, 2013)</ref> and cloud computing adoption by companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dachyar &amp; Prasetya, 2012)</ref> which both of the research area related to technology adoption.</p><p>A website, in general, can be considered as an information system which give informations to its users. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Shih, 2004)</ref>. Nowadays, TAM is the most suitable theory in order to explain the acceptance of technology in the information system research <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gefen, Karahanna &amp; Straub, 2003)</ref>. Thus, online purchase intention, as an appropriate measurement for intention to use a website, should be explained as a part of technology acceptance model.</p><p>As guiding theory in this research, the two factors of TAM (perceived usefulness perceived ease of use) are included. Perceived ease of use is explained to an extent when a user experienced a particular website as easily operated and effortless (i.e., time and energy) to learn using the website <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen &amp; Ching, 2013)</ref>. When websites interfaces are easy to use, buyers will find the meaningful and useful information easily, which improve their perception of usefulness.</p><p>Therefore, we hypothesized: H1: Perceived ease of use positively affects custmer's perceived usefulness in C2C e-commerce</p><p>In the terms of e-commerce, usefulness is defined as an extent to how an online store provides helpful information to their customers and how those information help their t ransactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen &amp; Ching, 2013)</ref>. In online shopping, the interactions between online shoppers and online stores only happen through the websites interfaces which means an easy to understand or high perceived ease-of-use websites will lead to the creation of trust and lower misunderstanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Blau, 1989)</ref>. The previous study also found that perceived ease of use affects customer trust through customer satisfaction in telecommunication company <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dachyar &amp; Hananto, 2014)</ref>. In the e-commerce context, it is found that the more usable and navigable a website is, the more a buyer will conclude that the online store operates in good faith, hence increasing customer's perception of trust <ref type="bibr">(Chen &amp; Chi ng, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, we hypothesized that: H2: Perceived ease of use positively affects customer's trust in C2C e-commerce According to empirical results of TAM in the previous study, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the potential adopters of an information system will affect their behavioral intentions to use certain technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hongyao, 2013)</ref>. The previous study also shows that there is a positive relationship between perceived ease-of-use and perceived usefulness with purchase intention in technology adoption settings. In another hand, a web interface which facilitating the transaction process and easy to use website is likely to be accepted by e-commerce users <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dishaw &amp; Strong, 1999)</ref>. Thus, we hypothesized that: H3: Customer's perceived ease of use positively affects the customer's purchase intention in C2C e-commerce Usefulness on its original definition is defined as an extent to which a person believes that using particular system would enhance users performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Davis, 1989)</ref>. In this study, we propose that the more customers find online transactions become useful, the more they tend to find the benefits of it compare to direct transaction. Also, online transactions enable customers to accomplish their shopping task more quickly than a traditional transaction. Hence, we hypothesized that:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H4: A consumer's perceived usefulness affects consumer's perceived benefits in C2C e-commerce</head><p>In accordance with the original TAM model, perceived usefulness is corresponded with user attitude towards information system and its use. For e-commerce context, perceived usefulness is defined as an extent to which an individual believes that trading on the websites would increase the effectiveness of shopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Shih, 2004)</ref>. In the previous study also shows that useful information and facilitation to assist buyer for completing the transaction will give positive values to customers which increase customer purchase intention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen &amp; Ching, 2013)</ref>. Thus, we hypothesized that: H5: Perceived usefulness positively affects the customer's purchase intention in C2C e-commerce</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Benefit</head><p>Benefit defined as the extent to a customer will gain advantage from the online transaction with a certain website. Internet consumers report that they purchase on the web because they perceived benefits (e.g., increased convenience, cost savings, time savings, varieties of product to choose) compared to the traditional mode of shopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Margherio, 1998)</ref>. When consumers gain benefits during online transaction with certain websites, they are more likely will make online transactions.</p><p>Hence, we hypothesized that: H6: Perceived benefit affects customer's purchase intention in C2C e-commerce</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Trust</head><p>Trust is defined as an extent to personal guarantees that the online shop will fulfill their obligations, will behave as expected, and put attention to their customers. For e-commerce context, the responsibilities of the vendors are to provide helpful information and facilitate customers to accomplish their task successfully. Finally, online shoppers will perceive its usefulness by receiving the benefits, such as gaining information from the websites and meet their expectations when an online website can be trusted, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen &amp; Ching, 2013)</ref>. Thus, the next research hypothesis is as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H7: A customer's trust positively affects customer's perceived usefulness in C2C e-commerce</head><p>Trust also defined the level of confidence of a person has in his or her expectations of what other people will do in the future based on previous interaction. The importance of trust is increasing because there is a high level of uncertainty and risk occurs in the online transaction. Lack of trust is also the main reason why customers do not want to engage in the e-commerc e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kim et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, we hypothesized that the increase of trust would directly affect purchase intentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H8: A customer's trust positively affects purchase intention in C2C e-commerce</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Risk</head><p>Perceived risk is an important factor that is likely to affect consumer behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Javernpaa, Tractinsky &amp; Vitale, 2000)</ref>. Risk is defined as a consumer's belief of uncertainty related to the potential outcomes that might occur in the online transaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kim et al., 2008)</ref>. In the e-commerce context, behavioral uncertainty and related risks with the possibility that a web retailer might treat their customer opportunistically will be reduced by trust. Purchaser have a tendency that a trusted web retailer will not take advantages opportunistically <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gefen, 2000)</ref>. Hence, trust will reduce the perceived risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mayer, Davis &amp; Shoorman, 1995)</ref>. At the point when a web retailer can be trusted to demonstrate capability, trustworthiness, and benevolence, there is less risk engaged with it. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pavlou, 2003)</ref>. Therefore, we hypothesized that:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H9: Trust affects consumer's perceived risk. in C2C e-commerce</head><p>It is basic for a purchaser who is making an online shopping to be hesitant to buy on the web when they aware of risk that might be overwhelming when contrasted with the conventional method of shopping because of the fact that the apparent of risk will build contrasted with the immediate transaction. Consequently, it should not be surprising that customers will be mindful of risk in online transaction, and such risk may impact their choices whether to buy from an online selle r. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kim et al., 2008)</ref>. Based on the arguments, we hypothesized that: H10: Perceived risk positively affects consumer's purchase intention in C2C e-commerce</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Reputation</head><p>Reputation is an extent to which a purchaser feel confident that a seller is being honest and care for its customers. Companies with a good reputation will be reluctant to jeopardize their reputation by acting opportunistically <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Javernpaa et al., 2000)</ref>. Positive reputation of the seller has been viewed as a key factor for diminishing risk and creating trust since it gives suspicions that the sellers have met their commitments toward different purchasers on the past. Therefore it is hypothesized that: H11: Reputation positively affects customer's trust in C2C e-commerce</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Familiarity</head><p>Familiarity is a "precondition or prerequisite of trust" <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Luhmann, 1979)</ref> since familiarity prompts an understanding of an entity's present activities while trust manages convictions around an entity's future activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gefen, 2000)</ref>. Familiarity related to the purchaser's level of comprehension of pertinent methods, for example, looking for items and data and requesting through sites interface. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kim et al., 2008)</ref>. Therefore it is hypothesized that: </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Sample and data collection</head><p>This research surveyed consumers of C2C e-commerce in Indonesia. An online, self-administered survey was intended to explore the customer purchase intention towards C2C e-commerce websites.</p><p>The web-survey procedure is utilized since its give a few advantages, for example, saving time and money, access to an extensive population of individual, interactive, and dynamic components that increase respondent inspiration to answer the inquiries, and ease of approaching particular targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Schmidt, 1997)</ref>. The instructions for the questionnaire stated that this study sought to investigate the purchase intention of online shopper. To generalize our findings, we assigned three C2C online shopping company's websites in Indonesia which at least one of them is frequently used for online  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Measures</head><p>The research model was developed using literature studies and expert judgment of five (5) experts in the e-commerce field to verify the research model and to choose the relationship of variables which suitable for the condition of Indonesia. The questionnaires from experts are collected using 5 Lickert scales. The relationship of latent variables will be accepted when the geomean value more than 3.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mohaparta, Mohantry &amp; Dhalla, 2010)</ref>. The result of expert assessment and literature study are the basis for the research model with 12 hypothesis which will be measured in this research.</p><p>The questionnaire used to test the relationship of the variables are distributed to the experienced online shopper in at least one of three online websites (Company A, B, or C). A pilot study was led to test the legitimacy of the survey to 40 undergraduate students. Items measuring purchase intention also use five-point Lickert scale (1 describes "strongly disagree" until 5 describes "strongly agree"). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows indicators or item used for the questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Data analysis method</head><p>This research was developed using structural equation modeling, a multivariate analysis approach which simultaneously used to examine and estimates complex causal relationship among variabl es <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Williams, Vanderberg &amp; Edwards, 2009)</ref>. This study utilizes AMOS 22 to conduct SEM analysis. This study adopted two steps analysis procedure (measurement and structural model) and maximum likelihood <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson, 1988)</ref>. To start with, this research performed a confirmatory factor analysis to assess the fit and develop validity of the model estimation. The second step is conducted once the satisfactory factor of measurement model is obtained <ref type="bibr">(Bollen, Structural Equation Modelling with Latent Variables, 1989)</ref>.</p><p>The total amount of collected data came from 1254 respondents. The data underwent rigorous outliers deletion through Mahalanobis distance detection. The remaining data processed is 400 data for each company or in a total of 1200 data. Further, univariate normality was analyzed using the Z-statistic skewness and kurtosis. The result shows the data already follows a normal distribution.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Demographics of the respondents</head><p>Demographics of 1200 respondents in this study is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. The data shows 67% of them are females; 52.75% age below 20 years old; the latest education of 60.58% them are high school; 38.92% of them shop online for once in a month; 58.58% of them have estimated money for online shopping ranged from Rp. 100,000 -Rp 25,000 ($10 -$25). The frequency of online shopping and estimated money spent are heterogeneous, and this reveals a different behavior of online shopping of the respondents.</p></div>

Meanwhile, incremental fit indices used in this study are Normed Fit Index (NFI) and</p><p>Comparative Fit Index (CFI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hooper, Coughlan &amp; Mullen, 2008)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> shows Goodness of Fit (GOF) indices of the model. The results of hypothesis testing conducted on the three companies show that trust (β8: 0.43; p&lt;0.05) and risk (β10: 0.15; p&lt;0.05) affecting purchase intention significantly in company A. The significant relationship between trust and risks is consistent with the previous studies suggesting that trust would be a risk-reducing factor in online transaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pavlou, 2003)</ref>. Although the TAM factors (perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness) not directly change purchase intention, the perceived ease of use factor significantly affects trust at p&lt;0.001 which indicates that the relationship between these two factors shows that trust in Company A comes from ease of use. The structural model with the estimation value of company A is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goodness of Fit</head><p>Perceived usefulness is a factor that directly and significantly affects purchase intention in the company B (β5: 0.81; p&lt;0.001). Perceived usefulness, in this context such as the effectiveness of searching for products, useful website content, and relatively fast purchasing process. The perceived usefulness comes from several significant antecedents factors, such as trust and ease of use. Usefulness will be perceived by the customer once the customer experienced particular website is easy to use, and the trust of customer for the website already exists, thus supporting Hypothesis 1 (β1: 0.67; p&lt;0.001) and Hypothesis 7 (β7: 0.39; p&lt;0.001). The insignificant relationship of trust to purchase intention indicates that customer's trust on company B website is not fully developed and not yet enough to influence purchase intention. The structural model with the estimation value of company B is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Company C sees the benefit as a factor affecting purchase intention of the customers significantly (β6: 0.30; p&lt;0.05). It is also found that trust and risk factors are not significant factors in influencing customer purchase intention at website C. In other words, customer confidence has not been sufficient to influence customers to make a purchase. The TAM factors (ease of use and perceived usefulness) in company C does not significantly affect customer's purchase intention which inconsistent with research conducted in one of e-commerce C2C website in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dehua, Lu &amp; Zhou, 2008)</ref>. The structural model with the estimation value of company C is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. circumstances that occur in this study also occur in the previous study <ref type="bibr">(Heijeden et al., 2003)</ref> where trust, PEOU, PU are insignificant because these variables are categorized as 'threshold' variables which are defined that once an evaluation level is obtained, these variables no longer contribute to behavioral intentions. Therefore, this variable will be significant at the low evaluation level or when the respondent evaluates the website as a bad category website. Illustration of this condition is described as follows, a buyer may purchase or not purchase on a user-friendly website, but the buyer definitely will not purchase on a website which is not user-friendly.</p><p>Another reason for the insignificant relationship of TAM variables is because the website selected in this study is not a website where the condition of PEOU and PU which have a bad evaluation.</p><p>Therefore, the researchers speculate that PEOU and PU reach expectations levels in almost all respondents which become the reason why these variables do not affect customer's online purchase intention.</p><p>In each of the company, not all TAM variables are significant to purchase intention. The explanation of this result is because purchase intention more narrowly compared to the variables found in the TAM model in general, which is intention to use. The original TAM model focuses intention to use technology, which is different from purchase intention. In the context of e-commerce, usage intention is wider than purchase intention. This is because someone may be using an online website but not to buy, but also to obtain information about a product and service. In the context of e-commerce, intention to use is more extensive than purchase intention because somebody might utilize an online site but not to purchase and only acquire data about an item and administration. Therefore, respondents are not interested in buying products on online shopping websites even though they feel the website is useful.</p><p>In the three model of the company, there is similarity that the relationship of familiarity or not significant relationship to trust which is inconsistent with the previous researc h ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kim et al., 2008)</ref>. The differences in this conditions define two possibilities. The first possibility, online shopping websites cognition of consumers in Indonesia is adequate so that it is not significant to affect customer's purchase intention. The second possibility is Indonesian do not only consider familiarity (i.e., the layout of website menu) when purchasing in online shopping websites, so that it is not significant enough to influence customer's purchase intention.</p><p>The summary of analysis based on path coefficient, direct effect, indirect effect, and total effect of factors in the research model are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">9</ref>. </p></div>

Using the regression values of the relationships of variables, it is found that trust and risk factors are factors that most significantly influence the purchase intention of customers in Company A. In company B, perceived usefulness is significant, while the benefits a significant factor which influences purchase intention in company C.</p><p>The shoppers in this research did not think much about the familiarity, but rather they cared about the reputation of the companies which prompts customer trust. Subsequently, it is suggested that sellers should give careful consideration to online shopping websites to increase customers' trust through website content, such as the content of information and more user-friendly website and also improve their customer services so that the reputation will attract more potential customers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
