<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The role of internal marketing in developing organisational competencies is identified as a key area for continued research (Rafiq and Ahmed, 2003). One competence of particular interest to marketers is market orientation. This paper examines the impact of internal marketing, operationalised as a set of internal market orientated behaviours (IMO) on market orientation (MO), and consequently organisational performance, and provides the first quantitative evidence to support the long held assumption that internal marketing has an impact on marketing success.</p><p>Data from UK retail managers were analysed using structural equations modelling employing LISREL software. These data indicate significant relationships between internal market orientation, employee motivation and external marketing success (market orientation, financial performance and customer satisfaction). Our results also support previous findings indicating a positive impact of external market orientation on customer satisfaction and financial performance. For marketing practitioners, the role of internal market orientation is developing marketing strategies is discussed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Generating, disseminating and responding to customer and competitor information (i.e. being market orientated) is generally accepted as an important organisational competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jaworski and Kohli, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chang and Chen, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Vorhies, Harker and Rao, 1999)</ref> and has been shown to have significant benefits for organisational financial performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Langerak, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Matear, Osborne, Garrett and Gray, 2002)</ref>. Whilst much is known about what market orientation is and does, relatively little attention has been dedicated to understanding its antecedents. Consequently, whilst companies know that they have to develop a market orientation, the means to do so are not apparent. A review of the extant literature identifies several mechanisms that have been suggested to give rise to higher levels of market orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bansal, Mendelson and Sharma, 2001)</ref>, although empirical evidence to support these claims is lacking. Internal marketing is one such mechanism, and a common view amongst scholars is that internal marketing will enable employees to behave in a more market oriented manner and motivate them to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Grönroos, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gummesson, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Piercy and Morgan, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Harris and Piercy, 1999)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">George and Grönroos (1991)</ref> suggest that internal marketing is a philosophy for satisfying and motivating employees based on a marketing perspective; it is based on the belief that satisfied and motivated employees are essential if customers are to be satisfied. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lings and Greenley (2005)</ref>, report five managerial behaviours (internal market orientation) associated with implementing the internal marketing philosophy. These behaviours relate to internal market research, internal communication, and the development of job-products to satisfy the wants and needs of employees. Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lings and Greenley (2005)</ref> report that IMO has positive consequences for some employee behaviours, its much mooted impact on market orientation (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Harris, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Harris and Piercy, 1999)</ref> remains unconfirmed. The impact of internal market orientation on market orientation, and the combined impacts of these internal and external orientations on performance (e.g. profitability, and customer satisfaction) continue to be signalled as important areas of study (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gounaris, 2006)</ref> Our study examines the role of internal market orientation in developing an external market orientation and seeks empirical evidence of the impact of internal marketing (operationalised as IMO) on market orientation within the established nomological network. See figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Market Orientation</head><p>Prior to any examination of market orientation it is essential to establish the conceptual background of market orientation used in this study. The majority of literature examining market orientation takes one of two views, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Homburg and Pflesser, 2000)</ref>. In the first, market orientation is viewed as a business philosophy representing the marketing concept (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Webster, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lichtenthal and Wilson, 1992)</ref>. In the second, market orientation is seen as a set of behaviours representing the implementation of the marketing concept (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Narver and Slater, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kohli and Jaworski, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Slater and Narver, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kohli, Jaworski and Kumar, 1993)</ref>. As we are particularly interested in the development of internal marketing activities on the behaviour of front line service staff we adopt a behavioural perspective to market orientation and follow the conceptual foundation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jaworski and Kohli (1993)</ref> that market orientation consists of a set of organisation wide behaviours associated with implementing the marketing concept. Although specific nomenclature varies, within the behavioural camp of market orientation, there appears to be broad consensus that market orientation involves the collection of market information, it's analysis and dissemination and an appropriate response to that information. See for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Day and Wensley, (1988)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Narver and Slater, (1990)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kohli and Jaworski, (1990)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Deng and Dart, (1994)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hunt and Morgan, (1995)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Siguaw, Simpson and Baker (1996)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wright, Pearce and Busbin (1997)</ref>. This is represented in an operationalisation of market orientation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kohli and Jaworski (1990)</ref>, who consider market orientation to be the organisation wide generation, dissemination and responsiveness to market information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jaworski and Kohli, (1993)</ref> first operationalised market orientation using a 32-item scale measuring information generation, dissemination and response, and later modified this to a shortened version <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kohli, Jaworski and Kumar, 1993)</ref>. This conceptualisation and operationalisation of market orientation has been shown to be robust under several different research contexts (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Pitt, Caruana and Berthon, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Martin, Martin and Grbac, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Siguaw, Simpson and Baker, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Vorhies, Harker and Rao, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Several adaptations of the scales have also been employed and found to be robust (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baker and Sinkula, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Wood, Bhuian and Kiecker, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cadogan, Paul, Salminen, Puumalainen and Sundqvist, 2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consequences of Market Orientation</head><p>The positive role of market orientation in the firm is also widely supported, (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jaworski and Kohli, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chang and Chen, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Vorhies, Harker and Rao, 1999)</ref>. It is reported to have both financial and non-financial consequences for the firm [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Langerak, 2003)</ref> for a comprehensive review of the business consequences of market orientation]. Of particular interest here; MO has been shown to have positive consequences for the profitability of the firm (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Avlonitisa and Gounaris, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Homburg and Pflesser, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Matear et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Langerak, 2001)</ref>. MO has also been shown to be related to employees' attitudes and behaviours (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Ruekert, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jaworski and Kohli, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Siguaw, Brown and Widing, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Piercy, Harris and Lane, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Jones, Busch and Dacin, 2003)</ref> and customers' attitudes and behaviours (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Qu and Ennew, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Singh and Ranchhod, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kaynak and Kara, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Market Orientation and Employees.</head><p>There is strong evidence to support the relationship between market orientation and employee attitudes and behaviours; however, the causal direction of this relationship remains unclear. Several authors report that market orientation has positive consequences for employee behaviours such as customer orientation, job satisfaction, organisational commitment and role stress (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Ruekert, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jaworski and Kohli, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Siguaw, Brown and Widing, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Piercy, Harris and Lane, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Jones, Busch and Dacin, 2003)</ref>. However, others argue that effective market oriented activities require the motivation and participation of employees at all levels of the firm, and in all functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gummesson, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kelley, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Harris, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Martin, Martin and Grbac, 1998)</ref>. In order to engage employees in the adoption of a market oriented strategy, it is essential that they are motivated to perform in a market-oriented manner, (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Harris, 2002)</ref>. Given the organisation wide nature of market orientation (all employees act in a marketing capacity and generate and disseminate information and respond in a customer focused manner) it is plausible that employees who are motivated will be more likely to undertake these positive behaviours and act in the best interest of the firm. Consequently we hypothesise that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H 1 :</formula><p>The more motivated front line staff are, the greater the firm's market orientation</p><p>Market Orientation and Customers. The market sensing and responding competencies implied by high levels of market orientation result in highly market oriented firms knowing what their customers want and what the market offers, and responding with a service or product that meets the needs of target customers better than competing offerings. Consequently, the success of a market-oriented strategy can be measured in terms of the customer satisfaction that it generates. (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Web, Webster and Krepapa, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Qu and Ennew, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kaynak and Kara, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Singh and Ranchhod, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Caruana and Calleya, 1998)</ref>, As a consequence of increased customer satisfaction, it is reasonable to assume that repeat purchase and customer loyalty would be enhanced, and consequently profitability. (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Maydeu-Olivares and Lado, 2003)</ref> These observations lead us to our second hypothesis:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">H 2 :</formula><p>The greater the firm's market orientation, the higher the satisfaction of customers.</p><p>H 3 : The greater the firm's market orientation, the more profitable the firm will be. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Tuominen and Möller, (1996)</ref> emphasise the role of management in developing appropriate systems and structures to create market-orientated behaviours. They suggest that organisational systems, including recruitment, training and rewards systems impact the adoption of MO within the firm (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Ruekert, 1992)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Harris (2002)</ref> argues that managerial behaviours (such as internal market orientation) are a major determinant of market orientation success (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Harris and Piercy, 1999)</ref>. At this juncture, it appears that training and motivating employees to perform market-oriented behaviours is a major consideration for organisations wishing to implement the marketing philosophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jaworski and Kohli, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Heskett, Jones, Loveman, Sasser and Schlesinger, 1994)</ref>. Internal marketing has long been discussed as a means of motivating employees to perform customer focused and market oriented behaviours (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Azzolini and Shillaber, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">George, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gummesson, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Harari, 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Harari, , 1993;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Harrell and Fors, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Piercy and Morgan, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Piercy, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Mohr-Jackson, 1991)</ref>. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support this assertion <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Conduit and Mavondo, 2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Antecedents to Market Orientation</head><p>This paucity of systematic research into the role of internal marketing and its impact on company performance, both directly and by facilitating market orientation in the firm, suggests the need for information concerning the internal marketing -external market orientation link.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internal Marketing</head><p>Internal marketing is grounded in the belief that external marketing success is, in part, contingent on the firm having satisfied and motivated boundary-spanning employees (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sasser and Arbeit, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berry and Parasuraman, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Greene, Walls and Schrest, 1994)</ref>. Recent advances in the field of internal marketing have led to the identification of behaviours associated with internal marketing, their conceptualisation as a multidimensional internal market orientation construct, and the development of an instrument to measure these <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Lings and Greenley, 2005)</ref>. IMO is reported to have several important consequences for the firm. Firstly IMO is thought to influence employee attitudes and behaviours, in particular employee motivation to provide good customer service <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Tansuhaj, Randall and McCullogh, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Comm, 1989)</ref>. Consequently;</p><p>H 4 : The higher the level of IMO exhibited by managers, the greater the motivation of service staff to provide exceptional service.</p><p>IMO behaviour displayed by managers is thought to foster employee identification with the organisation, and to reduce their dysfunctional behaviours, such as service sabotage or false reporting <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Ramaswami, 1996)</ref>. In addition to reducing dysfunctional behaviours, internal market oriented behaviour increases behaviours, which are compliant with organisational strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Piercy and Morgan, 1990)</ref>.</p><p>The market sensing, communication and responding capabilities implied by the internal market orientation construct represent the facilitation of information transfer between front line employees (who are also important sources of market research information) and managers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ballantyne, 2003)</ref>, a consequence internal market orientation is expected to have a positive impact on the information generation dimension of market orientation, as the route for market information to be communicated to managers becomes more utilised and routine. Furthermore, the adoption of internal market orientation within the organisation results in employees being better informed and motivated to carry out the strategic responses of the firm to its market <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Rafiq and Ahmed, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wasmer and Brunner, 1991)</ref>. Consequently IMO is expected to have a positive impact on the responsiveness dimension of market orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Piercy, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Naude, Desai and Murphy, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently we hypothesise:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">H 5 :</formula><p>The higher the level of IMO exhibited by managers, the greater the market-orientated behaviour of the firm.</p><p>In addition to its impact on employees, and perhaps as a result of this, IMO is suggested to have important consequences for customer attitudes and behaviours. Motivating employees to deliver exception service is thought to be a key determinant of customer satisfaction. This relationship has been discussed for more than two decades (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">George, 1977)</ref> and, although widely accepted, it remains a contentious issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Piercy, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Rafiq and Ahmed, 1993)</ref> with limited literature exploring the exact nature of the relationship between the two constructs. Despite this lack of empirical evidence, most researchers operate under the belief that employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction are significant and positively correlated.</p><p>We hypothesise therefore that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">H 6 :</formula><p>The higher the motivation of employees , the greater the satisfaction of customers.</p><p>And</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">H 7 :</formula><p>The higher the level of customer satisfaction, the greater the financial performance of the firm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>We collected data to examine the relationship between the constructs in our study by means of a survey. A total of 3,500 retail managers from a wide range of retail organisations, all providing multiple product lines, were surveyed. These included supermarkets, department stores, clothing retailers, and retailers of health and beauty products. Retailers were chosen on the basis that their advertising and other corporate communications made explicit statements about high levels of customer service, and emphasised service personnel as a factor differentiating them from competitors. Store managers were chosen as respondents because of their unique influence on the achievement of organisational objectives. At the local level, store managers act simultaneously as a merchandiser, salesperson, financial officer, marketer, researcher, strategist and supervisor of other employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lusch and Serpkenci, 1990)</ref>. This range of activities makes store managers knowledgeable respondents for performance measures. It is the behaviours of the store manager that constitute internal market orientation. The majority of previous studies examining market orientation have been conducted using data collected at the strategic business unit (SBU) level <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Uncles, 2000)</ref>. Using store managers to report on levels of market orientation is consistent with this approach as, in this instance, the retail store can be thought of as the SBU equivalent.</p><p>All respondents received a package containing a letter explaining the purpose of the study, the questionnaire and a return envelope. Reminder notices were posted two weeks after the initial mailing. A response rate of 22 percent was achieved (828 completed questionnaires, 766 usable). Respondents were roughly equally split between male and female managers (male 57.4 percent, female 42.6 percent). Ages ranged from 20 years to 61 years, with a mean of 36.6 years (σ = 8.6), the mean length of service with the company was 13.8 years (σ = 7.6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>IMO was measured using the scale reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lings and Greenley (2005)</ref>. This scale consisted of 16 items measuring the five behavioural components of IMO (4 items measuring informal information generation, 3 items measuring formal face to face information generation, 3 items measuring formal written information generation, 3 items measuring information dissemination, and 3 items measuring responsiveness).</p><p>Market orientation was measured using an adaptation of the MARKOR scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kohli, Jaworski and Kumar, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Performance was measured using managers' subjective evaluations of their achievement of financial objectives and internal and external marketplace success. The distinction between objective and subjective measures lies in whether the measure is based on empirical observation or, alternatively, on beliefs, perceptions, or attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Wang and Gianakis, 1999)</ref>. Subjective evaluations of performance were used in preference to objective measures, as in this context it was felt that mangers' day-to-day behaviours would be driven by their beliefs about the performance of their store, rather than an objective evaluation of their performance.</p><p>A comparison of the mean values for key items of interest revealed no significant differences between early (those who responded within the first 3 days) and late (those who responded after the follow up)</p><p>respondents. In addition 50 randomly selected non-respondents were contacted by telephone and asked why they had not responded. The main reasons given were that they did not receive the questionnaire and that time pressure prevented participation in the survey. None of these reasons suggests that non-response bias was an inhibiting factor in the analysis and interpretation of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Leslie, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Armstrong and Overton, 1977)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To be consistent with other research examining the impact of market orientation, scores for each generation, dissemination and responsiveness were computed by averaging the scores for all item included in each of the subscales, and market orientation was modelled as a higher order construct. A similar approach was taken to modelling IMO. Scores for each of the five dimensions of IMO were calculated by averaging the scores for the items associated with each dimension and then IMO was modelled as a higher order construct.</p><p>The psychometric properties of these new scales were tested and found to be acceptable i.e. coefficient α for each scale and composite reliabilities of each of the scales exceed the recommended minima suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Churchill (1999)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gerbing and Anderson (1988)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Hair et al. (1998, p.611)</ref>. (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>: Following this a structural model was estimated to examine the relationships between the constructs in the hypothetical model show in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.The theoretical model yielded the following fit statistics. The Chi square statistic was 237.7, df =163, p=0.00. Although the Chi square statistic is not significant it is susceptible to large sample sizes and under such circumstances the relative chi square (χ 2 /df) may be used to indicate the adequacy of fit of the model to the data. The relative chi-square for the model is 1.46. A ratio in the range 1-2 suggests an adequate fit between the theoretical model and the sample data <ref type="bibr">(Carmines and McIver, 1981, p.80)</ref>. The goodness of fit statistic were GFI=0.913, IFI=0.996, CFI=0.995, RMSEA=0.029, StRMR=0.049. All exceed the recommended cut offs for these measures of model fit. The next stage of analysis was to examine the path coefficients for the hypothesised relationships in the model.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">[INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]</formula><p>These are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The results of the model estimated above illustrate the roles of both internal and external market orientations in retailing organisations. Specifically, our results confirm the findings of other researchers who have examined the impact of market orientation on organisational performance in other contexts (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">McCullough, Heng and Khem, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Narver and Slater, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Ruekert, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Day and Nedungadi, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pelham and Wilson, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Vorhies, Harker and Rao, 1999)</ref>. We provide additional quantifiable evidence of the impact of market orientation on financial performance, in the context of retail stores in their local environment.</p><p>We also find support for the many assertions that internal market orientation has a significant role to play in retail service organisations. Specifically, our data support assertions that internal market orientation has a significant positive impact on external market orientation (Hypothesis 4) and employee motivation (Hypothesis 3). This addresses the limitations of current research in this area and supports the notion that creating market oriented organisations requires a balanced internal and external focus <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Piercy, 1995)</ref>. Our findings suggest that managerial behaviours associated with viewing employees as being important enough to warrant attention to their wants and needs does indeed create a more motivated workforce. This, in turn, has positive consequences for customer satisfaction (Hypothesis 5) and profitability (Hypothesis 6). Also, we find that employee focused IMO behaviours give rise to higher levels of market focus in the work force as evidenced by increased market orientation. Interestingly the data do not support the moderating role of employee motivation in this relationship (Hypothesis 1), rather they suggest that internal market orientation has a direct impact on external market orientation.</p><p>Our data also support the assertion that market orientation has positive consequences for customer satisfaction (Hypothesis 2), suggesting that consumers do notice organisations efforts to identify and meet their needs. We also find support for the relationship between customer satisfaction and profitability (Hypothesis 6). This is particularly important as both internal and external market orientation involves investment of resources, both financial and non-financial, and most organisations seek some financial return on this investment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Theory and Directions for Further Research</head><p>The contributions of this study are manifold. One major contribution is the presentation of the first empirical evidence supporting the positive correlation between internal and external market orientations.</p><p>Although it is not possible to unambiguously infer causal direction from structural equations models, our results, in conjunction with theoretical arguments, suggest that internal market orientation plays an antecedent role in the adoption of an external internal market orientation. The ability of the organisation to generate, disseminate and respond to information may represent an underlying capability of the firm; applying these capabilities to the internal market of service employees and the external market of service customers represents the stakeholder focus of the firm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Greenley and Foxall, 1997)</ref>. Examining the associations between internal market orientation and other external orientations of the firm may prove a fruitful area of further research to elucidate further mechanisms by which internal market orientation may influence the external market. Additionally, a longitudinal study, examining the impact of internal market orientation initiatives undertaken by an organisation, would provide further evidence of the causality between in the intern and external orientations and the direct consequences of such an initiative on service employees.</p><p>This study also provides evidence that, despite their conceptual similarities, internal and external market orientations are distinct constructs, both representing capabilities in information generation, dissemination and responsiveness of the firm. Given the prevalence of alternative conceptualisations of market orientation (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Narver and Slater, 1990)</ref> it would be beneficial to replicate this study using an alternative operationalisation of market orientation to provide additional support for the beneficial association between the internal and external foci of the firm.</p><p>Finally, the major limitations of this work arise from the use of retail managers as the sole respondents used. Despite being knowledgeable respondents, managers can only report their opinions of how staff and customers behave and so deduce how motivated and satisfied they are. If possible, any replications of this work should collect data directly from these stakeholders in a matched triadic study. Although obtaining such matched data would be challenging, and would come with its own set of limitations (such as obtaining responses from customers that relate to specific staff members and not to their overall evaluations f the service), such data would better represent the actual attitudes of employees and customers.</p><p>In the same vein, managers were used in this study to report their subjective views of the performance of their operations. As discussed earlier, subjective views do have the advantage of linking directly with managers' behaviours; however, more objective measures of performance may provide additional insights into the impact of both internal and external market orientations.</p><p>Finally, all data in this study were collected from a relating environment. Further replications need to examine other service contexts to provide additional support for the generalisability of the findings reported here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for practice</head><p>Our findings have important implications for the management of market focused service organisations.</p><p>Firstly, they suggest that, in addition to understanding the external market, services managers must develop a better understanding of the wants and needs of employees. Managers need to enhance their listening skills and learn to generate information about the wants and needs of employees using formal and informal techniques.</p><p>Service organisations also need to facilitate the dissemination of this information throughout the organisation and to encourage debate regarding the most appropriate response to employees' wants and needs, and how best to balance these with the objectives of the firm. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: IMO and Market Orientation within a nomological network</figDesc></figure>
