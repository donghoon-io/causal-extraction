TQM represents an overarching corporate focus toward meeting customer expectations and reducing costs resulting from poor quality by integrating quality management systems and processes with corporate culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Berry, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Handfield et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Yusof and Aspinwall, 2000)</ref>. Although there are numerous TQM success stories <ref type="bibr">(Mohanty and Lakhe, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Taylor and Wright, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Jayaram et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Zatzick et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Hietschold et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Ng et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Valmohammadi and Roshanzamir, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Donauer et al. 2015)</ref>, there are some sceptics who continuously question the role and impact of TQM <ref type="bibr">(Corredor and Goni, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">García -Bernal and García-Casarejos, 2016)</ref>. Indeed, failures of TQM implementation have been widely reported (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Powell, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Beer, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Jun et al. 2004)</ref>, and are largely attributed to inconsistent operationalization of TQM across different contexts (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Spencer, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Sousa and Voss, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bou-Llusar et al. 2009)</ref>, non-participative assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Korunka et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Ng et al. 2015)</ref>, and a failure to consider soft dimensions of TQM use and diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Calvo-Mora et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Dubey and Gunasekaran, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Zeng et al. 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Fried (1995)</ref> further argues that the existing TQM literature has failed to discuss the inhibitive role of the legal environment on TQM adoption. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">King (1995)</ref> noted that resistance to change often leads to failure of TQM implementation. In a later study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Jones and Seraphim (2008)</ref> further argue that the literature on TQM implementation in an unfavourable environment is scant.</p><p>Hence, we may argue that despite of rich body of TQM literature, studies explaining the diffusion (post-adoption) of TQM are very hard to find with the notable exceptions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ahire and Ravichandran (2001)</ref>; and Osayawe <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Ehigie and McAndrew (2005)</ref>. This is unfortunate, as literature suggests that adoption and installation of any innovation are only initial steps toward organisational diffusion, and that full performance expectations cannot be realized until innovations are assimilated to some degree <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ahire and Ravichandran, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Hung, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Kiatcharoenpol et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hazen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">2014)</ref>. In fact writers have used interchangeable terms to describe the processes in play; for example, <ref type="bibr">Porter et al (2001)</ref> examine assimilation and define it following <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Tornatzky and Klein (1982)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cooper and Zmud (1990)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fichman and Kemerer (1997)</ref> in terms of diffusion and adoption. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ahire and Ravichandran (2001)</ref> proposed stages of adoption, adaptation, acceptance, and use, based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Kwon &amp; Zmud's (1987)</ref> 5-stage model of implementation beginning with initiation and adoption stages.</p><p>Our study addresses the gaps noted in previous studies (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ahire and Ravichandran, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Hung, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kennedy and Fiss, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Zeng et al. 2015)</ref>. We suggest that a firm's top management (internal human agents) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Hambrick, 2007)</ref> play a significant role in the diffusion of TQM via motivating three stages of post-adoption diffusion: acceptance (ACP), routinization (RO) and assimilation (ASM) which we derived from <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hazen et al (2012)</ref>. We point out that the definition of Adaptation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ahire &amp; Ravichandran (2001)</ref>, including the willingness of employees to participate, is similar to what <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hazen et al (2012)</ref> term Acceptance (ACP) as used in this study. The term Acceptance as used by Ahire and Ravichandran to denote the extent of teamwork, supplier involvement, etc., corresponds more closely to what we term Routinisation (RO). Our third measure, Assimilation, relates to the extent of TQM use and corresponds somewhat to Ahire and Ravichandran's Use measure. We submit that external institutional forces play an important role with respect to the acceptance, routinization and assimilation phases of TQM diffusion and this remains largely unexplored.</p><p>We draw on Institutional Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(DiMaggio and Powell, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Westphal et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Liang et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Nair and Prajogo, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kauppi, 2013)</ref> and Upper Echelon Theory <ref type="bibr">(Hambrick and Mason, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Hambrick, 2007)</ref> to inform this research. Institutional theory is used to discuss innovation adoption and diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Kennedy and Fiss, 2009)</ref>; for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Sila's (2007)</ref> research sought to explain TQM and its impact on performance using three institutional factors and two contingency factors. We chose institutional theory because it describes how organisations shape themselves to gain legitimacy from important stakeholders <ref type="bibr">(Sila, 2007, p.92)</ref>. This is due in part to regulations, procedures, and structures imposed on organisations by the regulatory bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(DiMaggio and Powell, 1983)</ref>.</p><p>However, previous studies do not consider how organisations are seeking to adopt and diffuse TQM in response to external pressures. Furthermore, institutional theory focuses on homogeneity and persistence, and not on the role of interest and agency in shaping action. To address this limitation, the role of intra-organisational dynamics needs to be included <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Greenwood and Hinings, 1996)</ref>; in this case, upper echelon theory can be useful.</p><p>Upper echelon theory suggests that executives' experiences, values and personalities greatly influence their interpretations of the situations they face and, in turn, affect their choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Hambrick, 2007</ref>). As will be described in Section 2, by combining institutional theory and upper echelon theory, this paper extends the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Westphal et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ahire and Ravichandran, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Sila, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">and Kennedy and Fiss, 2009)</ref>. We argue that top management commitment plays an intervening role with respect to how institutional pressures affect TQM diffusion in an organisation.</p><p>We address the following research question: how do institutional factors affect top management commitment to TQM diffusion across their organisation? Examining this question yields two primary contributions. First, this research provides unique insights into postadoption TQM diffusion via organisational theories (i.e. institutional theory and upper echelon theory). We suggest that increased levels of diffusion may be a function of a firm's desire to appear legitimate to powerful constituents, peer organisations, or stakeholders outside the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abrahamson, 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Abrahamson, , 1993;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kennedy and Fiss, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Second, we examine top management commitment as a potentially important mediator of the relationship between institutional pressures and diffusion of TQM. The integration of these theories and literature streams contributes to building theory with respect to the diffusion of management innovations such as TQM.</p><p>The remainder of the article is organized as follows. In the next section, we provide a brief background of the literature on TQM. Then, the theoretical framework and research hypotheses are developed and presented. Subsequent sections describe the constructs and their operationalization, outline the data collection and analysis methods, and present the findings.</p><p>We then discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of our findings, and end with limitations and future research directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Organizational theories and total quality management research</head><p>Literature suggests that organisational theories offer a holistic understanding of the diffusion of innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Damanpour, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Sila, 2007)</ref>. Organisational factors including functional differentiation, specialisation, administrative intensity, organisational size, organisational slack, and others are shown to affect adoption of administrative innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Damanpour, 1987)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Weber (2009)</ref> argues that organisational theories are those that address structural organisation and basic scientific fundamentals that serve to increase measures of management efficacy. Hence, if we consider TQM as an innovative means through which to improve structural and process elements within the firm, then organisational theories have the potential to inform TQM research. The use of organisational theories such as institutional theory and contingency theory may provide an explanation of the diffusion process of TQM. A list of the prominent organisational theories used in TQM research is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Westphal et al.

(2011)</ref>.</p><p>The RBV asserts that an organisation can achieve competitive advantage by creating bundles of strategic resources and/or capabilities <ref type="bibr">(Barney, 1991)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Powell (1995)</ref> argues using RBV logic that TQM is not readily imitable. Hence, TQM may provide competitive advantage to the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Kiatcharoenpol et al. 2010)</ref>. However, the RBV does not necessarily consider properties of resources and resource markets to explain enduring firm heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Oliver, 1997)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Ling-Yee (2007, p.360)</ref> argues that RBV suffers from context insensitivity; it is unable to identify the conditions under which the resources or capabilities may be most effective or valuable. Contingency theory suggests that organisations must adapt depending on the environmental conditions in which they exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Donaldson, 1999)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Duncan (1972)</ref> argues that successful organisations choose structures and process characteristics that "fit" the degree of uncertainty in their environment.</p><p>To address the somewhat static nature of the RBV, many scholars have proposed contingent RBV (CRBV). The CRBV may help to evaluate the extent to which different organisational resources or capabilities provide value <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Aragón -Correa and Sharma, 2003)</ref>, to further enhance the value of the theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brush and Artz, 1999)</ref>, and to identify different conditions which affect the utility of different resources or capabilities. Hence, contingencies have been identified as critical in the realisation of competitive advantage created by resources and capabilities, especially in relation to selection and deployment <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Sirmon and Hitt, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Contingency factors such as national context and culture, firm size, strategic context and other organisational variables have been considered within the TQM literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Sila, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Jayaram et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Zatzick et al. 2012)</ref>. However, the studies utilising RBV or CRBV for understanding innovative manufacturing practices or TQM diffusion do not typically capture the social context within which resource selections are embedded, i.e. firm traditions, network ties, or regulatory pressures <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Ketokivi and Schroeder, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>According to institutional theory, organisations shape themselves to increase their stakeholders' perceived legitimacy <ref type="bibr">(Sila, 2007, p.92)</ref>. This is due in part to regulations, procedures, and structures imposed on organisations by regulatory bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(DiMaggio and Powell, 1983)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Sila (2007)</ref> argues that organisations may be forced to change their structures due to governmental pressures, imitate the structures of other organisations because of competitive pressures, or conform to normative standards developed by accreditation bodies.</p><p>Because there is no certification for TQM, there are no specific official guidelines for implementation. Therefore, organisations implementing TQM are likely to imitate early adopters to improve the quality of products or services in response to competitive pressures <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Westphal, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Sila, 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Kostova and Roth (2002)</ref> suggest that the adoption of TQM practices by a multinational corporations' subsidiaries highlights the consideration of the broader institutional context as well as the more localized, relational context. Their study has important implications regarding alignment of practices, interests, agency and relational factors that increase levels of diffusion. For instance, organisations seek to adopt TQM in response to external pressures from stakeholders such as customers and shareholders. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that institutional pressures may influence the diffusion of TQM <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Westphal et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dacin et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Kostova and Roth, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kennedy and Fiss, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">King (1995)</ref> further argues that the TQM initiatives often fail, especially in cases where organisations are resistant to TQM change. However, <ref type="bibr">Dacin et al.'s (2002)</ref> critique of institutional theory suggests that the theory generally focuses on homogeneity and persistence, with less attention to the role of interest and agency in shaping action. To address these limitations, researchers have incorporated the role of intra-organisational dynamics within the institutional theory framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Greenwood and Hinings, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Delmas and Toffel, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Following this tradition, we employ not only institutional theory, but also upper echelon theory <ref type="bibr">(Hambrick and Mason, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Hambrick, 2007)</ref>. The central premise of upper echelon theory is that executives' experiences, values and personalities greatly influence their interpretations of the situations they face and in turn, affect their choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Hambrick, 2007)</ref>. Top management support and commitment constructs have been used to increase understanding of the nomological network describing relationships between institutional factors and diffusion factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Liang, et al., 2007)</ref>. We employ the Top Management Commitment construct (TMC) as the focal variable that enhances understanding of how and why TQM might diffuse within organizations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Westphal et al. (1997)</ref> observed that early adopters customize TQM practices for efficiency gains, while later adopters gain legitimacy from adopting the normative form of TQM programs. They suggest that institutional theory may offer a better understanding to explain the diffusion of a management innovation such as TQM. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Westphal et al. (1997)</ref> do not illustrate how organisations that are engaging in TQM respond to the external pressures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kennedy and Fiss (2009)</ref> discuss the diffusion of innovative practices using institutional theory following <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Tolbert and Zucker's (1983)</ref> two-stage model. They argue that both early and later adopters are affected by need for efficiency and legitimacy, which are generally complementary constructs. Early adoption is associated with opportunity framing and motivations to achieve gains, both economic and social, while later adoption is associated with threat framing and motivations to avoid losses, again in both economic and social terms.</p><p>Their study indicates that the conventional two-stage model of innovation adoptionearly adopters seeking efficiency and later adopters seeking legitimacyfails to account for the complementarities regarding social and economic motivations for adoption. Instead, we suggest that the economic and social factors in combination may drive diffusion as it changes the motivation for adoption from a potential opportunity for early adopters to a more certain threat for later ones. These adoption motivations are related to subsequent implementation patterns. In addition, research indicates that the substantive importance of social considerations may differ less between early and later adopters than previously assumed. Prior studies (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Westphal et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Sila, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kennedy and Fiss, 2009)</ref> have remained silent on how external pressures may influence TQM diffusion. In this research, we therefore extend previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Westphal et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Sila, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kennedy and Fiss, 2009)</ref> by examining TQM diffusion using institutional theory and upper echelon theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Model and hypotheses development</head><p>The theoretical model (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) comprises two primary elements: institutional pressures (of three types) and top management commitment (TMC). Consistent with the previous studies (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Liang et al. 2007)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Powell, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Liang et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Lo et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kauppi, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Zhao et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dubey et al. 2016)</ref>. DiMaggio and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Powell (1983)</ref> argue that the drive for legitimacy encourages organisations to embrace institutionalisation. This process of institutionalisation is termed 'institutional isomorphism' (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">DiMaggio and Powell, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Liang et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kauppi, 2013)</ref>. This literature suggests there are three mechanisms of institutional isomorphism. The first mechanism is coercive pressures, which refer to external pressures such as cultural expectations in the society, government regulations and policies, professional associations, and/or competitive necessity within the industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Liang et al. 2007)</ref>. In response to these  <ref type="bibr">(1983,p. 150)</ref> as "… the collective struggle of members of an occupation to define the conditions and methods of their work, to control the production of the future member professionals, and to establish a cognitive base and legitimisation for their occupational autonomy …" Scholars argue that a pool of almost interchangeable employees (and hence normative isomorphism) is created through formal education and professional networks (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">DiMaggio and Powell, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Liang et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kauppi, 2013)</ref>. The third mechanism is mimetic pressures, which refer to how organisations mimic actions of competitor organisations. These pressures can often be attributed to environmental uncertainty. For instance, organisations might develop mimetic isomorphism to give the appearance of being on par with or even ahead of competitors, even if they are not <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(DiMaggio and Powell, 1983)</ref>. Indeed, it follows that coercive, normative, and mimetic pressures will influence top management commitment to the diffusion of TQM. Institutional theory can offer a useful lens through which to examine TQM diffusion, and therefore provides the theoretical rationale for our first three hypotheses. Next, we provide additional literature support to further develop each of these hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coercive Pressures and Top Management Commitment</head><p>Coercive pressures (CP) have been shown to influence introduction of technological and managerial innovations (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Hart and Saunders, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Hu and Quan, 2006)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Guler et al. (2002)</ref> find that CP have positive influence on the diffusion of ISO 9000 quality systems.</p><p>It follows that CP might also play an important role in facilitating TQM diffusion. Literature on diffusion suggests that the role of CP can be highly contextual, and can take the form of myriad contextual factors such as those derived from relationships with suppliers, peer firms, rival firms ("trendsetters"), customers, state or local government regulatory norms, industry associations and competitive structures (see, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Abrahamson and Rosenkopf, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>This factor might also have indirect impacts on diffusion via intervening variables such as organisational culture, top management commitment, and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Abrahamson and Rosenkopf, 1993)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Liang et al. (2007)</ref> argue how the mediating effects of TMC play an important role in translating CP into levels of diffusion. Hence, following similar logic we hypothesize:</p><p>H1: Higher levels of coercive pressures are related to higher levels of top management commitment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Normative Pressures and Top Management Commitment</head><p>Normative pressure (NP) can stem from professional organizations, peer organizations, media outlets, and other channels that firms identify to benchmark business practices and outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Liang et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nair and Prajago, 2009)</ref>. To this end, <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Lee and Dawes (2005)</ref> argue that NP plays a significant role in ERP adoption in a developing economies context. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Dubey et al. (2016)</ref> found that NP plays a significant role in motivating sustainable consumption and production practices. It follows that the effect of NP on top management commitment and subsequent diffusion would also hold when considering practices similar in form and scope such as TQM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Ng et al. (2015)</ref> caution that firms should neither seek to implement TQM as per any specific set of guidelines, nor seek to implement TQM half-heartedly. Instead, firms should benchmark best performers and practices, and examine normative TQM profiles when driving their own TQM implementation. Hence, it follows that NP will have significant influence on top management commitment to TQM. Thus, we hypothesize:</p><p>H2: Higher levels of normative pressures are related to higher levels of top management commitment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mimetic Pressures and Top Management Commitment</head><p>As with the other mechanisms of institutional theory, mimetic pressures (MP) have also been used as an antecedent to the adoption and diffusion of technological and management innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Liang et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nair and Prajago, 2009)</ref>. Organisations tend to mimic other organisations that are peers or aspiring peers. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Liang et al., (2007)</ref> found that MP influence top management commitment to ERP systems, which then increases levels of diffusion of ERP. Scholars (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">DiMaggio and Powell, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Liang et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kauppi, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dubey et al. 2016</ref>) note how organisations mimic other organisations within their industry with respect to how they adopt and use technological, managerial, and production-related innovations and new practices. Although there is a lack of research investigating the influence of MP on top management commitment and diffusion of TQM specifically, both institutional theory as well as TQM literature suggest that these influences should also hold in the context of TQM. Thus, we hypothesize:</p><p>H3: Higher levels of mimetic pressures are related to higher levels of top management commitment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Top Management Commitment and TQM Diffusion</head><p>Institutional theory suggests how coercive, normative, and mimetic pressures can affect how top managers choose to support the diffusion of innovations. However, the nature and intensity of this commitment to diffusion of practices such as TQM can vary widely between organizations. To account for this additional variance and increase predictive power and clarity, we draw on upper echelon theory. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Liang et al. (2007)</ref> argue that human agents play a significant role in translating external pressures into desired managerial actions such as establishing policies or providing a conducive environment for the establishment and diffusion of new business practices.</p><p>Top management commitment might take the form of both top management belief and top management participation <ref type="bibr">(Liang et al., 2017)</ref>. With respect to this current research, top management belief refers to subjective assessments regarding the potential of TQM, while top management participation refers to the behaviour and actions performed to facilitate TQM diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ahire and Ravichandran, 2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Hambrick and Mason (1984)</ref> further argue that organisational choices reflect the top management's values and cognitive bases. Hence, the positive beliefs of top managers about the usefulness of TQM result in certain managerial actions intended for diffusion of TQM. For instance, from an information systems perspective, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Liang et al. (2007)</ref> argue that the beliefs of the top management can offer visions and guidelines to the managers and business units about the opportunities and risks in diffusion of ERP. Hence, we may argue that TMC may significantly influence the TQM diffusion. We conceptualize post-adoption diffusion following <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hazen et al. (2012)</ref> in three stages: Acceptance (ACP), Routinisation (RO) and Assimilation (ASM). ACP has attracted significant attention from management scholars (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Davis, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ahire and Ravichandran, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Venkatesh et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hazen et al. 2012)</ref>. ACP can be defined in the context of TQM as how well the organisation's constituents receive TQM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hazen et al. (2012)</ref> have argued that once organisational constituents have accepted an innovation such as TQM as a guiding philosophy, then the process of it being routinised within the organisation is initiated. Inspired by the definition of Zmud and Apple (1992), we define TQM routinization as the permanent adjustment of the organisations' governance systems to account for TQM. We then use TQM assimilation (ASM) to denote the extent to which TQM is used in the organisation. Drawing upon previous studies on institutional theory and innovation diffusion (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Jarvenpaa and Ives, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Purvis et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ahire and Ravichandran, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Liang et al. 2007)</ref> we argue that top management commitment may contribute to the ACP, RO, and ASM. Thus, we hypothesize:</p><p>H4: Higher levels of top management commitment are related to higher levels of ACP; H5: Higher levels of top management commitment are related to higher levels of RO; H6: Higher levels of top management commitment are related to higher levels of ASM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Control Variables</head><p>We have based our arguments following <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ahire and Ravichandran (2001)</ref>, that organisation size (OS) may have significant influence on the diffusion process. Hence, in this study, we use measures of OS as control variables. To measure OS, we draw on <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Liang et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Construct Operationalization and Measurement</head><p>Based on how the constructs were conceptualized in previous research, we consider all constructs as reflective.

To improve the validity and reliability of our constructs, we adopted two phases. In the first phase, multi-item constructs were adopted from prior studies. For instance, the measure of CP was adapted from previous studies (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Liang et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nair and Prajago, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Colwell and Joshi, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dubey et al. 2016)</ref> to fit the context of this research.

Various scholars argue that PLS is a preferred method for exploratory research in that the resulting parameter estimates are robust to artefacts that commonly arise from the employment of new or revised measures in new sample frames <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Henseler et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hair et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Peng and Lai, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Henseler et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Filho et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Leyer et al. 2017)</ref>. Indeed, the proposed relationships between constructs in this study are guided by complementary yet distinct theories that are rarely examined in aggregate in the literature. Given these reasons, we chose PLS as the most appropriate method for data analysis in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Peng and Lai, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Moshtari, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In conducting the model estimation, we followed two stages recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Peng and Lai (2012)</ref>, examining validity and reliability of the measurement model and analysing the structural model. Appendices 2 and 3 illustrate the list of steps and criteria within two stages of PLS application in the model with reflective constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Measurement Model</head><p>To assess the measurement model, we examined each construct's individual-item reliabilities, the convergent validity and discriminant validity of the measures associated with each construct. Appendix 2 provides an overview of the factor loadings (λ), scale construct reliability (SCR), and average variance extracted (AVE) of the reflective constructs. We found that the factor loadings were all greater than 0.5, the SCRs were calculated to be greater than 0.7, and the AVE for each construct was greater than 0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Peng and Lai, 2012)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Common Method Bias (CMB) and Endogeneity</head><p>Podsakoff and Organ (1986) suggest that when using single-source data, there is potential for CMB. To address CMB in our study, we followed the suggestion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Podsakoff et al. (2003)</ref> and performed Harman's one factor test to assess whether a single latent factor would account for all the theoretical constructs. The results from this test showed that the single factor explains 42.12 percent of total variance, demonstrating that CMB is not a significant threat. However, following guidance from a recent editorial note <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Guide and Ketokivi, 2015)</ref> we understand that</p><p>Harman's single factor test has its own limitations (c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Ketokivi and Schroeder, 2004)</ref>. Thus, to ensure that CMB is not a major concern, we further used a method variance (MV) marker to assess common method variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Lindell and Whitney, 2001)</ref>. Using this method, we chose the five-item scale that measured routinization, which provided the lowest positive correlation (r=0.05) between the MV marker and other variables, to adjust the construct correlations and statistical significance <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Lindell and Whitney, 2001)</ref>. None of the significant correlations became non-significant after adjustment. To even further assess CMB, we compared the fit between the one-factor model, the measurement model with only traits, and the measurement model with both traits and a method factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Dong et al. 2016)</ref>. The one-factor model yielded a chi-square (ϰ²=2001.83, p&lt;0.000), that was significantly worse than that of the measurement model with only traits. The chi-square of the measurement model with both traits and a method factor (ϰ²=386.94; p&lt;0.000) did not significantly improve that of the measurement model with only traits. Thus, we further conclude that CMB is not a serious threat to the validity of the findings.</p><p>Before testing the research hypotheses, we tested for endogeneity of the exogenous variable in our model. CP, NP and MP are conceptualized as exogenous model variables to the acceptance, routinization and assimilation but not the other way around, in accordance with the literature <ref type="bibr">(Ahire and Ravichandran, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hazen et al. 2012)</ref>. Thus, endogeneity is unlikely to be a concern in this context. We further tested empirically whether the endogeneity was an issue by conducting the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Davidson and MacKinnon, 1993)</ref>. We first regressed CP, NP and MP on all controls and TMC, then used the residual of the regression as an additional regressor in our hypothesized equations. The parameter estimate for the residual was not significant, indicating that the CP, NP and MP were not endogenous in our setting, consistent with its conceptualization.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>In this study, we investigated to what extent institutional pressures influence TQM diffusion through top management commitment. The empirical results highlight the institutional pressures (i.e. CP, NP and MP) and TMC as strong predictors of TQM diffusion. The data analysis suggests that CP, NP and MP have significant influence on the TMC to adopt TQM, especially MP (β=0.68; p&lt;0.01). Secondly, the effect size of the MP on TMC was found to be 0.399 which is considered high as per <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cohen's (1988)</ref> suggestions. This finding is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Westphal et al. (1997)</ref> who argue that the late adopters would try to imitate the early implementers. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Westphal et al. (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Sila (2007)</ref> remain silent on the other two pressures (coercive and normative).</p><p>We have examined the combined effect of CP, NP and MP under the mediating effect of TMC on the three stages of TQM diffusion (i.e. ACP, RO and ASM). The study findings provide an interesting insight that CP, NP and MP in combination explain 53 percent of total variation in the TMC for TQM adoption. TMC further explains 70 percent of total variation in the ACP, 65 percent of total variation in RO and 22 percent of the variation in ASM. Hence, we argue that TMC plays a significant role in the TQM diffusion, which is an important contribution to the literature.</p><p>In this research we illustrated the use of institutional theory and upper echelon theory to explain TQM diffusion; this is lacking from previous studies (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Westphal et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Sila, 2007 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kennedy and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Fiss, 2009)</ref>. Given the limitations of institutional theory, in this context, we further extended the TQM diffusion literature using a combination of institutional theory and upper echelon theory to improve the explanatory power of the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Theoretical contributions</head><p>The literature has focused on the diffusion processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Kennedy and Fiss, 2009)</ref>, imitation processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983</ref>) and trendsetters <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Abrahamson, 1996)</ref>. However, diffusion (post-implementation) processes have seen less attention. Our study addressed this gap using institutional theory and upper echelon theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ahire and Ravichandran, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Hung, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Zeng et al. 2015)</ref>. Our research adds to the literature discussing the motivations of adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Kennedy and Fiss, 2009</ref>) from a sociological perspective, emphasizing the social embeddedness of organisations and motivations that stem primarily from a desire to appear legitimate to powerful constituents, peer organisations, or outside stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abrahamson, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kennedy and Fiss, 2009)</ref>. We draw on the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Tolbert and Zucker (1983)</ref> and argue that early adopters seek technical gains from adoption, but later adopters are primarily interested in the social benefits of appearing legitimate without compromising on economic gains; in this way, extend the previous literature (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Ahire and Ravichandran, 2001)</ref>. The overall R² of our model is 0.525 in comparison to the R²=0.23</p><p>of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ahire and Ravichandran (2001)</ref>. Our model's higher R² could be attributed to our attempt to explain the TQM diffusion using integration of institutional and upper echelon theories.</p><p>Two key aspects of this study signify our contributions to the theory of TQM diffusion.</p><p>First is the focus on post-implementation diffusion in the context of TQM. Our findings extend the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Westphal et al. (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Sila (2007)</ref> from the adoption phase to the three-stage diffusion stage of TQM. Considering that TQM may be challenging to assimilate among various organisational elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Kennedy and Fiss, 2009)</ref>, our findings are particularly noteworthy. Our finding regarding the significant role played by the institutional forces may be interpreted as guiding the diffusion process, that is, the CP, NP and MP influence the behaviour of the top management and thus influence the TQM diffusion.</p><p>Second, this study integrates institutional forces, upper echelon theory, and the influence of top management on the diffusion process into one model and reconciles what had previously been presumed to independent in literature. In existing TQM literature, the top management commitment and three forces of the institutional influence are rarely examined (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Westphal et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Sila, 2007 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kennedy and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Fiss, 2009)</ref>. In this study, we illustrate that all three external forces impact TQM diffusion through their influence on the behaviour of the top management toward TQM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Managerial Implications</head><p>As our study is focused on the post-adoption phases of diffusion, top managers should understand the level of their involvement that will be required even after a successful adoption of TQM in their organisation. In other words, after the adoption decision has been made and the new managerial innovation begins to be employed, top managers must remain actively engaged until the innovation is fully diffused if the organization is to achieve the desired results.</p><p>Our study has several implications for TQM adoption. Firstly, our empirical findings demonstrate the mediating role of TMC between external pressures and three stages of the TQM diffusion and thus support the notion that the top managers and the organisation need to align their organisational strategies to exploit the external pressures in achieving desired success through TQM diffusion. If top management are not committed to meta-structuring activities, the diffusion is likely to suffer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Fried (1995)</ref> argues that the existing TQM literature has failed to discuss the inhibitive role of the legal environment on TQM adoption. However, contrary to this popular view held by several managers, we have observed that the CP under the mediating effect of TMC, has a significant and positive effect on ACP, RO and ASM. The findings of our study support <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">King's (1995)</ref> response to <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Fried's (1995)</ref> arguments. Hence, our results offer useful guidance to those managers who have often criticized the legal environment for the failure of TQM initiatives.</p><p>Secondly, our study results support the previous arguments (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ahire and Ravichandran, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Hung, 2007)</ref> on how both collaboration between a focal organisation and customers/suppliers and the influence of the external professional bodies shape the TMC. In turn the TMC has significant and positive effect on ACP, RO and ASM. Our findings partially support important literature (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ahire and Ravichandran, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cho et al. 2017</ref>). However, organisations especially in the emerging economies have failed to align their organisational strategies to the prevailing environment. In this regard our study results r support those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ahire and Ravichandran (2001)</ref>. We argue that the managers of an organisation which seeks to derive significant and positive benefits from TQM diffusion need to focus on their customers and suppliers, and must maintain good association with professional bodies to ensure that organisational practices are in line.</p><p>Thirdly, our study results highlight the significant and positive influence of the perceptions of the customers, suppliers and the industry on TMC which in turn has positive effect on the ACP, RO and ASM. Hence, managers and the organisation must together continuously engage with the customers, suppliers and industry to get regular inputs on their product and service quality, which in turn further helps establish a positive perception of the organisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion, limitations and future research directions</head><p>Drawing broadly on institutional theory, upper echelon theory and TQM diffusion literature,</p><p>we developed a theoretical model to explain TQM diffusion in an organisation. Our theoretical model reconciles two well established streams of literature (i.e. the influence of TMC on TQM diffusion and role of institutional pressures on TQM diffusion). The findings of our study make a useful contribution to the existing TQM diffusion literature and provide useful guidelines to the practitioners.</p><p>Although we designed and controlled the study to reduce risks to validity and reliability, it is important to emphasize research limitations that might affect the research findings.</p><p>Fortunately, most of these limitations can be addressed by future research in such a way as to further refine and confirm our results. Firstly, we used cross-sectional data to test our research hypotheses. A longitudinal study would further enhance our understanding by offering more information about how TQM ascends through stages of diffusion. Secondly, the current study adopts three stages of post-adoption diffusion: acceptance, routinization and assimilation.</p><p>Future research can employ longitudinal data to understand how acceptance leads to routinization and routinization leads to assimilation, as well as potentially other relationships amongst those three variables. Since our scales differ in some respects from those used by other researchers (notably Ahire and Ravichandran 2012) and many terms such as diffusion, acceptance and adoption are defined inconsistently in literature, we identify the innovation stages themselves as a topic for future research. Thirdly, we have not included incorporation as a construct as argued by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hazen et al. (2012)</ref> or not included employee involvement, empowerment and other soft dimensions of TQM. This is consistent with research extending the original diffusion model to include managerial innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Douglas et al., 2016</ref>) such as TQM. Fourthly, we collected data from a single informant from each firm. Most of the firms, especially medium or large scale, involve groups of senior managers who make decisions on strategic issues such as TQM adoption. Although most of the informants held senior positions, they were not all CEOs; thus, their individual perceptions of the organisation's TQM adoption might not accurately represent divergent opinions of others on the top management team.</p><p>Therefore, we suggest that future research should develop ways to obtain differing perspectives across management. Finally, the demographic of our sample may limit the generalizability of our results. To eliminate the noise caused by industry differences, we purposely chose manufacturing companies. To avoid interference caused by varying professional backgrounds, we chose informants who had similar training. Although these choices may enhance the internal validity of our study, the external validity might not be as robust. Thus, as with any research findings, the results from our statistical analyses should be interpreted with caution when informing other contexts. Yet again, this provides another opportunity for future research to extend, confirm, or refute our findings. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1: Proposed TQM Diffusion Model</figDesc></figure>

Volume of use: The extent to which your organisation has embraced TQM philosophy as guiding principles in every department (%) (ASM1). To enhance the validity of the chosen measures, we interviewed twelve managers who have ten or more years of experience with TQM and asked them to provide feedback on the questionnaire. To assess the clarity of the questionnaire items and their satisfactory adaptation to the context of this research, we asked the twelve managers to assess the questionnaire in the presence of the researchers so that they could provide direct feedback and corrections could be discussed and implemented in near real-time. Based on this procedure, we clarified the constructs and the associated measurement items. Consistent with the call for research in operations and supply chain management literature <ref type="bibr">(Flynn et al.1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Malhotra and Grover, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Fawcett et al. 2014)</ref>, such additional analysis provides a useful method to validate items borrowed from other studies. Secondary data were collected from annual reports for those organisations comprising our sample frame. This strategy has helped us: (i) overcome the limitations of the reported literature and in-depth interviews by improving the generalizability of the measurement scales; and (ii) reduce key informant bias and common method bias (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Roth, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chan et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The measures listed in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> were measured on a five-point Likert scale with anchors ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). With respect to the dependent variables (TQM acceptance, routinization, and assimilation), respondents were asked to indicate the volume of use (i.e. the extent to which organisation has embraced TQM philosophy as guiding principles in every department), diversity of use (i.e. number of functional areas in an organisation that are guided by TQM philosophy), and depth of use (for each functional area, the level at which the TQM philosophy guides operation and decision making).</p></div>

After the first wave of mailing, 185 questionnaires were received. At five weeks, we again sent packages to those who had not responded. 115 questionnaires were subsequently returned for an overall response rate of 27.3%. Altogether, 300 completed questionnaires were received (please refer to Appendix 1 for demographics). All the returned surveys had been filled out properly, and there were no issues that would require any of them to be removed from the analysis. We attribute the quality of the survey responses to the communication medium (mailed survey via post versus online-based survey) and the follow-up telephone calls.</p></div>
