Especially for environmentally sustainable manufacturing supply chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chiarini, 2014)</ref>, the incorporation of environmental goals into the extended supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Handfield et al., 2005)</ref> is a complex endeavor <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ansari and Kant, 2017)</ref> because life-cycle impacts of a product can be costly to eliminate and it is a problem contributed and shared by all members of a supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Seuring and Müller, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Since no firm would implement a strategy that generates no economic benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carroll, 1991)</ref>, it is important to understand how efforts of a focal firm in developing sustainable suppliers and customers can make the firm greener, leaner and profitable.</p><p>Through sustainable development of supply chains many firms wish to realize both costreduction and environmental benefits, stimulated by the 'lean-is-green' claim (King and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lenox, 2001)</ref>. Another desirable claim is 'green-is-profitable' <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Porter and van der Linde, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Rothenberg et al., 2001)</ref>. But, it is unclear how these claims can be achieved in a supply chain.</p><p>Past studies that examined performance effects of sustainable supply chain development (SSCD) strategies have produced mixed results (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hart and Ahuja, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zhu and Sarkis, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gonzalez-Benito and Gonzalez-Benito, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rao and Holt, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Zhu et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Thun and Müller, 2010)</ref>. Though some SSCD strategies are shown to positively related to environmental performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zhu and Sarkis, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Vachon and Klassen, 2008)</ref>, their effects on cost-saving and financial performance remain unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Pullman et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zhu and Sarkis, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Zhu et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Golicic and Smith, 2013)</ref>. Supply chain managers remain skeptical of the economic benefits of SSCD <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Preuss, 2005)</ref>. The meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Golicic and Smith (2013)</ref> highlights that only two out of ten empirical studies (20%) reported positive effects of SSCD practices on both 'accounting' (profitability related) and 'operational' performance outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Rao and Holt, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Zhu et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>This paper attempts to refine our understanding of the environmental, cost-reduction and financial performance impacts of three SSCD strategies, namely internal, supplier, and customer sustainable development. Based on resource orchestration theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sirmon et al., 2011)</ref>, we argue that different SSCD strategies can access and orchestrate different resources in a supply chain. Internal sustainable development emphasizes strategic and operational alignment within an organization such that internal resources (e.g., knowledge, skills, routines, information and technologies) are directed to integrate environmental goals into business strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Wong et al., 2015)</ref>. Suppliers and customer resources are external resources that can be orchestrated by the focal firm to address environmental issues through certification, monitoring, assistance, information exchange and cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Zhu and Sarkis, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Vachon and Klassen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sharfman et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Wong et al., 2015)</ref>. Supplier sustainable development involves procurement and sourcing of environmentally friendlier resources from upstream suppliers <ref type="bibr">(Zuo et al., 2009)</ref> while customer sustainable development involves changing customer buying behaviors through cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Vachon and Klassen, 2006)</ref>, integration of processes and information exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Wong et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>This paper presents a large-scale study to empirically examine the relationships amongst the three SSCD strategies and their abilities to make firms lean (cost reduction), green (environmental performance), and profitable (financial performance). Our resource orchestration theory argues that the internal, supplier, and customer resources vary but the three SSCD complement each other. Thus, while individually internal, supplier and customer SSCD might not be able to affect all the three performance outcomes (environmental, cost-reduction and financial), collectively the three strategies could make a firm lean, green, and profitable.</p><p>We tested this hypothesis by specifying a theoretical model that reveals the multiple path dependencies between SSCD strategies and performance through structural equation modeling (SEM) of survey data collected from 203 Thai manufacturers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Review</head><p>Sustainable development generally means economic development that is conducted without depletion of natural resources. Sustainable development from a supply chain strategy perspective represents a crucial view for understanding how human needs are fulfilled by a chain of economic activities that also creates sustainability issues related to society and depletion of the natural environmental. To achieve sustainable development in a supply chain, corporate strategies related to design, sourcing, production and logistics ought to consider environmental sustainability along the supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Handfield et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Shrivastava, 1995)</ref>. Some scholars argue sustainable supply chain issues can be managed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ansari and Kant, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Seuring and Müller, 2008)</ref>, others suggest an emphasis in development <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chiarini, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Tregidga and Milne, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Seuring and</ref><ref type="bibr">Müller (2008: 1700)</ref> define sustainable supply chain management as "the management of material, information and capital flows as well as cooperation among companies along the supply chain while taking goals from all three dimensions of sustainable development, i.e., economic, environmental and social, into account which are derived from customer and stakeholder requirements". An emphasis on development is equally important because of the needs to influence, support and develop suppliers and customers, and view them as a part of the solutions such that they can continue improve cost efficiency, working conditions and the natural environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Tregidga and Milne, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Elkington (1994)</ref> once argued sustainable development policies are required to transform firms, their customers and the environment to all become winners. A Delphi study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Seuring and Müller (2008)</ref> found that suppliers is one of the major issues, suggesting the need for supplier sustainable development through creating awareness, integrating, cooperating and communicating with suppliers.</p><p>The questions are, what types of sustainable supply chain development strategies (SSCD) can help make firms lean, green and profitable? And, what are the underlying processes in which SSCD simultaneously generate multiple performance outcomes? The meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Golicic and Smith (2013)</ref> suggest that there is no single SSCD strategy that positively affects environmental, cost-reduction and financial performance. In fact, the literature recognizes there are different direct and indirect paths in which SSCD may affect performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ambec and Lanoie (2008)</ref> argue it is possible for SSCD to directly improve environmental and financial performance through generating opportunities to reduce cost and generate revenue. While these direct effects are reflected in the theoretical model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Shi et al. (2012)</ref>, the cost associated with SSCD make it hard to justify its direct effects on financial performance, or the claim that green is also profitable <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Porter and van der Linde, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Rothenberg et al., 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Instead, <ref type="bibr">Klassen and McLaughlin (1996)</ref> argue firms first generate better environmental performance, and by doing so, they can gain cost-saving and positive market responses as two ways to improve financial performance. The theoretical model of De <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Giovanni and Vinzi (2012)</ref> attempted to reflect the effects of SSCD on environmental and financial (economic) performance but it does not explain the effects of cost reduction and distinguish the differences between supplier and customer sustainable development. Lean or cost-reduction has been recognized as an effective supply chain strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lamming, 1996)</ref> for firms relying on cost competitiveness. When greening the supply chains by reducing energy and material consumptions it is possible to also achieve cost saving (King and <ref type="bibr">Lenox, 2002)</ref>. There is therefore a need to gather more empirical evidence to verify the "lean-is-green" claim.</p><p>In short, the above two questions remain unanswered due to the lack of consistent empirical evidence. Moreover, the existing studies suffered from a lack of theory. While the natural resource-based view (N-RBV) has been used to explain the performance effects of environmental management practices and strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hart, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Shi et al., 2012)</ref>, this theory does not distinguish the different paths in which SSCD strategies generate performance. To address this issue, we offer a new theoretical perspective. On reflection, when it comes to the development of sustainable supply chains, we essentially develop resources, or the capabilities to reduce resource depletions of supply chain activities while coping with growth in demand in a profitable manner. Because such resources are dispersedly located within autonomous suppliers, customers and focal firms, they needed to be orchestrated into the right forms and right place <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Wong et al., 2015)</ref>. For example, some suppliers need financial and technical assistance. Some customers demand for more accurate information about environmental impacts. SSCD can therefore be viewed as a strategy to orchestrate supply chain resources, following the resource orchestration theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sirmon et al., 2011)</ref>. With the resource orchestration theory, we explain how SSCD make firms lean, green and profitable in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Model</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> depicts our research model. Aiming to refine two existing theoretical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(De Giovanni and Vinzi, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Shi et al., 2012)</ref>, we propose a comprehensive model linking sustainable supply chain development (SSCD) strategies with performance. This model helps create insights into the ways different SSCD strategies associate with one another (hypotheses H4-H6) and with three performance outcomes (H1-H3). Three performance outcomes (environmental, cost reduction, and financial) are included to test and refine the 'lean-is-green' and 'green-is-profitable' claims. The model allows us to test four path dependencies that might, ultimately, explain whether financial performance: (1) is directly created by SSCD strategies (H1c-H3c); (2) is achieved through cost reduction (being lean) created by SSCD (H1b-H3b &amp; H8); (3) is achieved through cost reduction (being lean) created by better environment performance (H9 &amp; H8); (4) is realized by generating revenues or profit margins owing to better environmental performance (H1a-H3a &amp; H7). &lt; &lt; Insert Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> here&gt; &gt; The theoretical model can be explained by resource orchestration theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sirmon et al., 2011)</ref> and natural resource-based view (N-RBV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hart, 1995)</ref>. The resource orchestration theory emphasizes actions that effectively structure, bundle, and leverage firm resources such as knowledge, skills, routines, finance, information and technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sirmon et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Liu et al., 2016)</ref>. Such resources include internal resources owned by a firm and external resources owned by suppliers, customers and stakeholders accessible by the firm. The N-RBV argues access to rare resources can lead to competitive performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hart, 1995)</ref>. Resource orchestration helps create a shared vision to achieve better performance across supply chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hart, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>SSCD strategies can generate multiple benefits only when supply chain members have identified, combined, and leveraged the necessary resources in an integrative and coordinated manner. Such orchestrations of supply chain resources are triggered and supported by efforts and routines that share information, assist, collaborate, and integrate environmental goals into supply chain activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Wong et al., 2015)</ref>. Integrated intra-and inter-organizational business processes help bundle and leverage resources across the supply chain through information exchange and cooperation for reducing environmental impact while reducing cost reduction and achieving financial performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses Development</head><p>Internal sustainable development focuses on the integration of environmental goals and responsibilities into business strategies, management systems, top management rewards, and attempts to balance commercial, societal, and environmental goals for achieving sustainable growth (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Montabon et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pagell and Wu, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gond et al., 2012)</ref>. Internal sustainable development is achieved through a single integrated management system <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Margerum and Born, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Montabon et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Tari and Molina-Azorin, 2010)</ref>, crossfunctional communication, coordination, and collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Zhu and Sarkis, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Montabon et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2012)</ref>. Such an integrated system <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Margerum and Born, 2000)</ref> enables an effective orchestration of resources. By addressing disparate views concerning environmental responsibilities and avoiding sub-optimization; it enables bundling and leveraging of resources across functions to reduce environmental impact while meeting commercial imperatives. When environmental goals are integrated into the business strategy and operations using a single system, staff from different functions may cooperate with a focus on orchestrating resources to jointly address problems related to cost, finance, and environment. Thus, we posit: H1: Internal sustainable development is positively associated with (a) environmental performance, (b) cost reduction, and (c) financial performance.</p><p>Supplier sustainable development includes the exchange of information concerning goals, responsibilities, strategies, benefits, best-practices, and performance standards related to environmental issues with suppliers using an integrated environmental information system <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Rao, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Seuring and Müller, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Solér et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lai and Wong, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Green et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kim and Rhee, 2012)</ref>. Supplier sustainable development enables twoway information exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Solér et al., 2010)</ref> to create mutual understanding of environmental responsibilities and strategies between buyers and suppliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Vachon and Klassen, 2006)</ref>. The integration of information management systems across different suppliers helps reduce the costs of information exchange and normalize performance measurements and standards. Such integrated information systems (e.g., Carbon Disclosure Project) allow buyers and suppliers to better understand the overall environmental burdens such that more meaningful goals can be set and joint efforts can be established.</p><p>Supplier sustainable development orchestrates assistance, resources, support, and guidance to suppliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Rao, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hu and Hsu, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kim and Rhee, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Wong et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Wong et al., 2013)</ref>. Suppliers that are less financially and technically capable can benefit from different forms of assistance from buyers. Supplier assistance helps suppliers achieve cost efficient through energy and resource savings <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grant et al., 2015)</ref>. Supplier sustainable development facilitates coordination, standardization, cooperation, and integration of closed-loop supply chain processes and related planning and performance measurement with suppliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kleindorfer et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Montabon et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sharfman et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Yen and Yen, 2012</ref>). An integrated closed-loop system allows the use of resources including waste and end-of-life products and reduces waste across the supply chain. This helps reduce cost and environmental damages while providing the basis for designing sustainable products that meet and even exceed customer needs, resulting in financial gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ambec and Lanoie, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, we posit: H2: Supplier sustainable development is positively associated with (a) environmental performance, (b) cost reduction, and (c) financial performance.</p><p>Customer sustainable development includes the exchange of information concerning environmental goals, practices and strategies and cleaner production technology, and product life-cycle impact with customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Vachon and Klassen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Darnall et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hazen et al., 2011)</ref> so that the supplier and customer begin to share mutual environmental responsibilities and achieve environmental goals collectively <ref type="bibr">(Vachon and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Klassen, 2006 &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr">2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2008a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lee et al., 2012)</ref>. Customer sustainable development represents suppliers proactively informing customers of newer and cleaner production technology and the environmental management strategies that help their customers to introduce environmentally friendlier products that may generate profits <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ambec and Lanoie, 2008)</ref>. By receiving more information about upstream environmental burdens customers can become more aware of the problems and, therefore, appreciate the efforts of such proactive suppliers, leading to better and longer supplier-customer relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dyer and Singh, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Customer sustainable development orchestrates customer resources by coordinating closedloop processes, logistics planning and green supply chain activities, sharing environmental impact information, solving environmental-related problems and making joint decisions concerning reducing environmental impact <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Wong et al., 2015)</ref>. An integrated closed-loop supply chain returns all end-of-life natural resources to the producers for recycling and reuse.</p><p>Xerox, for example, developed an integrated reverse logistics process for the entire supply chain to remanufacture, recycle and reuse components of photocopy machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grant et al., 2015)</ref>. Thanks to the integrated closed-loop approach Xerox manages to help customers save energy, ink, and paper while avoiding disposal burdens. This exemplifies how end-to-end supply chain resource orchestration can be achieved through cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Vachon and Klassen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sharfman et al., 2009)</ref>. Thus, we posit: H3: Customer sustainable development is positively associated with (a) environmental performance, (b) cost reduction, and (c) financial performance.</p><p>Past studies show effective internal environmental management makes it easier to implement external environmental management (De Giovanni and Vinzi, 2012). Thus, internal sustainable development is expected to form the basis of successful supplier and customer sustainable development <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Shi et al., 2012</ref>). An integrated management system that incorporates environmental criteria into business strategies and operations created by internal sustainable development enables a firm to cooperate effectively with suppliers and customers. Firms that have implemented internal sustainable development are more capable of collaborating with external parties to enable pollution prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Darnall et al., 2008)</ref>. With an integrated environmental management system Motorola could cooperate with suppliers and customers to successfully implement its Environmentally Preferred Products (EPPs) program <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grant et al., 2015)</ref>. Thus, internal sustainable development is expected to positively affect supplier and customer sustainable development. Furthermore, to proactively collaborate with customers there is a need for supplier sustainable development to address environmental problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Plambeck, 2012)</ref>. Supplier sustainable development enables a firm to more effectively respond to customers' calls for reducing environmental impact. We therefore posit: H4: Internal sustainable development is positively associated with supplier sustainable development.</p><p>H5: Internal sustainable development is positively associated with customer sustainable development.</p><p>H6: Supplier sustainable development is positively associated with customer sustainable development.</p><p>Resource orchestration of end-to-end supply chains fueled by internal, supplier, and customer sustainable development allows a firm to reduce cost (H1b-H3b) and environmental damages (H1a-H3a) as the basis for better profitability (H1c-H3c). According to the naturalresource-based view, a better environmental performance over competitors is instrumental to create a better reputation such that it is possible to ask for premium prices and set new rules in the industry to gain financial advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hart, 1995)</ref>. Thus, better environmental performance leads to financial advantages. Moreover, achieving extra cost savings over competitors creates a more competitive cost structure. Cost reduction because of SSCD creates better profit margins. Furthermore, additional cost is the main barrier when implementing pollution prevention and product stewardship <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Zhu and Sarkis, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hart, 1995)</ref>. Thus, we posit: H7: Environmental performance is positively associated with financial performance. H8: Cost reduction is positively associated with financial performance. H9: Environmental performance is positively associated with cost reduction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and Data Collection</head><p>Our samples are based on three major manufacturing industries in Thailand, namely the electronic, automotive, and food manufacturing industries. The supply chains of these three industries are well documented in previous research, and they have a clear mandate for supply chain implementation. These industries represent major manufacturing sectors in the country.</p><p>We drew a sample of 1,325 manufacturers from a mass survey. Follow-up telephone calls were made to the late responders at two-month intervals. Ultimately, we received 203 completed and useable responses, indicating a response rate of 15%. The sample represents automotive (54%), electronic (30%), and food industries (16%). Of the sample, 88.2% were environmentally certified. Most (50.2%) have more than 500 employees, 42.9% have 101-500 employees, and the remaining (6.9%) have less than 100 employees. Furthermore, 31.8% have more than US$50M annual sales.</p><p>The survey was mailed to senior executives who have knowledge of SSCD and environmental management of their firms. Each respondent was asked to complete the questionnaire from the perspective of their primary supply chain management, environmental management activities, and firm capability. The informants consisted of Chief Operations Officers (COOs) (25.6%), Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) (25.1%), functional managers related to environment management (25.6%), and operations, logistics, and supply chain management (23.9%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measure Development</head><p>We define sustainable supply chain development (SSCD) as a set of strategies that embed environmental criteria into management systems, functions, suppliers, customers, and wider stakeholders across a supply chain. SSCD comprises a set of ten practices (as first-order constructs) covering information exchange, assistance, collaboration, and integration of environmental management systems and business strategies and processes. Following the systematic literature review of <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Wong et al. (2015)</ref> we identified ten first-order constructs with 57 measurement items. These first-order constructs form three second-order constructs, namely internal, supplier and customer sustainable development. Internal sustainable development consists of three first-order constructs (i.e., integration of environmental goal into business strategy; integration of environmental strategy into management systems; cross-functional collaboration). Supplier sustainable development is composed of four first-order constructs (i.e., exchanging environmental information with suppliers; collaborating with suppliers; assisting suppliers; integrating process with suppliers). Customer sustainable development contains three first-order constructs (i.e., exchange of environmental information with customers; collaborating with customers; integrating process with customers) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Solér et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Wong, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Next, six industrial expert judges validated the scales using three rounds of Q-Sort method (Moore and <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Benbasat, 1991)</ref>. Three steps were taken <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Li et al., 2005)</ref>. First, we counted the number of items the judges agreed to place in a certain category inter-judge agreement scores and reached 87.3% inter-judge agreement, which is greater than the recommended 70% (Moore and <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Benbasat, 1991)</ref>. Second, we calculated the Cohen's Kappa coefficient (90.6%), which indicates a high proportion of joint judgement in which chance agreement is excluded <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cohen, 1960)</ref>. Third, following Moore and Benbasat's (1991) approach, we analyzed how many items were placed by the judges for each round within the target construct and reached an overall placement ratio of 92.0%. These results indicate a high level of reliability and construct validity for further questionnaire development. Finally, 49 items were selected as measurement items.</p><p>The measurement items for environmental, cost reduction and financial performance were adapted from the existing operations management literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boyer and Lewis, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Ward and Duray, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Swink et al., 2007)</ref>. As for the SSCD constructs, we consider these performance outcomes as reflective measures. They are based on respondents' perceptions because there were inadequate objective scores. Financial performance is measured in terms of the increase in return on investment, market share and profitability. Instead of measuring operating cost our interest is in the cost reduction (i.e., lean) of business transaction, energy, and waste disposal <ref type="bibr">(Zhu et al., 2008a)</ref> elicited from SSCD strategies. Environmental performance reflects the reduction in the use of natural resources, pollution, and emissions <ref type="bibr">(Zhu et al., 2008a)</ref>.</p><p>We conducted a pilot test with a panel of academics and practitioners in the fields of supply chain, operations, and environmental management to improve the wording of measurement scales. Finally, we established ten SSCD first-order constructs with 49 measurement items (Supplementary A). The items were translated into Thai by two bilingual Thai researchers. A back-translation process was applied to ensure conceptual equivalence. The respondents were asked to assess the extent to which their firms implement the SSCD strategies on a five-point Likert scale of 1 = "almost never" to 5 = "almost always." They were asked to assess improvement in cost-reduction, financial, and environmental performance in the past-two years relative to the industry's average as we are interested in competitive rather than absolute performance. It helps eliminate potential bias due to different views of actual performance.</p><p>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality was executed and found that the data is normally distributed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construct Validity and Reliability</head><p>Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using the varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization was used to detect the underlying dimensions of the measurement items <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kaiser, 1958)</ref>. The EFA helped detect if the measurement items were associated with their respective construct and were unidimensional. The EFA results confirm that all items load on their respective construct with loadings of greater than 0.5. This step enabled us to adopt the item-parceling technique to form composite constructs for hypotheses testing.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gerbing and Anderson (1988)</ref>, we performed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using the maximum likelihood estimation of AMOS 20.0 to test the psychometric properties of the first-order measurement scales. We had 203 respondents which met the adequate sample size (n &gt;200) for CFA analysis to achieve "a convergent and proper solution" <ref type="bibr">(Anderson and Gerbing 1984, pp. 170-171)</ref>. We assessed the unidimensionality of the constructs by using Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability. Supplementary A shows that all constructs have Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability higher than the 0.70 threshold, suggesting adequate measurement scales reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Nunnally, 1984)</ref>. The CFA results show that the comparative fit index (CFI), incremental fit index (IFI), and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) are well above the recommended threshold of 0.90 and the root mean square residual (RMR) is below the recommended threshold of 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hu and Bentler, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the means and standard deviation of our constructs, and the correlations among them. The average variance extracted (AVE) of each construct exceeds the recommended value of 0.50; A high level of AVE indicates convergent validity, meaning our measurement scales measure mainly their respective constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref>.</p><p>We also tested the discriminant validity of the first-order constructs. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows discriminant validity among the constructs is achieved because the square-root AVEs of all constructs are greater than the correlation between any pairing. That means measurement scales that are not supposed to be related are not related.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>&lt; &lt; Insert Table 1 here&gt; &gt;</head><p>Common Method Variance and Non-Response Bias Non-response bias was evaluated in two ways. First, early responses were compared with late response (Armstrong and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Overton, 1977)</ref>. Although this method does not investigate nonresponse directly, a comparison was made between early and late responses. The 2 difference test results indicate no significant difference in any criterion with significant levels below 0.1. Second, another 2 test was applied to check for any significant difference between respondents and non-respondents. We contacted non-respondents and asked them to return the questionnaires; they were considered as non-respondents. The results also indicate no significant difference between the respondents and non-respondents. Therefore, non-response bias was not a major issue.</p><p>We took two steps to reduce common method variance. We first conducted the Harman's one-factor test that is widely followed by the extant operations management literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Craighead et al., 2011)</ref>. We examined the 2 difference between a single latent factor and the hypothesized construct model. A significant 2 difference at p &lt; 0.05 of the two models indicates that the fit of the single-factor model is significantly worse than the hypothesized model. These ex-post 'test results' do not mean there is no common method variance; instead, some ex ante measures are adopted <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Guide and Ketokivi, 2015)</ref>. Thus, in the design of the questionnaire, we separated the variables into sections to overcome the shortcomings of common method bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Item Parceling</head><p>Since our data-item ratio is small, we used a parceling-item technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bandalos, 2002)</ref> which is found to be useful as it will result in identical deattenuated structural coefficient estimates if the items are unidimensional <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Sass and Smith 2006)</ref>. The Cronbach's alpha of each construct is greater than 0.50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Pedazur and Schmelkin 1991)</ref> suggesting we have unidimensional constructs. We followed <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kishton and Widaman's (1994)</ref> technique of averaging the measurement items corresponding to each construct. We had a total of 49 items of SSCD, 15 items for internal sustainable development (three dimensions), 20 items for supplier sustainable development (four dimensions) and 14 items for customer sustainable development (three dimensions). We parceled the items at the first-order levels, resulting in ten item-parceled latent variables, resulting in a 9:1 data-item ratio, which is above the recommended ratio of 5:1 (Kline</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2005).</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical Results</head><p>To test the hypotheses, we created a structural model following the theoretical framework. The results show that the model has a good fit with the data ( 2 = 605.69, df = 275; RMR = .08; IFI = .91; CFI = .91; RMSEA = .08). The results for each hypothesis are as follow. Internal and customer sustainable development are positively associated with environmental performance (H1a) and costreduction performance (H3b), respectively. The other sub-hypotheses, H1-H3, are rejected.</p><p>Interestingly, the results support the positive relationships between internal and supplier sustainable development (H4), internal and customer sustainable development (H5), and supplier and customer sustainable development (H6). Even though supplier sustainable development does not directly affect performance, it enables customer sustainable development to reduce cost. In addition, the results provide no support for the positive link between environmental and finance performance (H7) but there is full support for the costreduction-financial performance relationship (H8) and environmental-cost-reduction relationship (H9).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>&lt; &lt; Insert Figure 2 here&gt; &gt;</head><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, two interesting path dependencies emerge. The first path relies heavily on customer sustainable development to reduce cost and subsequently improve financial performance. This path is supported by internal and supplier sustainable development.</p><p>The second path does not involve supplier and customer sustainable development. Internal sustainable development improves environmental performance and, in turn, reduces cost and financial performance. Ultimately, cost reduction is the major route towards better financial performance. Cost reduction is partly contributed by lowering environmental damages ( = 0.53 at p&lt;0.001) and implementing customer sustainable development ( = 0.36 and p&lt;0.001), supported by internal and customer sustainable development. The non-significant environmental-financial performance path suggests that the environmental performance generated by SSCD strategies (and other unobserved factors) was not able to generate new revenues or higher profit margins. In short, although none of the second-order SSCD can individually and directly explain all three performances, they can positively affect all of them in a collective manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and Implications</head><p>This paper provides four major areas of novelty and theoretical contributions. First, this paper extends the theoretical models of De Giovanni and Vinzi (2012) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Shi et al. (2012)</ref> by adding cost reduction as another performance measure of SSCD and distinguishing the difference between supplier and customer sustainable development. This provides crucial evidence concerning the paths by which SSCD generates financial performance. By comparing four possible paths SSCD generate financial performance, we expose mechanisms new to the sustainable supply chain literature that explain how the three SSCD strategies ultimately improve financial performance through cost reduction. The results indicate it is still not possible for a single SSCD strategy internal, supplier, or customer sustainable development) to directly affect all three performance outcomes (i.e., environment, cost, and finance). This new findings supplement the findings of a recent meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Golicic and Smith, 2013)</ref>. Internal, supplier, and customer sustainable development are unable to directly affect financial performance because they are more oriented to reduce cost and environmental damages, rather than generating products and services that lead to new revenues, better profit margins, or market share <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ambec and Lanoie, 2008)</ref>. Moreover, internal and supplier sustainable development could not directly lead to cost saving possibly due to the high cost of implementing such practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Zhu and Sarkis, 2004)</ref>. Nevertheless, there are, possibly, some time-lag effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hart and Ahuja, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Second, we reveal two effective path dependences to explain the mechanisms by which SSCD strategies ultimately generate better financial performance. Through orchestrating internal resources (internal sustainable development) and suppliers' resources (supplier sustainable development) and efforts to integrate environmental management with customers (customer sustainable development), it is possible to collectively become leaner in transactions, materials, waste, and energy, subsequently leading to better financial positions (SSCDleanprofit). This path dependency depends on efforts to develop customers through collaboration, closed-loop process integration and bi-directional information exchange with customers. Moreover, the implementation of an integrated business strategy and environmental management system while enabling cross-function collaboration (internal sustainable development) helps reduce environmental damage while saving costs as the indirect means to increase profitability (Internal sustainable developmentgreenleanprofit). The results show that these two paths are effective, and the fact that internal sustainable development is equally important. That means, in addition to integrating sustainable development strategies with suppliers and customers, thereby eventually realizing cost saving, internal sustainable development is also the basis for reducing environmental damage (through supplier and customer sustainable development).</p><p>These two crucial path dependencies are revealed because we added cost-reduction into the theoretical model as a dependent variable. Otherwise, we could conclude that sustainable development and environmental performance are not able to affect financial performance. Our model that incorporated cost-reduction represents a novel contribution, even though the effects of SSCD on cost has previously been studied; past studies show that there are no significant effects of environmental management initiatives on cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Christmann, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Zhu et al., 2005)</ref> and they frequently produce no financial gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Golicic and Smith, 2013)</ref>. These past findings might discourage scholars and managers to consider cost saving as a crucial motivation for investment in sustainable development. With our newer evidence and more comprehensive theoretical model, we show that cost reduction is the only path through which SSCD generated financial performance. This informs future studies on SSCD to incorporate cost reduction to fully understand the ways SSCD generate performance. Third, our results reinforce the resource orchestration argument <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sirmon et al., 2011)</ref> and introduce a new perspective to the SSCD literature. While past sustainable supply chain studies use a relational <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dyer and Singh, 1998)</ref> or natural-resource-based view to explain the mechanisms where SSCD strategies affect performance, this paper shows that, essentially, the attempts to integrate suppliers, customers, and internal functions by creating a management system are meant to identify, bundle, and leverage all the resources and knowledge required to make the supply chain lean, green, and profitable. This paper unveils how the 'lean-is-green' and 'green-is-profitable' argument popularized by King and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lenox (2001)</ref> and Porter and van der Linde (1995) can be made possible if members of a supply chain successfully orchestrate their resources by implementing all three SSCD strategies. Our results explain a single SSCD strategy cannot generate multiple performance outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Golicic and Smith, 2013)</ref> because of the resources they have access to and orchestrate are different and inadequate. An integrative approach to SSCD, supported by a unified management system spanning from suppliers to customers across internal functions from strategic to tactical levels, is required to orchestrate all the necessary resources from the entire supply chain. This requires capacity to orchestrate natural resources, human resources, knowledge, and other physical resources for achieving a balanced set of environmental, societal, and economic goals. This new insight can only be revealed using our theoretical model.</p><p>Fourth, this paper informs business strategy literature that it is possible to implement sustainable supply chain strategies to become lean, green and profitable but there is a need for an integrative approach, recognizing the facts that different sustainable supply chain strategies can access to and orchestrate different types of resources. Upstream suppliers require assistance and rich information about technical solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Vachon and Klassen, 2006)</ref> because they do not have all the technical and financial resources. Therefore, sustainable supply chain strategies cannot focus only on internal sustainable development as suggested by some scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Handfield et al., 2005)</ref>. By doing so, then only suppliers are readier to cooperate <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Vachon and Klassen, 2006)</ref>. Moreover, our results suggest internal and sustainable supplier development is inadequate because sustainable customer development is the key to cost-saving that led to financial gain. The end goal of a firm's strategy is financial gain, and our results indicate that financial performance comes from cost-saving, and better environmental performance did contribute to cost reduction. That means corporate environmental or sustainable supply chain strategies that integrate cost and resource efficiency efforts are more effective in making a firm lean, green and profitable.</p><p>In addition, there are some practical implications. The study shows the need for integrating all three SSCD strategies to effectively create 'lean-green-profitable' competitive outcomes.</p><p>Manufacturers need to develop an integrated management system that ties all internal functions and top management with external suppliers and customers at strategic, operations, and process levels to enable effective collaboration and orchestration of resources. Otherwise, there will remain sub-optimization behavior owing to lack of integration. Also, managers need to understand where performance occurs and which SSCD strategies to begin with. Our results suggest that the improvement of manufacturers' environmental performance originates mostly from internal sustainable development. Internal sustainable development is also the basis for developing capacity to integrate with suppliers and customers. Internal sustainable development may eventually lead to some cost saving but it is important to integrate with suppliers and customers to achieve sustainable cost saving and, subsequently, better financial performance. Customer sustainable development is particularly pivotal. It often drives upstream members to consider cost saving activities that benefit customers. It may also help to create greener products that add margins or create new markets and, hence, contribute to financial performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ambec and Lanoie, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and Future Research</head><p>This paper empirically verifies the performance impact of three supply chain sustainable development (SSCD) strategies. We introduce resource orchestration theory to conceptualize SSCD, bringing a new perspective to the sustainable supply chain strategy literature. By dividing the SSCD construct into three dimensions (i.e., internal, supplier, and customer sustainable development), this paper distinguishes their influences on environmental, cost reduction and financial performance but, collectively, they lead to 'lean-green-profitable' competitiveness. The new insight we create, here, is the need for integrated management systems that drive top management, internal functions, suppliers, and customers to orchestrate the required resources to achieve aligned and balanced environmental, cost, and financial goals.</p><p>Our empirical analyses show that only when all three dimensions of SSCD are successfully orchestrated firms can improve environmental performance while reducing cost and improving financial performance.</p><p>As with other survey-based research, this paper has some limitations. Single industry studies such as firms in the automotive industry, food industry, textile industry, and electronic industry in Thailand can be separately studied as they represent those industries in which the environmental pressures are at different levels. Also, comparisons of studies in emerging and developed countries can be used in a cross-national synthesis of studies that examine sustainable supply chain issues in those contexts. Further theoretical and applied research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of SSCD that supply chains take as they move toward more sustainable approaches. Our study shows that the three SSCD dimensions must co-exist, suggesting that there may be some complementarity, mediation, or moderating effects.</p><p>Future studies of other countries and industries are also needed on how and why the evolution of SSCD varies in different countries and industries. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 2 summarizes the results of our structural equation model; where significant paths are represented by straight arrows and insignificant paths as arrows with dotted lines.
