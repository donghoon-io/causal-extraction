<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A fair amount studies has been carried out on mobile banking adoption but limited number of studies focused on perceived interactivity. In reality, literatures on the key motivations of the intention to use mobile banking are no common standard of measurement. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate the factors influencing the Malaysian consumers' intention to use mobile banking services. This research fills the gap by integrating technology acceptance model with perceived risk, perceived cost and perceived interactivity aspects are incorporated. This study's foremost ambition is to analyze empirically the Malaysian consumers' intention to use mobile banking services via structural equation modeling approach. The findings indicated usefulness, perceived cost, perceived interactivity, perceived risk, relative advantage and easefulness are significant determinants of consumers' attitude towards using mobile banking which effects the consumers' intention to use mobile banking. A critique of the destiny of mobile banking concludes this paper.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Mobile banking is an imminent technology that will illuminate the peoples' lifestyle across the world. Interestingly, mobile banking is defined in various approaches. However, these various definitions have a common rendition that mobile banking is a system that allows customers of a financial institution to conduct a number of financial transactions through a mobile device such as a mobile phone or tablet, as elucidated in Wikipedia. In relation to that, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Drexelius and Herzig (2001)</ref> instituted mobile banking as the ability to conduct bank transactions via a mobile device. Basically, is about conducting financial transactions by the means of a mobile terminal. Analogously, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barnes and Corbitt (2003)</ref>, posits that mobile banking is a channel in which the customer interacts with a bank via mobile device such as a mobile phone or personal digital assistant. Despite the fact of various researchers' interpretation of mobile banking, in short, mobile banking is about doing monetary undertakings using a mobile phone or tablet.</p><p>Innovative mobile applications are developed in connection with the development of mobile banking. In Malaysia, Maybank was the first financial institution to introduce a free banking application, M2UMap, on the iPhone <ref type="bibr">(Maybank2u, 2009)</ref>. Homogeneously, CIMB Bank Berhad infused CIMB Clicks which became the most popular and widely used banking app in Malaysia. Accordingly, almost all the banks in Malaysia such as Al Rajhi Banking and Investment Corporation (Malaysia) Berhad, AmBank (M) Berhad, Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad, Bank Simpanan Nasional, CIMB Bank Berhad, Citibank Berhad, Hong Leong Bank Berhad, Malayan Banking Berhad, OCBC Bank (Malaysia) Berhad, Public Bank Berhad, RHB Bank Berhad, and Standard Chartered Bank Malaysia Berhad offers mobile banking services <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Masrek et al., 2012)</ref>. Later in 2014, Maybank launched Maybank2u App which was a huge success with more than one million downloads. In 2015, Maybank launched another App known as Quick Balance which accommodates customers who purely want to check balances <ref type="bibr">(Thestar.com.my, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Numerous researchers have studied the technology adoption but not many studies are carried out on the consumers' perceived interactivity and intention to use mobile banking within the Malaysian perspective. Mobile banking in Malaysia is still in its infancy stages and unpopular to Malaysians that leads to underutilization of this feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Amin et al., 2007)</ref>. This is consistent with the findings of Bank Negara Malaysia in 2015 that reported that there are 7,278.8 million subscribers of mobile banking services' in Malaysia while Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission reported that Malaysia's mobile phone penetration rate is as high as 143.8% in the Q4 2015.</p><p>Comparing the mobile banking services' subscribers to the mobile phone penetration rate, the former is relatively low. Reciprocally, the transaction volume via mobile banking per capita is comparatively low with other payments methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bank Negara Malaysia, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The main objective of the study is to determine the factors that influence the consumers' intention to use mobile banking services. Additionally, the relationship between usefulness, easefulness, relative advantage, perceived interactivity, perceived cost and perceived risk with the attitude towards using mobile banking services elements are to be discovered. Moreover, the relationships between attitude towards using mobile banking services and intention to use mobile banking are to be explored.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)</head><p>TAM was proposed by Fred Davis that champions that external stimulus comprises actual system's features and capabilities govern the users' motivation to use the system which predicts the usage of the system. He further inculcated that users' motivation of actual usage were regulated by three factors that were perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and attitude towards using a system which was mediated by users' behavioral intention. Perceived usefulness was the degree to which a person believed that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance while perceived ease of use was explained as the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Davis et al., 1989)</ref>.</p><p>In 2007, Amin analyzed the mobile credit card usage intentions in Sabah, Malaysia which uncovered that perceived ease of use has a significant effect on the perceived usefulness of mobile credit card. On other hand, both these variables effects the customers' usage intentions of mobile credit card. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gu et al. (2009)</ref> investigated users' behavioral intention to mobile banking in Korea. The result shows that perceived usefulness and perceived ease-of-use influences behavioral intention in mobile banking significantly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Selamat et al. (2009)</ref> examined the determinant factors and acceptance of information technology in the Malaysian banking industry which found that that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use influences bankers' acceptance of new technology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Riquelme and Rios (2010)</ref> investigated the moderating effect of gender in the adoption of mobile banking in Singapore and found that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness has a significant influence on the intention to adopt mobile banking. Consistently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Yousafzai and Yani-de-Soriano (2012)</ref> found that intention to use internet banking significantly predicts its actual use. The results also revealed that perceived usefulness significantly influences the intention to use internet banking. Besides that, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Moorthy et al. (2014)</ref> revealed that perceived use of use and perceived usefulness influences the academic's e-filing adoption intention in their study of e-filing behaviour among academics in Perak state in Malaysia.</p><p>In addition, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness has great impact on users' intention to adopt mobile self-service technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Yang et al., 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Xiao et al. (2014)</ref> found that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness influences attitude towards use while perceived ease of use effects significantly perceived usefulness in relation to continuing the reception of existing e-book reading in northern Taiwan. Moreover, <ref type="bibr">Özbek et al. (2015)</ref> found that both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness displayed significant effect on behavioral intention to use online booking among Russian tourists visiting Antalya, Turkey. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jafari et al. (2016)</ref> examined the factors influencing the mobile advertising acceptance in Mashhad, Iran that revealed that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness significantly impacts consumers' attitude towards mobile advertising. Simultaneously, intention to accept mobile advertising is significantly influenced by consumers' attitude towards advertisement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Püschel et al. (2010)</ref> investigated the adoption intention of mobile banking technology in Brazil which revealed that relative advantage and compatibility are the most important factors that influence the consumer to adopt mobile banking. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Arvidsson (2014)</ref> found that relative advantage as a significant predictor of consumers' attitudes to adopt the mobile payment services in Sweden. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amaro and Duarte (2015)</ref> examined the determinants of intentions to purchase travel online among internet users that revealed that relative advantage influences the attitudes towards online travel shopping significantly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Li (2013)</ref> found that perceived risk affects attitude toward using the internet banking. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hsieh (2015)</ref> examined the physicians' acceptance of electronic medical records exchange system in Taiwan that revealed that perceived risk is a significant predictor of physicians' intention to use an electronic medical records exchange system. On the other hand, physicians' attitudes toward using the system influence their intention to use it. Furthermore, both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the exchange system correlates significantly with the physicians' attitude toward using it. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cruz et al. (2010)</ref> found that perceived cost is a significant barrier on the Brazilian's adoption intention of mobile banking services. The behavioral intention to use the internet banking is effected by the perceived financial cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Tung et al., 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Amberg et al. (2015)</ref> investigated the user acceptance for web based aptitude tests among university students in Germany and found that perceived costs induces the users' acceptance of web based aptitude tests. Additionally, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use influences users' acceptance of web based aptitude tests too. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wu (1999)</ref> examined the perceived interactivity and attitude toward web sites among university students which found a positive significant influence of perceived interactivity on the attitude toward web sites. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Teo et al. (2003)</ref> investigated the effects of interactivity level on web user's attitude towards commercial web site among undergraduate students of National University of Singapore which found interactivity on a web site exhibited positive effects on user's attitude towards a web site.</p></div>

On the whole, all the hypothesized paths in relation to   direct relationships between the variables of the research model has P &lt; 0.05, hence, the significance of the related hypotheses is corroborated <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hair et al., 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONCLUSION</head><p>This study has revealed that higher the perceived usefulness and easefulness of mobile banking, consumers' attitude towards using mobile banking becomes higher. The result is further justified with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fu et al., 2012)</ref> which found that the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use has significant effect on attitude. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wu et al. (2015)</ref> consumers' attitude is significantly affected by perceived usefulness and perceived ease. In this study, it is also proven that relative advantage is the vital factor that inspires more people to use mobile banking. Accordingly, the result is justified with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Püschel et al., 2010)</ref> which found that relative advantage as a significant predictor of consumers' adoption intention of mobile banking technology. Moreover, in this study, it is established that consumers' attitude towards using mobile banking is significantly affected by their perceived cost. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kuo and Yen, 2009)</ref> found that perceived cost had a significantly negative effect on attitude. Allegedly, in this study, perceived risk exhibited significant negative relationship with consumers' attitude towards using mobile banking. Moreover, the result is vindicated with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lagzian and Naderi, 2015)</ref> which found that perceived risk exhibited significant negative relationship on customers' acceptance intention of e-invoice. In relation to perceived interactivity, consumers' attitude towards using mobile banking is significantly influenced by perceived interactivity. This is warranted with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wu (1999)</ref> which found perceived interactivity has a significant influence on the attitude. Hence, H 1 , H 2 , H 3 , H 4 , H 5 , H 6 and H 7 are supported by the data.</p><p>This research meets the requirements of mobile banking backdrop. Furthermore, it is an addition to the scanty number of literatures in the mobile banking subject. It also pervades the gaps of previous studies. From the findings of this far-reaching structural equation modelling approach, mobile banking service providers and mobile banking app developers will have to recognize the eminences of knowing and understanding consumer behaviour. In addition, both these mobile banking service providers and mobile banking app developers can utilize these findings of this research as a reference to improve their market share. This can be done by stages with the concept of personalisation of services to the consumers. Apart from that, marketing strategies can be coined to suit to consumers' attitude and behavioural intentions. Therefore, the findings of this research could be used banks, mobile banking service providers and mobile banking app developers in their marketing game plan.</p><p>Fundamentally, it will be an instrumental to a country's economic growth. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Research framework of factor influencing the consumers' perceived interactivity of mobile banking usage</figDesc><graphic coords="3,315.60,490.90,256.08,171.84" type="bitmap" /></figure>
