<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Scholars and practitioners have recognized the importance of positive employee attitude on several positive outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Reynolds and Lewis, 2018)</ref> including, well-being, commitment toward the organization, and work performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Avey et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Çetin and Basim, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Culbertson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Shahnawaz and Jafri, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Simons and Buitendach, 2013)</ref>. Psychological capital (PsyCap) captures and explains this positive attitude. It has been argued that individuals high in PsyCap are psychologically capable and are hopeful, efficacious, resilient, and optimistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Luthans and Youssef, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ngoma and Dithan Ntale, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Xu et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Although extant literature suggests that PsyCap does have a positive impact on employee attitudes such as their affective commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akhter et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rego et al., 2012)</ref>, research on how this relationship occurs is scarce. This study will fill this void by arguing and examining that the PsyCap and affective commitment relationship is in fact complex and worthy of dedicated analysis. Indeed, scholars in the past have suggest that affective well-being is the extent to which individuals have the positive versus negative experiences over a specific period of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Diener et al., 1985)</ref> could have a pivotal role in explaining the relationship between PsyCap and affective commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(McMurray et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>This study covers employees working in the diverse industries in Portugal. The last financial crisis faced by the Portuguese employees have generated a lot of sadness and have created widespread outlook and may have caused a decline in positive employee attitudes and behaviors.</p><p>Many workers have experienced reduced wages and benefits during that period. In adverse context, only an employee who is positive, hopeful, confident, resilient, and optimistic can remain affectively committed. PsyCap is one of the personal resources that keep employees emotionally committed to the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Luthans et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The concept of psychological capital was developed by Luthans and his colleagues on the basis of positive organizational scholarship, positive psychology, and positive organizational behavior literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cameron et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wright, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>It captures psychological capacities of individuals that are measurable, developable, and performance oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Luthans and Youssef, 2004)</ref>. They have identified four resources that form the PsyCap construct including self-efficacy, hope, optimism and resilience. In that, self-efficacy refers to the belief in oneself about accomplishing a particular task of achieving a particular goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Stajkovic and Luthans, 1998)</ref>, hope refers to 'willpower' which is one's determination to achieve a goal and 'waypower' which is one's ability to keep alternate paths ready to overcome obstacles in the path of achieving goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Snyder, 2002)</ref>, optimism refers to the extent to which the individuals are persistent and pervasive <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Carver and Scheier, 2002)</ref>, and resilience refers to individuals' ability to manipulate their surroundings successfully to guard against adversities <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Rutter, 1987)</ref> which was later-on modified as an ability to 'bounce-back' from adverse conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Luthans, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>A large body of literature has recently examined the relationships among PsyCap, employee attitudes, and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anglin et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carmona-Halty et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Heled et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Luthans and Youssef-Morgan, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Malik and Dhar, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Newman et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ngoma and Dithan Ntale, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Nielsen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Nolzen, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Pitichat et al, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Selvaraj and Bhat, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Thyrian et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Xu et al., 2017)</ref>. PsyCap comprises of the components that have been identified as precursors to employee attitudes and behaviors, yet research relating to the extent to which PsyCap affects both affective well-being and affective commitment is sparse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Newman et al. (2014)</ref> summarized the "agenda for future research" including "mediating mechanisms underlying the psychological capital/outcomes relationship" and the purpose of this study is precisely to examine the mediating role of Affective Well-Being in the relationship between PsyCap and Affective Commitment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical Framework and Hypotheses Development</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">PsyCap and Affective Commitment</head><p>Affective commitment refers to an alignment felt by the employees between their (1) personal value systems and desires and (2) organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Mellor et al., 2001)</ref>. More specifically, it is the extent to which employees are emotionally attached to and involved in their organization <ref type="bibr">(Çetin, 2011)</ref>. The relationship between PsyCap and affective commitment can be better understood with the help of conservation of resource theory. According to this theory, individuals want to protect, replenish and invest in resources that are valuable to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hobfoll, 1989)</ref>. Thus, if employees are psychologically capable, which means high in the four resources including hope, self-efficacy, resilience, and optimism, they would be emotionally attached with the organization as their organization is providing them necessary support for maintaining, replenishing, and investing their personal resources.</p><p>A growing body of research to date indicates that PsyCap has been found to have a positive effect on various job outcomes such as organizational commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Avey et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Larson and Luthans, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">McMurray et al., 2010)</ref>. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wu and Chen (2018)</ref> linked the collective PsyCap with organizational commitment and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Idris and Manganaro (2017)</ref> tested the relationships between PsyCap, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Karatepe and Karadas (2015)</ref> examined the joint impacts of self-efficacy, hope, optimism and resilience as the indicators of PsyCap on satisfaction outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Liao et al. (2017)</ref> found that PsyCap enhances job satisfaction which, in turn, has been correlated with organizational commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Mathieu and Zajac, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Pratt, 1998)</ref>. Scholars have also found PsyCap to be strongly correlated with affective commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Miao and Bozionelos, 2017)</ref>. H1: Self-efficacy, hope, optimism and resilience (i.e., PsyCap) have a positive influence on affective commitment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">PsyCap and Affective Well-being</head><p>Scholars in the past have conceptualized the relationship between PsyCap and well-being based on the conservation of resource (COR) theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hobfoll, 1989)</ref>. PsyCap is a personal resource that tends to positively affect happiness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Luthans et al. (2013)</ref> have proposed that the positive core construct of PsyCap, consisting of the positive psychological resources of hope, efficacy, resiliency, and optimism can be extended into the well-being domain. Other studies have found that optimism has a positive influence on well-being <ref type="bibr">(Scheier and Carver, 1992)</ref> and life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Seligman, 2002)</ref>. Since optimistic individuals have superior coping mechanism to handle adversity, they often experience greater happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Scheier and Carver, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Park, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>In COR, it has been argued that efficacious individuals serve as a cognitive resource. Since such individuals are confident about what they do, they are less affected by self-doubt, setbacks, and other negative events and are likely to report greater happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bandura and Locke, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Another component of PsyCap, hope, has to do with persevering and re-directing paths to achieve a goal because of which individuals are not stressed as they have another path available when they find one path not working out for them. The lower levels of stress due to hope help them garner happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kato and Snyder, 2005)</ref>. Similarly those who are resilient, have the capacity to bounce back from failures because of which they take failures as a challenge, achieve their goals by overcoming hurdles, and become happy <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Maddi, 1987)</ref>.</p><p>Once individuals conserve positive energy, they are able to increase their personal resources that are the components of PsyCap <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Malinowski and Lim, 2015)</ref>. The conceptual explanation can be given using the Broaden-and-Build theory of positive emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fredrickson, 2004)</ref>. According to this theory, "positive emotions (e.g., joy, interest, and contentment) broaden an individual's momentary thought-action repertoire, which in turn can build that individual's enduring personal resources, resources that also served the ancestral function of promoting survival" <ref type="bibr">(Fredrickson, 2000, p. 1)</ref>. Using the Broaden-and-Build theory, the authors of this paper thus predict that the individuals would broaden their efficacy, hope, optimism, and resilience resources to have greater positive emotions in terms of affective well-being. Most of the research is limited to the hedonic component of well-being in relation to PsyCap. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Luthans et al. (2007)</ref> found a positive impact of PsyCap on job satisfaction. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Avey et al. (2010)</ref> found that PsyCap has a positive impact on workers' beliefs. However, the emotional or affective component of well-being still needs to be explored as a consequence of PsyCap. H2: H1: Self-efficacy, hope, optimism and resilience (i.e., PsyCap) have a positive influence on affective well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Affective Well-being and Affective Commitment</head><p>Affective commitment is an affect-based bond with the organization and may be defined as "identification with, involvement in, and emotional attachment to the organization" <ref type="bibr">(Allen and Meyer, 1996, p. 253)</ref>. Individuals, who feel that they are emotionally well taken care of by the organization, are likely to develop an emotional bond with their organization. In other words, if employees feel happy at work, they are likely to improve positive attitudes toward the organization, such as affective commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fisher, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lilius et al., 2008)</ref>. Therefore, affective well-being at work may predict this attitude called affective commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Weiss and Cropanzano, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Researchers have found that employees who have frequent experiences of positive emotions at work tend to develop an affective attachment with the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fisher, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fredrickson, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fredrickson, , 2003;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lilius et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Rego et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Weiss and Cropanzano, 1996)</ref>. Reapplying the Fredrickson broaden-and-build model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fredrickson, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fredrickson, , 2003))</ref>, positive emotions probably lead employees to experience work as meaningful, thus assuming work as a 'mission' rather than as a 'job', which in turn makes them more affectively committed to their organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gavin and Mason, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Wright and Cropanzano, 2004)</ref>. A recent empirical study found a positive relation between employee's affective well-being and their affective commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Semedo et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, the following hypothesis can be stated: H3: Affective well-being has a positive influence on affective commitment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Mediating Role of Affective Well-being</head><p>PsyCap emphasizes the potential value of employees assessing situations in more positive, opportunistic, and adaptive ways, thus increasing their well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Avey et al., 2010)</ref>. Thus, PsyCap can promote well-being assessments. PsyCap is expected to lead to wellbeing and the cognitive mechanism takes place through PsyCap's positive evaluation of situations <ref type="bibr">(Luthans et al., 2007)</ref>. The affective mechanism takes place through the positive states produced by PsyCap, which can be important in the expansion of one's thought-action repertoires and building resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Fredrickson, 2009)</ref>. The core construct of PsyCap is fundamentally cognitive in nature;</p><p>employees' PsyCap reinforces the potential value of evaluating the workplace in more positive ways, and it improves employees' well-being and, subsequently, the affective bond with their organization.</p><p>PsyCap has been positively associated with job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Luthans et al., 2007)</ref> and wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Avey et al., 2010)</ref>. More specifically, Optimism has been related with mental well-being <ref type="bibr">(Scheier and Carver, 1992)</ref> and life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Seligman, 2002)</ref>. Hope is likely a resource that influences subjective well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kato and Snyder, 2005)</ref>. And resiliency predicts job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Larson and Luthans, 2006)</ref> and happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Youssef and Luthans, 2007)</ref>. In turn, affective wellbeing makes employees more affectively attached to their organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Semedo et al., 2019)</ref> and more committed to improving organizational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Wright and Cropanzano, 2004)</ref>. Therefore, it is believed that if PsyCap influences employees' affective well-being and the latter influences affective commitment, then affective well-being likely mediates the relationship between PsyCap and affective commitment.</p><p>H4: Affective well-being mediates the relationship between the four dimensions of PsyCap (selfefficacy, hope, optimism and resilience) and affective commitment.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> presents the hypothesized structural model.</p><p>---Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> ---</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Procedure and Sample</head><p>To test the research hypotheses, a self-report survey was administered to Portuguese employees based on Google Docs-survey. The survey was sent via e-mail and social media to individuals working in different organizations in Portugal. Information on research goals, the confidentiality of the data collected, and respondents' anonymity was provided in the questionnaire. Several instructions explicitly stating that the questions had no right or wrong answers and that the respondents should answer the questions as honestly as possible were also included in the questionnaire. Other instructions were provided regarding how to complete the questionnaire to reduce possible errors.</p><p>The final sample included 226 employees from various organizations, of which 63.3% were females, 45.1% had between 18 and 30 years old and 30.1% between 31 and 40 years old.</p><p>Regarding level of education, 44.7% had a higher education degree and 21.2% are post-graduated.</p><p>Regarding job tenure, 57.3% of the respondents had been employed in their organization from 1 to 5 years, 19% from 5 to 10 years, 6.6% from 10 to 15 years, and 16.8% more than 15 years.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">PsyCap (predictive variable)</head><p>PsyCap was evaluated on a 24-item scale of the PsyCap Questionnaire (PCQ) used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Malik and Dhar (2017)</ref> and developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Luthans et al. (2007)</ref>, specifically for organizational context.</p><p>The translation of these items into Portuguese followed the standard procedures for translations of research instruments <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brislin and Berry, 1986)</ref>. The PCQ measures four dimensions: 1) Self-efficacy (e.g., "I feel confident representing my work area in meetings with management"; α = .86) 2) Hope (e.g., "Right now I see myself as being pretty successful at work"; α = .79)</p><p>3) Resilience (e.g., "When I have a setback at work, I do not have trouble recovering from it, moving on"; α = .82) 4) Optimism (e.g., "I always look at the bright side of things regarding my job"; α = .80) Using a 5-point Likert response scale (1 = "Strongly disagree"; 5 = "Strongly agree"), employees were asked to indicate to what extent they agree with each statement presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Affective commitment (criterion variable)</head><p>The study measures affective commitment through 3 items proposed and validated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Rego et al. (2011)</ref>. Sample items included: "I am proud to tell others that I am part of this organization" and "I feel like «part of the family» at my organization". Using a 5-point Likert response scale (1 = "Strongly disagree"; 5 = "Strongly agree"), employees were asked to indicate to what extent they agree with each statement presented. Cronbach's alpha was .91.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Affective well-being (mediator variable)</head><p>Affective well-being was measured using 15 items adapted from Daniels' (2000) research and later validated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rego et al. (2010)</ref> in the Portuguese context. Participants were invited to think about their feelings (e.g., "anxious", "happy", "motivated") over the last three months in the organization, and to respond on a five-point scale ranging from never (1) to always (5). Cronbach's alpha was .76. Some items of the original measures unconsidered as they showed dubious positioning concerning the foreseen dimensions in this study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data Analysis</head><p>The data collected were analysed first checking for internal consistency by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficients. A construct with a Cronbach's alpha value of more than 0.70 was considered reliable. Next, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to know whether the constructs are sufficiently associated with each other or not. Next, SEM analysis was done to test the proposed hypotheses, notably, the mediational hypothesis. We have done so, in order to model structural relationships and yielding overall fit indices, while estimating mediational effects (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hu and Bentler, 1999)</ref>. We have also applied bootstrapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Efron, 1992)</ref> (at n=1000 units) as it permits a re-sample distribution by calculating "the statistic of interest in multiple re-samples of the data set, and by sampling n units with replacement from the original sample of n units" <ref type="bibr">(Preacher, et al., 2007, p.190)</ref>. We have also performed the Harman Test for assuring that the data do not account for significant amount of common method bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. Descriptive statistics and variable correlations of all items are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>

This may indicate that, when employees are efficacious, i.e., believe in oneself about accomplishing a particular task of achieving a particular goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Stajkovic and Luthans, 1998)</ref>, resilient, i.e., when employees manipulate their surroundings successfully to guard against adversities <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Rutter, 1987)</ref>, and optimistic, i.e., they are persistent and pervasive <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Carver and Scheier, 2002)</ref>,their affective bond is not comparatively greater. In turn, when employees have the ability to keep alternate paths ready to overcome obstacles in the path of achieving goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Snyder, 2002)</ref>, i.e., hopeful, they develop more affective commitment.</p><p>The current study's results indicate that PsyCap has a positive influence on employees' affective well-being. This is, for instance, consistent with prior research on hope that have demonstrated a link between hope and subjective well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kato and Snyder, 2005)</ref>. For example, lower levels of stress due to hope help employees garner happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kato and Snyder, 2005)</ref>. The possible reason could be that employees high on PsyCap have more resources to improve their well-being.</p><p>The present findings also reveal that affective well-being was found to be impacting affective commitment significantly which is also in line with past researches that have found that employees who have frequent experiences of positive emotions at work tend to develop an affective attachment with the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lilius et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Rego et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Semedo et al., 2019)</ref>. When employees feel happy at work, is probable that they develop positive attitudes toward the organization namely better affective organizational commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lilius et al., 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gavin and Mason (2004)</ref> suggested that happiness at work may lead employees to experience work as meaningful, thus assuming work as a mission rather than as a "job", which in turn makes them more affectively attached to their organizations.</p><p>Finally, the results demonstrate that affective well-being partially mediates the relationship between hope and affective commitment. Therefore, hopeful employees develop more affective well-being which, in turn, promotes their attachment with the organization.</p><p>Based on the COR theory, this study proposed that PsyCap promotes affective commitment through affective well-being. Even though prior research suggests that PsyCap does have a positive impact on employee's attitudes such as their affective commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akhter, Ghayas, and Adil, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rego et al., 2012)</ref>, research on how this relationship occurs is scarce. This study fills this gap by arguing and examining that the PsyCap and affective commitment relationship is mediated by affective well-being. The present study has also a significant contribution to the positive psychology field by testing a model of the relationships among PsyCap, employee affective wellbeing, and affective commitment, which have not yet examined within the organizational behavior literature. Thus, the current study adds to the existing theory and research on these topics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Managerial Implications</head><p>The findings of the present study suggest that organizations interested in developing their employees' well-being and affective commitment would be well-advised to target employee PsyCap. PsyCap has been supported as a state-like resource that is open to development through brief human resource development interventions, with significant impact on performance <ref type="bibr">(Luthans et al., 2008a</ref><ref type="bibr">(Luthans et al., , b, 2010))</ref>. Previous research has shown that interventions can develop PsyCap (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Luthans et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Luthans et al., 2008)</ref>. According to several scholars <ref type="bibr">(Luthans et al., 2008c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Luthans et al., 2010)</ref>, PsyCap can be developed through relatively short (two hours or so) onlinebased or face-to-face intervention training. Such training demonstrates to be useful because it increases employees' psychological capacities by 1.5 to 3 per cent <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Youssef and Luthans, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, organizations should develop interventions and other training methods to develop and strengthen the employees' PsyCap. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Badran and Youssef-Morgan (2015)</ref>, managers need to pay special attention to training, organizational development, job redesign, participation of employees in both goal setting and action plans, and creating an organizational culture that is more conducive to enhancing PsyCap. Moreover, rigorous selection process should be utilised to hire those candidates who are high on self-efficacy, hope, optimism and resilience. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Karatepe and Karadas (2015)</ref> suggested that managers can use the PsyCap questionnaire developed by <ref type="bibr">Luthans et al. (2007a)</ref> during and after the selection process. The significant relationship with affective well-being and affective commitment supported in this study, further highlights the importance of developing employees' PsyCap.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Limitations and Directions for Future Research</head><p>The present study has some limitations that indicate further research is needed to understand better the effects of PsyCap on employees' outcomes. One limitation is convenience sampling and although this study had a large sample size, it did not involve any probabilistic sampling which restrict the results' generalizability. In addition, the correlational and cross-sectional research design does not allow firm conclusions to be drawn about the causal nexus between the study's variables. Future research needs to examine possible causal relationships using longitudinal studies. Finally, the present study involves the single-source nature of our data that promotes potential inflated relationships. However, given that PsyCap, affective well-being and affective commitment are subjective in nature, they are arguably best evaluated by self-report. Thus, rather than attempting multisource ratings, future studies may be longitudinal research designs over several time points. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Spector (2006)</ref> has provided empirical evidence suggesting common method variance does not significantly inflate correlations. Moreover, the Harman's single factor test was administered for assuring that the data does not account for significant amount of common method bias.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>--The starting analysis of our study's results and hypothesis have revealed that the four dimensions of PsyCap have indeed a positive influence on affective commitment (PsyCap SE -Affective Commitment: r.=,37 / p ≤.05; PsyCap HO -Affective Commitment: r.= ,54 / p ≤.05; PsyCap RE -Affective Commitment: r.= ,41 / p ≤.05; PsyCap OT -Affective Commitment: r.= ,45 / p ≤.05). These results allow validation of our first hypothesis. Our results have also showed that PsyCap has a positive influence on affective well-being (PsyCap SEwell-being: r.=,35 / p ≤.05; PsyCap HOwell-being: r.=,53 / p ≤.05; PsyCap REwell-being: r.=,41 / p ≤.05; PsyCap OTwell-being: r.=,45 / p ≤.05). These results allow the validation of our second hypothesis. As for our third hypothesis, our results have showed that it is also supported (Well-being -Affective Commitment: r.=,56 / p ≤.05).</figDesc></figure>
