Whereas quality is only indirectly related to loyalty via perceived value and satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson &amp; Srinivasan, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ribbink et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boshoff, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cristobal et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Marimon et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lin, 2010)</ref>, recovery has a direct relationship with loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(McCollough et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Parasuraman, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lin, 2010)</ref>. The question that then arises for electronic commerce (ecommerce) is the extent to which loyalty depends on electronic quality (e-quality) and the extent to which it depends on electronic service recovery (e-recovery). In other words, is e-quality or erecovery the more important when an e-commerce company is designing its loyalty strategy?</p><p>To measure service quality and service recovery in the context of e-commerce, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Parasuraman et al. (2005)</ref> have proposed two scales: 'E-S-QUAL' to assess e-quality and 'E-RecS-QUAL' to assess e-recovery. Although some authors have applied these instruments in a variety of settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kim et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boshoff, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akinci et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fuentes-Blasco et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Marimon et al., 2010)</ref>, these scales have received relatively little research attention compared with that accorded to the well-known 'SERVQUAL' instrument <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Parasuraman et al., 1988)</ref>, which, in many ways, can be considered an antecedent of the two more recent e-commerce scales.</p><p>Despite their relative lack of research attention, these two e-service scales have enabled researchers to examine the relationships that exist between e-quality and various other constructs-such as perceived value, satisfaction, and loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Srinivasan et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sigala &amp; Sakellaridis, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huang, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fuentes-Blasco et al., 2010)</ref>. These relationships are important in all services, but they are especially significant in the case of e-services because the cost (to the customer) of changing his or her provider is low and the change is as easy as a 'click' <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fuentes-Blasco et al., 2010)</ref>. One can argue that switching online banking provider is not as easier as in e-tailing, given that e-banking may be tight to traditional accounts and switching requires at least setting up a new account, closing the earlier account. It incorporates setting up balances transfer, wage payments and initiating new automatic payments and direct debit to replace those operating at the old bank. However, in the past few years online banks competitors have started to actively promote switching provider as part of their "free" services. They often claimed that switching banks is easier today than it use to be, since they have made the process as simple and as easy as possible. This view is supported from the extant of literature. E.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sherry (2002)</ref> argued that in the 70´s customers were at the mercy of the bank and that changing banks was effectively impossible due to the penalties that existed; whereas she claimed that today it simply takes a phone call to switch. In the same vein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Trout (2006)</ref> in his study found that 70% of respondents expected changing banks would be a hassle, but nearly 90% of switchers found it easier than expected. Obviously, competing in such condition is as thorny as in an online shopping setting.</p><p>As a consequence, several authors have emphasised the importance of enhancing loyalty among internet consumers. Likewise, it is self-evident that an understanding of the antecedents of eloyalty is likely to enhance business performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Petnji et al., 2011)</ref> Against this background, the purposes of this study are twofold. The first is to propose scales to measure e-quality and e-recovery in the context of the Spanish e-banking sector. The second is to assess the impact of e-quality and e-recovery on e-loyalty.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. After this introduction, the second section presents a review of the relevant literature. In the third section, the methodology of the empirical study is described. The results are presented in the fourth section (validation of the scales to assess e-quality and e-recovery; and analysis of the impacts of e-quality and e-recovery on loyalty). The conclusions and managerial implications are presented in the final section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Measuring e-quality</head><p>Unlike the service quality literature, the number of studies on electronic service quality is still at its preliminary phase both from theoretical and empirical perspectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akinci et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Literally electronic service quality is a new concept and the way is conceptualized varies greatly. E.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Santos (2003)</ref> defines service quality in e-commerce as "the consumers´ overall evaluation and judgement of the excellence and quality of service offerings in the virtual market place". This definition is in a somewhat circular way <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kim at al., 2006)</ref> and do not capture all the aspects of the purchasing process <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Parasuraman et al., 2005)</ref>. Nevertheless, this study adopted <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Zeithaml et al., 2002)</ref> definition as it captures all the aspects of purchasing process (from pre-sale to the postsale) and is a relevant conceptualisation in our context. Since the meaning of service in the definition is comprehensive and includes prior technical aspects (e.g. secure electronic transaction symbols, search engines and one click order placement) and aspects subsequent to the website service (e.g. delivery period, exchanges, and refund) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Parasuraman et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fuentes-Blasco et al., 2010)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Zeithaml et al. (2002)</ref>, e-service quality is defined "as the extent to which a web site facilitates efficient and effective shopping, purchasing and delivery of product and services" Bearing in mind the natural differentiation between e-banking and e-retailers and drawing on <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Zeithaml et al. (2002)</ref>, this study defined e-SQ in an online banking setting as the extent to which a web site facilitates efficient and effective online operation/transaction and delivery of product and services.</p><p>Additionally, to deliver superior service quality, managers of companies with web presences must first understand how consumers perceived and evaluate online customer service quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Parasuraman et al., 2005)</ref>. Previous study provide important framework and research instruments. A variety of scales utilising various dimensions of quality have been suggested for measuring service quality in the context of electronic commerce. Many of these have focused on the quality of the website itself. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chen and Wells (1999)</ref> developed a measure of website quality, which consisted of three dimensions (entertainment, informativeness, and organisation). In a similar vein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Yoo and Donthu (2001)</ref> developed an instrument called 'SITEQUAL', which had four dimensions (ease of use, aesthetic design, processing speed, and security). Subsequently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Loiacono et al. (2002)</ref> used interviews with consumers and website designers to develop 'WebQual', which consisted of 12 dimensions of online service quality (informational fit-to-task, interactivity, trust, response time, ease of understanding, intuitive operations, visual appeal, innovativeness, flow/emotional appeal, consistent image, online completeness, and better than alternative channels). Coincidentally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barnes and Vidgen (2002)</ref> also developed a scale of website quality with the same name: 'WebQual'.</p><p>Apart from these measures of website quality, other authors, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Zeithaml et al. (2000)</ref>, have proposed a more comprehensive conception of e-service quality in terms of evaluation of the whole service encounter-including both the transaction and the post-transaction process. Some years later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Parasuraman et al. (2005)</ref> acted on this wider view of e-service quality in publishing the 'E-S-QUAL' instrument for assessing e-services. The E-S-QUAL scale contains 22 items gathered in four dimensions: (i) 'efficiency' (the ease and speed of accessing and using the site); (ii) 'fulfilment' (the extent to which the site's promises about order delivery and item availability are fulfilled); (iii) 'system availability' (the correct technical functioning of the site); and (iv) 'privacy' (the degree to which the site is safe and protects customer information). This scale was, in many ways, an adaptation (for the e-commerce context) of the well-known 'SERVQUAL' scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Parasuraman et al., 1988)</ref>, which had been developed two decades previously for measuring general service quality. As a pioneering instrument for measuring service quality, SERVQUAL has been successfully adapted for use in a wide variety of services sectors and contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ladhari, 2009)</ref>. For example, in the banking industry, which is the field of interest to the present study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kumar et al. (2010)</ref> recently used the SERVQUAL instrument to assess the quality of service provided by both Islamic and conventional banks in Malaysia.</p><p>The E-S-QUAL scale itself has been adapted to a variety of e-commerce settings. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boshoff (2007)</ref>, who investigated the relationship between e-quality and loyalty, proposed that the instrument should have six dimensions, rather than the four of the original instrument. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Marimon et al. (2010)</ref>, who applied the instrument to an analysis of the relationship between purchasing and loyalty in the context of an e-supermarket, expanded <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boshoff's (2007)</ref> model by adding a new construct. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Meng (2010)</ref> applied the scale in an African American cultural setting and a Chinese cultural setting. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fuentes-Blasco et al. (2010)</ref> also made an interesting contribution when they adapted items from the E-S-QUAL scale to assess service quality in an e-bank. Their study confirmed <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Parasuraman and Grewal's (2000)</ref> theoretical 'consequence chain'-that e-service quality impacts on perceived value, and that perceived value then has a positive effect on e-loyalty. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akinci et al. (2010)</ref> also utilised the E-S-QUAL scale in assessing the e-service quality offered by 13 banks in Turkey. Their study provided a refined and more stable version of the scale for use in Internet banks.</p><p>Before the publication of the E-S-QUAL scale by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Parasuraman et al. (2005)</ref>, other authors had proposed scales designed specifically for assessing quality in the particular setting of e-bank services. For example, <ref type="bibr">Zhilin et al. (2004)</ref> proposed a five-dimensional measurement instrument (reliability, responsiveness, competence, ease of use, product portfolio, and security), whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Osman et al. (2005)</ref> proposed a different five-dimensional scale adapted to the Cyprus e-banking market (service environment, interaction quality, reliability, empathy, and technology).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Relationship between e-quality and e-loyalty</head><p>Loyalty has been conceptualised and defined in various ways. The extant of literature indicates there are two trains of though dominating the conceptualization of customers´ loyalty.</p><p>One approach regards loyalty in behavioural terms. Drawing on that, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Srinivasan et al. (2002)</ref> defined e-loyalty as a "customer's favorable attitude toward the e-retailer that results in repeat buying behavior". Whereas, the other approach argues that effective feelings are important to the conceptualization of loyalty concept. According to this view, loyalty involves attitudes, psychological involvement, notions of favouritism, and a sense of goodwill towards a particular product or service <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kim et al., 2006)</ref>. Taken together, it would seem that is best understood by considering both behavioural and attitudinal loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Petnji et al., 2011)</ref>. Subsequently, based on the previous arguments and given the difficulties related to the acquisition of customers in online banking, this study adopts both concepts.</p><p>Several studies have confirmed that there is a direct relationship between service quality and loyalty in the context of e-commerce. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sigala and Sakellaridis (2004)</ref> concluded that e-quality is a vital antecedent of both online purchases and e-loyalty. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huang (2008)</ref>, who undertook a literature review of the subject, contended that there is a consensus among scholars that e-quality is a prerequisite of loyalty. More recently, Fuentes-Blasco et al. ( <ref type="formula">2010</ref>) also undertook a review of the literature on the relationship between e-quality and e-loyalty. Their conclusion was that superior e-service quality leads to enhanced customer satisfaction and retention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Measuring e-service recovery</head><p>The term 'service recovery' refers to "…. the actions taken by a service provider to address a customer complaint regarding a perceived service failure" <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Grönroos, 1988)</ref>. These actions are designed to resolve problems, alter negative attitudes of dissatisfied customers and to ultimately retain these customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sousa and Voss, 2009)</ref>. Service recovery in traditional services has received considerable attention in the academic literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Davidow, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">McCollough et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tax et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Parasuraman, 2006)</ref> because effective recovery management has been shown to have a significant positive effect on customers who have reacted adversely to a service failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berry and Parasuraman, 1991)</ref>. An understanding of effective recovery management is particularly relevant for service providers because the distinctive characteristics of service (especially the inseparability of production and consumption) makes it impossible to ensure 100% error-free service <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fisk et al., 1993</ref>). E-service recovery is an important aspect of e-service, since it addresses the web site's service in response to problems or questions experienced by customers. However, from the extant of literature this topic has received limited attention in the context of online setting. Perhaps because (i) is a new concept, since there is reduced or not all human interaction it is unclear whether the understanding of the concept from traditional service is transferable to online services and (ii) acquiring data to measure e-service recovery is difficult. Moreover, to assess the effectiveness of such service recovery in the context of e-commerce, a valid and reliable measurement instrument is required. The most widely used instrument appears to be the E-RecS-QUAL scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Parasuraman et al., 2005)</ref>. This scale includes 11 items arranged in three dimensions: (i) 'responsiveness' (effective handling of problems and returns through the site); (ii) 'compensation' (the degree to which the site compensates customers for problems); and (iii) 'contact' (the availability of assistance through telephone or online representatives). <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Meng (2010)</ref> applied the E-RecS-QUAL scale to an African American cultural setting and a Chinese cultural setting. However, studies suggest that certain modifications of this scale are usually required for application in various settings, including the e-banking sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kim et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fuentes et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yen &amp; Lu, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akinci et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Relationship between e-service recovery and e-loyalty</head><p>The best scenario for service providers is to deliver a service without failures <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(McCollough et al., 2000)</ref>. In general, companies fare better in the eyes of consumers by avoiding service failure than by responding to failure with superior recovery. However, when the failure has occurred, effective service recovery is considered essential to business survival in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berry &amp; Parasuraman, 1991)</ref>, and to e-commerce in particular <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Reichheld &amp; Schefter, 2000)</ref>. This is because service recovery has been shown to play a crucial role in maintaining customer loyalty-either directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Srinivasan et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Reichheld &amp; Schefter, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Semeijn et al., 2005)</ref> or indirectly through enhanced perceived value <ref type="bibr">(Boshof, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Marimon et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fuentes-Blasco et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Effective service recovery is especially important in services provided on the Internet. This is because online customers are difficult to attract and retain <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Srinivasan et al., 2002)</ref>; moreover, it is very easy for online customers to switch their online providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Reichheld &amp; Schefter, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Semeijn et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Various studies have utilised the E-RecS-QUAL scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Parasuraman et al., 2005)</ref> to investigate these issues. As noted above, Fuentes-Blasco et al. (2010) confirmed <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Parasuraman and Grewal's (2000)</ref> finding that e-service quality impacts on loyalty via perceived value. To measure the constructs of e-service quality and e-recovery, these authors adapted the items from both the E-S-QUAL and E-RecS-QUAL scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Parasuraman et al., 2005)</ref>. In another recent study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akinci et al. (2010)</ref> utilised the E-RecS-QUAL scale to assess service recovery offered by 13 banks in Turkey. This study showed that two of the dimensions of the scale ('responsiveness' and 'compensation') had a significant and positive effect on customer loyalty, whereas the third dimension ('contact') had no effect on customer loyalty (perhaps because online customers are reluctant to experience interpersonal interaction even when a problem occurs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Sample and data collection</head><p>From the Spanish banks´ derive database, online banking users were randomly invited by mail and directed to a specific website containing the structured questionnaire, which they then self administered. The questionnaire began with a filter screening question, seeking only respondents who are: (i) consumers of e-banking services; the second part began with a dichotomous screening question seeking only respondents who (ii) experienced at least one problem with e-banking services.</p><p>The field work was completed in May 2010. After refusing some incomplete or invalid questionnaires, 428 valid questionnaires remained from Spanish customers of e-bank (a list of 20 different e-banks were detected as providers to the respondents); of these, 123 had experienced a problem with the service they had received. The demographic characteristics of the sample are summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1</ref>. No gender bias was detected. A little more than half (59.8%) of the respondents were aged less than 34 years. The educational level of the sample was high, with twothirds of the sample having a university degree. The table also shows the demographics of the sub-sample of respondents who had complained about the service received. There was again no gender bias in this sub-sample. Half of the respondents were aged less than 34. The educational level was again high, with two-thirds of the sub-sample having a university degree.</p><p>Evidently to congregate external validity conditions, it was necessary to check that the final data collected was undeniably a representation of the online banking population. It was reported that 62.2% of Spanish general populations were internet users in April 2011 (Internet World Stats, April 2011). Besides, The success of online banking in Spain was evidenced by the number of current and potential users of these services, with 14.68 million internet users frequenting banking websites in 2008 <ref type="bibr">(Fundacion Orange, 2008)</ref>. The percentage difference in four demographic characteristics between online bank population (Instituto Nacional de Estadística's, 2011) and the final data set of this study were analyzed using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Four contrasts were assessed between the two groups assuming a null hypothesis that there was no difference of means between the groups. The results show no statistical differences; hence the sample replicates the general population in term of gender, age, education and annual income.</p><p>Moreover, the sample of service recovery was constructed by self-selection of respondents.</p><p>It was as well necessary to assess representativeness of the final data of service recovery with the aim population sample (428). A comparison of demographic variables between the two samples (respondents who had not reported any problems and those who had reported a problem) was conducted using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The findings indicated that no differences were detected in "gender" and "educational" level. However, the characteristics of "age" and "annual income" p-value ≤ 0.05, indicates that there was some differences. A thorough data analysis shows there was a slight disparity (10%). Respondents aged 17-23 and annual income &lt;12,000 failed to report non-routine encounters. It appears not to be a surprise as the data profile of this particular group indicates that they were likely to be students. Students are emblematic and very knowledgeable representation of the sizeable body of web users. They might not have reported service failure, since they can solve some non-routine encounters by seeking advices from their friends and family through social network media. To sum-up, the lack of any significant difference indicates that the collected information of service recovery has certain reference value and indeed is a representation of the population. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Questionnaire</head><p>As noted above, the two objectives of the study were: (i) to propose scales to measure e-quality and e-recovery in the context of the Spanish e-banking sector; and (ii) to assess the impact of e-quality and e-recovery on e-loyalty. To gather data for these purposes, the questionnaire included items for: * e-service quality and e-recovery (for the first objective); and * perceived value and loyalty intentions (for the second objective).</p><p>The rationale for collecting data on 'perceived value' will become apparent when the proposed model for the second objective is presented in detail below (see Section 4.2).</p></div>

The PLS procedure is able to model latent constructs under conditions of nonnormality and small-to-medium sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Compeau &amp; Higgins, 1995)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and Limitations</head><p>This study first seeks to develop a multi items scale that could be used to measure the service quality of online banking and to comprehend the fundamental service quality dimensions. The study showed that an amended version of the E-S-QUAL scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Parasuraman et al., 2005)</ref> is a valid instrument for measuring e-service quality in the context of Spanish e-banking services. The modified version of the scale moved two items of the original 'fulfilment' dimension into the 'system availability' dimension. The remainder of the original 'fulfilment' dimension was then discarded. The amended version of the scale thus has three dimensions ('efficiency', 'system availability' and 'privacy'), rather than the original four. This modification is in some extent accordance with <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boshoff (2007)</ref>, who also removed the 'fulfilment' dimension in his model. The modification is also supported to some degree by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fuentes-Blasco et al. (2010)</ref>, who found out that this dimension had a lower coefficient path to e-quality in their model.</p><p>Of the three remaining dimensions, the present study finds that 'efficiency' is the most important in engendering customer loyalty, with the other two ('system availability' and 'privacy') being equally (but less) important. All three dimensions have been shown to influence loyalty through 'perceived value'.</p><p>The study has also found that an adaptation of E-RecS-QUAL scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Parasuraman et al., 2005)</ref> is valid for assessing service recovery in the context of Spanish e-banking services. The modified scale merged the dimensions of 'responsiveness' and 'compensation' into one factor (labelled 'responsiveness'). The third dimension of the original scale ('contact') was retained.</p><p>This study has also shown that e-service recovery has a significant direct impact on eloyalty; indeed, this effect is equivalent in magnitude to the effect of 'efficiency' (a dimension of e-service) on loyalty. These results are consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akinci et al. (2010)</ref>, who reported that 'responsiveness' and 'compensation' (dimensions of e-service recovery) have a significant and positive effect on loyalty. The present study also agrees with <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akinci et al. (2010)</ref> in not finding any solid evidence of a relationship between 'contact' (a dimension' of recovery) and e-loyalty.</p><p>These findings have important implications for e-service managers in developing their recovery strategies. First, it would seem that not all recovery actions are equally important. The recovery dimension that really explains loyalty is 'responsiveness' (effective handling of problems and returns through the site). This is the best way to restore customer confidence after a bad service experience. In contrast, availability of a real person ('contact') is not significant in producing loyalty. Managers should bear this in mind in allocating resources with a view to enhancing customer loyalty.</p><p>Managers should also note that 'efficiency' is the most important dimension of e-service quality in its effect on loyalty; indeed, it is slightly more important than service recovery. The implication is that providing a service free of failures is the best way to enhance customer loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(McCollough et al., 2000)</ref>. In other words, avoiding service failure is better than responding to failure; nevertheless, when service failure does occur, the 'responsiveness' dimension of e-service recovery has a significant effect on loyalty in e-services, as it does in all service settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berry &amp; Parasuraman, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fisk et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Reichheld &amp; Schefter, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Given the phenomenal growth of e-services, previous studies provide important theoretical framework and research instruments for scales evaluation of e-services quality e.g. E-S-QUAL and E-RecS-QUAL <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Parasuraman et al 2005)</ref>. Other studies adopted formal procedures for empirically validating e-SQ measurement scales in online shopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boshoff, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fuentes-Blasco et al., 2010)</ref>. However, very few succeeded in an attempt to propose scales to measure e-SQ in pure service oriented setting. E.g. in an endeavour to propose a more stable version of the E-S-QUAL to evaluate e-service quality in online banking in Turkey, <ref type="bibr">Akinci et al. (2009)</ref> reported some problems with the discriminant validity of their study. Furthermore, in an attempt to reassess the scales in South Africa, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boshoff, 2007)</ref> admitted they kept items with poor loadings (lower than 0.35) in the confirmatory factor analysis of their study. This paper goes one step further by proposing e-SQ scales from a culturally different country and different industry (e-banking). In contrast to previous study, there are some new contributions to drawn from this research. This study is the first attempt to proposed a more stable and reliable version of the amended E-S-QUAL to evaluate electronic service quality in a pure service setting. Moreover, it proposed and test a model that explain better the direct relationship between service recovery and loyalty and the mediating role between the relationship of service quality and loyalty of value.</p><p>This study has several acknowledge limitations which should be address in the future. The empirical data for this study was confined to one online service industry in one country. In the future, researchers may replicate the study in other settings and to a culturally different country to enhance the scales external validity and reliability. To measure e-service recovery a filtering process with a dichotomous question was applied. Given that this study was exploratory it was necessary to lower variability in order to verify the feasibility and reliability of our model. Further research may categorize non-routine encounters from a single/simple defect (e.g. safety concern) to the most important (e.g. transaction/operation failure) before scale evaluation. Besides, this study investigates loyalty and its antecedents for a specific period in time. Since loyalty is a nonspatial notion, it would be interesting for further research to extend the present Loyalty model to different sectors and with a longitudinal data (time based) that can assist in scrupulously understand customers' behaviour and attitude alteration with time.</p><p>Zhilin Yang, Minjoon Jun and Robin T.
