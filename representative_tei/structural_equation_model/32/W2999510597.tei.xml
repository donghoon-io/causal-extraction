<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The relationships among character strengths (forgiveness and gratitude), happiness, and prosocial bystander behavior in bullying were analyzed. The sample includes 500 (early adolescents) and 500 (middle adolescents) of both genders, between 12 and 18 years old (M age = 14.70, SD = 1.58). Two structural equation models were calculated. Results of the first model indicated that forgiveness, gratitude, and happiness had a direct positive relation with prosocial bystander behavior. Furthermore, human strengths were indirectly related to prosocial behavior in bullying for this effect in happiness. The second model showed that prosocial bystander behavior had a positive effect on human strengths and happiness. Multigroup analyses indicated that gender and stage of adolescence did not moderate the relations found in the model. Overall findings suggest a reciprocal relationship between character strengths, happiness, and prosocial bystander behavior.</p></div>

While bystanders are the most numerous participants in bullying, they are capable of adopting three different behaviors in these events: avoidance, probullying, or prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Salmivalli et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Demaray et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Alcántar-Nieblas et al., 2018)</ref>. Therefore, prosocial bystander behavior is essential for maintaining positive relationships, limiting bullying, and for promoting social adjustment in the victims <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Salmivalli et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Kärnä et al., 2013)</ref>. A plethora of research has been conducted to further understand the role of victim and aggressor; however, very little is known about the predictors of prosocial behaviors. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Eisenberg et al. (2015)</ref>, prosocial behavior is a kind of conduct through which people benefit others. Specifically, it leads bystanders to defend the victims, comfort them, or alert adults about bullying episodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Sutton and Smith, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Reijntjes et al., 2016)</ref>.

While scholars remain incapable to elucidate the leading factors toward the adoption of prosocial behaviors in bystanders <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Barchia and Bussey, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Van der Ploeg et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lambe et al., 2019)</ref>, they are urged to further explore the underpinnings of prosocial behavior in bullying events.</p><p>The first difficulty is finding a research model that explains why individuals adopt prosocial behaviors; this is a complex task due to the different theoretical strands influencing the field <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Lapsley and Narvaez, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Garrigan et al., 2018)</ref>. Some scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Ettekal et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lambe et al., 2019)</ref> believe that the adoption of prosocial behavior can be explained through moral variables. Bystander researchers often times adopt either cognitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Kohlberg, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Rest et al., 2000)</ref> or affective <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Hoffman, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Tangney et al., 2007)</ref> frameworks of moral development. Under these perspectives, moral judgment and moral emotions are referred as directly related to the prosocial behavior. For example, some studies analyze the effects of moral sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Thornberg and Jungert, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Levasseur et al., 2017)</ref>, selfimportance of moral value <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Pozzoli et al., 2016)</ref>, empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Pöyhönen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barchia and Bussey, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Nickerson et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Pozzoli et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Van der Ploeg et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Yun and Graham, 2018)</ref>, and restorative shame management <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahmed, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Valdés-Cuervo et al., 2018)</ref> with defender bystander behavior in bullying.

According to them, neither moral emotions nor moral judgment can fully predict prosocial behavior by themselves; therefore, the exploration of moral identity, over merely morale variables, remains crucial to understanding the underpinnings of prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Blasi, 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Blasi, , 1984;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Aquino and Reed, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Narvaez and Lapsley, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>According to social cognitivists <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Aquino and Reed, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Lapsley and Narvaez, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Miles and Upenieks, 2018)</ref>, moral identity comprises a set of self-schemas arranged around a group of character strengths. Moral self-schema refers to a stable set of memories that summarize a person's beliefs, affective experiences, and generalization about the self, in moral domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Lapsley, 2016)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Research</head><p>Most of the studies exploring prosocial bystander behavior in bullying use theoretical frameworks around moral judgment or emotions. Despite the larger evidence suggesting that character strengths and happiness are associated with prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Light et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Riek and DeWit, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Yost-Dubrow and Dunham, 2018)</ref>, no study known by the authors has explored the relationship between forgiveness, gratitude, happiness, and prosocial behavior in bullying. Furthermore, the literature regarding bystanders' behavior in bullying events within the Mexican context is still scarce.</p><p>As other scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Blasi, 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Blasi, , 1984;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Aquino and Reed, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Narvaez and Lapsley, 2009)</ref>, the authors posit that moral identity is crucial to explain moral behavior. Therefore, unlike previous studies, we adopted a social-cognitive model of moral behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Hardy, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Aquino et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Narvaez and Lapsley, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Lapsley and Narvaez, 2013)</ref>. Within this model, individual identity is seen as a self-schema, which is organized around the association of specific moral traits. Moreover, based on the current body of literature, the mediation effect of happiness was analyzed with the association between forgiveness, gratitude, and bystander prosocial behavior. Specifically, this study explored the direct and indirect relationships between gratitude, forgiveness, happiness, and prosocial bystander behavior in Mexican early and middle adolescents (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Moreover, an alternative model was used to explore the effect of prosocial behavior on human strengths and happiness, since reciprocal relations between these positive factors are understudied. Finally, the role of gender and stage of adolescence (early vs. middle) in these relations was also examined.</p><p>Since previous scholars have reported direct and indirect positive relations between gratitude, forgiveness, happiness, and prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Meier and Stutzer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Rudd et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Light et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Sulemana, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Riek and DeWit, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Yost-Dubrow and Dunham, 2018)</ref>, a positive relationship between these variables and prosocial behavior in bullying was anticipated.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>There were 500 early and 500 middle adolescents from 28 public schools in the state of Sonora, Mexico. Participants were selected by simple probabilistic sampling (p = 0.5, q = 95%). The sample of early adolescents included 215 (45%) female (M age = 12.35, SD = 0.81 years) and 286 (55%) male (M age = 12.37, SD = 0.73 years) ranging from 12 to 15 years old. The middle adolescent sample included 262 (52.5%) female (M age = 17.11, SD = 0.94 years) and 237 (47.5%) male (M age = 16.97, SD = 0.94 years) with ages between 16 and 18 years old. As most public urban institutions in Mexico, its population includes students from low and middle classes (National Institute for the Evaluation of Education [INEE], 2018).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gratitude</head><p>The Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ6; <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">McCullough et al., 2002)</ref> was used. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">McCullough et al. (2008)</ref>, gratitude is a positive assessment of the benefits that others brought to personal experiences. This is a one-dimension scale, which consists of four items (e.g., If I had to make a list of things for which I am grateful, it would be a long list, α = 0.88, = 0.90). The scale responses are in Likert-type format with seven options (0 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree). The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) showed a good fit of the model [X 2 = 2.39, df = 1, p = 0.122; standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR) = 0.01; adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI) = 0.98; comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.99; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.03, 90% CI (0.00, 0.10)].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Forgiveness</head><p>The Forgiveness Heartland Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Thompson et al., 2005)</ref> was used. The authors define forgiveness as an action that involves both a benevolent feeling toward the offender and the reestablishment of the relationship. This one-dimension scale consists of eight (e.g., Eventually I understand the mistakes that others make, α = 0.75, = 0.81) Likert-type items (0 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree). The CFA showed a good fit of the measurement model [X 2 = 33.07, df = 10, p = 0.337; SRMR = 0.04; AGFI = 0.99; CFI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.04, 90% CI (0.02, 0.05)]. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Happiness</head><p>The scale of Orientation to Happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Peterson et al., 2005)</ref> was used. This scale consists of 10 Likert-type items (0 = completely opposite to me, 4 = Very much like me, α = 0.82), referring to three orientations to happiness: pleasure that seeks for fulfillment and avoidance of discomfort (e.g., The good life is full of pleasure); commitment, defined as the involvement in goal-related activities important for the individual (e.g., When I have to choose what to do, I always take into account if I can commit); and life with meaning, the use of personal virtues and skills for a greater good (e.g., my life has a bigger purpose). The CFA showed a good fit of the unidimensional model [X 2 = 21.93, df = 14, p &lt; 0.08; SRMR = 0.03; AGFI = 0.98; CFI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.02, 90% CI (0.01, 0.04)].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prosocial Bystander</head><p>To assess the prosocial bystander role, a subscale from the participant role approach was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Alcántar-Nieblas et al., 2018)</ref>. Prosocial behavior refers to the adolescents' involvement in behaviors aimed at protecting or comforting the victims of bullying (e.g., when a classmate is physically assaulted I inform the adults, α = 0.80, = 0.82). The subscale consists of four Likert-type items (0 = never, 4 = always). The participant role approach was found valid in Mexican populations [X 2 = 95.41, df = 60, p = 0.002; SRMR = 0.05; AGFI = 0.95; CFI = 0.96; RMSEA = 0.03, 90% CI (0.01, 0.04)].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Technological Institute of Sonora. Then, principals and teachers from schools located at Sonora, Mexico were reached to gather voluntary participants. Later, a consent letter was sent to the adolescents' parents both explaining the purpose of the study and asking permission for students' participation. Only 3% of parents refused to allow their children to participate in the study. Finally, we ensured voluntary participation and the confidentiality of their participation. The participants were informed that they may leave the study at any time during the data collection process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>The percentage of missing data was 4% in the sample. In all cases, they were treated using the SPSS imputation method. During the first stage, both descriptive (median and deviation standard) and univariate analysis (bivariate correlation, media comparison, and size of effect) were conducted. Later, CFA, the invariance measurement of scales, structural equation model, and structural invariance, using AMOS software were also used. All the analysis used the maximum likelihood estimation with percentile method bootstrap (with 5,000 replicates and a 95% confidence interval) to determine the goodness of fit of the models. The bootstrap is an AMOS method to approach multivariate normality issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Hancock and Liu, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Byrne, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>

In the analysis of invariance, configurational invariance (baseline model), metric invariance (factor loading), and scalar (measurement intercept) were evaluated. The measurement and structural invariance of the model between early and later adolescents were made using indicators of invariance X 2 with p &gt; 0.001, CFI &lt; 0.01, and RMSEA &lt; 0.015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Sass and Schmitt, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Byrne, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model</head><p>The goodness of fit of the structural models were calculated using chi-squared and associated probability (X 2 with p &gt; 0.001), SRMR (≤0.08), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI ≥ 0.95), AGFI (≥0.95), CFI (≥0.95), and RMSEA (≤0.05) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Blunch, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Byrne, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kline, 2016)</ref>. The direct and indirect effects were calculated with the bootstrap percentile method. For the comparison of alternative models, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were used <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Blunch, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Byrne, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kline, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Invariance</head><p>The structural coefficients invariance was tested concerning the relationships among the variables included in the model (gratitude, forgiveness, happiness, and prosocial bystander behavior). To test invariance of structural coefficients, five paths were constrained equal over gender and adolescence stage (early and middle). The following recommendations were applied for multigroup invariance testing: X 2 with p &gt; 0.001, CFI &lt; 0.01, and RMSEA &lt; 0.015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Sass and Schmitt, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Byrne, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive and Univariate Analysis</head><p>The results showed a significant positive correlation between gratitude, forgiveness, happiness, and prosocial behavior in bullying. Moreover, female participants scored higher than male participants in all the analyzed variables, and early adolescents scored higher in happiness than middle adolescents; no other differences in both stages were found (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Invariance</head><p>The measurement invariance over gender (477 female vs. 533 male) and adolescence stage (early 501 vs. middle 509) were tested by examining the following models of invariance: configurational, metric, and scalar model of invariance. Overall, the results showed the invariance of all the measurements used (see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Thus, these finding supported the invariance of the different instruments for gender and stage of adolescence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model</head><p>The calculated structural model showed good fit indices [X 2 = 172.16, df = 126, p = 0.04, TLI = 0.98; SRMR = 0.05; AGFI = 0.97; CFI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.03, 95% CI (0.02, 0.05); AIC = 230.64; BIC = 441.67], explaining 35% of variance in prosocial bystander behavior. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the structural model with the standardized coefficients and their associated probability. Regarding the direct effects, the results showed that gratitude (β = 0.43, p &lt; 0.000) and forgiveness (β = 0.32, p &lt; 0.000) have a positive relationship with happiness and prosocial bystander behavior (β = 0.33, p &lt; 0.000; β = 0.27, p &lt; 0.000). Moreover, the indirect effects showed that gratitude [β = 0.12, p &lt; 0.000, 95% CI (0.04, 0.13)] and forgiveness [β = 0.08, p &lt; 0.000, 95% CI (0.03, 0.10)] were related to prosocial bystander behavior through happiness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alternative Model</head><p>The effects of prosocial bystander behavior in happiness, forgiveness, and gratitude were analyzed. The structural model had an acceptable fit index [X 2 = 218.57, df = 129, p &lt; 0.000; SRMR = 0.06; AGFI = 0.94; TLI = 0.93; CFI = 0.95; RMSEA = 0.06, 90% CI (0.04, 0.04), AIC = 260.64; BIC = 470.67]. Prosocial behavior was directly related to happiness (β = 0.34, p &lt; 0.000) and gratitude (β = 0.34, p &lt; 0.000); however, it was not related to forgiveness (β = 0.02, p = 0.62). Regarding indirect effects, prosocial behavior was found to promote forgiveness [β = 0.27, p &lt; 0.000, 95% CI (0.18, 0.36)] and gratitude [β = 0.10, p &lt; 0.000, 95% CI (0.04, 0.13)] through its positive relationship with happiness. However, this model resulted in a poorer fit than the original model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multigroup Structural Analysis</head><p>To analyze the moderated effect of gender and stage of adolescence (early vs. middle), a multigroup analysis was performed. Results showed the existence of structural invariance in gender [X 2 = 376.25, df = 160, p &lt; 0.000; CFI = 0.96; AGFI = 0.95; TLI = 0.97; RMSEA = 0.04, 95% CI 90 (0.02, 0.06)] and stage of adolescence [X 2 = 389.36, df = 183, p &lt; 0.00; CFI = 0.96; AGFI = 0.93; TLI = 0.94; RMSEA = 0.05, 95% CI (0.03, 0.07)]. Both differences in chi-squared ( X 2 ), in the comparative goodness-of-fit indices ( CFI), and RMSEA ( RMSEA) suggest that gender and the adolescence stage (early vs. middle) does not affect the relations proposed in the model (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>While past studies have focused on the moral domain, they have been unable to fully explain the leading factors for prosocial behavior in bystanders of bullying. Unlike past studies, this research was framed by the social-cognitive model of moral behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Aquino and Reed, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Lapsley and Narvaez, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Miles and Upenieks, 2018)</ref> and analyzed the association between virtues (forgiveness, gratitude, and happiness) and prosocial bystander behavior. The results showed positive relations between forgiveness, gratitude, happiness, and prosocial bystander behavior. Finally, results indicated that the relationships between these variables were not moderated by gender or adolescence stage (early vs. middle). Consistent with previous studies, forgiveness and gratitude were related to happiness in adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Maltby et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref>  Rana <ref type="bibr">et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Witvliet et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">You et al., 2018)</ref>. This association may be explained by the influence of forgiveness and gratitude in maintaining positive relationships, which contributes to gaining social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Hobfoll, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Fredickson, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">You et al., 2018)</ref>. Similar to other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Karremans et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Meier and Stutzer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Gini et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Seider et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Light et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Sulemana, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Shiraki and Igarashi, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bono et al., 2019)</ref>, these results showed a positive relation between both moral self-schemes and prosocial bystander behavior. In this regard, as other scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(McCullough et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Emmons, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Karremans and van Lange, 2009)</ref>, we posit gratitude and forgiveness usually evolve to stimulate reciprocity and sympathy, not only with benefactors but also unrelated others. Finally, in line with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Thoits and Hewitt, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Walker, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Meier and Stutzer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Rudd et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Light et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Sulemana, 2016)</ref>, these results indicated that the happiest people are likely to engage in prosocial behaviors. In this regard, some scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Thoits and Hewitt, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Dunn et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aknin et al., 2012)</ref> explain that happiness produces generosity to others that will be later transformed into prosocial behavior. Overall, the findings suggest individual virtues as a moral self-schema plays an important role in explaining prosocial bystander behavior in bullying.</p><p>Results from the alternative model suggest that prosocial bystander behavior positively relates to virtues and happiness in adolescence. This evidence is consistent with past literature that reports a positive impact of prosocial behavior in virtues development <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Lerner et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Dunn et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aknin et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Carlo et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Fu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Al-yaaribi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Curry et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bieda et al., 2019)</ref>. Although the mechanism underlying this relationship remains unclear, the current body of the literature suggests that the effect of happiness in prosocial behavior is related to adolescents' perceptions about positive consequences of their behavior in their own and others' wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bierhoff, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Rudd et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Paulus and Moore, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, the gender and adolescence stage did not have a moderating effect on the relationships in the study model. In other words, the influence of gratitude and forgiveness on prosocial bystander behavior in bullying was similar in both genders and adolescence stages. This suggests that forgiveness, gratitude, and happiness are valuable, regardless of gender or stage of adolescence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The present study contributes to advance the understanding of the relationships between forgiveness, gratitude, happiness, and prosocial bystander behavior. Nonetheless, this study had at least three limitations. First, a cross-sectional design does not allow for probing a causal relationship among the proposed variables. Therefore, longitudinal or experimental designs are suggested. Second, the measures of variables were self-reported, paper-and-pencil measures. Although the findings were consistent to prior research, studies using multiple methods of measure are desirable. Third, despite the relatively large sample, it is necessary to use research samples with greater diversity to generalize the findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical and Practical Implications</head><p>From a theoretical perspective, these findings confirmed the value of the social-cognitive model of moral behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bandura, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Aquino and Reed, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Lapsley and Narvaez, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Miles and Upenieks, 2018)</ref> in the understanding on moral behavior. Particularly, results suggest that the activation of moral self-schemas in bullying bystanders predict their moral behavior. Moreover, the evidence shows that giving to students the opportunity to practice prosocial behaviors toward bullying victims favors the accessibility to moral self-schemas in future events. In accordance with the proposed model, the results suggest that individual behavior is consistent with a moral self-schema, which is also related to individuals' well-being. In summary, results confirm that the activation of moral-self schemas such as gratitude and forgiveness provide bystanders a dispositional readiness to selecting situationally appropriate behavior in the context of bullying. Hence, the exploration of moral self-schemas, particularly virtues, remain a promising field of study in the context of bullying.</p><p>From a practical perspective, these findings suggest that promoting virtues along with happiness results in a useful strategy to promote prosocial behavior toward bullying victims and potentially reduce bullying in general. Therefore, we believe that further efforts should target the development of virtues such as gratitude and forgiveness rather than highlighting adolescents' weaknesses. Hence, we believe it is necessary to link the community, families, and schools to promote a social climate that facilitates the development of these virtues in adolescents. Furthermore, adults should develop the mechanisms to encourage adolescents to engage in prosocial behaviors such as volunteering, charity, community service, etc. Overall, we believe that a caring and righteous environment remain a fundamental source for the development of positive outcomes in adolescents.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1 | Theoretical model of the relations between forgiveness, gratitude, happiness, and prosocial bystander behavior.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,74.61,69.02,444.00,145.68" type="bitmap" /></figure>
