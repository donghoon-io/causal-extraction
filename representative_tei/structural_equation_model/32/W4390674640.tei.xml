<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Objective The transition phase is a common custom experienced by graduate nurses, who are required to adapt quickly to their new workplace as it is a prerequisite for a successful transition. However, workplace adaptation is very challenging and may affect nurses' future career prospects if not managed properly. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the factors that facilitate newly employed nurses' adaptation and integration at Ministry of Health (MOH)-run state hospitals in Malaysia. The study framework was derived and adapted from the Roy adaptation model (RAM) and organisational socialisation theories.</p><p>Design This quantitative study was conducted from May 2021 to December 2021.</p><p>Setting The sample population was newly employed nurses working at state hospitals with 1-2 years of service experience.</p><p>Participants A total of 496 newly hired nurses from MOH state hospitals participated in this study. The data was analysed using covariance-based structural equation modelling and IBM SPSS Amos 24.</p><p>Results The participants perceived that workplace organisation (OC), academic institution contribution (AIC), and new nurse's personality traits (PT) contributed approximately 36% to newly employed nurses' adaptation (NENA). PT partially mediated the relationship between OC and NENA and between AIC and NENA.</p><p>Conclusions The ndings could be useful to nursing authorities. Additionally, it is also recommended that a nurse's personality be developed, emphasised, and enhanced through continuous programmes or training to ensure that they can easily adapt to their new working environment. Moreover, academic institutions and work organisations should be encouraged to collaborate to develop improvement cycles that facilitate newly employed nurses' prompt and e cient adaptation at MOH hospitals during transition.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACKGROUND</head><p>Reality shock or 'shock-like reaction' refers to the strong feelings of anxiety and stress experienced by newly employed nurses <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. New nurses experience pressure, trauma, and anxiety during transition period because they cannot adjust to, integrate into, or socialise within the new organisation <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Many studies focused on newly employed nurses' transition, which involves major changes between one phase and another <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Based on organisational socialisation theory, transition involves three stages: (1) new employee behaviour, characteristics, and organisational efforts; <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> newcomer adjustment from being an outsider to an insider; and (3) correlation to adjustment outcomes, which include job satisfaction, performance, turnover rate, and commitment <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. The adaptation phase is critical and determines new employees' successful transition. It is crucial to ask what determines a successful transition from student to registered nurse. Nevertheless, an effective adaptation is likely to determine newly employed nurses' successful transition. This view was supported by a study of adolescents' vocational transition, which was successfully managed by highly adaptable adolescents <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. The Roy adaptation model <ref type="bibr">(RAM)</ref> indicates that individuals use their conscious awareness to integrate human and environmental stressors <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Thus, a stable equilibrium between ecological factors and the internal system would result in newly employed nurses' effective adaptation.</p><p>In their rst year of practice, new nurses are assisted by transition support programmes. Other countries conduct several strategies and programmes, including WhatsApp community practices <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, extended orientation <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, nurse residency programmes (NRP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, nurse transition programmes (NTP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, introductory programmes <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>, and mentoring programmes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. These initiatives are vital to prepare new nurses to face workplace environment challenges and culture.</p><p>In Malaysia, newly employed nurses registered with the Nursing Board undergo a 1-week orientation and are required to participate in a mentoring program for 6 months. The core concept of these programmes is to provide coaching and counselling to improve the nurses' long-term work skills and competencies.</p><p>After 6 months, newly employed nurses must sit for the National Nursing Audit (NNA), where they are assessed and observed by their mentors. Nurses who have passed the NNA assessment are expected to work independently as professional nurses in hectic work environments that involve resource constraints, high workloads, and different working cultures. This high expectation can cause transition shock among these nurses and thus affect their adaptation.</p><p>As research on adaptation during transition is insu cient, this study aimed to identify the extent to which the factors organisational contribution (OC), academic institution contribution (AIC), and personality traits (PT) are associated with new nurses' adaptation during transition. The ndings can: (a) provide research-based evidence to nursing authorities on the success factors related to adaptation, (b) contribute to the growing body of knowledge and literature on newly graduated nurses' adaptation and transition, and (c) encourage collaboration between nursing academic institutes and workplace organisations to establish an improvement cycle to facilitate the prompt and e cient adaptation of newly employed nurses at Malaysian Ministry of Health (MOH) hospitals during the transition phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESEARCH FRAMEWORK AND RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</head><p>The research framework was constructed based on the RAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and organisational socialisation theories <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. Brie y, the RAM describes the interaction between stressors (or the external environment) and the open system in response to adaptation. In this context, the open system was the newly employed nurses and comprised four adaptive modes: interdependence, self-concept, role function (RF), and physiology, which are described below.</p><p>The factors related to interpersonal interaction in giving and receiving value or support are categorised as the interdependence adaptive mode, which consists of teacher's characteristics (TC), clinical teacher roles (CTR), and superiors' roles (SR). The RF adaptive mode focuses on the workplace organisational role in mediating new nurses' roles, positions, and work requirements and comprises the learning environment (LE), nursing programme clinical component (CCNP), work characteristics (WC), organisational support and teamwork integration (OS_TI), work readiness (WR), and RF. Socio-emotional support (SES) is classi ed as a physiology adaptive mode as it relates to the manner in which new nurses interact with organisational culture. The self-concept adaptive mode comprises hardiness (HR), self-esteem (SE), optimism (OP), caring (CG), and proactive (PRO) values, which refer to psychological, emotional, spiritual, and personal values, respectively. Under the four adaptive modes, the identi ed constructs were categorised into three main constructs: OC, AIC, and PT <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>In this study, adaptive behavioural outcomes were measured with the third stage (outcome) of organisational socialisation theory. The adaptive behavioural outcomes comprised four outcomes (work satisfaction, performance, turnover, commitment) directly correlated to new nurses' adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>Numerous studies have proven that job satisfaction is positively associated with being more likely to remain in the nursing profession <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr">26]</ref>. Furthermore, work commitment and performance are also highly correlated <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr">28]</ref>. Therefore, job satisfaction, work performance, self-belief, and work commitment were used as proxies in this study to measure the adaptation level. PT were also identi ed as a mediator in the relationships between OC and adaptation level and between AIC and adaptation level.</p><p>Based on the Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> the following hypotheses (H) were proposed:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODOLOGY Sampling and Data Collection</head><p>In this study, the cross-sectional approach deemed more appropriate to test the hypotheses. The population involved new nurses working at MOH hospitals who had been hired in 2019 and who had between 1 and 3 years of service experience. In 2019, most new nurses were assigned to state hospitals. To retain sample homogeneity, only nurses working at state hospitals were invited to participate in this study. The information on 806 eligible state hospital nurses was obtained from the respective District Health O ce liaison o cers. As a 5:1 sample size:parameter number ratio was required <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, the 123item questionnaire required a total sample size of 615. The participants were chosen randomly from the sampling frame via simple probability sampling to avoid sample selection bias. The validated and reliable NENA questionnaire (NENA-q) (Additional 1) was distributed to the selected respondents and data were collected from August 2021 to December 2021.</p><p>The survey was conducted during the Malaysian Movement Control Order (MCO) that had been imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The consent form and questionnaire were designed and distributed to the respondents via Google Forms. The participants were allowed to respond at a time convenient to them without feeling fearful or pressured. Of the 615 potential respondents, 119 declined to participate in the study. The data of the remaining 496 newly employed nurses was assessed using sequential equation modelling (SEM). SEM is the most appropriate statistical analysis to investigate cause-andeffect relationships among exogenous and endogenous constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Before modelling the structural model for hypothesis testing, the latent constructs were validated through con rmatory factor analysis (CFA). The higher-order construct of the measurement model was validated with a 2-step CFA: individual CFA and pooled CFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. The CFA determined that all latent constructs, i.e. OC, AIC, PT, and NENA, met the construct validity and passed the convergent and discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Once the model had been validated, the measurement model was converted into a structural model to perform the SEM. The standardised regression paths (standardised estimates) and regression paths (unstandardised estimates) of the model to perform structural analysis were computed with IBM SPSS Amos 24.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS</head><p>Organisational Contribution (OC) and Newly Employed Nurse's Adaptation (NENA)</p><p>The organisational contribution concept was developed based on several main works <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> using a 5point Likert scale, where 1 and 5 represented 'strongly disagree' and 'strongly agree', respectively. Superior role (SR), organisational support and teamwork integration (OS_TI), Socio-emotional support (SES), work readiness (WR), role function (RF), and work characteristics (WC) were included as the important factors in the newly employed nurse's adaptation. SR refers to the leaders' responsibility to provide motivation and guidance to new nurses. Seniors' or supervisors' advice and information can enhance work performance and signi cantly increase the feeling of community belonging <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. OS_TI refers to the workplace organisational role in the various in uences on nursing performance. A key component of the OS_TI concept is the observation of the impressions of adaptive behaviour among newly graduated nurses after they receive positive stimuli through training and collaborative methods. Organisations use orientation and mentoring programmes to introduce newcomers to cultural and workplace socialisation. Both types of programmes contribute signi cantly to nurses' adaptation, work commitment, and job satisfaction <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</p><p>Workers achieve job satisfaction and adapt to workplace pressures more easily through positive impressions <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref>. SES includes social construction, social acceptance, and a sense of belonging. Social support is an important aspect of creating a sense of ease and security and increasing morale and belonging, which can facilitate NENA <ref type="bibr">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</p><p>Newly graduated nurses acknowledge that their WR determines the success of their transition and workplace integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. In this study, WR was de ned as new nurses' ability to determine or predict the skills needed to perform tasks effectively. Furthermore, new nurses who are less prepared to face the work environment reported feeling dissatisfaction, anxiety, and a lack of con dence <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Additionally, role clarity among new nurses is associated with excellent work performance, high job satisfaction, and low turnover rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Newly graduated nurses must understand the required standards and protocols and their job scope, roles, and responsibilities to optimise their work performance and thus aid the maintenance of job satisfaction and long-term retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Academic Institution Contribution (AIC) and Newly Employed Nurse's Adaptation (NENA)</head><p>Nursing education is based on existing and validated questionnaires with some modi cations. The subdomains of the nursing education component learning experience (LE), teacher characteristic (TC), clinical teacher role (CTR), and the clinical and classroom features of the education programme (CCNP) were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The variables were evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 and 5 representing 'strongly disagree' and 'strongly agree', respectively. Based on the faculty attributes with con dence, equilibrium, and success (FACES) theory, nursing schools should implement positive LEs, experienced teachers, and excellent teaching strategies to ensure that novice nurses quickly adapt during transition <ref type="bibr">[46]</ref>. Previous studies identi ed a gap between an ideology-dominated nursing education and a good occupational skill-dominated nursing profession <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. Thus, CTR were considered to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and clinical nursing practice. The LE component is related to new nurses' ability to connect their student practical/work experience with professional practice. This component is considered pre-entry knowledge as it is intended to provide su cient experience in and opportunities for clinical practice. Classroom components refer to how adequately the educational programmes prepare students with the required basic knowledge before they implement it in clinical practice. Finally, the TC component includes nurse educator qualities and characteristics such as vast knowledge and experience, professionalism, caring, and strict.</p><p>Personality Traits (PT) and Newly Employed Nurse's Adaptation (NENA)</p><p>In this study, PT refer to the interpersonal strength required by new nurses to cope with stressful events. This strength was measured by assessing the new nurses' hardiness (HR), proactive (PRO), self-esteem (SE), optimism (OP), and caring (CG) values. Strength of character buffers the negative effects of workrelated factors and the greater challenges experienced, which in turn enhances job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> and reduces turnover rates <ref type="bibr">[48]</ref>. This study focused on how the newly hired nurses' positive PT were related to adaptive behaviour. The nurses' PT were developed based on HR <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, PRO <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, SE <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, OP <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, and CG values <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Considering that new nurses experience physical and emotional fatigue, anxiety, low SE, and despair when trying to adapt to new health unit environments, we attempted to determine the relationship between the nurses' PT, which must be established to help them adjust at work. The personality variables were evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 and 5 representing 'strongly disagree' and 'strongly agree', respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Newly Employed Nurse's Adaptation (NENA)</head><p>In this study, adaptive behavioural outcomes were measured using the adaptation outcome component in organisational socialisation theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Initially, these outcomes were based on nurses' job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> and clinical competency <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Following exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the factors were divided into four categories and the component was renamed based on the meanings of the items in each factor (job satisfaction, work performance, self-belief, commitment) as the outcome indicators of an adaptive response. All variables were evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 and 5 representing 'strongly disagree' and 'strongly agree', respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic Information</head><p>The demographic variables were posting placement, gender, age, work experience, eld of work experience, duration of unemployment after graduation, and intention to leave the nursing profession (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The sample consisted of 496 newly employed nurses working at MOH state hospitals. Female participants dominated the sample, where 90.9% of the respondents were female compared to the 9.1% who were male. The data was collected when the country was under the COVID-19 MCO, which most greatly affected Selangor and the southern states (Johor, Melaka, Negeri Sembilan). Therefore, more nursing placements were in the Central (37.9%) and South Zones (23.8%), followed by the North (16.9%), West (15.3%), and East Zones (6.0%). Of the participants, 77.4% had work experience before being assigned as registered nurses; the remaining 22.6% had no work experience. Most respondents had health sector work experience (55.6%) while the remainder (44.4%) had worked in non-health sector roles. The unemployment duration referred to any duration after graduation during which the respondents did not work. This variable was categorised into a shorter duration (waited for registered nurse placement for &lt; 1 year and 6 months) and longer duration (waited for &gt; 1 year and 6 months). Of the participants, 76% and 24% had a shorter and longer unemployment duration, respectively. Additionally, 77.8% of the new nurses had no intention to leave the profession while 22.2% did. The NENA-q model ful lled the discriminant validity criteria as the square roots of the AVE of the four latent constructs were greater than the inter-construct correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. After passing all requirements, the structural model was tested with an evaluation of the goodness of t (GoF) of the NENA-q model. The cut-off root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) values were 0.05-1.00; the con rmatory t index (CFI) ≥ 0.90; and the chi square/degree of freedom (Chisq/df) ≤ 5.00 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. The model tness index results in the NENA-q measurement model were satisfactory (Chisq/df = 4.969, RMSEA = 0.090, CFI = 0.918) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Moreover, the data distribution met the normality distribution requirement, where the skewness was required to fall within the - 1.5 to 1.5 range (S1). The hypotheses were tested after all reliability, internal consistency, and convergent validity indicators had been well established.</p><p>The SEM inferential analysis of the direct effects revealed that the squared multiple correlation (R 2 ) for the NENA was 0.36 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>). This indicated that OC, PT, and AIC contributed 36% to NENA. The model demonstrated that the correlation value between OC and AIC was 0.76, which indicated that workplace organisations and academic institutions must cooperate and are strongly mutually dependent in supporting new nurses' adaptation during transition. That is, it is di cult for nurses to adjust to the new environment during transition if only one organisation supports them. Both constructs were discriminant as the correlation value (Pearson correlation coe cient) was below the 0.85 threshold level <ref type="bibr">[56]</ref>.</p><p>In this study, seven hypotheses related to the adaptive association factors among newly hired nurses at MOH hospitals were proposed. Three hypotheses describe the effects of OC, PT, and AIC on NENA; two hypotheses describe the effects of OC and AIC on PT; and two hypotheses describe the effects of PT as the mediator between OC and NENA and between AIC and NENA.</p><p>First, the following direct effects were ascertained using a structural model: (H1) OC on NENA, (H2) PT on NENA, and (H3) AIC on NENA. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> depicts the hypotheses testing results, which determined that H1 was not supported (β = 0.140, p &gt; 0.05). In H2 and H3, the relationship between NENA and PT (β = 0.216, p &lt; 0.000) and between NENA and AIC (β = 0.195, p &lt; 0.000) was signi cant and PT and AIC exerted strong and positive effects on NENA. Hence, H2 and H3 were accepted. OC (β = 0.715, p &lt; 0.00) had a positive strong relationship with PT and exerted a signi cant effect on PT, so H4 was accepted. Similarly, AIC (β = 0.121, p &lt; 0.042) exerted a positive and signi cant effect on PT, so H5 was accepted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 2: Unstandardised Regression Path coe cient between constructs</head><p>Next, the mediator was tested with a simple mediation model based on a previously recommended method [56] that has been published in numerous journals <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. We were particularly interested in the size and signi cance of indirect effects (i.e. OC/AIC → PT → NENA), as these inform the understanding of the association mechanism between individual values, the workplace, and the academic contributions involved in facilitating adaptation. The results revealed a signi cant indirect effect of OC on PT (β = 0.163, p = 0.008) (S2), which supported H6. The indirect test of the OC to NENA through PT indicated that the lower and upper bound con dence intervals were 0.078 and 0.288, respectively (S3). The absence of zero between the lower and upper bound con dence intervals demonstrated the signi cant indirect effects. Furthermore, the direct effect of OC on NENA in the presence of the mediator was also signi cant (β = 0.231, p = 0.00). Although the SEM analysis did not support the relationship between OC and NENA as p &gt; 0.05 (0.066), both indirect and direct effects were signi cant with the presence of the mediator. The mediation effect strength can be computed from the variance accounted-for (VAF) value to ensure the mediation occurred. VAF is the magnitude of the indirect effect in relation to the total effect, where VAF &gt; 80% indicates full mediation, VAF of 20-80% indicates partial mediation, and VAF &lt; 20% indicates no mediation <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. In this study, the VAF value was 41%, indicating that partial mediation occurred in this relationship. Hence, PT partially mediated the relationship between OC and NENA, so H6 was accepted. Similarly, H7 was accepted as AIC had a signi cant indirect effect on PT (β = 0.181, p = 0.006) (S4) (Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>). The lower and upper bound con dence intervals were 0.104 and 0.257, respectively (S5). As the con dence intervals did not exceed zero, the indirect effects were signi cant. Thus, the signi cant direct effects (β = 0.258, p = 0.001) indicated that PT partially mediated the relationship between AIC and NENA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>SEM is currently increasingly popular. One advantage of SEM is that it allows the simultaneous modelling and testing of complex relationship patterns while concurrently yielding statistical e ciency values <ref type="bibr">[60]</ref>. SEM can also extensively examine the relationships between latent variables and observe variables that contain measurement errors <ref type="bibr">[61]</ref>. Additionally, this approach enables easy interpretation of latent variables, more accurate analysis of the proposed research framework, and better methodological evaluation <ref type="bibr">[62]</ref>.</p><p>Here, the ndings are discussed according to the proposed research objectives and hypotheses. The main objective was to investigate the signi cance of the relationships between OC, AIC, and PT and NENA during transition. Additionally, PT were examined as a mediator in the relationships between OC and NENA and between AIC and NENA. Here, the outcomes are discussed to explain the relationship between the workplace role, the academic organisation, and PT in facilitating NENA.</p><p>H1: Relationship Between OC and NENA</p><p>The ndings revealed that OC did not signi cantly in uence NENA; therefore, H1 was rejected. However, the results revealed that the rst three components (OS_TI, WC, SR) had higher mean scores of 4.39, 4.36, and 4.23, respectively (S6). Therefore, these components were believed to be more in uential in relation to adaptation than the other OC components.</p><p>The OS_TI component comprises the organisational programmes, efforts, or strategies to support newly licenced nurses in becoming professional registered nurses. Orientation, mentoring, the NTP, and a preceptorship programme are among the familiar efforts available to newly hired nurses. This study supported the opinion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, who stated that mentoring and orientation interventions foster newly registered nurses' development and socialisation in an organisation or unit. In their rst 2 weeks at Malaysian public hospitals, new nurses undergo an orientation programme, followed by a mentoring programme. This arrangement is designed to orient the new nurses to the new working environment, the hospital system, and the organisational standard operating procedures. Furthermore, orientation is highly related to new nurses' RF. During the orientation period, any necessary information is provided and explained to help new nurses gain a clear understanding of their duties, responsibilities, and work processes, thus ensuring that their RF is clear. The study outcomes were also strengthened by the work abilities to make critical and accurate decisions; increase stress, anxiety, and depression; and negatively affect nurses' SE and con dence levels <ref type="bibr">[66]</ref>. Performing an incorrect procedure on a patient or making a false decision would adversely affect the patient's safety. Additionally, new nurses perceive that the main factor contributing to job stress is being assigned to deal with death and dying patients as they feel that they are not psychologically prepared to deal with such patients [66].</p><p>Typically, it is believed that long working hours will cause nurses to experience physical disorders and negatively impact new nurses' quality of life and psychology. However, our ndings contradicted this assumption, where long working hours helped new nurses adapt quickly. The study by <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> determined that long working hours affect new nurses' quality of life and performance level. Surprisingly, nurses believed that working long hours could help them gain more clinical practice knowledge and experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Furthermore, we believe that long working hours can indirectly provide more space and time to acquaint new nurses with the culture, friends, and other medical personnel to assist in socialising and becoming insiders.</p><p>In this study, the SR component was related to the superior leadership value and the relationship with new nurses. According to [67], constructive and positive feedback from supervisors or preceptors exerted a major in uence on career development and motivated new nurses to improve their nursing practices. Their approach used a self-re ection tool with which superiors and new nurses could measure adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Moreover, new nurses were perceived to have adapted when the new nurse and their superior had a positive relationship. One strategy new nurses can use to build positive relationships with their superiors is to frequently ask clinical questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. personality promotes adaptation as it helps new graduate nurses develop resilience, increase their selfcon dence, and cope with stressful situations; furthermore, it also reduces staff turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr">18]</ref>.</p><p>A PRO personality also helps new graduate nurses develop the HR needed to overcome challenges and resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. HR refers to the individual's potential to cope with stressful and di cult life situations to achieve socio-psychological adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. Researchers have asserted that the HR value should be assessed in new nurses as it can be viewed as a personal resource that allows individuals to use contextual factors such as work support to reduce their psychological stress or improve their psychological well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. HR also reduces burnout incidence among nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>.</p><p>In this study, the CG attitude aspect related more to expressive behaviour, which involves emotional kindness towards patients. Cultivating a CG attitude requires a nurse's spiritual, moral, personal, and social involvement with a commitment to themselves and other communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. As CG behaviour is signi cantly associated with job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, it directly and positively affects adaptation. Meanwhile, nurses with SE are automatically optimistic. Many studies proved that con dence is an important personality trait for new nurses as it helps them develop the resilience needed to confront stressors while improving their competency and job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">76]</ref>. However, new nurses may face a crisis of con dence as they lack the con dence to assume responsibility if their patients experience unfortunate outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. Therefore, transition programmes such as NTP, mentoring, orientation, preceptorships or induction programmes speci cally designed for new nurses result in signi cantly higher SE and OP value <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr">38]</ref>.</p><p>H3: Relationship Between AIC and NENA</p><p>We determined the in uence of AIC on NENA, where the analysis revealed that H3 was supported.</p><p>Nurses attending public nursing colleges are exposed to a real working culture in the fth semester, which is known as the practical period. Here, the students are required to 'learn and do' to improve their nursing practice and build relationships with other healthcare personnel to enhance their con dence. The results were consistent with those of [78], who stated that students exposed to a real working environment and clinical or emergency simulations during their study period gained experience prior to pre-entry knowledge. Thus, nurses' con dence levels increased when performing their nursing practice <ref type="bibr">[78]</ref>. Therefore, the clinical knowledge and experience gained during the study period are important for socialisation, signi cantly in uence the learning process, develop nurses' critical thinking skills, and help them bridge the gap between knowledge and implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr">80]</ref>.</p><p>Our results were consistent with the FACES theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. A positive LE, an experienced and knowledgeable teacher, interactive teaching strategies, and the use of various approaches to help students may cultivate students' motivation to enhance their learning process. A previous study reported that new nurses would contact their nursing school teachers if they encountered workplace issues <ref type="bibr">[80]</ref>. Academic institutions can occasionally provide support systems for new nurses to help them address di cult workplace situations. Additionally, nursing school is the gateway for new nurses to become professionals.</p><p>Therefore, it was recommended that nursing schools and workplace organisations provide guidelines and preparation standards to nal-year nursing students before they experience the transition stage in their rst year of service <ref type="bibr">[81]</ref>. Sharing adaptation knowledge at academic institutions will increase students' awareness and enhance their mental preparedness before they enter the workplace environment.</p><p>H4: Relationship Between OC and PT</p><p>The analysis revealed that H4 regarding the relationship between OC and PT was supported. Establishing supportive and positive surroundings is another important aspect of developing CG attitudes. People often choose a CG attitude to increase their resilience because this relationship involves dynamic interaction between themselves and other people <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>. The natural tendency and desire to help others can maximise the probability of being accepted into a social group and receiving support when needed <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H5: Relationship Between AIC and PT</head><p>The four AIC components (CCNP, LE, TC, CTR) contributed to the new nurses' personality development.</p><p>The results indicated that new nurses socialised and adapted more easily to the new working environment if they had been exposed to a workplace setting during their education. This was proven by [78], who stated that clinical simulation exposed nurses to good and bad experiences when handling patients. It also assisted them in expanding their critical thinking skills and enhancing their personality values, speci cally HR, self-con dence, and CG [78, 80]. However, another study reported that new nurses' self-con dence might be eroded when they undergo nursing education, especially during the clinical practicum, as they lack con dence in what they should say from the clinical perspective and how they should anticipate potential questions from clinical instructors or other team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, an important part of the CTR is to provide continuous support to nursing students during the practical period.</p><p>Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> suggested that nursing schools should implement a positive LE, experienced teachers, and excellent teaching strategies to ensure that novice nurses adapt quickly during the transition.</p><p>Interesting teaching approaches and strategies can sustain and promote nursing students' active engagement in learning activities and thus promote the students' proactivity, SE, and OP <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95,</ref><ref type="bibr">96]</ref>.</p><p>H6 and H7: PT Mediates the Relationship Between OC and NENA and Between AIC and NENA</p><p>This study determined the mediating in uence of PT in the relationship between OC and NENA and between AIC and NENA. The statistical outcomes revealed that PT mediated the relationship between both OC and NENA. Given that OC and AIC exerted signi cant direct and indirect effects on NENA, the mediation was partial. This nding indicated that the effects of OC and AIC helped nurses adapt effectively if they exhibited a positive personality. In fact, the adaptation process will be prolonged if only one type of initiative were used to aid nurses but the nurses lacked motivation. It was reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref> determined that the personal attributes of optimism, proactive, and negative affectivity contributed signi cantly to job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>. Furthermore, positive work values, conscientiousness, and emotional stability signi cantly reduced the turnover rate among nurses in Taiwan <ref type="bibr">[98]</ref>. Exhibiting valuable personality characteristics might help new nurses shape their e cient adaptation to work <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>We examined the relationships among the constructs of AIC, OC, PT, and NENA and proposed that PT mediated the relationship between AIC and OC with NENA. The developed NENA-q model was established to highlight the effective factors and opportunities that encourage new nurses to adapt promptly during transition. The adaptation success factors in the AIC construct were TC, LE, CCNP, and CTR. The potential determinants of OC in facilitating adaptation were SES, WR, WC, SR, RF, and OS_TI.</p><p>Furthermore, newly employed nurses needed the PT that comprised HR, PRO, OP, CG, and SE to achieve successful adaptation. Additionally, the NENA was assessed using four components: job satisfaction, work performance, work commitment, and self-belief.</p><p>Overall, personal values partially in uenced the role of workplaces and academic organisations in facilitating new nurses' effective adaptation. Therefore, developing personality values is vital to achieving a successful transition and facilitating the adjustment process among new nurses. The information from this study could be useful to nursing authorities to bridge the gap between workplace and educational institution. Furthermore, continuous programmes or training are also recommended to develop, emphasise, and enhance a nurse's personality. This would ensure that every nurse has the PT needed to adapt to their new working environment. We also encourage collaboration between academic institutions and working organisations to establish improvement cycles that facilitate the prompt and e cient adaptation of newly employed nurses at MOH hospitals during transition.</p></div>

In the mentoring programme, the core concepts of coaching and counselling are aimed at improving the nurses' long-term work skills and competencies and focus on developing and improving the nurses' personal potential to catalyse positive behavioural changes[63]. Mentorship programmes, particularly the elements of re ection and mentor-protege relationship quality, are positively related to the new employee's socialisation and adaptation[64]. Furthermore, newly employed nurses are encouraged to participate in continuous professional development programmes (CPD) to guarantee high-quality ethical care and nurse productivity.Workload allocation and working hours were the WC element and the second most important promoters of adaptation and socialisation. Supervisors are advised to assign tasks judiciously and provide learning support during transition[65]. The distribution of tasks appropriate to the nurses' knowledge and experience levels is an important factor that can aid transition. Complex tasks can impair nurses'</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>H2:</head><label></label><figDesc>Relationship Between PT and NENA H2 states that PT signi cantly in uences NENA. The analysis revealed the signi cant positive impact of PT in facilitating NENA. New nurses possessing PRO, HR, SE, CG, and OP values would have increased ability to adapt quickly to the work culture. A comprehensive study [68] of new employees emphasised that PRO has two dimensions: PRO changes and PRO roles [68]. The former refers to a new employee's tendency to adjust or change their behaviour to achieve a desired outcome, while employees who adopt PRO roles facilitate effective adaptation. In the nursing context, PRO changes are also known as selfembodiment or self-awareness. Demonstrating the abilities to master nursing practices, present positive impressions to seniors, and collaborate with other staff helps new nurses become self-aware of their surrounding environment, learn the work group culture, and thus maximise the probability of their acceptance by the working community [69, 70]. Additionally, there is empirical evidence that a PRO</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The six OC components (WC, SR, OS_TI, SES, WR, RF) contributed ~ 72% to the new nurses' personality development.Any organisational workplace transition programmes established speci cally for newly employed nurses enhanced their clinical skills and thus developed their self-con dence to deliver safe nursing practises [82-84]. Self-con dence is a valuable resource in helping nurses overcome issues and di culties after several months in their professional role. New nurses are also required to have self-con dence to develop competence[85]. Furthermore, experienced, knowledgeable, respectful, and supportive facilitators or mentors are positively related to new graduates' con dence, especially in professional collaborations [86, 87]. Additionally, constant support from a mentor or facilitator can help new nurses develop PRO values. Such nurses are given opportunities to ask questions and demonstrate their talent and interest in performing assigned tasks [88]. Superiors are involved in fostering HR and resilience among new nurses to help them adapt to the work environment. Strategies are required to instil HR values through educational activities such as simulation, role play, discussion, and self-re ection [89]. Additionally, verbal persuasion or feedback and re ection sessions are considered useful strategies for instilling HR, con dence, SE, and OP among new</figDesc><table /><note><p><p><p><p><p>nurses</p>[89,<ref type="bibr" target="#b89">90]</ref></p>. Nevertheless, their superiors should demonstrate a rm attitude and a more prudent approach to increase the nurses' credibility and resilience. It is feared that the wrong approach would cause interpersonal con ict between superiors and new nurses. This con ict is also known as horizontal violence, where the highlighted assertiveness is more akin to verbal or physical bullying or threats, which harm the new nurses' SE and self-image [69,</p><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref></p>.</p></note></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIMITATIONS</head><p>The generalisation of the results is limited as the study involved only new nurses who had graduated from public academic institutions (MOH training centres). Therefore, aspects related to nursing academic institutions cannot be discussed further. As this study was conducted during the MCO period in Malaysia, most nurses had been assigned to general hospitals due to the lack of nursing staff there. Therefore, only nurses at general hospitals were selected as respondents during the data collection. In the future, it is recommended that this study be expanded to assess new nurses who have graduated from public and private nursing colleges and new nurses working at other MOH facilities such as district hospitals, specialised hospitals, military hospitals, and health clinics. Future studies that use a longitudinal design are necessary to corroborate our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and Limitations of This Study</head><p>Newly graduated nurses' transition to professionals must be considered an adaptation that allows individuals to successfully pass the transition period.</p><p>Transition must be supported and emphasised at the academic institution level, empowered and strengthened at the organisational workplace, and enhanced by a positive personality to help new nurses self-adjust effectively.</p><p>The newly employed nurses' adaptation questionnaire (NENA-q) model was developed to identify important areas for nursing authorities in Malaysia to consider in empowering existing programmes and assessments speci cally to facilitate effective adaptation among new nurses.</p><p>One limitation is that the causal relationships among the variables could not be explained in detail; to do so would require a qualitative study.</p><p>The results generalisation was limited and would require the involvement of new graduate nurses from private nursing institutions.</p></div>
