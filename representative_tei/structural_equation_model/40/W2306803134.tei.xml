<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study aims to examine the direct and indirect effects of brand experience on consumer satisfaction, brand trust and brand loyalty. It also aims to put forth a model encapsulating the notions of brand experience, consumer satisfaction and brand trust to explain the relationship between these three antecedents of brand loyalty. A face to face survey was used to collect data with the use of interviewers. The population of interest was consumers of four different brands from different product categories. Convenience sampling technique was used to gather data from 1200 respondents. A total of 1102 valid questionnaires were used for analysis where structural equation modelling was used for analysis.</p><p>Findings revealed that brand experience directly and positively affected consumer satisfaction, brand trust and brand loyalty. In addition, it was found that brand experience had an indirect impact on brand loyalty through both consumer satisfaction and brand trust. More specifically, it was found that the effect of brand experience on consumer satisfaction and brand trust was much more powerful than its direct effect on brand loyalty. On the other hand, in terms of total effects, it was seen that brand experience had a greater effect on brand loyalty by itself than the total effects of consumer satisfaction and brand trust combined. The empirical results indicate that brand experience has a direct effect on consumer turst. This study highlights the direct and indirect effects of brand experience on brand loyalty directly and through the mediating roles of consumer satisfaction and brand trust.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>For many years, functional product differentiations have been very important to marketers. Nowadays however, the importance of these functional product differentiations are decreasing, since many products in many categories began to resemble each other especially in terms of their function 1 . As a consequence of many products reaching their maturity stage in the product life cycle and hence attaining market saturation, marketers have realised that products and services cannot be differentiated only through their quality and functional attributes 2 . Schmitt 3 states that consumers still want to buy products for their functional attributes, quality and a positive brand image, but at the same time they also want to buy products that deliver experiences. In other words, consumers do not simply buy products of a firm, instead they buy what the firm offers and what the offerings can offer them 4 . Thus, what is important for a consumer is how a certain product enriches his/her life, not just its functional benefits 5 . Both final and B2B consumers believe that products are not enough by themselves, they should also provide experiences 6 . Moreover, it is a known fact that information received through personal experience is more permanent and appealing than information obtained through learning 7 .</p><p>The concept of experiential marketing was first introduced by Pine and Gilmore in their book entitled The Experience Economy: Work Is Theater &amp; Every Business a Stage. Additionally, Schmitt succeeded in arousing interest on experiential marketing among academics and practitioners through his academic article 8 .</p><p>In marketing literature, the notion of experience has been examined from different perspectives such as: customer experience 9 , consumption experience 10 , product 3 Bernd Schmitt, "Experiential marketing", Journal of Marketing Management, 1999, 15, (1-3), p. 57.</p><p>4 <ref type="bibr">Philip Kotler et. al.

One more research area was brand experience. Brakus, Schmitt and Zarantonello 15 were the first researchers who comprehensively conceptualised the concept of brand experience and introduced a valid and reliable scale for its measurement. To define and conceptualise this construct, they examined former studies related to the concept of experience in consumer and marketing literature. Additionally, they also examined the literature on philosophy, cognitive science, and applied management in order to distinguish the dimensions of brand experience from other types of experience. By using the scale they developed on brand experience they examined its effects on brand personality, satisfaction and loyalty.</p><p>Delgado-Ballester and Munuera-Alemán 16 demonstrates that brand trust has high contributions to brand equity. Therefore, if a firm wants to capitalize the competitive edge of brand equity, the first thing it should do is to build brand trust.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Brand Experience</head><p>Researchers have defined the concept of brand experience in different ways. Ortmeyer and Huber 19 considered brand experience as the buying behaviour towards a specific brand and measured it through the amount of past purchases of this specific brand. Kim and Sullivan 20 considered brand experience as an experience which resulted from buying or using a specific brand's products or services. On the other hand, Ha and Perks 21 considered brand experience as the positive perceptions towards a brand. Qi et al. 22 described brand experience as the totality of a brand's appearance and communication and therefore made various measurements regarding a brand's logo, commercials and the use of word of mouth. Brakus, Schmitt and Zarantonello 23 were the first academics to conceptualise and measure brand experience. Brakus, Schmitt and Zarantonello 24 defined brand experience as "the subjective, internal consumer responses (sensations, feelings, cognitive and behavioural responses) evoked by brand-related stimuli that are part of a brand's design and identity, packaging, communications and environments." The same academics also indicated that brand experience constituted of four dimensions: sensory, affective, intellectual and behavioural. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr">Zarantonello and 19</ref> Gwen G. Ortmeyer and Joel Huber, "Brand experience as a moderator of the negative impact of promotions", Marketing Letters, 2, <ref type="bibr">(1), 1991, pp. 35-45. 20</ref> Byung-Do Kim and Mary W. Sullivan, "The effect of parent brand experience on line extension trial and repeat purchase", Marketing Letters, 9, (2), <ref type="bibr">1998, pp. 181-193.</ref> 21 <ref type="bibr">Ha and Perks,</ref> Jiayin, Qi et. al. "An extension of technology acceptance model: analysis of the adoption of mobile data services in China", Systems Research and Behavioral Science, <ref type="bibr">26, (3), 2009, pp. 391-407.</ref> Schmitt 25 defined these four dimensions as, "a sensory dimension, which refers to the visual, auditory, tactile, gustative, and olfactory stimulations provided by a brand; an affective dimension, which includes feelings generated by the brand and its emotional bond with the consumer; an intellectual dimension, which refers to the ability of the brand to engage consumers' convergent and divergent thinking; and a behavioural dimension, which includes bodily experiences, lifestyles, and interactions with the brand." Nowadays, by using traditional communication channels, firms can reach only a limited section of their target market. Thus, to reach the whole target market it is necessary to use additional and more conventional communication methods. One of the new communication channels is to develop customer experiences related to brands. By creating a brand environment, firms try to encourage their potential and existing consumers to be part of this environment, rather than using traditional media 26 . Interaction between the brand and the consumer creates an experience which affects the thoughts and behaviours of consumers. Moreover, Shankar et al. 27 indicate that, many scholars have found that experiences are determinants of satisfaction 28 and brand experience directly affects consumer satisfaction and brand loyalty 29 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Consumer Satisfaction</head><p>The concept of consumer satisfaction has been examined by both academics and practitioners for over four decades 30 . Although researchers agree on the importance of consumer satisfaction, there is no consensus on the definition of consumer satisfaction. The leading researcher of consumer satisfaction, Oliver 31 , defines consumer satisfaction as "a judgment that a product or service feature, or the product or service itself, provides (or is providing) a pleasurable level of consumption-related fulfilment including levels of under-or over fulfilment."</p><p>Results of different research show that highly satisfied consumers continually buy the products of the firm that provides satisfaction 32 . In another words, when a consumer is satisfied, he/she develops a high level of commitment and loyalty to the brand/firm 33 . Hence, satisfaction has a direct effect on loyalty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Brand Trust</head><p>The concept of trust has been defined in different disciplines: from psychology to economics; from sociology to administrative sciences 34 . Needless to say, these disciplines have different points of view concerning the concept of trust. Nevertheless, there is a common point among these differences: the importance of trust in human relations and its effects on human behaviour.</p><p>Marketing considers trust as a bond which could be the relationship that occurs between a consumer and a firm. The relationship of trust between a brand and its consumer affects the consumer's buying decisions 35 . Likewise, consumers are constantly in a relationship with various brands in their daily lives 36 . This type of relationship could be defined as a combination of cognitive, emotional and behavioural processes occurring between the brand and its consumers 37 . As mentioned, brand experience is a subjective notion. Internal consumer responses include: sensations, feelings, cognitions and behavioural responses. Therefore, it is evident that brand experience is clearly a part of the relationship that occurs between a brand and its consumer. Moreover, consumer satisfaction is one of the basic components of trust 38 and trust establishes a bridge between consumer satisfaction and brand loyalty 39 . Therefore, for a firm to build brand trust and brand loyalty, consumer satisfaction is the first step. Nevertheless, in order to be satisfied or dissatisfied, ordinarily a consumer should have an 32 <ref type="bibr">Ha and Perks,</ref> Eugene W, Anderson, and Mary W. Sullivan "The antecedents and consequences of customer satisfaction for firms", Marketing Science, 12, (2), 1993, pp. 125-143; Vikas Mittal and Wagner A. Kamakura, "Satisfaction, repurchase intent, and repurchase behavior: investigating the moderating effect of customer characteristics", Journal of Marketing <ref type="bibr">Research, 38, (1), 2001, pp. 131-142. 34</ref> Larue Tone Hosmer "Trust: the connecting link between organizational theory and philosophical ethics", Academy of Management Review, 20, (2), <ref type="bibr">1995, pp. 379-403. 35</ref> Susan Fournier, "Consumers and their brands: developing relationship theory in consumer research", Journal of Consumer Research, 24, (4), <ref type="bibr">1998, pp. 343-353. 36</ref> Seong-Yeon Park and Eun Mi Lee, "Congruence between brand personality and self-image, and the mediating roles of satisfaction and consumer-brand relationship on brand loyalty", Asia Pacific Advances in Consumer Research, <ref type="bibr">6, 2005, pp. 39-45. 37</ref> Max Blackston, M.

For this reason, if brand experience has an effect on consumer satisfaction, it should also directly and positively affect brand trust, as brand trust is a bridge between consumer satisfaction and brand loyalty.</p><p>Trust is a vital part of all types of customer relationships and brand loyalty is one of the consequences of this relationship. It is likely that consumers will prefer brands and/or products that they trust, since perception of trust reduces or removes risks and ambiguity 41 . Therefore it could be stated that in order to establish a long term relationship between the consumer and the brand, the first step is to gain the trust of the consumer 42 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Brand Loyalty</head><p>Oliver 43 defines loyalty as "a deeply held commitment to rebuy or repatronise a preferred product or service consistently in the future, despite situational influences and marketing efforts having the potential to cause switching behaviour." Academics and practitioners agree that brand loyalty is one of the most important strategic constituents in creating sustainable competitive advantage. This is because firms need to invest less in marketing and undertake less effort in addressing loyal customers as compared to disloyal customers 44 . Loyal customers continue to buy and use the same brand as long as they are satisfied. Moreover, loyal customers are usually willing to pay more for a certain brand, because they think no other brands are able to deliver the same offerings. A firm/brand that has loyal customers does not have to allocate a big budget for promotional activities 45 . Knox and Maklan<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> state that firms get 50% to 85% of their revenues from 10% to 20% of their total customers (who actually are their loyal customers). Hence brand loyalty is considered as the dependent variable in this study.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>For the study, as a first step pre-studies were conducted in order to determine the brands to be used in the main research. As a second step, the main research was undertaken to test the proposed model and the relevant hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Pre-studies</head><p>Two pre-studies were conducted to determine the brands to be used in the main research. The aim of the first pre-study was to determine the potential brands which could be used for the main research. To accomplish this, a focus group study was conducted which consisted of 5 male and 5 female MBA students from İstanbul Bilgi University. The concept of experiential marketing was explained to all participants. Following the necessary explanations, the participants were asked to state as many brand names as possible, which they believed were marketed using experiential marketing. Afterwards, all the brand names that were generated in the first pre-study were used as input for the second pre-study.</p><p>The aim of the second pre-study was to finalize the selection of the brands to be used in the main research. Hence, 80 MBA students from İstanbul Bilgi University who had not attended the first pre-study were selected for the second pre-study. After the explanation of the concept of experiential marketing, the students were asked to rate the extent of their experiences with the stated brands, using a five-point Likert type scale (1= strongly agree, and 5 = strongly disagree) 47 . The purpose of selecting MBA students for the second pre-study was because most of them were working in the private sector. It was believed that a more realistic assessment of brand experience would be made with a non-student consumer group. To determine the brands to be used in the study, a one sample t-test was conducted. As a result, four brands that had the highest means and that also had statistically significant differences from the midpoint of the scale were selected for the main study. The chosen brands were: Apple (X = 4.41; sd = 0.63; sig = .000), Sony Play Station (X = 4.26; sd = 1.02; sig =.000), Nike (X = 4.18; sd = 1.06; sig =.000) and Coca Cola (X = 3.97; sd = 1.04; sig =.000).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Measurement</head><p>In the study, brand experience was measured using a 12 item, five-point Likert type scale (1=strongly disagree, and 5=strongly agree) that consisted of four dimensions: sensory, affective, behavioural and intellectual 48 . Brand trust was measured using an 8 item, five-point Likert type scale (1=strongly disagree, and 5=strongly agree) which consisted of two dimensions: reliability and intentions 49 . In order to assess consumer satisfaction, Oliver's 50 satisfaction scale was used, which is regarded as a valid and reliable scale by many researchers. It consists of a 6 item, five-point Likert type scale (1=strongly disagree, and 5=strongly agree). To measure brand loyalty, a 3 item, five-point Likert type scale (1=strongly disagree, and 5=strongly agree) was adopted from the work of Yoo and Donthu 51 . Additionally, two filter questions were used in order to eliminate irrelevant participants ("Do you use this brand?" which could be answered as "yes" or "no"; and "How well do you know this brand?" which could be responded as a five point scale (1=not at all, and 5=very well)). The main purpose of the filter questions was the belief that possible differences may exist between users and non-users of brand in terms of brand experience perceptions. The second purpose was to make sure that participants had enough experience with the brands to make evaluations. To accomplish these aims participants who said yes to the first filter question and gave a ranking of 3 or higher to the second filter question were included in the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Data Collection and Sampling</head><p>A face-to-face survey method was used to gather data for the main study. All the scales in the questionnaire were adapted from existing scales whose reliability and validity were already proven. To ensure the accuracy of the translation and to detect possible translation errors, a double translation/parallel translation method was used 52 . Two bilingual native English and two bilingual native Turkish speakers were asked to make the required translations. The two bilingual native English speakers at first translated the survey questions into Turkish, afterwards two bilingual Turkish speakers were asked to translate the Turkish version of the questionnaire back into English 53 . After comparing both translations, it was concluded that the translations were almost identical, therefore no probable semantic displacements were identified. Before the field study, a pre-test was used to test the questionnaire on 28 non-student participants to detect confusing or ambiguous wording. No objections were made, therefore the questionnaire was used without making any changes.</p><p>Convenience sampling was used as the method of sampling. Business administration students were used as interviewers in return for extra credits as in other studies 54 . The students were instructed to find four participants to complete the questionnaire. Three of the selected four participants had to be non-students and one had to be a student. In addition, students were instructed to try to recruit participants from different ages, gender and occupations 55 .</p><p>Since convenience sampling was used, some rules pertaining to statistical analysis techniques were considered in determining the sample size. For factor analysis, ideal sample size should be at least 20 twenty times the number of scale items 56 . On the other hand, some researchers 57 suggest that there should be at least 10 to 20 times as many observations as variables to make the estimates of LISREL stable. As there were 37 scale items in the survey, at least 740 surveys were needed in total. Taking into consideration that some surveys may be incomplete or filled incorrectly, data from 300 participants for each brand (Apple, Nike, Sony PlayStation and Coca Cola) were gathered. A total of 1200 surveys were collected. After the elimination of incorrectly filled surveys and elimination due to the filter questions, a total of 283 surveys for Apple, 278 surveys for Nike, 268 surveys for Play Station and 273 surveys for Coca Cola, in total 1102 surveys, remained for further analysis.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. provides the sample profile (n=1102 for all four brands). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Assessing The Validity of The Measurement Models</head><p>Since brand experience consists of four sub dimensions and brand trust consists of two sub dimensions, the two scales (measurement model) were tested in terms of their validity. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to assess the validity of the measurement models. An acceptable goodness of fit indices and some specific evidence of construct validity are needed to mention the validity of the measurement model 58 . Construct validity was assessed via convergent and discriminant validity. The properties of the brand experience measurement model and goodness of fit indices are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>As seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, all items significantly load to their assigned constructs and all factor loadings are higher than the desirable minimum threshold of 0.5 59 . Moreover, all composite reliability coefficients are greater than 0.6, the threshold proposed in literature 60 . Fornell and Larcker 61 state that, the average variance in manifest variables by extracted construct should be equal to at least 0.5 or higher. All average variance extractions (AVE's) are at least equal to 0.5 or higher except the AVE of intellectual dimension (0.47). However, the AVE approach for assessing convergent validity is a rather conservative approach 62 . Therefore, it was assumed that, convergent validity was achieved.</p><p>One criterion for adequate discriminant validity is that the AVE for a construct should exceed the squared correlation coefficients between any two constructs 63 . As seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, none of the squared correlation coefficients (above the diagonal) exceeds the AVE, thus discriminant validity was achieved. Additionally, the measurement model gave an acceptable fit to the data ( 2 = 280.72, df = 48; NFI = 0.97, CFI = 0.97, IFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.06, SRMR = 0.03). Consequently, it could be said that the brand experience measurement model has acceptable validity. The correlation matrix for the brand experience construct is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. For the brand trust measurement model, as seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, all factor loadings and composite reliability coefficients are higher than 0.5 and 0.60, which are the thresholds proposed in literature, respectively. All the AVE values of brand trust are greater than the 0.5 threshold which shows that convergent validity is achieved. As seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>, since the AVE of reliability dimension is lower than the squared correlations among the two constructs of brand trust, it could be said that discriminant validity could not be achieved completely. Although convergent validity was verified and the model gave an acceptable fit to the data ( = 186.02, df = 19; NFI = 0.99; CFI = 0.99; IFI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.08; SRMR = 0.03) but discriminant validity could not be verified. An exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation was employed to obtain new dimensions for brand trust. The results are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>. The exploratory factor analysis results showed that the data was appropriate for factor analysis (KMO = 0.923; Approx. Chi-Square = 6571, 172; df = 28; sig = .000) where all factor loadings ranged from 0.668 to 0.872 and were found to be statistically significant. Furthermore, the results revealed that all items loaded only on one single construct which explained 70% of the total variance and which is higher than the 0.60 threshold gen-erally proposed in literature 64 . Consequently, brand trust was considered as a single construct in this study and was specified as such in the structural model. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Validation of The Structural Model</head><p>The proposed model was tested with Lisrel 9.1 using maximum likelihood estimation method. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> shows the estimated structural equation model and Table 7 contains standardized path coefficients, t values and related hypothesis test results. Composite scores of brand experience dimension were used to estimate the proposed model. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) of the composite scores were satisfactory (sensory dimension=0.863; affective dimension=0.739; behavioural dimension=0.835 and intellectual dimension=0.720). The estimated model gave an acceptable fit to the data ( = 1590.25, df = 184; NFI = 0.97; CFI = 0.97; IFI = 0.97; RMSEA = 0.08; SRMR = 0.07). All goodness of fit indices were found to be satisfactory in terms of proposed thresholds in the literature 65 . All path coefficients in the estimated model were significant (ps &lt; 0.01). All hypotheses were supported. Therefore, brand experience directly and positively affects consumer satisfaction, brand trust and loyalty. Also brand experience indirectly affects brand loyalty through consumer satisfaction and brand trust. The direct effects of brand experience on consumer satisfaction, brand trust and loyalty are 0.74, 0.68 and 0.29, respectively. The indirect effect of brand experience on brand loyalty through consumer satisfaction is equal to (0.74 x 0.27) 0.20. Likewise, the indirect effect of brand experience on brand loyalty through brand trust is equal to (0.68 x 0.33) 0.22. The indirect effects of brand experience on brand loyalty are nearly equal. The total effect of brand experience on brand loyalty is roughly equal to (0.20 + 0.22 + 0.29) 0.82. Notably, there are differential effects of brand experience on consumer satisfaction and brand trust, compared to brand loyalty. The direct effect of brand experience of consumer satisfaction (0.74) is higher than the direct effect of brand experience on brand loyalty (0.29). Similarly, the direct effect of brand experience of brand trust (0.68) is higher than the direct effect of brand experience on brand loyalty (0.29). Therefore, brand experience appears to be a stronger predictor of satisfaction and trust. On the other hand, in terms of total effect, brand experience has a more powerful effect (0.82) on brand loyalty, compared to the total effects of satisfaction and trust (0.60) put together.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>This study focuses on the relationship between brand experience, consumer satisfaction, brand trust and brand loyalty. Specifically, this study tries to demonstrate that brand experience not only affects brand trust in the virtual world 66 , but also in the physical world. In addition, this study also examines the mentioned relationships in the context of a pool of four different brands (two durable goods brands -Apple and Sony, Playstation; and two fast moving consumer goods brands -Coca Cola and Nike) to get an overall view. Therefore, the proposed structural model was tested for the pool of brands and was not tested separately for the individual brands included in the study.</p><p>The results of the study indicates that the brand experience scale is a valid and reliable measure and consists of four dimensions: sensory, affective, behavioural and intellectual. This finding shows parallelism with the findings of Brakus et al. 67  and Zarantonello and Schmitt 68 . Although cultural differences have the potential to have an effect on marketing variables, the results of this study shows the validity and reliability of the brand experience scale and therefore, supports the fact that the brand experience scale could be used in a different country, Turkey in particular.</p><p>Another important finding of this study is that brand experience has a significant and direct, positive effect on brand trust. Consumers are likely to choose the brand they trust because trust reduces risk and ambiguity 69 . Therefore, brand trust leads to brand loyalty 70 . This finding is important, especially for firms that have the intention of establishing long term relationships between consumers and their brands, as it shows that they have to gain the trust of their consumers to achieve this goal 71 . From this perspective, it could be said that brand trust is one of the fundamental antecedents of brand loyalty. According to Hofstede 72 risk aversion is one of the five criteria which is used to separate one culture from another. Thus risk aversion could be effective on consumers' buying decisions. Especially in emerging markets such as Turkey which has a very high risk aversion level, reliable brands are preferred since they carry low risk. In other words, Turkish consumers tend to choose reliable brands. Therefore it could be said that brand trust is an important antecedent in building brand loyalty. The findings of this study shows that, the effect of brand experience and brand trust on brand loyalty is nearly equal. However, brand experience has an indirect effect on brand loyalty through brand trust which means, in terms of total effects that 66 <ref type="bibr">Ha and Perks,</ref> 67  68 <ref type="bibr">Zarantonello and Schmitt,</ref> 69  Arjun Chaudhuri and Morris B.

Hofstede, Culture's consequences: International differences in work-related values, <ref type="bibr">Newbury Park, CA., Sage, 1980.</ref> brand experience has a greater effect on brand loyalty. As a result it has been deduced that brand experience is a crucial antecedent of brand loyalty.</p><p>This study has demonstrated that brand experience has a direct and positive effect on consumer satisfaction and brand loyalty. Also brand experience indirectly affects brand loyalty through consumer satisfaction. More specifically, the results indicate that the effect of brand experience on consumer satisfaction and brand trust is nearly equal. However, the effect of brand experience on consumer satisfaction and brand trust is stronger than the effect of brand experience on brand loyalty. These findings differ from Brakus et al. 73 in terms of the size of the effect of brand experience on consumer satisfaction and brand loyalty. Their study shows that, the effect of brand experience on consumer satisfaction and brand loyalty is nearly equal, but consumer satisfaction has a more pronounced effect on brand loyalty compared to brand experience. However, the results of this study may be related to the natural relationship between experience and satisfaction. Many scholars 74 have acknowledged experience as a determinant of satisfaction. Since experience is one of the key determinants of satisfaction, it is necessary to know the level of experience of that person as well as his/her expectation, need and purpose 75 . Similarly, the results demonstrate that brand experience is a stronger predictor of consumer satisfaction and can be regarded as a key determinant of satisfaction. Additionally, this research indicates that consumer satisfaction directly and positively affects brand loyalty. Likewise, brand trust directly and positively affects brand loyalty. These results are consistent with the findings of the preview research 76 in terms of the effects of consumer satisfaction and brand trust 77 on brand loyalty. veloping country. For comparison of results, it is recommended that further research is conducted in other developing countries.</p><p>The second limitation of the study is the use of convenience sampling as the sampling technique. The results of the current study pertains only to the sample of concern and cannot be generalized to the whole population. Random sampling would be more appropriate for generalizing the results. However, the selection of relevant participants was carried out with great care by using filter questions.</p><p>The third limitation of the study is the inclusion of only four brands. Future studies should replicate this study using other brands, especially service related ones as this study used only physical product brands. This would allow the comparison of the effects of brand experience on brand trust, brand satisfaction and brand loyalty for product and service related brands. It should also be noted that for this study analysis was conducted for the pool of the four brands and not for the brands individually. Hence, future studies may focus on the effects of brand experience on brand trust, brand satisfaction and brand loyalty taking into account the differences of brands according to durability and/or involvement.</p><p>This study is a cross-sectional study and thus examines short-term effects of brand experience on consumer satisfaction, brand trust and brand loyalty. By using longitudinal research, further research could focus on long term effects of brand experience, especially its effects on customer life time value. In other words, further research could examine whether brand experience builds customer equity or not 78 .</p><p>The current study examines the relationships between brand experience, consumer satisfaction, brand trust and brand loyalty. However, there is a need to have a greater understanding of the impact of brand experience either on the aforementioned concepts or on other brand related concepts. Hence, further research should examine relationships between brand experience and other concepts such as brand involvement, brand attachment, brand reputation, brand equity, brand value and brand relationship quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>Present consumers are not only interested in the functional attributes of products, but they also are interested in the experiences that they have with these products. Consumers want to have feelings, sensations or good memories about brands. In short, they want to purchase products that deliver experience. Consumer experience, consumption experience, shopping experience or service experience have provided valuable insights to understand the way consumers have experiences with products. However, conceptualisation of brand experience and developing a valid scale for its measurement have revealed new insights to manage satisfaction, trust, personality, loyalty or other brand related situations. Therefore, the concept of brand experience has begun to be valued by both practitioners and scholars.</p><p>This study demonstrates that brand experience directly and positively affects consumer satisfaction, brand trust and brand loyalty. In addition, brand experience has an indirect impact on brand loyalty through both consumer satisfaction and brand trust. More specifically, the direct effect of brand experience on consumer satisfaction and brand trust is more than its direct effect on brand loyalty. On the other hand, in terms of total effects, brand experience has a greater effect on brand loyalty than the total effect of consumer satisfaction and brand trust put together. In short, this study reveals that brand experience is a significant antecedent of consumer satisfaction, brand trust and brand loyalty. Therefore, it is suggested that, brand experience should be subject to further examination in terms of its antecedents and consequences. [X]' is a brand name that meets my expectations 2.
