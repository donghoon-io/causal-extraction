<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lele (2018)</ref>, the twenty-first century is dominated by Asian countries, due to the rapid development in culture, politics, technology, and economics in those nations. Various Asian countries are fortifying their space investments, and smaller states within the region are showing ambitions of establishing national space programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lele, 2018)</ref>. The broad mission of those programs is to establish/observe the remote-sensing, meteorology, communications, artificial intelligence, as well as navigation technology for the programs. Meanwhile, space tourism is also becoming a potential industry that has attracted the attention of governments, businesses and tourists <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Olya &amp; Han, 2020)</ref>. Certain Asian countries (e.g., Japan, India, China, Singapore) have shown the greatest public interest and demand for space travel <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(DePasquale et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lele, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>China is a leader in space exploration among Asian countries, since China became a spacefaring state in 1970 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lele, 2018)</ref>. In 2018, China has launched more than 300 satellites and currently operates 200 satellites in space, and these numbers are higher than other comparable Asian countries, such as Japan, India, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lele, 2018)</ref>. More specifically, China has developed human spaceflight and counter space anti-satellite weapon capability, joining the U.S. and Russia as the only other countries with such capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fisher, 2008)</ref>. Chinese consumers have displayed a high interest in the space tourism market. Le <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Goff and Moreau (2013)</ref> conducted a demand analysis of suborbital space tourism found that China is a sizable market starting with 600 customers, that could reach 128,500 clients by 2030. Specifically, the Chinese and the Americans showed the most promise as potential clients for space tourism <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Olya &amp; Han, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Traditionally, space tourism enables the country or company with the capability of operating a space program to date, to make millions of dollars by selling seats on their rockets to private companies and private citizens <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ormrod &amp; Dickens, 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Olya and Han (2020)</ref> stated that orbital and suborbital markets are the two main types of space tourism. Today, private space industries in some parts of the world are keen to make investments in projects involving space tourism <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lele, 2018)</ref>. A number of companies are competing in the space tourism area, such as Space X, XCOR, Blue Origin, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ormrod &amp; Dickens, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Webber, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>It is clear that there is a paucity of empirical research models that investigate the behavioral intention of space travelers <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Olya &amp; Han, 2020)</ref>. Most of the previous studies investigated space tourism from an outer space orientation perspective of tourists <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ormrod &amp; Dickens, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Webber, 2019)</ref>. There is no research to date, related to tourists' perception toward indoor space tourism (i.e., space-launch destination tourism). One potential reason for such research is that although space tourism is relatively new for some countries (e.g., Asian countries), there is a potential to develop an ecosystem to support this kind of tourism activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lele, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The theory of planned behavior model (TPB) is one of most popular theories to predict an individual's intention in various tourism studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Soliman, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang &amp; Wong, 2020)</ref>. Unfortunately, there is no research that has applied the TPB in explaining a tourist's decision-making process by considering its relationship with other critical underlying factors that form a tourist's intention toward space-launch tourism. There is no research that examine the relative importance of immediate volitional and nonvolitional antecedent variables in the prediction of tourist's intention to participate in space-launch tourism.</p><p>Some scholars suggested that one's positive or negative views or perceived conceptions of novel products or service are influenced by significant referents (e.g., close-friends, relatives, colleagues). This can lead to a favorable or unfavorable attitude, which result in a high or low intention in highly collectivistic countries (e.g., China, Korea, Japan) <ref type="bibr">(Wang &amp; Wong, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wang et al., 2019)</ref>. This corresponds to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bashir et al. (2019)</ref>'s view that although the existing practices within TPB does not confirm any role of mediation among its principle-independent constructs, the possibility of mediation cannot be ignored in some circumstances. Certain studies investigated the correlation between subjective norm and attitude and confirmed that subjective norm had a positive influence on attitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Paul et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wang et al., 2019)</ref>. However, there is no study that explores the relationship between subjective norm and attitude of consumers in the space tourism literature.</p><p>Furthermore, many researchers have suggested that a tourist's motivation should be included in the TPB model to predict his/her intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Durán et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ulker-Demirel &amp; Ciftci, 2020)</ref>. Hedonic motivation has been considered as a supplementary condition to enhance the application of cognitive-rational process <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Yeo et al., 2017)</ref>. Nevertheless, there is a little knowledge about the motivations involved in space tourism <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Olya &amp; Han, 2020)</ref>, and there is room for further investigation into different kinds of tourism activities. In addition, it is rare to find studies that compare the predictive power between original TPB model and the modified TPB model with an additional construct (i.e., hedonic motivation) in a tourism context.</p><p>This study examines the validity of the uses of the theory of TPB model combined with a motivation aspect (i.e., hedonic motivation) to explain the tourists' intention toward space-launch tourism. Three major research objectives are therefore proposed: (1) to determine the relationship between components of TPB and tourist's intention toward space-launch tourism; (2) to determine the relationship between hedonic motivation and tourist's intention toward space-launch tourism; and (3) to compare the predictive capability between the original TPB model, modified model and the proposed model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The space-launch destination tourism -wenchang spacecraft launch site</head><p>There are five Chinese satellite launch centers in China, which are Jiuquan Satellite launch center; Taiyuan satellite launch center; Xichang satellite launch center; Wenchang spacecraft launch site (WSLS); and China eastern space port (under construction). Except for China eastern space port, other satellite launch centers are located on the land. The WSLS is the newest space launch center among other land-based space launch centers, which started construction in 2009 and was completed in 2016. The WSLS is located in Hainan, which is in southernmost China. It is bounded on the north by Guangdong, on the west by Vietnam, on the east by Taiwan, and on the southeast and south by the Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia. It is famous for its tourism natural resources, such as its beach, ocean and tropical fruits. The WSLS is fully open to domestic tourists since March 2016. The WSLS allows tourists to visit the launch tower, launch site, aircraft assembly plant, rocket vertical assembly test plant, command hall, observation room, and remote ignition and launch court. The WSLS also permits visitors to view aerospace models, an aerospace science exhibition, and three dimensions (3D) movies in its visitors' center. There is a space-theme park that also provides the opportunity for tourists to not only learn about space-related science, but also to enjoy its natural attractions. According to Mafengwo Travel Agency (2020), (the largest Chinese usergenerated content tourism website) the WSLS is the fifth most popular destination for tourists to visit in Hainan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Intention to visit wenchang spacecraft launch site</head><p>Researchers have widely used and adapted the TPB model to predict tourists' intentions in various tourism marketing literature, such as visa exemption travel <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Han et al., 2011)</ref>, green hotel selection <ref type="bibr">(Wang &amp; Wong, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wang &amp; Zhang, 2020)</ref>, religious tourism <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wang et al., 2020c)</ref>, destination visit intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Soliman, 2019)</ref>, and many others. The core of TPB supports intention as the most important antecedent of behavior, whereby Wang (2020) has described intention as an individual's cognitive motivation to utilize effort in performing a specific behavior. In terms of marketing, intention is the single most important predictor of an individual's actual behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1975)</ref>, and is considered a precursor and the best predictor of actual behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wang et al., 2019)</ref>. Some researchers argued that an individual's actual behavior is not always equivalent to his/her behavioral intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wang et al., 2020c</ref><ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., , 2020a))</ref>. However, many studies' results demonstrated that intention has a high reliability for predicting the decision-making processes of a tourist <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Paul et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Wang et al., 2020b)</ref>. Therefore, intention to visit space-launch place tourism (i.e., WSLS) as a dependent variable is sufficiently justified for this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Attitude toward intention</head><p>Undoubtedly, attitude has the most predictive capacity compared to other factors that determine one's behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1977)</ref>. Specifically, attitude always plays the most important and consistent role in explaining an individual's intention and behavior compared to other components (i.e., subjective norm, perceived behavioral control) in TPB model <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Wang et al., 2020b)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Wang et al. (2020a)</ref>, attitude can be described as the extent to which an individual has a positive or negative evaluation of a given behavior. It reflects one's psychological evaluation process of a specific product or service when he/she engages with it within a certain purchasing behavior <ref type="bibr">(Wang &amp; Wong, 2020)</ref>. It can represent an individual's consistently favorable or unfavorable evaluation, tendencies and feelings toward any particular thought or behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wang et al., 2019)</ref>. Therefore, when individuals have a more positive attitude toward a specific behavior, it will strengthen their intention to perform the behavior, and vice-versa <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wang et al., 2020c)</ref>.</p><p>Certain studies on tourism marketing have demonstrated how attitude positively influences intention and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jaiswal &amp; Kant, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Teeroovengadum, 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wang (2020)</ref> found that attitude positively affected intention in the context of green hotel selection in the China. <ref type="bibr">Han et al. (2017)</ref> adopted the modified TPB model and found that attitude positively affected intention in the emerging bicycle tourism. Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Soliman (2019)</ref> reported similar results in Egypt, where attitude significantly affected tourism destination revisit intention. Therefore, the following hypothesis was proposed:</p><p>H1: There is a positive relationship between attitude and intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Subjective Norm (SN) toward intention</head><p>SN refers to social norm or peer influence in the marketing literature. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ajzen (1991)</ref>, SN is the driving social force of deciding on whether or not to perform a certain behavior. It is an influence on one's decision-making from the perceived opinions of significant others (e.g., relatives, close friends, coworkers, or business partners). Thus, SN is a feeling or moral obligation of an individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wang et al., 2019)</ref>, while it represents a function of an individual's normative beliefs about what significant others think he/she should or should not to do <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Han and Stoel (2017)</ref> stated that SN seems to be the weakest component of TPB in past studies. However, Ulker-Demirel and Ciftci (2020) demonstrated that SN may function as a source of social pressure and have the potential to encourage individuals to change their behaviors in different settings at a macro level.</p><p>Numerous studies on tourism marketing have shown how SN positively influences intention and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Liu et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang &amp; Wong, 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Wang and Wong (2020)</ref> adopted the TPB model and found that SN positively affected intention in the context of environmentally friendly hotel selection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kim and Kim (2018)</ref> found that the SN positively affected intention toward food festival attendees among U.S consumers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Soliman (2019)</ref> reported that the SN positively influenced tourism destination revisit intention. Thus, the following hypothesis was proposed: H2: There is a positive relationship between SN and intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Subjective norm (SN) toward attitude</head><p>Some studies have highlighted a significant causative relationship from SN to attitude, and subsequently, behavioral intention (T. B. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chen &amp; Chai, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wang et al., 2019)</ref>, while other studies suggested that attitude has a mediating role between SN and intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Han et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang &amp; Wong, 2020)</ref>. These findings diverge from the original formulation of the TPB model. <ref type="bibr">Wang and Wong (2020)</ref> mentioned that for researchers who propose the TPB as the underpinning theory for their studies on Asian consumers, should consider eastern countries such as China, Japan, and Korea as highly collectivistic societies when compared with most western countries. Researchers must therefore consider the role of subjective norm in influencing consumers' attitudes on purchasing novel products or services. Consumers from these eastern high collectivistic countries are more likely to share their positive or negative experiences regarding unfamiliar or novel products or services with important others (e.g., close-friends, colleagues, relatives, worshippers) that lead to high or low level of purchase intention or behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wang et al., 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wang et al. (2019)</ref> demonstrated a significant influence of SN on attitude among 261 hotel customers, while <ref type="bibr">Wang and Wong (2020)</ref> also reported that SN positively and indirectly influenced intention via attitude of visiting green hotels. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Teng et al. (2015)</ref> adopted the TPB model and found that SN positively affected attitude to visit hotels in Taiwan, China. Following these findings, the following hypotheses were proposed to account for attitude: H3: There is a positive relationship between SN and attitude. H4: Attitude mediates the relationship between SN and intention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Wang et al. (2020b)</ref> stated that certain studies have shown that PBC cannot lead to purchase intention and behavior because if a particular behavior is under full volitional control, PBC will not influence intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Paul et al., 2016)</ref>. However, PBC is a particular important predictor in the TPB model, because of its high explanatory power in situation characterized by high behavioral cost and strong constraints, e.g., time, inconvenience, money compared to normative-orientation theories (e.g., value-belief-norm theory of environmentalism, norm-activation model) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Steg &amp; Vlek, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC) toward intention</head><p>PBC refers to an individual's perception of how difficult it is to perform a specific behavior <ref type="bibr">(Wang &amp; Wong, 2020)</ref> and to an individual's perceived ability to perform a certain behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Botetzagias et al., 2015)</ref>. Thus, the more an individual is able to have control over any obstacles, the more possibilities he/she will be engaged in the giving behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wang et al., 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Nimri et al. (2019)</ref> found that PBC positively affected the intention to visit green hotels in Australia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Soliman (2019)</ref> found that PBC was positively associated with the intention to revisit a destination. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Paul et al. (2016)</ref> reported that PBC positively affected the intention to purchase green products in the U.S. Based on above considerations, the following hypothesis was proposed: H5: There is a positive relationship between PBC and intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">Anticipate hedonic motivation toward intention</head><p>Recently, some researchers demonstrated the limitations and criticisms leveled against the TPB model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Durán et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ulker-Demirel &amp; Ciftci, 2020)</ref>. One of the criticisms of using TPB is on its focus on rational reasoning and its lack of subconscious, associative and impulse factors, feelings, and private standards (Ulker-Demirel &amp; Ciftci, 2020). TPB is a behavioral theory based on a causal process, and while it is extremely rationalistic with regard to decision-making, it is at the same time, neglecting motivational and emotional elements, such as unconscious motives and spontaneous choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Yuzhanin &amp; Fisher, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The construct of hedonic motivation is a function of an individual's affect. In contrast with previous studies which viewed that shopping behavior is a rational process of acquiring products <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Yeo et al., 2017)</ref>, hedonism may be representing an irrational process toward shopping for goods or experiencing of services, such as the desire to have fun, be playful <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Yeo et al., 2017)</ref>, or to feel better <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lindenberg, 2001)</ref>. When consumers search for a particular product or service, they are also seeking expected sensory stimulation, comfort, status, affection, symbolism, and behavioral confirmation during the purchasing and usage process <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lindenberg, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Yeo et al., 2017)</ref>. Therefore, hedonic motivation would increase/decrease one's arousal and increase/decrease pleasantness <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lindenberg, 2001)</ref>. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Yeo et al. (2017)</ref> indicated that hedonic motivation does not replace the traditional consumption theories, but rather working as an extension to enhance the application of consumption theories. Only when feelings become the center of an individual's attention, it will be an appropriate precondition <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lindenberg, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Certain studies postulated the significant role of hedonic motivation in influencing tourists and consumers behavior in different settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ingham et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lindenberg &amp; Steg, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Yeo et al. (2017)</ref> found that hedonic motivation positively affected convenience motivation and post-usage usefulness; ultimately resulting in behavioral intention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lindenberg and Steg (2013)</ref> reported that hedonic motivation positively influenced and dominated green purchase behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Miao and Wei (2013)</ref> found that the hedonic motivation positively influenced intention to visit environmental-friendly hotels selection. Therefore, the following hypothesis was proposed for testing:</p><p>H6: There is a positive relationship between anticipate hedonic motivation and intention. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> 3. Methodology</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Research paradigm</head><p>In this study, the positivism philosophical paradigm was adopted through the deductive approach to undertake empirical research and to test the hypotheses. The results obtained were to confirm or reject the relationships of the behaviors, leading to the further development of knowledge in this domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Saunders et al., 2011)</ref>. This research was considered to be exploratory in nature, given its concern in understanding what was occurring, and to explore new insights and to evaluate phenomena in a new research domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Saunders et al., 2011)</ref>. A survey was undertaken to answer the questions, and this research design was considered a cross-sectional study due to time and cost constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Measures</head><p>A self-administered, closed-ended format questionnaire was adopted in this research that incorporates a set of verified scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(De Vaus, 2013)</ref>. This method of data collection enabled greater geographical coverage, cost savings, involves less pressure, provides anonymity, allows for quicker collection, and reduces levels of bias when compared with the interview technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Saunders et al., 2011)</ref>. The questionnaire consisted of three sections. The first section included the independent variables; three items belonging to subjective norm, and three items belonging to perceived behavioral control were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Han et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Wang and Wong (2020)</ref>; and 3 items belonging to anticipate hedonic motivation were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Yeo et al. (2017)</ref>. The second section included the dependent variable: attitude and intention, of which four items belonging to attitude were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wang (2020)</ref>, and 3 items belonging to intention were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wang et al. (2019)</ref>. The third section addressed the demographic characteristics. A five-point Likert scale was adopted, as a 5-or 7-point Likert scale would more likely produce slightly higher mean scores within the highest possible attainable score compared and makes comparing data much easier <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dawes, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Data collection</head><p>The non-probability sampling method was employed. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Saunders et al. (2011)</ref>, in social science research, researchers generally have difficulty acquiring an accurate sampling frame from organizations and companies or difficulty locating appropriate respondents in order to answer the research questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sekaran, 2006</ref>).</p><p>An online/web-based sampling method was employed to collect data due to the advantages of this data collection method. For instance, the data can be collected irrespective of the geographic location of respondents; the high speed of data collection; low cost; instant access to a broader audience; and better access to unique populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wang et al., 2019)</ref>. Another important reason in adopting online sampling is that as in March 2020, there were over 904 million individuals noted as regular internet users in China. Interestingly, over 64.5% of the Chinese population were internet users <ref type="bibr">(China Internet Network Information Center, 2020)</ref>. A number of consumer consumption studies have adopted an online sampling technique to collect the required data that met their expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kumar &amp; Sreen, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang &amp; Wong, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>This research developed and posted the research questionnaire in Chinese, on the website, <ref type="url" target="https://www.wenjuan.com">https://www.wenjuan.com</ref>, between August 1 and September 31, 2020. This free online survey questionnaire collection website is extremely popular among consumers, businesses, and organizations in China, where it frequently serves as the first option in the collection of primary survey data related to internet users <ref type="bibr">(Wang &amp; Wong, 2020)</ref>. Considering space tourism is new to the Chinese, there are no restrictions on any netizens to complete the questionnaires. An amount of five RMB/per respondent was offered as an incentive to increase the response rate from potential participants who normally browse through the website for prizes, or they may be invited to complete a questionnaire on the website via Tencent QQ and WeChat.</p><p>For this research, the limited reasonable sample size of 384 respondents was obtained based on Cochran's formula when the target population is unknown or infinite in number <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Sarmah et al., 2013)</ref>. As for this study, 444 responses were considered for analysis, which was higher than the recommended values for most types of research. A pilot test was conducted involving 30 respondents to ensure that the questionnaire was usable and valid and to reduce any issues that may negatively impact the results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Confirmatory factor analysis</head><p>For assessing the internal reliability of this research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hair et al. (2010)</ref> suggested a Cronbach's Alpha values of 0.7 and above to be treated as acceptable. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hair et al. (2010)</ref>, the rule of thumb for assessing the practical significance of standardized factor loadings must be at least 0.5 or higher; ideally 0.7 or higher. All of the factor loadings for this research were more than 0.7. For the convergent validity of the measurement model, the composite reliability (CR) should be greater than 0.7, and the average variance extracted (AVE) should be greater than 0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hair et al., 2010)</ref> (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>The discriminant validity was assessed by considering the maximum shared squared variance (MSV), and the average shared squared variance (ASV) which should be less than AVE <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Byrne, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hair et al., 2010)</ref>. The correlation between the different variables must be less than 0.9 in the measurement model <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Meyers et al., 2006)</ref>. Thus, discriminant validity was established (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>Next, the study ensued with the assessment of model fit. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ho (2006)</ref>, at least three indices must be met in order to ensure model fit. In the model fit summary, the chi-square divided by the df value (CMIN/DF) was 1.35, which was below 3.0, and therefore, accepted as a good model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hair et al., 2010)</ref>. Besides, GFI = 0.962, CFI = 990, AGFI = 0.945, PGFI = 0.665, NFI = 0.962, IFI = 0.99, RMR = 0.044, PNFI = 0.753, PCFI = 0.775, RMSEA = 0.03, all of which met with the recommended thresholds. Thus, the model fit in this research was achieved.      </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Structural model estimation</head><p>The next step was to perform SEM using the structural model and testing the hypotheses. The overall goodness-of-fit indices of the structural model were: CMIN/DF = 3.282, AGFI = 0.868, PGFI = 0.658, CFI = 0.929, GFI = 0.904, IFI = 0.93, NFI = 0.902, PNFI = 0.744, PCFI = 0.766, RMSEA = 0.076. again, the values showed a good fit with the structural model and the outcomes tabulated in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, accordingly.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion and implications</head><p>This study examined the extended framework of the TPB model, in which anticipated hedonic motivation was added into the TPB together with attitude, SN, and PBC as antecedents of tourists' intention to visit a spacecraft-launch site tourism destination, and to identify the mediating role of attitude in the relationship between SN and intention. In previous studies, attitude has been proven to be the one of the most important predictor leading to one's intention and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Paul et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wang et al., 2019)</ref>. This means that the more positive attitude consumers have, the stronger consumers' intention to visit the Wenchang spacecraft launch site as travel destination.</p><p>In support of the findings reported by <ref type="bibr">Wang and Wong (2020)</ref>, there is a positive relationship found between SN and attitude, and attitude mediates the relationship between SN and intention. M.-F. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chen and Tung (2014)</ref> mentioned that SN has a positive influence on intention in marketing, and in some circumstances, SN has been shown to have a significant influence on intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lee, 2008)</ref>. Space-launch tourism is a novel concept that has just been introduced in China and has met with some practical challenges as the Chinese consumers' concerns and understanding of space-launch tourism are still low. Being a highly collectivistic society <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2020a)</ref> the effect of peer influence is more important in China when compared to consumers in western countries. In China, the individuals' close friends, relatives, coworkers/colleagues, or business partners can have a significant influence on their intention to visit a space-launch tourism site.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wang et al. (2019)</ref>, consumers' purchase intention is positively influenced by PBC. PBC is the most important predictor influencing consumer purchase intention if a particular behavior is not under full volitional control <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Paul et al., 2016)</ref>. This study confirmed that there is a significant positive relationship between PBC and intention. As such, the perceived ease of performing certain actions can be effectively highlighted in promoting favorable attitudes toward space-launch tourism visitation, resulting in more effective marketing of the space-launch destination tourism concept.</p><p>Anticipate hedonic motivation shows a positive association with intention in this study. The findings showed that the tourists' behavior is not just a rational process of acquiring products/services with a work mentality <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Yeo et al., 2017)</ref>, but they are seeking expected sensory stimulation and affection during the engagement process. Tourists are willing to engage in any novel kind of tourism activities (e.g., space-launch tourism), which can lead to an increase in tourists' arousal and pleasantness.</p><p>In addition, this research showed that the hypothesized model has more predictive capacity compared to the original TPB model and modified model. When the hedonism variable is removed from the hypothesized model, the interrelationship between attitude, SN and intention is affected significantly with the R-square value showing a decrease from 0.447 to 0.428 and 0.426 for the TPB model and modified model, respectively. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kumar et al. (2017)</ref>, the flexible nature of the TPB model allows the means to explore the impact of other contextual variables (e.g., motivational variables) which might help to explain an individual's intention and behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Theoretical contributions</head><p>First, although TPB is most widely used as the underpinning theory in tourism literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ulker-Demirel &amp; Ciftci, 2020)</ref>, the TPB model ignores the influence of unconscious and motivational or emotional elements on consumers behavior <ref type="bibr">(Ajzen &amp; Dasgupta, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Durán et al., 2016)</ref>. Many researchers suggested that a tourist's motivational and emotional elements should be included in the TPB model to predict one's intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Durán et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ulker-Demirel &amp; Ciftci, 2020)</ref>, because consumers' behaviors is an irrational process of acquiring stimulation with implosive emotion. Specifically, hedonic motivation is a supplementary condition that can enhance the application of the cognitiverational process <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Yeo et al., 2017)</ref> which influences an individual's purchase predisposition, such as his/her interactions, intentions, behaviors and so forth. This study confirmed that anticipate hedonic motivation significantly influenced tourists' intention to visit Wenchang spacecraft launch site, and it does not replace the role of traditional consumption theories (i.e., components of TPB), but rather working as an extension of consumption theories.</p><p>Second, although the existing TPB model does not confirm any role of mediation by its principle-independent constructs, the possibility of mediation cannot be ignored <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bashir et al., 2019)</ref>. Researchers cannot ignore the causal relationship between SN and attitude of consumers in highly collectivistic cultures <ref type="bibr">(Wang &amp; Wong, 2020)</ref>. This study confirmed the findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wang et al. (2019)</ref> that there is a significant relationship between SN and attitude, which can result in intention. Researchers must consider the role of SN in influencing consumers' attitudes on purchasing novel tourism products or services as consumers from highly collectivistic countries are more likely to share the positive or negative experiences regarding unfamiliar or novel products or service with important others that lead to high or low level of intention or behavior.</p><p>Third, this study is one of the first papers to explain the relationship between anticipated hedonic motivation and components of the TPB (i.e., attitude, SN, PBC) using the highly rigorous method of SEM in exploring the effect of antecedents on spacelaunch destination tourism activities. The study's results indicate that there is a significant relationship between attitude, SN, PBC, and anticipated hedonic motivation and intention to visit the Wenchang spacecraft launch site. The modified model's (with the added anticipated hedonic motivation into TPB) explanatory power for intention is similar with the original TPB model (R-square = 0.426 for modified model V.S. R-square = 0.428 for original TPB model). However, the modified model provides more exhaustive explanation for intention to visit Wenchang spacecraft launch site as a travel destination, while the anticipated hedonic motivation is the second important predictor in the modified model. These relationships are particularly important for some regions or countries that have highly developed space programs such as China, Japan, U.S. Russian, etc, because most previous studies have investigated space tourism activities from an outer space orientation perspective. There is no research yet that examine tourists' perceptions toward space-launch destination tourism. Our results provide a basic understanding of why potential tourists will visit a spacecraft launch site destination based on their volitional, non-volitional and motivational aspects.</p><p>Finally, this study provides a revised conceptual framework (i.e., proposed model) based on the TPB model for academics to investigate tourists' intention to visit a spacecraft launch site who come from highly collectivistic countries (e.g., China, Korea, Japan, India). The results showed the proposed model had more explanatory power (R-square = 0.447) compared to the modified model and the original TPB model. These results are important to eastern space tourism literature, because there is a lot of room for improvement in investigating space tourism in Asia. Researchers should not only consider the influence of motivational aspects on intention, but also need to take into account the relationship between SN and attitude based on TPB model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Practical implications</head><p>This study raises some practical implications for the novel space-launch tourism activities. The empirical results showed that the influence of tourist's attitude and PBC are significant in predicting their intention. This means that Chinese tourists who have more positive attitudes will develop stronger intentions to visit the Wenchang spacecraft launch site as their travel destination. They will have more confidence to control nonrational factors or overcome obstacles (e.g., time, money) that may influence their spacelaunch tourism behaviors. Space-related tourism marketers are encouraged to disseminate space knowledge and perspectives via formal and informal communication channels while focusing on creating a positive space tourism image for potential tourists.</p><p>As mentioned in previous studies, a higher level of SN will help to influence one's intention and behavior <ref type="bibr">(Wang &amp; Wong, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wang et al., 2019)</ref>. It means that when an individual develops a positive concept of space-launch tourism activities, it will result in a high level of intention to visit this kind of tourism destination. Therefore, space-related tourism managers should develop more effective product and advertising strategies to promote their space tourism activities to the public, such as creating greater awareness for their rocket launch activities schedule and other attractions available at the launch site.</p><p>Moreover, Chinese tourists have expressed great interest in engaging in space-related activities. They also possess a high hedonic motivation toward any novel tourism activity. The fun or entertaining element in any specific form of tourism (e.g., space-launch tourism) can be transferred to one's intention via creating more enjoyable experiences through customer interaction. Thus, marketers can devise strategies to encourage tourists' interaction to enhance the tourist's experience which will possibly strengthen a tourist's intention to visit a space-launch tourism destination. Space-related education should be considered a marketing tool for managers, because information on new space technologies and sciences would attract more potential space tourists to visit the site in order to satisfy their curiosity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Limitations</head><p>First, although the application and use of online surveys have become more prevalent, adopting this approach has various disadvantages, such as non-users may not be included. Specifically, the majority of respondents (54.3%) aged between 18 and 30. The reason is that the generation Y (born between 1980 and 1995) and generation Z (born between 1995 and 2010) are the most frequent internet users. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kusumawati et al. (2019)</ref>, technology is part of Generation Y's everyday life, and generation Z has never lived without the internet. Thus, it is not surprising that the majority of the respondents were young, which is another limitation for this study. Second, this study solely measured the tourists' intention; despite the argument of many researchers that intention is the single most important predictor of an individuals' actual behavior, a consumer's actual behavior is not always caused by his/her attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wang et al., 2019)</ref>. Therefore, future research should measure tourists' actual visit behaviors in this research area. In addition, this research has been conducted with a very limited scope, specifically on the Wenchang spacecraft launch site in China. Thus, the results can only be applicable to China's Wenchang area and cannot be generalized to other districts and countries. The proposed model used in this study should be reproduced and tested in other regions to further confirm its validity and usefulness. Finally, demographic characteristic is one of the most widely used methods to segment and predict tourists' behavior <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2020a)</ref>. Further research should consider the influence of demographic characteristics on tourists' behavior to visit spacelaunch tourism destination.</p></div>
