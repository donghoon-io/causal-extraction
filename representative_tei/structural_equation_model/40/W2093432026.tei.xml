<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Objective. To develop and validate a survey instrument designed to measure team dynamics in primary care. Data Sources/Study Setting. We studied 1,080 physician and nonphysician health care professionals working at 18 primary care practices participating in a learning collaborative aimed at improving team-based care. Study Design. We developed a conceptual model and administered a cross-sectional survey addressing team dynamics, and we assessed reliability and discriminant validity of survey factors and the overall survey's goodness-of-fit using structural equation modeling. Data Collection. We administered the survey between September 2012 and March 2013. Principal Findings. Overall response rate was 68 percent (732 respondents). Results support a seven-factor model of team dynamics, suggesting that conditions for team effectiveness, shared understanding, and three supportive processes are associated with acting and feeling like a team and, in turn, perceived team effectiveness. This model demonstrated adequate fit (goodness-of-fit index: 0.91), scale reliability (Cronbach's alphas: 0.71-0.91), and discriminant validity (average factor correlations: 0.49). Conclusions. It is possible to measure primary care team dynamics reliably using a 29-item survey. This survey may be used in ambulatory settings to study teamwork and explore the effect of efforts to improve team-based care. Future studies should demonstrate the importance of team dynamics for markers of team effectiveness (e.g., work satisfaction, care quality, clinical outcomes).</p></div>

Prior research has associated teambased primary care with improved care for patients with specific diagnoses (e.g., diabetes and depression) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Lemieux-Charles and McGuire 2006)</ref>. However, findings have been mixed, given differences in the way teams were designed and implemented. Nevertheless, team-based care has become a key tenet of efforts to transform primary care practices into patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs) (The Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative 2007; National Committee for Quality Assurance 2014), and stakeholders are considering how to structure payments to primary care teams as opposed to individual physicians <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Blumenthal et al. 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Despite heightened interest in improving teams and teamwork, little is known about how to assess team dynamics in ambulatory settings. While several survey instruments measure selected aspects of teamwork (e.g., conditions for team effectiveness), few tools comprehensively capture the team dynamics that evidence suggests may be valuable in ambulatory settings <ref type="bibr">(Valentine, Nembhard, and Edmondson in press)</ref>. Existing measures of teamwork are also either too specific (e.g., focused on geriatric care, targeted to nurses and physicians only) or not specific enough (i.e., thought applicable to any health care setting). Other surveys are designed for non-U.S. settings. Few surveys have measured, and even fewer have satisfied, standard psychometric criteria for validating surveys.</p><p>A survey instrument that measures ambulatory-based team dynamics is needed because teams in these settings face challenges that are less prominent in inpatient care: high rates of patient and provider turnover, wide variation in patient needs, a need for provider coordination within and beyond facility boundaries, and increasing expectations of primary care providers to engage patients in their care. Assessing team dynamics in ambulatory settings would  enable identification of team dynamics most critical for desired health care outcomes, and this would make more targeted interventions possible.</p><p>To address this opportunity, we developed a novel survey that is grounded in an evidence-based conceptual model and draws on previous, psychometrically tested instruments. We administered the survey to all physician and nonphysician health care professionals caring for patients within 18 primary care practices in Massachusetts who are working to improve team-based care as part of a primary care learning collaborative.</p><p>In this paper, we begin by presenting our conceptual model for how to measure team dynamics in ambulatory settings. We then describe the development of the survey instrument, explore its psychometric properties, and discuss implications for the survey, future research, and its application in ambulatory care.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF PRIMARY CARE TEAM DYNAMICS</head><p>Based on research about effective teaming in a variety of health care settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Toseland, Palmer-Ganeles, and Chapman 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Heinemann et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hyer et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Millward and Jeffries 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gittell 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Leipzig et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lemieux-Charles and McGuire 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nagpal et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Schroder et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jesmin, Thind, and Sarma 2012)</ref>, we developed a framework for team dynamics in primary care, which applies to ambulatory settings in general. We define effective team dynamics according to the following criteria: (1) team performance (i.e., the product of teamwork meets the expectations of those who use it); (2) member satisfaction (i.e., each team member's experience contributes to his or her personal well-being and development); and (3) team adaptation (i.e., the team experience enhances each member's capability to work and learn together in the future) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Nadler, Hackman, and Lawler 1979)</ref>. Our conceptual model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>) posits that effective team performance begins with a set of enabling conditions that facilitate teaming. When present, these conditions promote shared understanding and supportive processes, which in turn encourage group members to act and feel like a team. When these conditions are met, group members will report that the care they deliver is more effective and efficient for both patients and professionals. Implied by our conceptual model-though not explored in this paper-is the belief that survey measures of team member perceptions will correspond with objective measures of team effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditions for Team Effectiveness</head><p>Prior research demonstrates that teams are more likely to be effective when certain types of organizational conditions are present <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hackman 1987</ref>,   <ref type="bibr">et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Klein et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Shuffler, DiazGranados, and Salas 2011)</ref>, and patient engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Remmers et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Stacey et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barry and Edgman-Levitan 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Harvey et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hibbard and Greene 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hibbard, Greene, and Overton 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">King and Moulton 2013)</ref>.

A shared understanding of team member roles and responsibilities matters, particularly in the context of interprofessional teams like those in primary care, which frequently include doctors, nurses, medical assistants, and</p><p>The Primary Care Team Dynamics Survey others <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Suter et al. 2009)</ref>. A shared understanding about patients' active participation in decisions about their care, understanding of the care plan, and needs and preferences affects the way team members (which may, according to our survey, include patients themselves) interact with each other. Indeed, an inconsistent understanding about how to engage patients may result in team members delivering very different care, with potential for undermining team dynamics, patient experience, and clinical outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gandhi et al. 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supportive Processes</head><p>Our model emphasizes three processes that support teaming in primary care: accountability, conflict resolution, and communication and information exchange. Prior research has identified the need for teams to establish processes that foster responsibility and accountability for members' actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Weiss and Davis 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baggs 1994)</ref>. Accountability is important because perceived inequalities in team members' share of work lead to conflict and dissatisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Herzberg 1968</ref>). Ensuring that team members contribute their fair share, and holding individual members personally responsible for aspects of the team's task, promotes equity and willingness to exert effort on behalf of team goals (Latan e, Williams, and Harkins 1979; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Katzenbach and Smith 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hill 2001</ref>).</p><p>Effective processes for conflict resolution are also critical for effective teamwork. A healthy amount of task conflict is desirable to explore problems thoroughly and generate novel solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hill 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hill , 2001;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bradford and Cohen 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Leonard-Barton and Swap 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Edmondson, Bohmer, and Pisano 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Garvin and Roberto 2001)</ref>. However, too much task conflict can stress relationships and lead to negative dynamics. Productive conflict management requires a systematic way to refine and critique possible solutions and make decisions in a safe environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hill 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eisenhardt, Kahwajy, and Bourgeois 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Edmondson, Bohmer, and Pisano 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Garvin and Roberto 2001)</ref>. Explicitly framing decisions as a learning process can also reduce unproductive conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Argyris and Sch€ on 1978)</ref>.</p><p>Lastly, communication and information exchange are critical processes for supporting effective teamwork <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Weiss and Davis 1985)</ref>, as they allow the ongoing mutual adjustment that ensures safe and effective care <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Thompson 1967)</ref>. Communication breakdowns are the most common cause of medical errors and adverse events in medicine (The Joint Commission 2013). Teams need systematic approaches for communicating information clearly, compre- hensibly, and reliably <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gandhi et al. 2005)</ref>. Promoting knowledge integration when information is distributed among team members requires deliberate effort to encourage those with less formal authority to speak up <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gardner, Gino, and Staats 2012)</ref>, especially when information is uniquely held <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Stasser, Stewart, and Wittenbaum 1995)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acting and Feeling Like a Team</head><p>Where the conditions for team effectiveness are present, members share an understanding about the team, and they engage in processes that support teaming, our model posits that members will learn to act and feel like a team.</p><p>Acting like a team includes providing and using information from other team members who possess different skills and knowledge, such that they are working interdependently to accomplish tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alexander et al. 2005)</ref>. Feeling like a team means perceiving a collective identity, a "real team," in which members experience a sense of belonging. Team-oriented feelings also include valuing, trusting, and respecting other group members' perspectives and roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Schroder et al. 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived Team Effectiveness</head><p>When team members act and feel like a team, the literature suggests that group members will perceive a higher level of team effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Millward and Jeffries 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kozlowski and Ilgen 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lemieux-Charles and McGuire 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brennan et al. 2013)</ref>. According to our conceptual model, team members may perceive a team to be successful in delivering highly effective and efficient care for patients and enhancing enthusiasm and interest among the professionals on the team <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Heinemann et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hyer et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Leipzig et al. 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Our model suggests that the conditions, understanding, processes, actions/ feelings, and perceptions we have described will be positively associated with perceived team effectiveness (and ultimately with objective measures of team effectiveness) in primary care.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instrument Development</head><p>We developed our survey in conjunction with a 2-year primary care learning collaborative at Harvard-affiliated practices called the Academic Innovations</p><p>The Primary Care Team Dynamics Survey Collaborative (AIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bitton et al. 2014)</ref>. One of the key objectives of the AIC was for participating practices to establish "teams" (if they did not already have them) and improve team dynamics. We first reviewed proposals from primary care practices participating in the learning collaborative to understand how they envisioned developing team-based care within their practices.</p><p>We also studied the proposed learning collaborative curriculum. In addition, we examined a variety of survey instruments, including those discussed in a recent systematic review of teamwork surveys in health care settings (Valentine, Nembhard, and Edmondson in press) and others suggested by investigators and learning collaborative members <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Heinemann et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hyer et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Leipzig et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mahoney and Turkovich 2010</ref>; National Committee for Quality Assurance 2011; <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Schroder et al. 2011)</ref>. Of these, we selected 10 survey instruments whose content best reflected the constructs in our conceptual model. From these, we selected groups of items that best or uniquely reflected the dimensions in our model, retaining a comprehensive and nonredundant set of items. In selecting items to represent each factor, we chose among surveys rather than combining items from multiple surveys, maintaining original survey constructs as much as possible. We conducted a series of expert reviews and carried out cognitive interviews with attending physicians, nurses, and front desk staff to test targeted respondents' understanding of survey items (e.g., comprehensibility for staff with high-school education levels or those who were nonnative-English speakers). On the basis of these interviews, we modified survey items mostly in minor ways (e.g., wrote items at the sixth grade literacy level). We also dropped items that interviewees suggested were not applicable in the context of ambulatory care (e.g., "I feel physically safe within this hospital environment").</p><p>The administered survey included 31 items measuring the five factors represented in our conceptual model and four demographic items assessing respondent gender, age, race, and ethnicity. Except as noted, all items used a five-point Likert response scale, ranging from 1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree. Appendix SA2 describes the content and origin of each domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and Data Collection</head><p>The target population for this study consisted of 1,080 patient-facing health care professionals at 18 Harvard-affiliated primary care practices in Massachusetts participating in the AIC. We targeted this population using personnel lists obtained from each practice's Practice Manager. These lists contained infor- mation on each staff member's job title, description (including whether they interacted directly [e.g., reception] or indirectly [e.g., phone bank] with patients), and professional licenses, if applicable. We classified respondents into personnel types for comparing sample demographic characteristics. Though participating practices were affiliated with Harvard, they were diverse in setting (hospital-based vs. community-based), size (3-64 physicians), revenue sources (5-81 percent Medicaid, 7-40 percent Medicare), and patient demographics (ages 0 to &gt;75 years, 15-95 percent non-white). They also varied in the type of primary care they provided (three pediatric practices, one internal medicine-pediatrics, two family medicine, and 12 internal medicine, including one with a geriatric program).</p><p>Between September 2012 and March 2013, we administered our survey electronically through subjects' work emails. All Practice Managers sent an introductory email to their staff to notify them to expect our survey. We followed Practice Managers' recommendations to determine specific timing for administering the initial survey (e.g., avoiding competing surveys) and reminders. Practice Managers promoted participation in our survey (e.g., through release time from clinical duties or required meetings). We also provided Practice Managers with token incentives (e.g., breakfast items) to help promote the survey.</p><p>For each practice, survey administration concluded when the practice reached or exceeded a 60 percent response or after 29 weeks following survey launch, whichever occurred first. The Institutional Review Board at the Harvard School of Public Health approved all research methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>First, we reverse-scored negatively worded items and assessed survey properties including item nonresponse, means, and variance. To determine the extent to which missing items would bias our results, we performed sensitivity analysis comparing results based on the original data to results based on a complete dataset generated by imputing missing values using stratified means. Results at each step in our analysis were robust to the dataset selected. In describing the sample, item means, and variance, we present results based on the original, nonimputed data.</p><p>Next, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to perform two rounds of psychometric analysis. Given our strong conceptual model and the derivation of our items from previously validated instruments, rather than conducting a traditional exploratory factor analysis, we used SEM to test the The Primary Care Team Dynamics Survey fit of the survey data with our hypothesized model of primary care team dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Byrne 2001)</ref>. In doing so, we split our sample into randomly drawn halves, using the imputed dataset to maximize sample size. We used output from the first SEM, based on data from the first split-half sample, to identify minor ways of improving model fit by deleting items with factor loadings below 0.40 if they captured content similar to other items in the same factor and by adding covariances between items within factors if modification indices were 0.20 or higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Byrne 2001)</ref>. We also adjusted for spurious variance that can result when multiple scale scores come from a single survey by including a common latent factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Podsakoff et al. 2003)</ref>. Thus, our first SEM served an exploratory purpose. With the second split-half sample, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis using SEM and accounting for common method bias to assess the goodness-of-fit of the final model derived from the initial SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brown 2006)</ref>. We assessed the robustness of the final model by comparing results based on the imputed data to results based on the original data, after list-wise deleting missing values.</p><p>We averaged items in each factor to create factor scores. We assessed factor reliability by computing Cronbach's alpha coefficients, which measure the internal consistency of the items comprising each scale. We also assessed the convergent and discriminant validity of the factors in our model by examining the strength of each item's correlation with its assigned scale and comparing it to its correlations with the remaining scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hays and Hayashi 1990)</ref>.</p><p>We performed SEM using SPSS AMOS version 20 (Amos Development Corporation, Meadville, Pennsylvania, USA). All other analyses were performed using STATA 13.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response Rate</head><p>We received 732 responses for an overall response rate of 68 percent, ranging from 55 to 89 percent among practices. We excluded one observation with a value for age greater than 100, assuming this was a respondent's typographical error.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Characteristics</head><p>Respondents were predominantly female (81 percent) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>). Approximately, one-third of respondents were 36-50 years old, and another third were older. Among respondents, 39 percent were physicians and 24 percent were administrative staff. More than half of respondents were non-Hispanic white (57 percent), and 21 percent were Hispanic. The split-half samples Includes Academic Innovations Collaborative practice project managers, administrative assistants, administrative coordinators, administrative directors, ambulatory billing coordinators, clinical research associates, community resource specialists, financial counselors, managed care coordinators, medical records staff, office managers, operations directors, practice managers, and receptionists.</p><p>The Primary Care Team Dynamics Survey exhibited nonsignificant differences in distributions of demographic characteristics, suggesting randomization was successful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survey Properties</head><p>Most survey responses were nonnegative, suggesting that on average respondents perceived a neutral to positive level of team dynamics in primary care in the first year of the learning collaborative (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). Mean scores for individual items ranged from 2.97 to 4.04 on a five-point scale, indicating opportunity for improvement in team dynamics measured by the survey. The item with the most positive response was "I regularly communicate with other members of my team." The item with the least positive response was "My team has an effective process for conflict management." Responses were also variable, with standard deviations for individual items of at least 0.73. The differences in average item score within participating practices also varied, by at least 0.4 SD and up to 1.4 SD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychometric Analysis</head><p>Using the first half-sample, SEM suggested excluding four of 31 items in three factors due to factor loadings less than 0.40 and the inclusion of a multitude of covariances between items within factors to improve model fit. This initial five-factor model demonstrated adequate fit on standard indices: goodness-offit index (GFI) of 0.91, adjusted GFI of 0.88, comparative fit index (CFI) of 0.96, root mean square residual (RMR) of 0.04, and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) of 0.05. Model fit is considered adequate when GFI&gt;0.90, adjusted GFI&gt;0.80, CFI&gt;0.90, RMR&lt;0.10, and RMSEA&lt;0.08.</p><p>The pattern of factor loadings also suggested that a seven-factor model might better represent the underlying structure of our data than the five-factor model initially proposed. Such a modified model would differ from the original by dividing Supportive Processes into three distinct factors: (1) processes for accountability-one item; (2) processes for communication and information exchange-five items; and (3) processes for conflict resolution-two items. Conceptual distinctions among these three processes supported modifying the model in this way. Thus, we repeated the analyses above using the first halfsample and reverting to the original set of 31 survey items to explore the fit of a seven-factor model. 1 Analysis with this adjusted model suggested the exclusion of two items (one from the shared understanding factor and the other from acting and feeling like a team) and a more limited number of item  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continued</head><p>The Primary Care Team Dynamics Survey covariances (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref>). This seven-factor model also had adequate fit on standard indices: GFI of 0.91, adjusted GFI of 0.87, CFI of 0.96, RMR of 0.04, and RMSEA of 0.04.</p><p>In the second half-sample, we examined this seven-factor model, including the 29 remaining items, interfactor item covariances, and accounting for common method bias. We again obtained adequate fit on standard indices: GFI of 0.88, adjusted GFI of 0.83, CFI of 0.94, RMR of 0.05, and RMSEA of 0.06. We further assessed the robustness of our empirically derived, sevenfactor model by comparing results based on the imputed data to those derived from the same analysis using data with no imputed values. In this  instance, observations missing any data were list-wise deleted (n = 94). All indices were robust to this analysis; this modified model achieved similar fit: GFI of 0.91, adjusted GFI of 0.88, CFI of 0.95, RMR of 0.04, and RMSEA of 0.05. Scale means, standard deviations, correlation among scales, and Cronbach's alpha coefficients (estimating scale internal consistency at the individual level of analysis) are included in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>. Mean scores for the seven factors (including the single-item independent measure of accountability) ranged from 3.09 for processes for accountability to 3.83 for acting and feeling like a team (based on the first half-sample). All six multi-item factors demonstrated adequate reliability using standard criteria, ranging from 0.71 to 0.91. Correlations among factors were relatively high, averaging 0.49. This was particularly true for the relationship between shared understanding and conditions for team effectiveness (r = 0.73). However, all correlations among factors were lower than the corresponding alpha coefficients, suggesting the factors measured related, yet distinct team dynamics.</p><p>To assess the extent to which our measures could inform practice-level comparisons, we calculated four complementary measures of within-group agreement for each of the seven factors in our final model: the median r wg (the degree to which individual responses within a practice are interchangeable), the F-statistic from a one-way ANOVA (the extent to which responses differ between individuals at different practices), and two forms of intraclass correlation: ICC(1) (an estimate of the reliability of one individual's assessment of the practice mean) and ICC(2) (an overall estimate of the reliability of practice means). Assessed with an average sample size of 40 respondents per practice, the median r wg ranged from 0.23 to 0.75, with two of the seven factors having a median r wg greater than the suggested threshold of 0.70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">( James, Demaree, and Wolf 1984)</ref>. Each F-statistic was highly significant (p &lt; .01), all values of ICC(1) were positive, and values of ICC(2) ranged from 0.58 to 0.81, with all above the suggested threshold of 0.50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Klein and Kozlowski 2000)</ref>. Collectively, these results suggest that survey domains may be aggregated to assess team dynamics at the practice level, with the caveat that individual responses within a practice may not be highly interchangeable. We used the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula to solve for the number of respondents needed to obtain practice-level reliability of 0.70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hays et al. 1999)</ref>. This yielded sample size requirements for each of the seven factors ranging from 26 to 62.  The Primary Care Team Dynamics Survey</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>In recent years, team dynamics have become increasingly important in ambulatory settings to manage and coordinate care for patients with multiple comorbidities and to curb costs. Health care providers-even those working within the same practice-need to exchange critical information and coordinate efforts with one another. Thus, being able to measure and improve team dynamics in ambulatory settings will be integral to the development and promotion of PCMHs and Accountable Care Organizations. Notably, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) recently designated team-based care as a "must-pass" criterion for PCMH recognition (NCQA 2014).</p><p>We developed an evidence-based conceptual model of primary care team dynamics and validated a survey instrument designed to measure team dynamics in ambulatory settings. Our findings suggest it is possible to reliably measure primary care team dynamics using a 29-item survey. Survey items represent a model that includes seven dynamically interacting factors (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>). Certain conditions increase shared understanding and specific processes that support teamwork. These promote acting and feeling like a team, which is related to team member perceptions of team effectiveness.</p><p>The first factor, conditions for team effectiveness, includes four items that assess whether the team has stable membership, an enabling structure, and a supportive organizational context. Shared understanding, our second factor, includes seven survey items that assess the extent to which the team has collective goals, a clear delineation of member roles and responsibilities, and patient involvement. Our psychometric analysis suggested three separate processes support teamwork in primary care: processes for accountability measured with a single item; processes for communication and information exchange represented by five items probing communication that regularly occurs in primary care; and processes for conflict resolution, consisting of two items. Acting and feeling like a team, the sixth factor, includes seven items measuring the extent to which team members have learned to use team skills and knowledge effectively; share and use information from others; and value, trust, and respect other members of the team. The last factor uses five items to assess perceived team effectiveness, the extent to which members view the team as effective in delivering effective, efficient care, and in enhancing enthusiasm and interest among team members.</p><p>Empirical support for the survey instrument is strong. With only minor modifications to our original conceptual framework, goodness-of-fit measures supported the hypothesized model. Evidence for scale reliability is also excellent, with all scales demonstrating Cronbach's alpha coefficients exceeding conventional thresholds <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Nunnally and Bernstein 1994)</ref>. In addition, correlation patterns provide validation of satisfactory discrimination among factors, although not unexpectedly this analysis also reveals strong relationships among factors.</p><p>This survey instrument is the first, to our knowledge, that comprehensively assesses team dynamics in ambulatory settings. Unlike most other survey instruments designed for use in health care settings, it is also designed to be administered to a wide range of health care professionals, including nonphysician health care professionals such as medical assistants, nursing assistants, and receptionists.</p><p>Nevertheless, our testing of the Primary Care Team Dynamics survey has limitations. First, our final sample of 731 individuals was adequate, but not large relative to the number of dimensions in our conceptual model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brown 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hair et al. 2010)</ref>, and the overall response rate of 68 percent was high <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">( Jepson et al. 2005</ref>), but still leaves room for selection bias. Survey respondents and nonrespondents may have differed systematically in ways that impacted their team dynamics. However, analyses comparing the responses of early and late responders do not reveal significant differences, suggesting that nonresponse bias may not significantly affect interpretation of results. Second, our conceptual model may be incomplete. For the sake of parsimony, we excluded intervening processes (e.g., processes for learning within teams). Researchers may consider further developing the survey instrument by complementing it with scales that capture such processes. Third, like many surveys, responses may be subject to social desirability bias. We modified survey items to minimize this potential, but cannot rule out the possibility of an effect. Fourth, although our conceptual model asserts directionality, we are unable to ascertain the directionality of related constructs because our data come from a cross-sectional survey administration. Future research should seek to determine empirically the directionality of constructs. Finally, in this paper, we did not examine the relationship of survey measures to objective measures of team effectiveness, such as career satisfaction, care quality, and clinical outcomes. Future research should seek to validate the Primary Care Team Dynamics survey in this way.</p><p>Because of the critical role that team-based care plays in recent U.S. efforts to transform primary care practices to become PCMHs, more specific primary care-focused tools that evaluate team dynamics are needed to enable organizations to understand where they are succeeding and where they need</p><p>The Primary Care Team Dynamics Survey more work <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Margolius 2013</ref>). The Primary Care Team Dynamics survey is currently ready for use in a research or exploratory context. Additional research should generate information about the reliability of the survey in other contexts, its responsiveness to interventions to improve team performance, and the relationship between survey constructs and team outcomes. In future studies, the Primary Care Team Dynamics survey may be useful in understanding the level of team dynamics in primary care practices, evaluating differences in perceptions among team members in different roles, and measuring the impact of interventions that seek to establish care teams and improve team dynamics in primary care practices.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Address correspondence to Sara J.
