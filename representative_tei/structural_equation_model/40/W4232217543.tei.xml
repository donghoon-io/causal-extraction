<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Empathy is a well-established facet of clinical competency that research suggests is associated with enhanced medical student well-being. Since little is known about empathy and well-being before students enter medical school-during pre-medical education-the main goal of this study is to test a conceptual model of how clinical empathy is related to two indicators of well-being, depression, and burnout among pre-medical students. The theoretical model hypothesizes that three dimensions of clinical empathy-Perspective-Taking, Compassionate Care, and Standing in Patients' Shoeswill be directly and negatively related to depression, as well as indirectly through its inverse relationship with three facets of burnout, Emotional Exhaustion, Poor Academic E cacy, and Cynicism.</p><p>Methods: Using survey data from a sample of 132 pre-medical students at an American Midwestern university, this study employs structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the theoretical model of the relationships between empathy, burnout, and depression among pre-medical students. We identify the direct effects of the three dimensions of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSE-S) on depression (CES-D), as well as the indirect effects of clinical empathy on depression through the three dimensions of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-S).</p><p>Results: SEM analyses show that while none of the three dimensions of the JSE-S are directly related to depression, clinical empathy does signi cantly affect depression indirectly through burnout. Speci cally, as predicted, we nd that Perspective-Taking decreases Emotional Exhaustion, but, contrary to expectations, Compassionate Care increases it. And, the positive relationship between Compassionate Care and Emotional Exhaustion is particularly strong. In turn, Perspective-Taking and Compassionate Care are associated with depression in opposite directions and to different degrees.</p><p>Conclusions: Findings suggest that clinical empathy as measured by the JSE-S produces both positive and negative effects on personal well-being. We conclude that further conceptual clarity of clinical empathy is needed to better discern how the different dimensions impact different indicators of wellbeing. Given that pre-medical education is a crucial time for emotional socialization, the challenge for medical education will be fostering the positive, cognitive aspects of clinical empathy while simultaneously mitigating the adverse effects of affective empathy on medical student well-being.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Empathy, generally de ned as the capacity to understand the perspectives and feelings of others, is a well-established facet of clinical competency and quality doctor-patient relationships. Research shows that a physician's ability to communicate empathy is related to increased patient satisfaction <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> improved clinical outcomes <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, increased patient enablement <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, decreased patient distress <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, and lower burnout and depression among physicians <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. Despite its importance for both patient and physician wellbeing, a number of studies identify levels of empathy that may begin relatively high upon entry into medical school, but then subsequently decline over time throughout medical training <ref type="bibr">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>, alongside measures of personal well-being that also seem to worsen <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. Little is known about empathy and wellbeing before students enter medical school-during pre-medical education-which is a crucial time of emotional socialization for aspiring physicians and, as Cundell notes, represents an important opportunity for early cognitive empathy training <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. This study, therefore, constitutes a vital rst step in assessing empathy in this largely understudied population, as it examines how different aspects of clinical empathy relate to measures of well-being among pre-medical students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measuring Clinical Empathy</head><p>In response to the need to measure empathy in clinical settings, Hojat and colleagues developed the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. They subsequently adapted the original JSE for physicians (HP-Version), medical students (S-Version), and other health professions students (HPS-Version). The JSE-S Version captures three underlying components of clinical empathy, that of Perspective-Taking (viewing a situation from another's point of view), Compassionate Care (emotions in patient care), and Standing in Patients' Shoes (thinking like a patient). Clinical empathy in the JSE is conceptualized as cognitive rather than affective, meaning that physicians understand patients' experiences and communicate that understanding without experiencing the emotional state themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The JSE-S has been extensively tested for its reliability and validity among medical students <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Numerous exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) con rm the three-factor latent structure of the JSE-S as it was originally theorized, as do the few existing con rmatory factor analyses (CFAs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. A small number of studies, however, identify two <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, four <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and ve factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Even in studies that identify three latent factors in the JSE-S, only a few analyze the dimensions separately for their relationships with other variables. In an exhaustive literature search, we identi ed seven studies that examine the three factors separately among medical students. They nd different relationships across the three dimensions with respect to gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, rates of change over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, other measures of empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, willingness to show empathetic behavior [18], and burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Several studies also show that only certain aspects of empathy decline, while others may actually improve <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Given that student empathy varies depending on the stage of training, it is important to develop a measurement strategy that examines the three "factors independently in a context dependent way" <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. One such context is the pre-medical experience, for which research has not established baseline levels of empathy. To fully understand the phenomenon of clinical empathy in medical trainees, we argue that greater attention should be paid to empathy in premedical students, as well as to the ways that the three dimensions of clinical empathy in the JSE-S may differentially impact well-being outcomes for students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medical Student Well-being</head><p>Burnout and depression are prevalent among medical students <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, even among rst-year students <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. The majority of studies show that empathy is associated with less burnout and depression <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> , suggesting that relationships with patients can serve as a buffer to the stresses of medical training <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Nonetheless, some studies do not report an association <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, and there are concerns that the emotional labor associated with clinical empathy can produce compassion fatigue/exposure to vicarious trauma <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. While a few researchers have measured the well-being of pre-medical students, no studies have explored the link between levels of empathy and burnout/depression for these students. One study, however, shows that a mindfulness intervention improved both depression and empathy among premedical students <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>Research on pre-medical students is limited and tends to focus on reasons for attrition and stereotypes of the pre-medical personality <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>. Two existing studies indicate that pre-medical students have higher levels of burnout and depressive symptoms compared to their non-pre-medical counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr">38]</ref>. In a non-comparative study among pre-medical students, Grace nds that burnout and depression are negatively associated with interest in medical school <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. There is also evidence that those with lower baseline empathy upon entrance into medical school experience greater decline in empathy thereafter, although this is inconclusive <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, suggesting, as some other studies have, that physicians' poor health and less than ideal levels of clinical empathy likely begin before students enter medical school <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Establishing baseline levels of clinical empathy and examining the relationship between empathy and well-being during the pre-medical period is important in order to develop appropriately timed interventions. Thus, this study aims to 1) identify baseline levels of clinical empathy, burnout, and depression among pre-medical students; and 2) examine how different aspects of clinical empathy are related to well-being. Speci cally, based on the literature discussed above, and is depicted in the conceptual model in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we hypothesize that the three empathy dimensions will have both direct relationships with depression, as well as indirect relationships through three facets of burnout. The results of this study will help establish baseline levels of clinical empathy and well-being among premedical students and contribute to ongoing debates about the existence and extent of empathy declines during medical training <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants and procedure Survey data were collected in April of 2019 at a large state Midwestern university in the United States as part of a larger longitudinal, mixed-methods study on clinical empathy development and decline. Participants were recruited among all undergraduate students who were enrolled in the four-year premedical program that provides a clear curricular pathway to students interested in applying to medical school. Online invitations to the con dential and anonymous Qualtrics survey were sent to 666 undergraduate students, 45 of whom received a slightly modi ed version of the survey as to make a few of the questions applicable to the early admittance program in which they were enrolled. A total of 132 students (28 BS/MD students) consented to participate, constituting an approximate 20% response rate.</p><p>There were no missing data on any of the variables used in these analyses except for one individual who identi ed their gender as "queer" and so we substituted the mean (male) for that individual. Informed consent was obtained for all participants and all study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board (#18-503).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures Clinical Empathy</head><p>The JSE-S Version contains 20 items on a 7-point Likert scale in which respondents are asked to rate their agreement (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree). The medical student version words items in third person (i.e., refers to "physicians" rather than "I"). Half of the items are positively worded and half of them are negatively worded as to reduce passive response <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Items were recoded so that all items indicate higher degrees of clinical empathy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Well-being</head><p>We operationalize well-being as burnout and depressive symptoms. The main well-being dependent variable in this study is depression, measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D), which is a summative scale ranging from 10-40 that asks respondents how often they have experienced depressive symptoms in the past week (1 = Most or all of the time to 4 = Rarely or none of the time) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Some items were reverse-coded so that higher values re ect more depressive symptoms. The CES-D has been used among pre-medical students with high internal consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>We use burnout as a second indicator of well-being, using the 15-item Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (MBI-SS) that includes three dimensions of burnout: Emotional Exhaustion, Academic E cacy, and Cynicism <ref type="bibr">[46]</ref>. The items ask respondents to rate how frequently they may have had certain feelings about their academic work (0 = never had this feeling to 6 = every day), with the total summed scale ranging from 0-84. Summed sub-scales for the three dimensions range from 0 to 30 for the Emotional Exhaustion scale; 0-36 for the Poor Academic E cacy scale; and 0 to 18 for the Cynicism scale. The three subscales have been validated among pre-clinical medical students <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> and the two studies that employ the MBI-SS among pre-medical students show high internal consistency <ref type="bibr">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>To con rm the 3-latent structure of the JSE-S among pre-medical students, we conducted a CFA in Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) because it can simultaneously examine multiple dependent variables, model latent variables, and estimate indirect effects <ref type="bibr">[48]</ref>. We rst ran three nested models with all 20 items and then examined the 20-item global latent variable of clinical empathy in comparison to 2and 3-factor structures. [analyses available upon request]. After con rming the 3-factor latent structure of the JSE-S among this sample of pre-medical students, we then tested direct and indirect pathways from empathy to well-being. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we hypothesize that clinical empathy will be directly and negatively related to depression, as well as negatively associated with depression through its inverse relationships with burnout. We control for women's greater levels of depression compared to men <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. For all models, we estimate the covariance between the latent variables of the JSE-S and the MBI-S; use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE); and set one of the items to 1 as to scale the latent variable.</p><p>For all of the SEM models, we report several t indices, including the Chi-Square Statistic (χ 2 ), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and the Standardized Root Mean Squared Residual (SRMR). A statistically signi cant χ 2 is undesirable, as it indicates that the hypothesized model is signi cantly different than the observed data. Higher values of the CFI (&gt; .95) indicate better model t, while lower values of RMSEA (&lt; .06) and SRMR (&lt; .08) suggest better t. For all analyses, we set our alpha at .05. Descriptive statistics were computed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26 and SEM was conducted using Muthén &amp; Muthén Mplus 7.31.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, the sample of 132 pre-medical students is predominantly female (67%), white (72%), and not married (97%). The average age is about 20 years old and they tend to have parents with advanced degrees (33% of their mothers and 45% of their fathers). The students in the sample range from being freshman (27%) to seniors (14%) and about 70% reported having a GPA of 3.5 or higher on a 4.0 scale. he Academic E cacy sub-scale was re-named "Poor Academic E cacy" to re ect that some items were reverse-coded and so higher values re ect more burnout.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Well-being descriptive statistics</head><p>Pre-medical students reported a mean of 1.93 (sd: 64) on the summed and averaged CES-D scale that ranges from 1-4, which is the equivalent of a mean of 19.35 (sd: 6.43) not averaged that ranges from 10-40. Students reported an average of 2.18 (sd: 1.08) on the MBI-SS on a scale of 0 to 6. Of the three dimensions of burnout, students reported the highest levels of Emotional Exhaustion (mean: 3.27, sd: 1.59) and the lowest levels of Poor Academic E cacy (mean: 1.56, sd: 1.12). In examining the 95% con dence intervals, students reported signi cantly more Emotional Exhaustion than Cynicism, but not Poor Academic E cacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model</head><p>After con rming the latent 3-factor structure of the JSE-S among pre-medical students, we then estimated the entire measurement model with both the JSE-S and the MBI-SS. Because of the relatively small sample size compared to the number of variables, we used the CES-D 10-item scale as an observed, rather than latent, variable in the SEM analyses, which is reasonable given that this scale is a widely used and extensively validated instrument to measure depressive symptoms in the general population and has been implemented on medical students and pre-medical students. In addition to the high internal consistency of the scale (a = .87), we con rmed that the scale was valid in this sample using CFA in SEM. Standardized factor loadings for the CES-D ranged from .50 to .81 and, with one added correlation between Items 5 and 8, all model t indices were acceptable (χ 2 = 48.48, df = 34, CFI: .97, RMSEA: .06, SRMR: .04) [analyses not shown].</p><p>When we ran the initial measurement model, the statistically signi cant chi square model t statistic indicated that the measurement model was not an acceptable t to the data (χ 2 = 505.73, df = 389, CFI: .93, RMSEA: .05, SRMR: .06). To solve this issue of poor model t, we took the suggestion of the modi cation indices to add a correlation between items MBI11 &amp; MBI16. To further improve model t, and in the interest of parsimony, we then trimmed items from the model that had low factor loadings, as other studies using the JSE have done (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for which items were cut/retained). 13,20 The nal measurement model is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>; it had good t indices (χ 2 = 308.12, df = 282, CFI: .98, RMSEA: .03, SRMR: .06) and contained items with standardized factor loadings that were all ≥ .40 and statistically signi cant (p &lt; .001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural model</head><p>We next tested the structural model. This model explained 58.2% of the variation in depression among pre-medical students and the relationships between empathy, burnout, and depression generally functioned in the hypothesized manner depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, as indicated by the good model t indices (χ 2 = 363.63, df = 328, CFI: .98, RMSEA: .03, SRMR: .06). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, all three of the latent factors of the MBI-SS were positively and signi cantly related to each other, but, between the three latent factors of the JSE-S, Standing in Patients' Shoes was not signi cantly correlated with Compassionate Care.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Direct effects</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> reports the standardized regression weights and shows that, contrary to hypotheses (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), we did not nd that any of the three types of empathy had direct relationships with depression (p &gt; .05). However, as predicted, we found that, controlling for women's greater degree of depressive symptoms (β = .16, p = .01), burnout had a positive relationship with depression in that there was a strong relationship between Emotional Exhaustion and depression (β = .61, p &lt; .000). Poor Academic E cacy was also positively associated with depression, but not as strongly (β = .28, p = .00), and Cynicism was not signi cantly related to depression (β = .03, p = .76).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indirect effects</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, empathy and burnout were signi cantly related. As predicted, greater Perspective-Taking was negatively associated with Poor Academic E cacy (β=-51, p = .02) and Emotional Exhaustion (β=-.51, p = .05). Compassionate Care was also strongly related to burnout, but in a direction counter to that was hypothesized (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) in that the more pre-medical students value Compassionate Care, the more likely they were to be emotionally exhausted (β = .65, p = .01). Standing in Patients' Shoes was not signi cantly related to any of the three dimensions of burnout (p &gt; .05).</p><p>In assessing the relative strength of relationships between the three dimensions of empathy and the three types of burnout, Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> illustrates that Emotional Exhaustion had the strongest relationship with Compassionate Care (β = .65), followed by Perspective-Taking (β=-.51), neither of which had strong relationships with Cynicism (β = .07, β=-.15). Standing in Patients' Shoes had weak relationships with all measures of burnout (β=-.13, β=-.03, β=-.09). [Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> near here].</p><p>While we did not identify any direct effects between clinical empathy and depression, there were several signi cant indirect pathways from Perspective-Taking and Compassionate Care, but not Standing in Patients' Shoes. Perspective-taking had an indirect, negative association with depression (total indirect effects: β=-.46, p = .03). Compassionate care also had an indirect, positive relationship with depression (total indirect effects: β = .46, p = .03), mostly through its relationship with Emotional Exhaustion (β = .39, p = .03). Thus, while those who value Perspective-Taking experienced less depression, those who value Compassionate Care experienced more depression because of their greater Emotional Exhaustion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>All in the same year, Hojat and LaNoue advocated for more studies "in different sociocultural environments, populations, and in different translated versions of the scale to assure the psychometric soundness of the JSE in a variety of situations" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Leombruni and colleagues called for the examination of the subcomponents of empathy separately <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>; and Paro and colleagues noted the dearth of studies establishing a link between empathy and burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Since the publication of these studies in 2014, very few have taken up these charges. We, however, did so in the American pre-medical context by, rst, identifying baseline levels of clinical empathy, burnout, and depression among premedical students and, second, by examining how different aspects of clinical empathy are related to wellbeing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Establishing baseline levels of clinical empathy and wellbeing</head><p>Pre-medical students in this sample report a mean of 110 for the global 20-item JSE-S, which is slightly lower than average clinical empathy scores of rst year medical students in the U.S. (that range between 114 and 115 with standard deviations from 9-12) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. It is possible that pre-medical students have lower levels of clinical empathy than medical students or that pre-medical students with higher clinical empathy are more likely to be accepted to, and actually attend, medical school. Future research should compare pre-medical students to medical students to determine to what degree a difference exists.</p><p>With respect to well-being, we nd that levels of depression among pre-medical students are slightly higher than levels reported in the only other study that uses the CES-D in this population <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. We nd slightly lower means in the Emotional Exhaustion, Poor Academic E cacy, and Cynicism burnout subscales than Fang and colleagues <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref>, whereas our data are consistent with previous studies that show pre-medical students score highest in levels of Emotional Exhaustion and lowest in Cynicism <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr">38]</ref>.</p><p>Given that those who are at higher risk for burnout and depression might be more likely to be on the premedical track than undergraduates who are not <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr">38]</ref> baseline levels found here could help future research to distinguish between selection effects into medical school and the effects of the structure and culture of medical education on the changes in clinical empathy and well-being throughout medical training.</p><p>Clinical empathy: Good or bad for well-being? SEM analyses show that over half of the variation in depression among pre-medical students is explained by clinical empathy and burnout, with empathy affecting depression primarily through burnout as opposed to directly. Although it was counter to our hypotheses concerning direct effects (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), this nding is not surprising given the evidence showing the factors that contribute the most to depression among medical students are those that are related to academic stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</p><p>The existence, direction, and strength of relationships are not the same between the three factors of the JSE-S and the three types of the MBI-SS. We nd that the more students take the perspective of others, the less emotional exhaustion they experience, which in turn lessens depression. By contrast, students who report more Compassionate Care have greater Emotional Exhaustion, which then leads to greater depression. Thus, while being able to take patients' perspectives is bene cial for burnout and depression among pre-medical students, Compassionate Care has the opposite effect-and this positive relationship between Compassionate Care and Emotional Exhaustion is particularly strong.</p><p>It is di cult to discern precisely why Compassionate Care produces deleterious outcomes relative to Perspective-Taking, which is contrary to our hypotheses about the positive relationship between empathy and well-being (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Nonetheless, a study by Ünlü and Uludağ may provide some insight that supports our counterintuitive nding regarding the negative effects of clinical empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Using the JSE-S among a sample of medical students, they nd that Perspective-Taking and Compassionate Care were signi cantly and positively correlated with avoiding and having di culty communicating about death/dying among patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. We concur with Ünlü and Uludağ that these ndings re ect a lack of conceptual distinction between cognitive and affective empathy in the JSE-S <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. In fact, in his book, Hojat and colleagues de ne Compassionate Care as having two components, understanding patient experiences and emotions in patient care, suggesting that the factor is comprised of both cognitive and affective dimensions of empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Indeed, three of the items associated with Compassionate Care appear to measure what Davis labels empathic concern, or the tendency to experience the feelings of others or feel sympathy/compassion for unfortunate people <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. As such, our nding that more Compassionate Care increases Emotional Exhaustion, and in turn depression, corroborates previous research that links affective empathy to compassion fatigue, burnout, and vicarious trauma <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Results suggesting that greater empathy leads to compassion fatigue also prompt questions about previous studies that report a positive relationship between empathy and well-being <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. Rather than ndings here re ecting the negative effects of too much empathy, the use of the global JSE-S scale in past studies may in fact obscure the existence and strength of an inverse relationship between certain aspects of empathy and burnout. This argument is consistent with Hojat and LaNoue's conclusion that "because of its cognitive nature, abundance of empathy is always bene cial in patient-physician relationships; understanding in excess cannot be detrimental" <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In other words, ndings here should not be interpreted as actual negative effects of clinical empathy, but rather an issue of methodological operationalization. As other scholars have suggested <ref type="bibr">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, the current study provides further support for the claim that the different dimensions of clinical empathy should be examined separately and, in particular, the affective and cognitive aspects, which do not seem to develop and/or decline uniformly <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. Conceptual clarity is needed with respect to the three different components of clinical empathy as measured by the JSE-S so that researchers can better discern how different dimensions of the cognitive and affective aspects of empathy impact medical student well-being. Qualitative analyses may be particularly adept to compliment studies using the JSE-S in deciphering the effects of the different aspects of clinical empathy on well-being <ref type="bibr">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future research</head><p>This study has several limitations that future research should consider. First, it is likely that some proportion of our sample will never attend medical school. Pre-medical students who leave the medical track may be different from their peers who enter medical school, raising questions about the utility of our data when comparing pre-meds to medical students. A small number of respondents in the sample are also early admission students who may have a qualitatively different experience in medical school and therefore differ from their traditional pre-med peers with respect to empathy and/or well-being. Studies like the current one, however, can contribute to understandings of the reasons for a loss of interest in pursing a career in medicine [58].</p><p>Our study is also limited by a small sample that required us to correlate a few items in order to achieve adequate model t, although several other studies using the JSE have proceeded similarly <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Additionally, the latent factor of Standing in Patients' Shoes does not correlate with the other two JSE-S latent factors in the measurement model or with Compassionate Care in the structural model, suggesting that there may be other latent factors in addition to the three identi ed here. Finally, as with all studies that use the JSE-S, this study relies on self-reports of empathy and therefore is subject to social desirability bias. Self-reports can be crude measures of student/physician behavior in the context of clinical encounters, but there is evidence that scores on the JSE-S are related to clinical competence rated by an observer <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref>, as well as to patient perceptions of physician self-reported empathy <ref type="bibr">[60]</ref>.</p><p>Since the current study is cross-sectional, it does not allow for strong causal claims or the examination of the enduring effects of clinical empathy scores on behavior. Although SEM implies causal pathways, it is important to note that longitudinal data is necessary to establish causal order. It is possible, and even likely, that burnout and depression affect clinical empathy instead of the direction that it is modeled here, as some studies have shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr">61]</ref>. Given these limitations, future research should replicate these analyses longitudinally and on larger samples of pre-medical students.</p><p>Despite its limitations, this study is one of very few studies to examine the differential effects of the three dimensions of JSE-S on well-being outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. This is also one of a few studies of clinical empathy among students <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> to use SEM, which is an underutilized, but potentially valuable tool, in medical education research <ref type="bibr">[62]</ref>. Given the lack of conceptual clarity between burnout and depression [26], SEM is an especially superior method to other linear models that can neither simultaneously examine the effects of clinical empathy on multiple measures of well-being nor estimate indirect effects on outcomes. Lastly, this was the rst study to employ the JSE-S on pre-medical students, which arguably opens the door for the inclusion of pre-medical students in subsequent studies about clinical empathy development. Since medical students do not matriculate as "blank slates," it is imperative that we consider empathy development prior to the M1 year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The ndings of this study have several implications for protecting the well-being of future physicians. Our nding that the effect of clinical empathy on depression is solely indirect warrants a continued focus on burnout in pre-medical and medical education. Nonetheless, the indirect effects of clinical empathy on depression through burnout identi ed here suggest a need to upstream to the antecedents of burnout. Focusing on clinical empathy development might be one effective way to protect against burnout and depression, while also improving future patient care <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. In addition to enhancing personal well-being, another motivation for pre-medical education to focus on empathy development is that research shows a connection between a variety of emotions-e.g., hope, pride, anxiety, and shame-and academic achievement in medical school <ref type="bibr">[63]</ref>.</p><p>Given that greater compassionate care appears linked to greater emotional exhaustion and depression, it behooves medical educators to emphasize the cognitive aspects of empathy (i.e., perspective-taking) that our ndings suggest protect against the adverse effects of the demands of medical school on students' well-being. For early medical students who often possess abstract and idealized notions of the doctorpatient relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, it would be bene cial to provide them with opportunities to learn about affective versus cognitive empathy, especially since they themselves seem to distinguish between the emotional versus intellectual parts of empathy development <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. As Harvey notes, pre-medical students are subjected to a hidden/informal curriculum that touts emotional readiness but does very little to prepare students for the emotional demands of medical school <ref type="bibr">[64]</ref>, which in part explains why some studies show that medical students crave more explicit discussion around emotions in medical school <ref type="bibr">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr">66]</ref> students would likely bene t from more emotional socialization in their pre-medical years <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr">67]</ref>. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figures Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figures</figDesc><graphic coords="18,28.00,554.72,557.00,175.66" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In conclusion, this study shows that students come to medical school with already-developing understandings of the doctor-patient relationship and that these understandings are linked to well-being in both positive and negative ways. As students make the transition from pre-medical to medical school, the challenge for medical education, then, will be how to train students to have the bene cial, positive aspects of clinical empathy without experiencing the adverse effects of affective empathy.
