<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) model to gain insight regarding mobile banking (m-banking) usage has been developed. By combining three perspectives, UTAUT2, gamification and generational cohort theory, this study seeks to investigate the factors which impact m-banking usage and to examine the moderating effect of generations Y and Z into the relationship between gamification and intention to use m-banking. The adopted model was tested in a quantitative study by employing partial least square structural equation modelling. To carry out the data analyse 380 valid questionnaire has been proceed. Within the study are provided scientific evidences concerning the UTAUT2 model and gamification elements. The results revealed that the age significantly moderate the relationship between gamification and behavioural intention. Compare to generation Z, individuals inborn before 1996 (generation Y) scored lower on gamification, manifest lower intention to use m-banking, whereas m-banking users score higher gamification indicated higher behavioural intention. Besides identifying the determinants of m-banking usage, this study notably reveal the importance of generational cohorts as moderators effect of gamification on m-banking behavioural intention.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Emerging communication technologies have been evolving in the world over the last few decades. Internet based applications and wireless phones are empowering continuously individuals to execute financial or non-financial transactions at any corner of the world just from a finger touch. Peeping into the past, one of the first commercial applications of the mobile internet was mobile banking, which came out as an innovative extension of telephone banking and online banking <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barnes &amp; Corbitt, 2003)</ref>. Since the 1990s banking system in Europe has stretched rapidly much faster than many other banking systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Langfield &amp; Pagano, 2015)</ref>. Therefore, this simultaneous expansion of banking system, internet, and wireless mobile, gave a strong tool in the hands of the banking services providers to take the banking services in the pockets of the consumers and empower them to access from anywhere at any time <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Laukkanen &amp; Pasanen, 2008)</ref> and this easiness delight individuals.</p><p>Mobile banking services are about complete accessibility to banking services and easy transactions from bank accounts, instalment payments, fund transfer and other related banking services <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Al-Jabri &amp; Sohail, 2012)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Shaikh, Karjaluoto, and Chinje (2015a)</ref>. M-banking services just need an electronic device such as smartphones or tablets, to execute financial and non-financial transactions. This easiness of service usage is behind its acceptance and adaptability around the world. This explains itself why mbanking is expanding rapidly, bankers want to grab this as an opportunity to improve their competitiveness, expand their banking services, and to enhance customer loyalty and satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alalwan, Dwivedi, Rana, Lal, &amp; Williams, 2015)</ref>. M-banking can help in the customer's base expansion, operational efficiency, costeffective, and can enhance revenue, and for consumers, it facilitates easy, cost-effective and anywhere banking <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Al-Jabri &amp; Sohail, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Banking services are rapidly expanding, including offering the service remotely <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Langfield &amp; Pagano, 2015)</ref>. Therefore, it is predicted that m-banking will continue gaining its popularity, particularly among banks as it has potential to upsurge their market share <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Vella, Wallström, &amp; Farshid, 2017)</ref>. Based on the same reasons, expansion of electronic devices, applications and internet are the causes behind the advent of gamification also, which are consist of group of activities which brings fun, excitement, motivation and joyful experience in usage, as well as an improved gamification stage, can help service providers to learn about their consumers which can be very helpful to design their online experience grounded on the users activities and liking <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Zichermann &amp; Cunningham, 2011)</ref>. Game-based applications are useful in improving learning and performances <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Galetta, 2013)</ref>. Therefore, it can be assumed that gamification might subsidize to improve m-banking usage.</p><p>The whole structure of this system is based on four aspects, human behaviour, banking application, internet, and mobile phone. Continuous improvement in communication technologies, are making software (application and internet) and hardware (electronic device) easy and smooth to use, and the only unrelated, much studied and most dynamic aspect is to understand human behaviour. Therefore, it has to be studied separately on how and what influences consumer behaviour, what drives users' behaviour, and how it can be improved to enhance m-banking adaptability and make it more user-friendly. Therefore, service providers and researchers are continuously trying to understand the factors affecting behaviour intention and usage behaviour. Specifically, the region where the present study is conducted i.e. Albania a country in the transition phase.</p><p>Looking into the few facts regarding communication technology expansion and acceptance, along with financial services limitations in Albania. Still, more than ninety percent of the transaction witness cash transaction and a big chunk of the population does not have a bank account. Technological advancement through electronic and m-banking can be useful to remove cash and paper-based transactions and can reduce the cost significantly and can help banking services expansion in Albania. Moreover, initiatives on access and usage will complement the other initiatives such as to enhance financial literacy among Albanians <ref type="bibr">(Bank of Albania, 2018)</ref>. But the studies on m-banking usage and acceptance in the context of a transition country like Albania is still limited and emerging studies can contribute theoretically for its practical implication and improvement. Apparently, this is one of the reasons to conduct this study in the premises of Albania. Recently, considerable progress has been observed regarding the number of home-banking transactions amplified substantially during 2018 (Bank of Albania, 2019) and it an obvious motivation of study. To sum up, all indications of the fast development trend of technology acceptance and usage in Albania, m-banking seems a burgeoning area to be researched and recommend.</p><p>In nutshell, the present study espoused the UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) advanced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref> and the extended UTAUT2 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Venkatesh, Thong, and Xu (2012)</ref>. Based on these models, the current study assumes that this extended UTAUT2 model can be useful to explain how Albanian consumers embracing the mobile banking because UTAUT has been considered the most well-known and comprehensive model related with communication technology acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Park, Yang, &amp; Lehto, 2007)</ref>. Later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baptista and Oliveira (2017)</ref> studied the combined effect of gamification first time with UTAUT2 theory in the construct to determine the possible impact of the application of game design techniques and game mechanics in the acceptance of m-banking services and found some interesting results. Motivated by the results, the present study covered a further step to assess the relationship between gamification and behavioural intention, identify the generational differences to bring out clearly who and how accepts m-banking. This can help marketers and law-makers to understand and serve specifically Albanian consumers better as well as to generalize it to similar economies.</p><p>The present study is motivated by the discussed model and emerging factors, investigate the further impact of gamification on behavioural intention and the influence of generational difference (Gen Y and Z) on the relationship of gamification and behavioural intention. The present study has identified the key variables such as performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), facilitating conditions (FC), habit (HB), hedonic motivation (HM) on behavioural intention (BI), use behaviour (UB), intention to recommend (IR) and gamification (GM) and a moderator, generation cohort (Gen Y and Z) using the extended UTAUT2 model given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Venkatesh et al. (2012)</ref>, to investigate the significant factors influence m-banking acceptance and usage under the chosen theory in the context of Albanian consumers' m-banking adaptability and acceptance.</p><p>To the best of the authors' knowledge, no other study has covered gamification extensively, how gamification can affect behavioural intention, and comparison of the relationship between gamification and behavioural intention between generation Y and Z, which represent the core originality of the present study. From the managerial point of view, the moderating effect of generational cohorts into the relationship between GM and BI provides useful insights. The study offers an extended model based on the UTAUT2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Venkatesh et al. (2012)</ref>. The adoption of this framework would add substantially to the literature, and the outcome will contribute towards practical implication. The necessity to understand and investigate the factors which affect BI, UB, IR, and GM in the context of a transition country motivated to conduct this research. Hence, this study seeks to investigate the effect of augmented constructs of UTAUT2 and gamification on the intention to use m-banking in the context of a post-communist transition country Albania.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical background</head><p>The theoretical underpinning of the current research is built on three perspectives: UTAUT2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>, gamification <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kim &amp; Lee, 2015)</ref> and generational cohort theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Inglehart, 2015)</ref>. The UTAUT model <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref> was established based on eight prominent and preceding theories: the theory of reasoned action <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975)</ref>, the technology acceptance model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Davis, 1989)</ref>, the motivational model <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Davis, Bagozzi, &amp; Warshaw, 1992)</ref>, the theory of planned behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>, the personal computing utilization model <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Thompson, Higgins, &amp; Howell, 1991)</ref>, the innovation diffusion theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Rogers, 1995)</ref>, the social cognitive theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Compeau &amp; Higgins, 1995)</ref> and the integrated model of technology acceptance and planned behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Taylor &amp; Todd, 1995)</ref>. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Zichermann and Cunningham (2011)</ref> claim that integrating game mechanics into a consumer-facing website or mobile application create a fun-filled and captivating environment for consumers, attract them to visit again and again. Later, other researchers also considered this in their framework and gave meaningful results <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baptista &amp; Oliveira, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Galetta, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kim &amp; Lee, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">W. K. Tan, 2018)</ref>. Thus, the present study applied gamification to examine behavioral intentions. Moreover, the generational cohort theory formulated back in 1977 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Inglehart, 2015)</ref> advocates that individuals can be grouped based on their birth years, because it has been found that individuals belonging to a certain generational cohort manifesting common beliefs and attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Meriac, Woehr, &amp; Banister, 2010)</ref>. Scholars have considered segmenting the population by generation cohort more efficient that grouping by age <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lissitsa &amp; Kol, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Parment, 2013)</ref>. Therefore, the present study will combine these concepts to draw the consumers' behavioral intentions, user behavior and intentions to recommend considering specifically the role of gamification and generational cohorts.</p><p>The current research further developed its hypotheses in five blocks with the explanation of each variable how they are related to the dependent variable: (i) factors which influence UB (BI, FC and HB); (ii) factors affecting BI (PE, EE, SI, FC, HB, HM, and gamification); (iii) linking SI, FC, HB, and HM to gamification Fourth, how the generation cohort affects the relationship between gamification and behavioural intention (BI), and Fifth, how user behaviour (UB) affects the intention to recommend (IR).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses development</head><p>The first block of hypotheses deals with the factors affecting user behaviour (UB). Based on UTAUT2, BI, FC, and HB have an imperative role in predicting continuous use of the technology. Moreover, other researchers also applied this in mobile banking studies and found relevant findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baptista &amp; Oliveira, 2017)</ref>. Looking into the relationship between BI, FC, HB, and UB, the existing literature reveals a strong relationship between the variables, which provide a strong platform to examine the impact on user behaviour. Looking into the meaning of BI, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ajzen (1991)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fishbein and Ajzen (1975)</ref>, explained intentions are about how much effort and hard work an individual is putting to achieve the desired behaviour. Intentions are supposed to apprehend the factors which motivate an individual to perform a desirable behaviour. Therefore, it is on the willingness of an individual's intention whether he or she wants to perform a particular behaviour or not. The stronger the intention for expected behaviour, the higher the chances of its achievement. Therefore, it supports that intentions affect behaviour.</p><p>Similarly, FC is about providing a supportive set of conditions, such as online seminars or samples, examples and demonstrations, which are helpful to increase the chances of m-banking acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baptista &amp; Oliveira, 2017)</ref>. Another factor is HB, which is elucidated in the context of information system as to what extent people tend to behave automatically because of learning. It reflects that it is about regular and automaticity and it is essential to understand habit to improve the use of technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Limayem, Hirt, &amp; Cheung, 2007)</ref>. A number of studies found that BI positively affects UB <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bhatiasevi, 2016)</ref>. The studies from different regions reveal strongly that BI, FC, and HB have a major influence on UB <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ameen, Willis, &amp; Hussain Shah, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baabdullah, Alalwan, Rana, Kizgin, &amp; Patil, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baptista &amp; Oliveira, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kwateng, Atiemo, &amp; Appiah, 2019)</ref>. Therefore, the following hypotheses have been framed: H1: UB is positively affected by BI (H1a), FC (H1b), and HB (H1c).</p><p>The second block of hypotheses is framed to test the factors affecting BI. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref> explain PE as the degree to which a person believes that using the system can support to attain the improvements in job performance, it is about perceived usefulness. Similarly, regarding m-banking, researchers found that users perceived that using m-banking can change the nature of banking, navigation patterns, the number of site visits, and the number of transactions executed, will affect the overall usage pattern because of fast, convenient and service effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Engotoit, Kituyi, &amp; Moya, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Naicker &amp; Van Der Merwe, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Zhou, Lu, &amp; Wang, 2010)</ref>. On the other hand, EE is about the degree of easiness attached to the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. It is assumed that easiness helps users to adopt the system easily, sometimes it can be a reason behind the system acceptance or adoption failure, similarly, the same is the case with m-banking. Hence, it is relevant to related EE with m-banking usage. Usefulness and easiness of usage positively affect BI <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ameen et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Moazenzadeh &amp; Hamidi, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Thongsri, Shen, Bao, &amp; Alharbi, 2018)</ref>. Studies also indicate that PE and EE have a positive effect on the intention to use mobile devices/services or behavioural intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carlsson, Carlsson, Hyvönen, Puhakainen, &amp; Walden, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Rahi &amp; Abd. Ghani, 2019)</ref>. SI is the degree to which customers perceive that others (e.g., family and friends) believe they should use a specific technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>. Indeed, SI and intention to use m-banking have a significant connection <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kumar, Lall, &amp; Mane, 2017)</ref>. FC is explained as the extent to which a person is certain that an organizational and technical infrastructure is available to support the use of the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. On the other hand, m-banking usage requires a specific kind of skill and resources support <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alalwan et al., 2015)</ref>. FC has a significant effect on user adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Zhou et al., 2010)</ref>. Habit is defined as the degree to which people incline to perform behaviours repeatedly because of learning, it reflects that it is about regular, and automaticity and it is essential to understand the habit to improve the use of technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Limayem et al., 2007)</ref>. Because of its convenience and easy adaptability and its repeated use makes consumers addictive and gradually m-banking can become people's habit <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Huili &amp; Chunfang, 2011)</ref>. HM is the amusing or pleasure resultant from using technology, and it has been displayed to play a significant role in shaping technology acceptance and usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brown &amp; Venkatesh, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alalwan et al. (2015)</ref>, Internet banking adoption among consumers may increase if they perceive Internet banking as entertaining, pleasurable and enjoyable and the results of the study indicated that HM has a significant influence on BI. HM and HB have a positive effect on BI <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alalwan et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The term gamification (GM) was originated in the digital media industry. Its application is widespread and is used by various service providers to engage users and enhance participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Deterding, Dixon, Khaled, &amp; Nacke, 2011)</ref>. GM is the process of game-thinking and game mechanics to engage users and solve problems. It is about consumers' engagement, attracting through fun filed activities and motivate towards a specific behaviour change. GM is acknowledged as a vital set of activities concerning engagement and motivation. A study found that GM has a positive impact on BI. This reveals the importance that the usage of game mechanics and game design techniques can influence the m-banking usage intention, direct and strong association between gamification and intention towards usage of m-banking services were traced from the evidences <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baptista &amp; Oliveira, 2017)</ref>. H2: BI is positively influenced by PE (H2a), EE (H2b), SI (H2c), FC (H2d), HB (H2e), HM (H2f), and GM (H2g).</p><p>The third block of hypothesis consists of factors affecting gamification. Scholars have revealed that social factors are a strong determinant of user intentions towards gamified services (C. H. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chung, Shen, &amp; Qiu, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hamari &amp; Koivisto, 2015)</ref>. Moreover, FC is a significant factor influencing students to accept gamification (C. H. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chung et al., 2019)</ref>. Game dynamics and mechanics affect the development of a habit through the mobile application. As no prior study has examined how habit influence gamification, the present study aims to contribute to this novelty. Habit is about repetitiveness, therefore, the present study aims to examine how a habit effects gamification. GM influences intention to use m-banking services targeting to augment the banking services by making an enjoyable and attractive experience. Therefore, mbanking attractiveness makes consumers habitual towards gamification. A study addressed the perception and usage of the gamified learning environment from a hedonic motivation perspective and found enjoyment is significant with BI <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Oluwajana, Idowu, Nat, Vanduhe, &amp; Fadiya, 2019)</ref>. On the other hand, gamification provides fun and pleasure to use technology, hence the study tried to investigate how HM affects gamification. Taking all together, H3: Gamification is positively impacted by SI (H3a), FC (H3b), HB (H3c), and HM (H3d).</p><p>The fourth block of hypotheses is about the generational cohort and how it affects the relationship between gamification and BI. No prior study has covered it so far. To understand the influence of generation, what is expected to influence this relationship is the difference in characteristics of Gen Y and Z. Different generations reflect different characteristics based on the changes happening around the world. Generation cohorts classify generations in homogenous groups which reflect a similar attitude towards social and professional life. People born between 1979-1995 were named as Gen Y and they have witnessed the era of globalization. They have witnessed technology development and its application for easiness. On the other hand, Gen Z inclusive of people born after 1996, are born in the technological environment. They are brought up in mobile technology and technology is part of their daily life <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fromm &amp; Read, 2018)</ref>. Considering this difference, it would be interesting to identify the generational differences impact on the relationship between gamification and behavioural intention to use mobile banking. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Harris, Cox, Musgrove, &amp; Ernstberger (2016)</ref>, though people of all ages now reflect an equal interest in emerging online technologies, comparatively, older customers perceive high value in conventional banking, and younger users are more attracted towards newest technologies. Another study stated that age reflects differences in information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>. As gamification came into existence, gradually it gains acceptance among both the generations. Baptista &amp; Oliveira <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baptista &amp; Oliveira, 2017)</ref> claim that gamification can make banking services more enjoyable, fun-filed, and exciting, which can improve consumers' mobile banking services acceptance, involvement, and satisfaction. Gamification is expected to have more engagement among Gen Z as they are brought up in a similar digital environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Zichermann &amp; Cunningham, 2011)</ref>. Therefore, the current study extends the mentioned research by examining specifically generational perception and differences in the relationship between gamification and BI. Thus, H4: Generational cohort moderates the relationship between GM and BI.</p><p>Regarding the fifth hypothesis, very limited research about the IR and actual recommendations are available, regardless of word-of-mouth IR popularity and importance among researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Keiningham, Cooil, Aksoy, Andreassen, &amp; Weiner, 2007)</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mehrad &amp; Mohammadi (2017)</ref> found that word-ofmouth is the main variable influences users' attitudes toward the use of m-banking. From the user's behaviour perspective, satisfaction is a key factor of behavioural intentions, including IR <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Finn, Wang, &amp; Frank, 2009)</ref>. In simple words, intention to recommend may depend on the usage behaviour of consumers, either they have positive or negative. IR through social media and communication devices is influenced by the benefits gained through mobile payment technology. Therefore, the intention to recommend technology is a post-adoption behaviour (K. H. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chung &amp; Shin, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lancelot Miltgen, Popovič, &amp; Oliveira, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Oliveira, Thomas, Baptista, &amp; Campos, 2016)</ref>. Therefore, H5: IR is positively affected by UB.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> presents the conceptual framework of this study which has been designed to investigate the behaviour of m-banking users. The conceptual framework maps the hypotheses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection and research methodology</head><p>To examine the proposed theoretical model, a questionnaire in English language was designed and reviewed for content validity by academics of the field. Afterwards, it was translated into the local language of Albania. The data collection tool has been chosen questionnaire due to the fact that previous research which investigate m-banking and UTAUT2 model followed identical data collection technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baptista &amp; Oliveira, 2017)</ref>. The questionnaire contains three main sections: indicators of UTAUT2 constructs, gamification indicators, and demographic profile of the respondents.

( , 2012))</ref>; the UB, IR and GM from Martins, Oliveira and Popovič <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Martins, Oliveira, &amp; Popovič, 2014)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baptista and Oliveira (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Sigala (2015)</ref>. The original UTAUT2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref> includes even price value construct, however, it was not relevant for this research, since the mobile service in Albania is provided free of charge. The level of agreement for indicator have been measured with a five-point Likert scale (1 = 'strongly disagree' to 5 = 'strongly agree'). Within the questionnaire, UB scale was reworded from Martins et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Martins et al., 2014)</ref> aiming to measure the m-banking usage frequency. Since the respondents had used m-banking at least once in a year, the UB scale was modified from 11 into 10 answers by removing the 'never' answer: 1 = 'once a year', 2 = 'once in six months', 3 = 'once in three months', 4 = 'once a month', 5 = 'once a week', 6 = 'once in 4-5 days', 7 = 'once in 2-3 days', 8 = 'almost every day', 9 = 'every day', 10 = 'several times a day'. Furthermore, the respondents were request to write the year they were born, however, for analysis purposes, codes used were 0 for Generation Z (covering respondents born after 1996) and 1 for Generation Y (respondents inborn between 1985 and 1996).</p><p>The convenience sampling technique has been followed due to the fact that the study focuses on the behaviour of m-banking users only. Thus, the target population consist of individuals (above 18 years old) who poses a mobile phone or tablet with internet access, have at least one bank accounts and have used mbanking at least once a year. Before distribution, a pilot test with 100 respondents randomly chosen was conducted, to be able to revise the accuracy of the translation and to ensure consistency. The gathered data from pilot test were not included in the final sample. The collection of the data took place during Spring 2019 in Albania. After filtering the final sample, 380 valid records were used for further analyses, above the suggested level of 200 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> demonstrates the sample profile. Half of the sample consists of Generation Z individuals (49%). The majority of the respondents were female (68.7%). 15 in 100 respondents had high school as the highest level of education and the rest had at least university degree (84% = 52.4% university + 31.6% postuniversity and more). Concerning the employment status, approximately two in five respondents were unemployed. Regarding the occupation profile, the majority of those who were employed worked in the private sector (78.6%), 16.3% in the public sector and 5.1% in both sectors. Further information regarding sample characteristics within generational cohorts are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The sample profile correspond with the study conducted by Chaouali, Souiden and Ladhari <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chaouali, Souiden, &amp; Ladhari, 2017)</ref>. PLS-SEM was used to evaluate the variance of the internal cause of the constructs based on the proposed theoretical model and their corresponding manifest variables in turn <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hair, Hult, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2017)</ref>. PLS-SEM was employed because constructs are not normally distributed and the current research requires latent variable scores for follow-up analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hair, Risher, Sarstedt, &amp; Ringle, 2019)</ref>. In addition, PLS performs convenient method in testing mediation effects because it provides an indication of relationship that is similar to the traditional regression coefficients. All constructs in the current study were modelled as reflective indicators. PLS-SEM was run through SmartPLS 3.0 computer software <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Ringle, Wende, &amp; Becker, 2015)</ref>. Firstly, the structural model was designed to assist in order to define the variables and their relationship. Secondly, the measurement model of the constructs were calculated initially to define the reliability, validity and discriminant validity to follow up with the demonstration of the relationships between the constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>. To identify the significance of these relationships the standardized paths were examined. These paths were calculated using the bootstrap procedure, with 1000 iterations of resampling.</p></div>

In this section are presented the core PLS-SEM assumptions dealing with collinearity, item loading, reliability and discriminant validity among constructs.</p><p>Initially all items per each construct in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> were included in the analysis. Based on variance inflation factor (VIF) the first item of IR construct was removed, because it exceeded the threshold of 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hair et al., 2019)</ref>. Besides HB1, HB2, HB4, IR2, IR4 which had a slightly higher VIF value than 3, the ensuing indicators fulfilled the conservative threshold.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural model</head><p>Following the fulfilment of PLS-SEM assumption, the examination of structural model has been completed (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>). The model explains 15.7% of the variation in UB, 63.5% in BI, 40.7% in GM, and 7.4% in IR. Based on our conceptual framework, UB is determined by FC, HB and BI. Hence, UB is positively affected by BI (β = 0.145, p &lt; 0.1) and HB (β = 0.268, p &lt; 0.001). Therefore, sufficient evidence have been identified to support H1a and H1c. The relationship between FC and UB resulted insignificant (β = 0.026, p &gt; 0.10). Regarding BI, constructs which statistically impact were PE (β = 0.175, p &lt; 0.01), FC (β = 0.257, p &lt; 0.001), HB (β = 0.405, p &lt; 0.001), and HM (β = 0.096, p &lt; 0.1). The influence of EE and SI along with the main effect of GM over BI resulted insignificant. However, the moderation effect of GM through Gen YZ on BI was significant (β = 0.069, p &lt; 0.05). Following the <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kenny's (2018)</ref> benchmarks, the moderation effect size was medium (f 2 = 0.013). Thus, H2a, H2d, H2e, H2f and H4 were supported. Regarding GM, which resulted to be positively influenced by FC (β = 0.2, p &lt; 0.01), HB (β = 0.155, p &lt; 0.05), and HM (β = 0.387, p &lt; 0.001). SI effect on GM was insignificant, β = 0.039, p &gt; 0.10. The effect of UB over IR was positively significant, β = 0.272, p &lt; 0.001. Therefore, H3b, H3c, H3d and H5 were supported.</p></div>

Moreover, the determinants of UB and its effect on IR were examined. Additionally, the novelty of this study consists on the moderating effect of generational cohorts into the relationship between BI and GM.</p><p>The results of this study reveal that BI determinants are PE, FC, HB and HM.

According to Thiebes, Lins and Basten (2014) 80% of cases where game elements were employed failed due to poor design and inappropriate appliance. The results of this study confirm the lack of game elements design and appliance impact. However, the current research discovered the relationship as statistically moderated by generational cohorts. As indicated by the PLS-SEM analysis, when compared to Gen Z, individuals who score high on GM and have born before 1996 (Gen Y) reflect higher intention to use m-banking, whereas those with low GM score have lower such intentions (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Consequently, different BI levels may be achieved through the application of game elements within generational cohorts.</p></div>

The moderating effect on BI</head><p>The finding comprehensible shed light on the Gen Z individuals' easiness adoption of game elements within app usage, compared with the individuals of Gen Y.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions, limitations and recommendations</head><p>The research provides insights regarding influential factors on behaviour intention, user behaviour, gamification and intention to recommend m-banking. Thus, the current research makes an important contribution concerning customer behaviour in m-banking and its determinants. The theoretical background of the study leans on modified UTAUT2 model <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>, gamification <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Deterding, Sicart, et al., 2011)</ref> and generational cohorts theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Inglehart, 2015)</ref> establishing an attractive combination of constructs and its impact on m-banking users in the context of a transition country.</p><p>To authors' knowledge, the current study is among the first which theoretically explain and empirical examine the moderation effect of gamification on intention to use m-banking through generational cohorts.</p><p>However, prior studies have demonstrated the importance of gamification <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hamari &amp; Koivisto, 2015)</ref> and its influence on individuals' intention to use m-banking <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baptista &amp; Oliveira, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Rahi &amp; Abd. Ghani, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rodrigues et al., 2017)</ref>, while the current research emphasises the role of generational cohorts which moderates the effect of gamification on intention to use m-banking.</p><p>From a managerial perspective, bank managers are in favour of offering services remotely, due to diminish operational costs. For banks, technological advancements create competitive advantages by allowing companies to invest on services improvement. Operating banks in transition countries are adviced to follow the similar trends accros the glob regarding m-banking services due to its beneficial obtainability for banks and clients. An enhanced bank strategy which would employ game elements is expected to encourage clients to use and recommend the m-banking services. The similar evidence regarding motivation to use mbanking have been identified previously, whereas points (game mechanics element) motivated app usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chaouali et al., 2017)</ref>. Furthermore, the results of current study assist banks concerning additional effort required to encourage individuals belonging to Gen Y to use m-banking services, rather than Gen Z.</p><p>The current study has its limitations which may be consider as invitation for further research by academic and researchers. Beginning with the sample, the study is biased due to its lack of comparision with nonusers. Eventually, investigating the obstacles which prohibit nonusers to use m-banking may assist banks to increase the usage of m-banking. Although the majority constructs appeared to be significant, further research may employ trust, information asymmetry, perceived risk, personal innovativeness. Furthermore, modifying the model by adding different variables based on cultural and economic background might provide attractive results. Also, modifying the gamification construct by incorporating other game elements to obtain additional information regarding game elements impact on m-banking users could provide important insight. Nevertheless, Albania might share similarities with other countries in terms of economic progress and technology advancements in banking services sectors the results of this study are limited to one country. Limited research has been conducted in Albania regarding the reasons to continue using mbanking services as suggested by <ref type="bibr">Shaikh et al. (2015b)</ref> which may be incorporated within the model.
