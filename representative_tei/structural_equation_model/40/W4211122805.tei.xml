<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In recent years, the proliferation of social media use gained the attention of scholars and practitioners, especially work-related outcomes (e.g., active social media users number around 4.20 billion globally). A recent report shows that approximately 41% of employees worldwide have used social media for work purposes <ref type="bibr">(Digital Report, 2021)</ref>. The use of social media applications and tools has the characteristics of attracting potential customers, future employees and communicating, sharing, expressing knowledge, generating ideas, and building relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bilgihan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ebrahimi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Human et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Jose 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Pekkala et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Seyyedamiri and Tajrobehkar, 2021)</ref> resulting in online brand communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chikweche and Fletcher, 2014)</ref>. Social media has a significant impact on the lives of individuals or employees and the way organisations operate <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bodhi et al., 2021a)</ref>.</p><p>Employees are increasingly adopting various social media technologies related to enhancing communication and collaboration in the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Pekkala et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Pitafi et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The adoption of various social media technologies such as corporate social media by practitioners and academics highlights the importance of social media activities for business and value creation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alsharji et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Papa et al., 2018)</ref>. Enterprise social media also provides employees with capabilities such as establishing, strengthening, and maintaining their social relationships, stimulating creativity, accelerating innovation, strengthening management practices, and may help to obtain psychological and social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Al Dari et al, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bodhi et al., 2021c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ding et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Leonardi, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Nusrat et al., 2021)</ref>. Thus, there is a need to study the role of work-related social media use and how it impacts employee psychological wellbeing and innovative work performance.</p><p>Prior studies have further stated that social media use in organisations impacts employee performance, job satisfaction, wellbeing, knowledge sharing, and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jafar et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ma et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Song et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Zhao et al., 2020)</ref>. However, some basic factors need to be considered. We have suggested several gaps based on the comments of the previous WSMU literature. First, there is limited research on WSMU and its association with employee-related results (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Pekkala et al., 2021)</ref>. Previous research has focused on general results, such as social overload, information overload, and SNS exhaustion <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Luqman et al., 2017)</ref>. Therefore, the use of social media must be considered from the perspective of employees. In addition, it is also important to respond to <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Luqman et al.'s (2021)</ref> recent call for research to examine the impact of social media use on employees and its subsequent consequences.</p><p>Second, most previous studies related to social media in organisations did not specify the types of social media use. It is imperative to investigate specific types of SNS behaviours, because the types of SNS usage may vary from person to person and serve different purposes. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cao et al. (2018)</ref> examined the causes of general social media use problems and recommended investigating specific media research. Our research provides insights into how certain types of social media affect employees' innovative behaviours.</p><p>Third, a lot of research have been conducted in context to use of social media in non-work environments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hsu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Twenge et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Wartberg et al., 2020)</ref> includes adolescents and young adults. This study examines the role of social media use (for example, work-related social media use) and its impact on employee wellbeing and innovative performance.</p><p>Moreover, a novel phenomenon, FoMO, has attracted the attention of scholars in the recent past <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Elhai et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Tandon et al., 2021b)</ref> and captured the mass media's focus <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Budnick et al., 2020)</ref>. A recent study states that FoMO adversely impacts psychological and behavioural outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Tandon et al., 2021b)</ref>. FoMO refers to a "pervasive apprehension that one might miss valuable career opportunities when away or disconnected from work, and the people's tendency to worry, they might be missing positive social experiences" <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Budnick et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Prior literature offers guidelines for combating FoMO and reducing FoMO-related job distractions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Kitchen, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lieberman, 2016)</ref> as well as FoMO's negative workplace influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Budnick et al., 2020)</ref>. However, a recent study has stated that no empirically validated investigation on workplace FoMO exists to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Budnick et al., 2020)</ref>. Hence, workplace and employees' understanding of FoMO is still limited. Therefore, we recommend addressing this gap to reveal the role of FoMO in the association between WSMU and employee well-being, and innovative job performance. Thus, it investigates the role of FoMO in a workplace context. Fourth, most previous studies have focused on the adverse effects of using social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Dhir et al., 2019)</ref>, such as sleep problems or problematic sleep <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dhir et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kaur et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Tandon et al., 2020)</ref>. Furthermore, earlier studies have established an association between general use of social media and higher psychological wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lee et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Lin, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Pang, 2018)</ref>. However, few studies have reported lower wellbeing in context to adolescents and young adults. Studies have reported numerous challenges associated with social media use and mixed results in the context of the relationship between social media usage and wellbeing. However, these studies related to social media use have been conducted in a non-working environment that includes adolescents and young adults (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hsu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Papa et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Twenge et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Wartberg et al., 2020)</ref>. Limited studies are available in the context of how WSMU at the workplace impacts overall employee wellbeing.</p><p>Moreover, scholars have made recent attempts to understand the correlation between FoMO and wellbeing, mainly in the general setting. Therefore, increasing social media use at the workplace is significant area of concern for employees and the entire organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Olfat et al., 2020)</ref> and needs to be explored.</p><p>Last, social media usage for personal and organisational purposes enhances employee performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jafar et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Jiang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Song et al., 2019)</ref>. One study stated that social media use improved routine or in-role performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Cui et al., 2020)</ref>. However, another study found a decline in performance of employees due to social media usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Zivnuska et al., 2019)</ref>. Most of the prior studies have not specified the type of social media use at the workplace, except for some exceptions (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Luo et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Luqman et al., 2021)</ref>. Since innovation is considered the essential ability that employees need to possess to enhance their performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cai et al., 2018)</ref>, the current study focuses on how WSMU influences the innovative performance of employees at the workplace. Moreover, in the recent past, WSMU has drawn researchers and practitioners' attention. Hence, based on the arguments mentioned above, we frame the following research questions (RQs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ1. Does WSMU influence employee psychological well-being and thereby innovative work performance?</head><p>RQ2. What is the role of FoMO in the association between WSMU and employee psychological well-being and innovative work performance, respectively? By answering the above research questions, the present study contributes to the literature in three ways: First, the adoption of the self-determination theory (SDT) in the organisational context and how WSMU is associated with employee-related outcomes. Second, we investigate the moderating role of FoMO in the association between WSMU, IP and PW. Third, we also examine the mediation role of employee's PW.</p><p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 details the theoretical framework and hypothesized research framework and associations. Next, section 3 provides data collection, measurement, and profile of the respondents. Subsequently, section 4 reports the results of the measurement and structural model. Section 5 provides the discussion on the results, while section 6 provides the theoretical and practical implications of the study. The last section of the manuscript details the limitations and future research direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical Background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Self-Determination Theory</head><p>Due to the nascent stage of FoMO and related concepts, the theoretical foundations of previous literature on FoMO are not yet strong <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Tandon et al., 2021a)</ref>. We formulated relationships among the recognised variables based on SDT and proposed two research questions. The SDT assumes that "humans are active organisms which possess an active tendency towards psychological growth, endowed with innate efforts to cope with ongoing challenges and to assimilate new experiences" <ref type="bibr">(Ryan &amp; Deci 2002)</ref>. Moreover, SDT examines "how social media use affects job satisfaction and intrinsic work motivation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Chen et al., 2020)</ref>. Furthermore, the workplace model of SDT poses that, when employees feel more connected to the organisation and their members, they feel satisfied and experience support; thus, results are achieved in enhanced wellbeing and performance <ref type="bibr">(Deci et al., 2017)</ref>. Hence, based on SDT, the present study examines how WSMU impacts employees' performance at the workplace; moreover, how it is connected to employees' wellbeing?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Importance of social media use at workplace</head><p>Social media use at workplaces has drawn scholars' attention towards investigating their influence on employees and related outcomes <ref type="bibr">(Bodhi et al., 2021c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Tandon et al., 2022)</ref>. An essential question is frequently stressed to researchers and stockholders; what is the difference between work-related social media use (WSMU) and general social media use? Basically, WSMU refers to the "content shared related to work experience, organizational or industryrelated information, sharing documents and work-related information" <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Liang et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The general type of social media use, such as adolescent and young adults, refers to "non-workrelated activities, such as sharing leisure information, documenting life experiences, and exchanging emotional feelings" <ref type="bibr">(Huang et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Organisations and employees are incrementally actualising applications based on social media because it contributes to social interaction, innovation and socio-emotional relationships <ref type="bibr">(Luqman et al., 2020)</ref>. Moreover, social media use for organisational branding has substantial importance for how current and future employees perceive the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bodhi, 2021)</ref>. Furthermore, employee communication and collaboration on different work-related social media platforms is also considered as a competitive advantage for organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Pekkala &amp; van Zoonen, 2021)</ref>. Thus, the increasing ubiquity of social media use and their frequent usages in organisations needs expertise <ref type="bibr">(Bodhi et al., 2021c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">van Laar et al., 2019)</ref>. Therefore, the role of WSMU is an essential area of concern for both employees and their organisations. Hence, the present study examines the associations between WSMU and innovative job performance.</p><p>Furthermore, the mediating role of psychological wellbeing and the moderating role of FoMO were examined. The operational description of the study constructs is shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Hypothesis Development</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> presents the proposed moderated mediated research model and the hypothesised associations framed in the following sections to explore the notions and research questions in an organisational setting. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ali-Hassan et al. (2015)</ref> stated that social media use reinforces employees' skills to create, obtain and share knowledge, and, thus, increases employees performance. Another study stated that social media use improves routine or in-role performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Cui et al., 2020)</ref>. A recent study stated that employees are unable to work without social media in any private or public sector organizations, which shows the relevance of social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Liang et al., 2021)</ref>. Another study reported that social media use at the workplace enhances employee creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Liu et al., 2018)</ref>, which is essential for organisational competitiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Ding et al., 2019)</ref>. WSMU may empower employees to advance their knowledge and social interaction <ref type="bibr">(Bodhi et al., 2021c;</ref><ref type="bibr">Leonardi, 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, WSMU has potential to increase employees' own capabilities, which is vital to improve job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chen et al., 2021)</ref>. However, some prior studies found a decline in employee performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Zivnuska et al., 2019)</ref>. This dichotomy related to the social media use on employee performance warrants further examination. Moreover, we argue that WSMU enhances employees' innovative performance. Thus, based on the above argument, the first hypothesis is proposed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1: WSMU positively influences innovative work performance.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">WSMU and psychological wellbeing</head><p>Due to technological advances, social media sites and applications' popularity increases globally <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chai et al., 2019)</ref>. Prior studies have found a positive association between personal or general use of social networking sites and application use and wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Lönnqvist and Große Deters, 2016)</ref> in adolescents and young adults. Previous studies have also stated the positive impact of social media in terms of improved work-life equilibrium, optimistic effect on morale, and psychological meaningfulness at the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kühnel et al, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Men et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Nusrat et al., 2021)</ref>. Another study shows that greater use of social media use is linked with greater life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Wheatley and Buglass, 2019)</ref>. However, some studies also found a negative association between social media and subjective wellbeing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Rae and Lonborg, 2015)</ref> and exhaustion <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Luqman et al., 2021)</ref>. However, intimacy theory <ref type="bibr">(Reis and Shaver, 1988)</ref> says that interactions through social media are positively related to wellbeing.</p><p>According to managerial practices, wellbeing of employees refers to physical, social and psychological wellbeing (PW). PW is mainly related to satisfaction with one's job and life, <ref type="bibr">(Grant et al., 2007)</ref>. Prior studies have found that positive psychological emotions boost performance related outcomes (Chia and <ref type="bibr">Chu, 2016)</ref>. Thus, we believe that WSMU positively affects the psychological wellbeing of the employee. Furthermore, employees' psychological wellbeing positively impacts innovative work performance. Hence, based on the above discussion, the following hypothesis are proposed.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Budnick et al. (2020)</ref> defined FoMO "as a pervasive apprehension that one might miss valuable career opportunities when away or disconnected from work". Moreover, it refers to "a strong need to stay connected online, passively or actively participate in information or messages exchange" through different social technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Tomczyk and Selmanagic-Lizde, 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Przybylski et al. (2013)</ref> specified that FoMO is usually represented and measured mostly in an online or internet setting; however, its concept, definitions, and scale items do not refer to online behaviour. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Wegmann et al. (2017)</ref> stated that it could be considered or measured as a dispositional trait, distinguished as general FoMO. Prior research stated that FoMO is associated with the deterioration of various dimensions of wellbeing in a general context <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Buglass et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Stead and Bibby, 2017)</ref>. Furthermore, FoMO may moderate the association of social media use and individuals' adaptation through various mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chai et al., 2019)</ref>. Individuals with high FoMO are anticipated to use maladaptive approaches for fulfilling their psychological needs, such as addictive or problematic WSMU <ref type="bibr">(Wolniewicz et al., 2017)</ref>, resulting in low wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Marino et al., 2018)</ref> and job performance. Hence, based on the discussions, we propose the following hypotheses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Data collection</head><p>Data were collected using a paper-based and online questionnaire in the English language. The online questionnaire was circulated by email and social networking sites. A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect data from working professionals from different organizations in India. India has witnessed a massive rise in social media usage at the workplace; according to the Digital Report, 2021, approximately 47% of Indian employees have adopted social media for work purposes. The respondents were employed in different organisations from services sectors in India. The services sector is a dominant sector in India, accounting for 54% of the total gross value added (GVA) in the financial year 2021 (IBEF, 2021) and covers a wide range of activities, such as financing, insurance, transport, communication, business services, etc.</p><p>A total of 300 employees were invited from different departments to participate in an online survey. Moreover, we visited some organisations for data collection in the central part of India.</p><p>Data were collected between February and April 2021. Initially, questionnaires were circulated through offline mode. However, due to the COVID-19 complication, the survey was distributed by email and WhatsApp (e.g., a mobile-based application widely used in India). The authors provided a guarantee to respondents for confidentiality and anonymity during the data collection process, which encouraged them to provide genuine responses and ensured the survey's validity. Initially, 268 responses were collected; however, 32 responses were dropped due to inadequate responses. Finally, a total of 236 responses was used for analysis purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Measures</head><p>The measurement items are mostly based on prior literature. Participants responded to all survey items using a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from "1 = strongly disagree" to "5 = strongly agree" (except for demographics). The items of all scales are shown in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Work-related social media use (WSMU)</head><p>. WSMU was measured using five items based on <ref type="bibr">Ellison et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Gonzalez et al. (2013)</ref>. This scale measured work-related social media use in organisations. Sample items are "Social media has become part of my daily routine" and "I use the social media to share work-related information with colleagues". The Cronbach's alpha value is 0.85 for a five-item scale (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Psychological wellbeing (PW)</head><p>. PW was measured using a three items scale <ref type="bibr">(Diener et al., 2009)</ref>. Sample items are" I am engaged and interested in my daily activities" and "I lead a purposeful &amp; meaningful life". The Cronbach's alpha value is 0.81 for this three-item scale.</p><p>However, one item was removed due to weak factor loading. <ref type="bibr">(FoMO)</ref>. FoMO was measured using five items based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Przybylski et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Budnick et al. (2020)</ref>. This scale measured how an individual feels or has sensations about FoMO. Sample items are "I get worried when I might miss important work-related updates" and "I get anxious when I miss out on an opportunity to make important business connections". The Cronbach's alpha values are 0.85 for this five-item scale.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.5">Control Variables.</head><p>In this study, we employed two control variables. We included the age and gender of respondents as control variables. Prior studies have recognised age and gender as significant demographic variables that impact employee performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Chen and Karahanna, 2018)</ref>. Age (18-24 years=1, 25-32 years =2, 33-38 years = 3, 39-54 years= 4, 55 and above=5 and Gender (female = 1 and male = 2) were dummy-coded. During statistical analysis of the data, these demographic variables were controlled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Participant profile</head><p>For the present study, a cross-sectional dataset was used, consisting of 236 working professionals aged between 15 to 55 years, and 68.3% were male. The detailed participant profiles are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Common method bias (CMB)</head><p>The present study used a cross-sectional study; thus, it is essential to address the possible existence of CMB <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. First, Harmans' single factor test was used, and the maximum covariance explained by a single factor was found 37.1%, which is less than 50% <ref type="bibr">(Podsakoff et al., 2012)</ref>. Therefore, it is resolved that the current research is not affected by CMB. Second, to limit the response bias, we also examined the correlation matrix and found that none of any association exceeded 0.90 <ref type="bibr">(Pavlou et al., 2017)</ref>. Finally, we examined the regression weights of all measurement items for the model with and without common latent factor (CLF) based on the AMOS CFA model. The differences in regression weights (standardised) were found less than 0.20, confirming that CMB is not a concern in our data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Archimi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gaski, 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Analysis</head><p>For statistical analyses of the data, the present study used a variety of statistical tools, such as IBM SPSS 24.0, AMOS 25.0, and Process Macro 3.4. two two-step approach was followed as directed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</ref> for applying Structural Equation Modelling (SEM).</p><p>Firstly, the measurement model confirms the reliability and validity of the items and constructs.</p><p>Moreover, to examine the factorial structure of the measurement model, we have conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in AMOS 21. The model fit was evaluated based on the following eight indexes. Secondly, the structural model was used for confirming the proposed hypotheses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1.">Validity and reliability.</head><p>The investigation of the measurement model for each construct includes the validity and reliability of the data. Thus, following validity and reliability of the measures or scales., internal consistency reliability, discriminant validity, and convergent validity have been calculated and discussed in detail (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>). The values of Cronbach's alphas for all constructs are above 0.8, and composite reliabilities are above 0.80 (recommended value &gt; 0.7), representing good reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hair et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The convergent validity was measured based on factor loadings of the items and values of average variance extracted (AVEs). AVEs for study constructs should be greater than the maximum shared variance (MSV) value <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Sarstedt et al., 2014)</ref>. The values of factor loadings of all items are above the threshold value of 0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Anderson and Gerbing, 1988)</ref>. Moreover, the AVEs values for all latent constructs has been found higher than 0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref>. The discriminant validity was examined by comparing the inter-construct correlations of the constructs with the square root of a particular AVEs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hair et al. (2009)</ref> stated that the square root of AVEs for each latent variable should be higher than the intercorrelations of constructs. Hence, the validity and reliability of the study is established (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>). Finally, the HTMT ratio is a new criterion for evaluating discriminant validity. The HTMT values should be less than or equal to 0.9. <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kline, 2011)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref> displays the HTMT ratios of all constructs, and it is observed that HTMT values are within the permissible limits.</p><p>The results suggested a good model fit for the present study (CMIN/df = 1.851, CFI = 0.96, GFI = 0.91, AGFI = 0.88, IFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.94, NFI = 0.91, RMSEA = 0.05). <ref type="bibr">Hair et al. (2006)</ref> recommended factor loadings of each scale item threshold value of 0.60 and this was found to be satisfactory.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hayes, 2018)</ref>. Results from the mediation model indicated that WSMU was positively related to PW (β=0.69, p &lt;.001). Furthermore, psychological wellbeing was positively linked with innovative work performance (β=0.31, p &lt; .001). The mediating role of psychological wellbeing is discussed in the subsequent section (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">7</ref>).

A 43% variance in data is explained for innovative work performance and 50% for psychological wellbeing The strongest associations existed between WSMU and psychological wellbeing, followed by WSMU and innovative work performance.</p><p>Hence, the hypotheses H1, H2, H3, and H4 were supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.4.">FoMO as a moderator.</head><p>The present study also examined whether FoMO played a moderating role in the mediating effect of social media use on innovative job performance through psychological wellbeing. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref> shows the results from the moderated mediation model. Hypothesis H5 and H6 were proposed to examine the moderation of FoMO between the relationship of social media use, psychological wellbeing and innovative work performance. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">8</ref> illustrates that the interaction of social media use with FoMO was significant in predicting PW (β =.15, p &lt; .01). However, the interaction of PW with FoMO did not predict innovative work performance (β = -.05, p = .29). The result showed that the H5 (β=0.15, p &lt; .01) is supported. Moreover, hypothesis H6 (β=-.05, p=.29) was not supported. RQ1 inquired about the WSMU, which influences employee psychological wellbeing and, thereby, innovative work performance. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">9</ref>, first, WSMU directly and positively impacts employee innovative work performance; thus, H1 is supported. Prior studies support the result (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ali-Hassan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Chu, 2020)</ref>. Second, WSMU directly and positively influences employee psychological wellbeing; thus, H2 is supported. Prior studies support the result to some extent <ref type="bibr">(Bodhi et al., 2021c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Chu, 2020)</ref>. Third, employee psychological wellbeing directly and positively influences employee innovative work performance; thus, H3 is supported. The result is supported by prior studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Obrenovic et al., 2020)</ref>. Fourth, employee psychological wellbeing positively and significantly mediates the relationship between WSMU and innovative work performance. Thus, H4 is supported. Hence, our results revealed that WSMU is positively associated with innovative work performance.</p><p>Subsequently, it is also positively related to psychological wellbeing. Moreover, psychological wellbeing was positively associated with innovative job performance. Furthermore, the indirect effect of WSMU on innovative job performance is positive and significant. wellbeing is significant. Thus, H5 is supported. Moreover, the moderating of with FoMO between psychological wellbeing and innovative job performance is insignificant. Thus, H6 is not supported.</p><p>The interaction plot shows that low social media levels were associated with increased psychological wellbeing for individuals with low FoMO. Moreover, high levels of WSMU were associated with increased psychological wellbeing for individuals with high FoMO and low levels of FoMO. A 43% variance in data is explained for innovative job performance and 50% for psychological wellbeing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Implications</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Implications for research</head><p>This study constructed and examined a moderated mediation model to identify the shielding and hazard factors of innovative job performance. Thus, the present study has an essential contribution to the existing body of knowledge.</p><p>The present study offers four contributions that can advance the research on work-related social media use (WSMU). First, our study extends prior work on social media use and its impact on employee performance and wellbeing. However, most of the prior studies did not mention or define the type of social media use.</p><p>Second, previous studies have predominantly focused on FoMO as an antecedent of social media use. Moreover, previous research on FoMO has mainly investigated mediating influence (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Beyens et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Buglass et al., 2017)</ref> in general settings. This study explored the role of FoMO by empirically exploring how FoMO moderates in associations between WSMU, PW and IP. However, most of the earlier studies related to social media and FoMO have been conducted in a non-working environment.</p><p>Third, based on the concluding remark, this study examines the mediating effect of psychological wellbeing among employees in the association between WSMU and work performance. Due to this, the current study adds to the scant literature on the mediating effect of PW among employees in the association between WSMU and IP.</p><p>Finally, this study contributes to theory by providing significant empirical support for selfdetermination theory in the Indian context. This paper deepens our understanding regarding the association between WSMU, employee performance and wellbeing. Furthermore, the study findings advance the current knowledge on FoMO and provide a more detailed understanding of FoMO in an organisational setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Implication for practice</head><p>This study provides four essential insights into practice. First, according to this study, WSMU can contribute to employees' psychological wellbeing and work performance. Thus, managers and policy makers may encourage employees as to WSMU as it can improve employee performance.</p><p>Second, organisations may pay attention to improving the psychological well-being of employees by using WSMU. Moreover, results show that employees' psychological wellbeing positively affects work performance, which suggests that organisations should invest more in improving employee psychological wellbeing. Furthermore, managers can catalyse WSMU as it helps in (a) shared work plan, work-related information with peers (b) arranging meetings with colleagues about work projects and (c) sharing documents and file within the organisation.</p><p>Additionally, knowledge sharing on different social media platforms enhances competitiveness among employees and stakeholders. However, the exchange of knowledge is a complicated process that requires organisations to manage routine activities that support collaboration and interaction <ref type="bibr">(Papa et al., 2021a)</ref>. Additionally, WSMU and networking may boost and discover new sources for innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Papa et al., 2021b)</ref>. Thus, managers should promote employee social media use for work purposes, such as discuss and solve work-related issues, promoting collaboration with co-workers and socialisation opportunities that help in enhancing performance and creativity.</p><p>Third, FoMO emerges as a critical distrusting factor that may harm employee wellbeing.</p><p>Managers and policy makers may develop a strategy to reduce FoMO at the workplace. The earlier study suggests that, when individuals' psychological wellbeing is in the decline stage, they might experience FoMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Przybylski et al., 2013)</ref>. Thus, organisations should develop responsive prevention and intervention programmes that could help create a positive environment and enhance the psychological wellbeing of employees. Moreover, it may be beneficial for the prevention of FoMO among employees. Last, managers should build a favourable fraternity ethos, advocate values of sharing, and pay attention to the role of informal communication on social media platforms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusions, Limitations and Future Research Directions</head><p>We sought to seek clearer insight of the role of WSMU and its underlying factor (i.e., psychological wellbeing) and, thereby, associations with employee-related outcomes and innovative work performance. In addition, given the importance of FoMO, we have studied the role of FoMO as a boundary condition in our proposed model, which has received little attention in the context of organisational environment. We found that WSMU plays an essential role in enhancing the creative performance via wellbeing of employees. Furthermore, based on the results, FoMO is recognised as a negative factor that harms employees' psychological wellbeing (moderation analysis). Our study suggested that organisations can effectively use social media to manage their workforce through real-time communication, work-related meetings, and sharing documents in a professional setting.</p><p>Despite the essential contributions of the present study, the generalisability of findings is constrained due to few limitations. However, the present study contributes by empirically validating the theoretical association between WSMU and related key aspects. First, this study is based on self-reported data and cross-sectional study; thus, social desirability bias may be affected the validity of the findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bodhi et al., 2021b)</ref>. Future studies can build upon this by using a longitudinal panel design. Second, the study's conclusions are drawn based on the respondents' perceptions, and the relationships are measured in terms of present attitudes and behaviour. However, with the continuous changing of various technologies, the responses of individuals are likely to change. Third, data were collected from a single country or geographical location. Fourth, the result of this study is presently limited to the insights gained from a limited sample or based on the availability of different social media platforms. Thus, future studies should focus on the research based on a range of social media platforms used by employees or organisations. Last, future studies should focus on other factors such as cyberloafing <ref type="bibr">(Tandon et al., 2021c)</ref>, cyberbullying, and the role of fake news related to organisations and employees spread through social media platforms, and further how it can impact employee-related outcomes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>missing out refers as a pervasive apprehension that one might miss valuable career opportunities when away or disconnected from work and the people's tendency to worry, they might be missing positive social experiences." being is defined as "meaning and purpose in life, supportive and rewarding relationships, contributing to the well-being of others</figDesc></figure>
