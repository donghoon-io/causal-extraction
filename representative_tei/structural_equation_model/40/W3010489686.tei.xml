<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cloud computing presents an opportunity for organizations to leverage affordable, scalable, and agile technologies. However, even with the demonstrated value of cloud computing, organizations have been hesitant to adopt such technologies. Based on a multi-theoretical research model, this paper provides an empirical study targeted to better understand the adoption of cloud services. An online survey addressing the factors derived from literature for three specific popular cloud application types (cloud storage, cloud mail and cloud office) was undertaken. The research model was analyzed by using variance-based structural equation modelling. Results show that the factors of compatibility, relative advantage, security &amp; trust, as well as, a lower level of complexity lead to a more positive attitude towards cloud adoption. Complexity, compatibility, image and security &amp; trust have direct and indirect effects on relative advantage. These factors further explain a large part of the attitude towards cloud adoption but not of its usage.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Cloud computing is a beneficial way of delivering information technology (IT) services to individuals and organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Even though cloud computing offers ways to improve their IT performance, the attitude towards cloud computing is influenced by significant concerns toward this innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</p><p>Being an important area for IT innovation and business investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the adoption of cloud computing has received increasing attention in both practice and research <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Although recent studies have provided information on the current state of the adoption of cloud computing, there is still a need to study both the attitude towards adoption and the actual usage of certain cloud application types across organizations of different sizes, industries and locations. Therefore, this paper develops an explorative multi-theoretical model to examine important factors affecting cloud adoption among organizations.</p><p>The goal of this paper is to verify a multi-theoretical research model recombined by factors originating from Davis' Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation (DoI). While the factors are theoretically based, this paper examines their practical relevance within the context of cloud computing. The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 frames the background and motivates the necessity to derive factors relevant for the intended purpose. In Section 3, the research model is presented, included factors are described and the proposed hypotheses are deduced. Section 4 summarizes the operationalization of the influencing factors. Section 5 provides the empirical results using variance-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Finally, conclusions and future work are provided in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review: background and factor exploration in the context of cloud computing</head><p>As research on the diffusion of innovations dates back to the 1940s <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, various explorations of the drivers for innovation adoption are found in the literature. Of primary interest for this research are empirical studies based on widely accepted theories that are related to the topic of cloud computing. Furthermore, it is important to distinguish between the adoption of innovations by individuals and adoption within organizations, as the adoption processes may be quite different <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Several sources of recent topic-related literature show empirical evidence indicating that certain factors influence the adoption decision regarding cloud services <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>To form a rigorous understanding of innovation, it is necessary to consider several factors of innovation simultaneously and to evaluate their relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. For example, Holland and Light identified several critical success factors from a larger list of potential factors found in relevant research <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. The innovation factors that have the most consistently significant relationships with innovation adoption are compatibility, relative advantage and complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. These three factors originate from Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) theory, which suggested that diffusion is "the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, whereas an innovation is "an idea, practice or object that is perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Compatibility, relative advantage and complexity are perceived attributes of innovations that help to explain the adoption of innovative technologies and therefore are considered to be relevant in the context of this research. In addition to the factors stated by Rogers' DoI, Moore and Benbasat considered image an important factor within their development of an instrument to measure the perceptions of adopting an information technology innovation. Some authors include image within the factor of relative advantage (e.g. 9). This has been criticised, as the effect of image is rather different from the effect of relative advantage. Therefore, image should be specified as independent factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>.</p><p>To examine the adoption of complex, new and interactive technology, it is beneficial to take factors from more than one theoretical model into account in order to appropriately express the multi-faceted nature of such an adoption phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. For this purpose, Davis' Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is also included in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. Davis suggested TAM to explore reasons for users to accept or reject information technology and to explain the impact of design features of a system on user acceptance. Specifically, causal relations between external stimulus, cognitive response, affective response and behavioural response are investigated. The factors perceived usefulness and perceived ease-of-use determine the cognitive responses to system design features. However, even with the similarity of perceived usefulness to relative advantage of perceived ease-of-use to complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, these factors have been included as they are of particular interest in the context of cloud computing research. Davis' TAM primarily aims at influences on the behaviour of individuals whereas this research focuses on the organizational perspective. However, Benamati and Rajkumar stated that many IT decisions, such as that of outsourcing, are made by single individuals at the executive levels of an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. Thus the application of TAM, which is designed to elicit responses of an individual, is appropriate to evaluate acceptance of certain organization-wide technology decisions. However, TAM and its modified versions are criticized for failing to address certain issues such as security &amp; trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, an examination of the adoption of innovations should focus on both the attitude towards adoption and actual usage as the dependent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Davis' TAM also suggests distinguishing between those two variables. In a recent study on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) adoption, based on the theory of planned behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, Benlian, Hess, and Buxmann found that the attitude toward the behaviour to adopt influences the actual SaaS adoption as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Based on these considerations, existing literature on influencing factors of technological innovations were compared and categorized into the factors compatibility (CPT), relative advantage (REL), complexity (CPX), image (IMG) and security &amp; trust (SEC) which are widely accepted and verified in IS research. Stieninger et al. provide a comprehensive examination of these factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. This overview includes mainly empirical surveys that analyse different factors based on well-established models and frameworks, as well as conceptual papers that aggregate these factors. All of the empirical surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> focus on only some of the aforementioned factors. Therefore, there is a lack of studies that consider these factors simultaneously and evaluate their relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research Model</head><p>In this section, we describe the research model developed to explore the adoption of cloud computing. The model consists of the factors derived from literature and hypotheses concerning relationships between these factors and towards the constructs of attitude towards cloud adoption and actual cloud usage. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (in next page) provides an overview of the research model. The following subsections define and briefly discuss the factors and hypotheses derived.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Attitude towards cloud adoption and actual cloud usage</head><p>Research studies on innovation characteristics should focus on both planned adoption and actual implementation as dependent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. As mentioned earlier, Davis' TAM suggests distinguishing between these two variables. Additionally, in a recent study on SaaS adoption, based on the theory of planned behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, Benlian, Hess, and Buxmann found that the attitude toward the adoption influences the actual SaaS adoption as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Therefore, we hypothesize:</p><p>H1. (+) The attitude towards cloud adoption (ATT) positively affects the actual usage of cloud computing (USG).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Compatibility</head><p>The factor of compatibility is derived from Rogers' DoI theory. "Compatibility is the degree to which an innovation is perceived as consistent with the existing values, past experiences and needs of potential adopters" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Tornatzky et al. define compatibility in a more operational way as "congruence with the existing practices of the adopters" <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In addition, there is a need to distinguish between technical compatibility and organizational compatibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. Consequently, the proposed hypotheses are based on the assumption that increased compatibility influences the adoption intention and the actual adoption of cloud computing in a positive way <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>. Additionally, we assume that when cloud computing is compatible with existing data structures and processes, it will be perceived to have a relative advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</p><p>H2a. (+) A higher level of compatibility (CPT) will positively affect the attitude towards cloud adoption (ATT).</p><p>H2b. (+) A higher level of compatibility (CPT) will positively affect the actual usage of cloud computing (USG).</p><p>H2c. (+) A higher level of compatibility (CPT) will positively affect the perceived relative advantage (REL).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Relative advantage</head><p>The factor of relative advantage also originates from Rogers' DoI theory. Relative advantage is defined as "the degree to which an innovation is perceived as being better than the idea it supersedes" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In the context of IS, the application of this theory revealed that relative advantage is one of the most important factors for adoption decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. Cloud computing solutions provide several relative advantages, including load relieving of the network infrastructure, reduction of hardware maintenance and infrastructure operation, flexibility, simple administration, collaboration opportunities, potential cost savings and increased automation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Consequently, the corresponding hypotheses are: H3a. (+) A higher level of perceived relative advantage (REL) will positively affect the attitude towards cloud adoption (ATT).</p><p>H3b. (+) A higher level of perceived relative advantage (REL) will positively affect the actual usage of cloud computing (USG).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Complexity</head><p>Complexity has been extensively studied in the IS literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Rogers defines complexity as "the degree to which an innovation is perceived as relatively difficult to understand and use" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The longer it takes to understand and to implement an innovation, the more likely it is that complexity turns into a barrier for adoption of a new technology. This is why complexity usually negatively affects adoption of technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>. However, a study among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) revealed that experts do not consider cloud computing as a very complex technology to implement due to simple administration tools, high usability, as well as a high degree of automation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In TAM, Davis describes complexity from a positive point of view and uses the term ease-of-use. He defines it as "the degree to which an individual believes that using a particular system would be free of physical and mental effort" <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. Even though there are general differences between Rogers' DoI theory and Davis' TAM (i.e., Rogers focuses on the organizational and Davis on the individual perspective, concerning complexity and ease-of-use), they are both discussing the perception of individuals. Several studies suggest that individuals will see greater relative advantage in innovations that are perceived as easy to use (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>). Hence, increased complexity probably inhibits the adoption of technological innovations. For that purpose, the factors are negatively correlated in the proposed hypotheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>H4a. (-) A higher level of complexity (CPX) will negatively affect the attitude towards cloud adoption (ATT).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H4b. (-) A higher level of complexity (CPX) will negatively affect the actual usage of cloud computing (USG).</head><p>H4c. (-) A higher level of complexity (CPX) will negatively affect the perceived relative advantage of cloud computing (REL).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Image</head><p>Moore and Benbasat define image as "the degree to which use of an innovation is perceived to enhance one's image or status in one's social system" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. Existing research suggests that image can be seen as the reputation of the service provider <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, the reputation of the company adopting the solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>, and the innovativeness of the solution itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. In the context of cloud computing, the factor image is of high importance, because attitudes towards the adopted technology might also be transferred to the company and thereby influence its image <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Previous studies also found that the influence of image is partially mediated by relative advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Therefore, we hypothesize: H5a. (+) A better image (IMG) will positively affect the attitude towards cloud adoption (ATT).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H5b. (+) A better image (IMG) will positively affect the actual usage of cloud computing (USG).</head><p>H5c. (+) A better image (IMG) will positively affect the perceived relative advantage of cloud computing (REL).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Security &amp; trust</head><p>As a literature overview by Gefen et al. found, there is a multitude of differing approaches for the conceptualization of trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref>. For the scope of this paper, the factor is considered as the ability of the involved actors to convey the perception of trustfulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Trust is characterized as a critical quality of service (QoS) parameter to be considered for service requests within the context of cloud computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref>. This factor is especially crucial regarding scenarios involving public cloud <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref>. Following Wu, perceived security and safety were applied as an element of trust and thus security and trust were combined to a single factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Issues in security &amp; trust are also likely to affect the image of cloud computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>. Accordingly, the following hypotheses are proposed: H6a. (+) A higher level of security and trust (SEC) will positively affect the attitude towards cloud adoption (ATT).</p><p>H6b. (+) A higher level of security and trust (SEC) will positively affect the actual usage of cloud computing (USG).</p><p>H6c. (+) A higher level of security and trust (SEC) will positively affect the perceived image of cloud computing (IMG).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Operationalization of the research model</head><p>In this section, we describe how the factors of the previous section were operationalized and measured. Based on existing literature for each of them, a number of relevant measurement items were identified. Additionally, every item was described by a statement that has been used in the survey (see section 5.1). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows these factors, items, statements and the literature reference it was derived from. Three popular cloud computing applications in the business context <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref>, namely (i) cloud storage, (ii) cloud e-mail and (iii) cloud office were chosen to clarify the term cloud computing itself. Example statements in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> refer to cloud storage only. Additionally, participants were also asked to respond to questions concerning cloud-based e-mail and cloud office applications. For example, item CPT1 was surveyed using the following three statements: "Data can easily be exchanged between the existing IT services/applications and the cloud storage", "Data can easily be exchanged between the existing IT services/applications and cloud office applications", and "Existing e-mail data can easily be transferred to the cloud service provider". [16]</p><p>Compatibility (CPT2) Process integrability Cloud storage solutions can easily be integrated into the existing process landscape.</p><p>[16]</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Empirical Results</head><p>This section discusses the instrument for data collection and provides a profile of the sample. Furthermore, the results of the data analysis, which was done by structural equation modelling (SEM), are presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Data collection and sample description</head><p>The measurement instrument was delivered online and subjects were recruited using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (www.mturk.com), an online labour market, in the light of cloud computing also referred to as Humans-as-a-Service (HaaS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref>. While subjects are paid for their responses, sample errors (e.g., coverage error) and risks (e.g., dishonest responses) are low or moderate compared to traditional recruiting methods for laboratory, traditional web study and web studies through purpose built websites <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref>. It was also reported that subjects appear to be truthful when providing selfreport information because of their intrinsic motivations and the incentive structure of Mechanical Turk. Submissions can be rejected by the requesters and subjects can be screened, for example on the basis of past approval rates, or the number of tasks completed <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref>. Furthermore, the efficacy of using Mechanical Turk for behavioural research has been explored in the domains of political science <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>, linguistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref>, psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref>, economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref> and information systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref>. As task seekers in online labour market may utilize cloud computing services to complete technical tasks, and as such markets include participants with a wide variety of demographic statistics, the sample used in this study exhibits traits of strong generalizability.</p><p>The survey was available for participation from April 11th to May 18th, 2014. As the survey was executed in English language, the participants were asked to indicate their level of English proficiency in order to avoid misunderstandings due to language deficiencies. Furthermore, a requirement for participation in the survey was a positive employment status to ensure that the participants were in the position to judge a statement from the organizational perspective.</p><p>At the beginning of the survey, the participants were asked to provide some demographic data such as age, sex, and nationality. Then they were asked to indicate their familiarity with certain types of cloud computing applications (e.g., cloud storage, cloud e-mail and cloud office). Depending on the answers to these questions, the participants were subsequently asked to rate a set of statements on the particular cloud computing application types with which they had indicated to be familiar with. For that purpose, a 5-point Likert scale has been applied ranging from "I strongly agree"</p><p>to "I strongly disagree" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>). The attitude towards the particular type of cloud computing application was queried through the semantic differential approach and the use of three bipolar dimensions (negative-positive, harmfulbeneficial, and unimportant-important), likewise on a 5-point Likert scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">48]</ref> (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>We included several mechanisms to assess the seriousness of the responses:</p><p> The survey was only available to workers who demonstrated consistent accuracy. Specifically, the survey was only available to subjects with an approval rate of at least 97% and who previously completed at least 500 approved tasks.  The participants were not told about the initial requirements to be included in the sample. Instead, a short survey with the possibility to take part in an extended survey was launched. The resulting sample only includes participants with a professional English proficiency level and an employment status either "employed" or "self-employed" (i.e., participants with limited English skills, as well as unemployed people, students, or pensioners were excluded).</p><p> To prevent repeated submissions by an individual participant, the unique identifiers assigned to each user by Amazon's Mechanical Turk ("Worker ID") was verified to be unique prior to the data analysis.  The participants were asked to reflect on the accurateness of their responses in a final question ("What describes best what you have just done?"), remarking that their answer would not have any influence on the reward. Only respondents answering with "I focused on each question and answered them to the best knowledge and belief" were included in the sample.  Only completed surveys were included. As additional indicator of the accuracy of the task, a 10-digit code titled "response id" was displayed within the text at the last page. Respondents were required to provide this code to the Mechanical Turk system. Only responses with a valid code were included in the sample.  The overall time needed to fill out the survey was also monitored, as response time may serve as additional indicator of the seriousness of the answers <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref>. Instead of removing the fastest responses, a minimum of two minutes for answering the questions on each cloud application type was used as reference time for inclusion in the sample.</p><p>Overall, the final sample includes responses from 203 individuals, with more men (63%) than women (37%) participating. 60% of the participants were younger than 35 years. The geographical distribution shows that the majority of them were located in North America (41.87%), Asia (33.50%) and Europe (18.72%). Participation in other continents (Africa, Australia, South America) was lower (combined 5.91%). Since each participant filled out one set of questions for each cloud application type (e.g., cloud storage, cloud e-mail, cloud office) he/she had indicated to be familiar with, the dataset includes 518 complete responses (182 for cloud e-mail, 174 for cloud storage and 162 for cloud office). Regardless of how many application types they filled out due to the familiarity, each participant received 2 USD for the completion of the full survey via their Amazon Mechanical Turk account. Consequently, the sample can be considered heterogeneous. While participation in online labour markets, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk are popular in Asia, this study was able to generate a sample with a good mix in respect to sex, age and location.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Evaluation of the research model</head><p>Due to the complexity of the relationships between the factors, structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to evaluate the research model <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>. This statistical multivariate technique combines factor analysis and regressions. It enables the examination of relationships among measured variables and latent variables. Latent variables are abstract, complex and not directly measurable. In the context of this study, the factors of the theoretical research model are latent variables (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>There are two forms of structural equation modelling (SEM): variance-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM). For this study, we applied PLS-SEM (Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling) as (i) it has no requirements as to the normality of the latent values in the population, (ii) it is used in exploratory research for predictive applications, and (iii) it is designed to explain variance in dependent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">51]</ref>.</p><p>During the analysis, five indicators (CPX1, CPX3, REL4, SEC4 and USG2) were eliminated as they did not meet the required criteria. Thus, henceforth, the eliminated indicators are no longer mentioned within this paper. As all items are manifestations of the latent variables, the investigated model is considered reflective.</p><p>To evaluate the model using PLS-SEM a two-step approach was conducted, consisting of (i) the evaluation of the measurement model followed by (ii) the evaluation of the structural model <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Measurement model evaluation</head><p>Evaluating the measurement model involved four steps including an examination of (i) t-values of item loadings, (ii) internal consistency reliability, (iii) convergent validity, and (iv) discriminant validity.</p><p>T-values of loadings. The bootstrap draws a large number of sub-samples from the original data with replacements to approximate the sampling distribution and derive the standard error and standard deviation of the estimated coefficients to calculate their t-values. For the tested model, all items can be considered reliable and valid, as the tvalues of the loadings of each of them are greater than 25.</p><p>Internal consistency reliability. The internal consistency reliability is checked by examining Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability (CR). As a general rule for exploratory research, Cronbach's alpha should be greater than 0.65 and CR should be greater than 0.70. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows that these conditions are met. Cronbach's Alpha of the factor image is just slightly above 0.65, but all other factors show high values. Note that we had to eliminate items because of reliability issues and therefore we ended up with a single item measurement for complexity and usage. Composite reliability values are also high for all factors. Consequently, the internal consistency reliability can be considered to be high. Convergent Validity. The convergent validity check is done by measuring the magnitude of outer loadings and the average variance extracted (AVE). They measure whether the items share a large proportion of variance. The magnitude of outer loadings measures the reliability of indicators. The bold values in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> represent these loadings, which are all above 0.70 and therefore support indicator reliability. Average variance extracted (AVE) is a measure that describes how much the variation in the items is explained by the latent variable. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows that AVE of all items is above 0.50. Therefore, latent variables explain a high part of the variance of their items. Since both measures are above the recommended limits, the convergent validity can be considered to be high.</p><p>Discriminant validity. The discriminant validity describes whether each latent variable is distinctly different from the others. This can be measured using (i) the item cross-loadings and (ii) the Fornell-Larcker criterion.</p><p>The item cross-loadings are used to examine if each indicator (or item) loads highest on the latent variable to which it is assigned. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows that all items only load very strongly (&gt;0.75) on its own latent variable and loadings on other variables are much smaller. Therefore, the discriminant validity is confirmed. The Fornell-Larcker criterion is a more conservative measure of discriminant validity. It compares the square root (SQRT) of AVE with latent variable correlations. When the square root of the AVEs is greater, this indicates that the particular variable shares a greater variance with its indicators than with the other variables. Consequently, the square root (SQRT) of each AVE should be greater than the correlation with any other variable. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows this is the case for all factors (SQRTs of AVEs are bold). Since all these measures are above the recommended values, the measurement model evaluation can be considered satisfactory. We therefore proceed to evaluate the relationships in the structural model in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Structural model evaluation</head><p>The evaluation of the structural model reveals the relationships between its latent variables. For that purpose, (i) the path t-values, (ii) the path coefficients between latent variables, (iii) amount of variance in the dependent variables, and (iv) the effect sizes were evaluated.</p><p>Path t-values. First, the hypotheses have to be tested. This is done by evaluating the path t-values which are provided by the bootstrap routine. These values indicate the significance levels of each path and thereby the strength of support for the proposed hypotheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> provides an overview of the proposed hypotheses, the corresponding t-values and levels of significance and reveals that not all hypotheses are supported.

The remaining hypotheses (H2b, H3b, H4b, H5a, H5b and H6b) do not show any significant support.  Amount of variance in the dependent variables. The coefficient of determination, or R Square (R²), is a measure of the model's predictive ability. It represents the combined effects of the independent variables on a dependent variable by the amount of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by all the independent variables connected to it. It ranges from 0 to 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions and future work</head><p>In this paper, relevant factors influencing the intention to adopt and the actual usage of cloud services were discussed.</p><p>The focus was on public cloud services in the organizational context. Based on widely accepted theories such as Rogers' DoI theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Davis' TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, and its various extensions, the paper identifies factors that impact the adoption and usage of cloud computing, integrates them in a theoretical research model, and operationalizes the factors. The research model is tested in an empirical online survey using Amazon Mechanical Turk for the acquisition of participants. In doing so, a sample with a fairly good mix in respect to sex, age and location was generated.</p><p>The analysis of the structural equation model followed a two-step approach. In a first step, the measurement model was evaluated. Since Internal Consistency Reliability (using Cronbach's Alpha and Composite Reliability), Convergent Validity (using magnitude of outer loadings and Average Variance Extracted) as well as Discriminant Validity (using item cross-loadings and Fornell-Larcker criterion) could be confirmed, the measurement model evaluation was considered satisfactory. Consequently, the structural model evaluation revealed that the attitude towards cloud adoption (ATT) positively affects the actual usage of cloud computing (USG). All other hypotheses regarding the direct influence of certain factors on the actual usage of cloud services were rejected. However, the effect of the attitude towards cloud adoption (ATT) on the actual cloud usage (USG) is also low. Therefore, there are other factors, which were not considered in our model, that affect the actual cloud usage. A better image (IMG) seems to neither positively affect the attitude towards cloud adoption (ATT) nor the actual cloud usage (USG). All other factors influence the attitude towards cloud adoption (ATT). A higher level of compatibility (CPT), relative advantage (REL) and security &amp; trust (SEC) as well as a lower level of complexity (CPX) lead to a more positive attitude towards cloud adoption (ATT).</p><p>Limitations of this study include the data collection and sample composition using Mechanical Turk. In an experiment, using data collected from a large Midwestern U.S. university, an Internet board and Mechanical Turk, Paolacci and Chandler found that the response error was significantly lower in Mechanical Turk than in the Internet board <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Although it was noted to be more diverse than usual college samples, respondents using Internet technology are not a representative sample either <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref>, leading to the suggestions that research should be transparent in the recruiting and excluding of participants. As stated, this study included several mechanisms to assess the validity of the results based on several technical possibilities in combination with a self-assessment of the cloud workers. While efforts were undertaken to ensure that subjects had experience using cloud computing, their degree of knowledge concerning cloud computing may be quite varied. In addition, due to the diverse applications of cloud computing, the application types cloud storage, cloud e-mail, and cloud office were queried separately. While these are commonly used, individuals may actively use other cloud computing applications not included, such as cloud based customer relationship management or enterprise resource planning systems. However, inquiring each item for up to three cloud computing application types, entailed a multiplication of questions to be answered by the participants. For that reason, the number of items was kept low to avoid loss of data quality due to participants increasing frustration through a cavalcade of questions. This again led to ending up with only one item left for complexity (CPX) and actual usage of cloud computing (USG) after the evaluation of the research model. Concerning this matter, other possible approaches could be either to focus on fewer factors, or to ask questions on cloud services in general and not on multiple specific cloud application types.</p><p>Furthermore, the results show that the model's predictive ability on actual cloud usage (USG) is low. Consequently, there seem to be other factors that influence USG. While many factors that explain the motivations and barriers toward broad organizational adoption of cloud computing services are explored in this research, some additional factors may have inadvertently been omitted. This may be due to the scope of the reviewed studies, as some focus on cloud computing in a general context while others focus on very specific cloud services. In future research we intend to identify additional factors and conduct further empirical studies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

The analysis shows that R² of attitude towards cloud adoption has a value of 0.456, which means 45.6% of the variance of this dependent variable is explained by the independent variables compatibility, complexity, relative advantage, image and security &amp; trust. This is a high value that indicates that the above-named factors influence a large proportion of the users' attitude towards cloud adoption. Conversely, R² of the factor actual cloud usage has a value of 0.06, which is very low. This implies that only 6% of the variance is explained by all the other variables of the model. Therefore, actual cloud usage is mainly influenced by factors that are not included in the theoretical research model. This is already indicated by Table5and Figure2, which illustrate that the path t-values of four factors show no significant support on actual cloud usage. Furthermore, the R² values of relative advantage and image are also high. Security &amp; trust accounts for 31.7% of the variance of image. 49.4% of the variance in relative advantage is explained by compatibility, complexity, image, and security &amp; trust. Consequently, the predictive ability of the model regarding these factors is satisfying.Effect Sizes. Cohen's f² is a quantitative measure of the strength of a phenomenon that assess how much every independent variable affects a particular dependent variable's R². According to<ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref>, for multiple regressions these effects can be considered weak (0.02 -0.15), moderate (0.15 -0.35) or high (&gt;0.35). Table7shows that relative advantage is moderately affected by capability, complexity and image. Furthermore, image has a strong effect on security &amp; trust. Attitude towards cloud adoption is moderately affected by relative advantage and weakly influenced by security. Effects on actual cloud usage are all below the limit of 0.02.</figDesc><table /></figure>
