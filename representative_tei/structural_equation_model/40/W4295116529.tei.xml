<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Physics achievement at the secondary school is not encouraging, and physics teachers are not keen to implement creativity-based learning. This affects students' involvement in physics learning, plus, the affective aspects of students not given attention because it is considered not to influence students' examination grades. The main purpose of this research was to analyses the contribution of creativity domain physics, general creativity and affective factors towards students' physics achievement by using structural equation modeling analysis. The research employed a survey design with a data collection method using tests and questionnaires among 400 form four students in the public secondary school in Johor. The data were analysed using Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) and Analysis of Moments Structures (AMOS) version 21. The structural equation modeling results showed that scientific creativity and divergent thinking directly affect physics achievement. In contrast, general creativity and affective factors affect indirectly. The findings also showed that the strongest relationships were between physics divergent thinking and scientific creativity, scientific creativity and physics achievement and between intrinsic motivation and attitude towards physics. The study's implication suggests that vigorous effort needs to be focused on developing physics divergent thinking and scientific creativity, as these factors are the most influential and directly related to physics achievement. It is equally important that the affective factors, namely students' self-efficacy and students' attitudes towards physics, are emphasized. These factors significantly affect students' physics divergent thinking, which would eventually lead to better physics achievement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>One of the challenges in secondary school education is providing high-quality students with excellent academic achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. The achievement of Malaysian form four students in physics is not encouraging because several physics topics are considered difficult by students, such as Introduction to physics and Force and Motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Conventional learning, such as teachers providing step-by-step problem-solving methods, is no longer effective in conceptual understanding and physics problem-solving skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Nevertheless, in reality, physics students still practice conventional learning, contributing to the decline in physics achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Creativity is in the top three most demand skills needed to endure the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) since it is a cognitive skill that is more important than complex information processing, understanding, advanced literacy and writing skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Creativity is a necessary skill in future careers. Fostering creative thinking is an initiative to change ineffective teaching and learning (T&amp;L) practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p><p>Physics is the most suitable medium for cultivating creative thinking skills and many researchers have agreed that creativity can influence physics achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. However, thinking creatively is not cultured by most physics teachers while students do not have the opportunity to generate diverse and unique ideas in the classroom <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Sawyer supported this statement, stating that the creative thinking culture is not welcome in the school and is more pronounced in Asian countries, including Malaysia <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. One of the reasons, creativity is not welcome and teachers are not confident in the effectiveness of such creative activities in helping students improve achievement grades <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Many creativity studies have been conducted, and most studies involve only one type of creativity in one study. Through the reading of past studies, there have been research of constructing models or theoretical frameworks that apply general creativity only and do not integrate with scientific creativity even though the field of study is in science <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Thus, there is a need to study more than two types of creativity in a research. This gives an idea to simultaneously test different type of creativity such as general creativity and creativity domain physics to identify its contribution to students' physics achievement.</p><p>There is a need to collectively and holistically integrate creativity with affective characteristics to determine its influence on physics achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This is because a lack of specific theory or model looks at the holistic interaction between general creativity and creativity in physics, with affective characteristics such as attitudes towards physics, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation towards student physics achievement at the secondary school level. The model constructed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Son (2009)</ref> was not studied in the context of physics education <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. While Bloom's taxonomy (1956) and Amabile's Specific Domain Creativity Theory (1983) have combined cognitive and affective components but need to be reconceived as needed based on issues and problems that arise <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</p><p>Based on the gaps that have been identified, it can be concluded that a model contains information on the interaction between factors that contribute to the physics achievement that involves integration between more than one concept of creativity and affective need to be studied. Thus, a study was conducted to examine the contribution of these cognitive and affective factors simultaneously and holistically to see its influence on the physics achievement of form four public secondary school students in Malaysia by using the Structural Equation Model (SEM-AMOS) application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Objectives</head><p>The main purpose of this study was to verify the structural equation hypothetical model to adequately fit the research data and analyses the contribution and strength of relationships between variables in the model. The predictor factors studied for their contribution to physics achievement are general creativity of drawing products (TCT-DP), scientific creativity in physics (SCP), divergent thinking in physics (DTP), and affective factors, namely attitude towards physics (ATP), self-efficacy (SE) and intrinsic motivation (IM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Review</head><p>The decline in physics achievement has attracted the interest of many researchers to examine the factors that influence student achievement. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Napitupulu et al. (2018)</ref>, cognitive factors are a key focus that needs to be developed if teachers want physics students to excel in their learning and achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Nevertheless, to develop cognitive aspects, studies are stating that affective factors are the aspects that play the most important role as these factors influence the internal aspects of students that motivate students to perform mental functions such as thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Thus, this research focused on aspects of scientific creativity, divergent thinking in physics and general creativity to represent cognitive factors and attitudes towards physics, intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy to represent affective factors to study their contribution to physics achievement. These factors were analysed simultaneously using structural equation model analysis of moment structures (SEM-AMOS) statistical software.</p><p>There are a lot of studies have been conducted and many theories have been confirmed empirically to prove that the freedom of students to think creatively can affect student achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. However, most creativity studies involve only one approach of creativity. For example, Theurer, Berner &amp; Lipowsky (2016) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Roke &amp; Kalis (2015)</ref> used Test of Creative Thinking-Drawing Product (TCT-DP) while Siti Rafiah (2008) and Fauziah, Coll &amp; Suriani (2014) used Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) to study the effect of general creativity towards academic achievement <ref type="bibr">[21, 10, 22, and 23]</ref>.</p><p>However, due to development in the study of creativity, researchers expanded the focus from general creativity to creativity domain specific, also known as scientific creativity. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Liang (2002)</ref> and Raj Saxena (2016) did research related to scientific creativity in the domain of science while Park (2012), <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rabari (2011)</ref> and Razip (2014) focused their research in scientific creativity in the domain of physics <ref type="bibr">[9, 12, 24, 25, and 26]</ref>. These studies of creativity with various approaches, whether general creativity or scientific creativity, have raised questions about what type of creativity approaches influence student achievement according to specific fields such as physics. This is because the approaches and concepts of general creativity and scientific creativity are different, so their influence on an achievement should also be different.</p><p>A meta-analysis study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chang et al. (2017)</ref> concluded that studies to build models using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis involving creativity and academic achievement have been widely available <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Still, most models do not integrate cognitive with affective aspects collectively and holistically. The role of affective aspects is important to encourage students to think creatively and learning actively <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The reality now is that physics students are less motivated and show weak and declining attitudes and self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</p><p>According to LaForce, Noble and Blackwell (2017), affective aspects such as motivation, selfefficacy and attitude are essential for continuously aim good academic achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. These affective traits can influence students' acceptance to continue their effort in mastering complex scientific knowledge. The findings of the influence of different affective traits raise a question of how interactions occur between intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, attitudes toward creativity and physics achievement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual Framework</head><p>This research intends to test the relationship among constructs that are modelled into a conceptual framework. A conceptual framework was constructed from two existing theories and one model that have been widely used namely Theory Creativity Domain Specific <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Amabile, 1983</ref>), Bloom's Taxonomy Learning <ref type="bibr">Domain (1956)</ref> and Model of Scientific Creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Son 2009)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. The cause-and-effect relationship between the two variables was also constructed based on some models and findings from previous studies <ref type="bibr">[8, 12, 16, 31, 32, 33, 34,</ref>].</p><p>Bloom's Taxonomy explained that meaningful learning involves cognitive abilities accompanied by affective and psychomotor domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. While the Scientific Creativity Model that analyse by Son (2009) using SEM-AMOS and built based on Amabile's Model of Creativity Domain-Specific <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Amabile, 1983</ref>) contains cognitive factors (general creativity and creativity domain-specific) and affective factors (intrinsic motivation and attitude) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Another affective factor, self-efficacy, was chosen because a systematic review of several structural models by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Bandura (1993)</ref> has shown the importance of self-efficacy towards academic achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. This adds value to the hypothetical model to be tested. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the conceptual framework that has been restructured based on the theories and models discussed above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig 1: Conceptual framework</head><p>The conceptual framework has been divided into three parts, cognitive factors, affective factors and result. For cognitive factors, there are three concepts of creativity selected to be studied; general creativity of drawing products (TCT-DP), DTP and SCP. Three subconstructs represent DTP: fluency, flexibility, and originality <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. For affective factors, there are SE, IM and ATP. There are two indicators used to measure IM, namely enjoyment and value <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>, while five indicators are used to measure ATP, namely interest in physics, physics career, learning physics, inquiry activities and practical physics and physics teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. In this hypothetical model there were existence of mediator role. The arrangement of these mediators is based on theories, models and previous findings. Amabile's Model of Creativity Domain-Specific and Scientific Creativity Model by Son stated that affective factors such as intrinsic motivation and attitude can play a direct or indirect role, which requires the mediator to affect cognitive function <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Scientific Creativity Model by Son also gives the idea that general creativity and scientific creativity can influence achievement indirectly. However, the role of mediator is not a main focus in this research and is not discussed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>This study is a descriptive quantitative study that uses a survey research design. The population consists of 10,680 form four students (16 years old) in the public secondary school in Johor, Malaysia. Based on the population, a total of 400 students were selected as the research sample using three combinations of sampling techniques, proportionate stratified random sampling (determination of districts in Johor), simple random sampling procedure (school selection) and cluster sampling procedure (class selection).</p><p>Briefly, the school is divided into four zones in the state of Johor, namely the southern zone (5267 students, 49.32%), the northern zone (2360 students, 22.10%), the western zone (2250 students, 21.06%) and the eastern zone (803 people. students, 7.52%). The percentage of students in each zone was identified to ensure that the number of samples in each zone was selected balanced according to the percentage rate. The detail number of samples discussed in the Profile of Respondent (Result).</p><p>The number of samples is determined based on the suggestions made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hair et al. (2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kline (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yuan et al. (2010)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. All students in the selected class completed all the instruments given to them. Form four students were selected because physics was first studied by form four students at the school level. In addition, topics that are found to be difficult to learn are from the form four syllabus. Therefore, this population is targeted because the factors that influence physics achievement should be identified from the early stage of physics learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Instruments</head><p>There are seven instruments used, namely Physics Achievement Test (PAT), Test of Creative Thinking Drawing Product (TCT-DP), Divergent Thinking in Physics Test (DTPT), Scientific Creativity in Physics Test (SCPT), Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SEQ), Intrinsic Motivation Questionnaire (IMQ) and Attitudes Towards Physics Questionnaire (ATPQ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physics Achievement Test (PAT)</head><p>PAT consists of two parts. Part A containing 30 objective questions covering the topic of Introduction to Physics and Force and Motion. Part B is a written practical test related to the topic of Inertia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test of Creative Thinking-Drawing Product (TCT-DP)</head><p>TCT-DP was designed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Urban and Jellen (1996)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. TCT-DP is an effective drawing-based instrument for measuring creative ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. The TCT-DP is measured through scores obtained from fourteen criteria. The criteria in TCT-DP represent the competence to generate exceptional figures with a single theme or give meaning to the result of the creative drawing as a whole <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Divergent Thinking in Physics Test (DTPT)</head><p>DTPT is an open-ended test adapted from Hu and Adey (2002), <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mohamed (2006)</ref>, Razip (2014) and Alrubaie &amp; Daniel (2014) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. There are two questions in the DTPT. First, students are asked to list as many scientific observations as possible based on the given pictures in the first question. The observations requested are related to the causes and effects of bicycle and car accidents. In the second question, students are asked to list as many solutions as possible to the observations that have been made in the first question. Scores are based on three characteristics of divergent thinking that are fluency, flexibility and originality. Fluency is the number of scientific answers/ideas successfully identified by respondents. Flexibility is an approach to see the variety of categories of answers given by respondents. Originality is measured based on the generation of new ideas that have not been proposed or designed by other respondents <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific Creativity in Physics Test (SCPT)</head><p>In the SCPT, only have one item that requires students to design a product for the solution proposed in the DTPT. Scientific creativity scores are given based on a scoring rubric that has been constructed using the Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT) introduced by Amabile (1996) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SEQ)</head><p>SEQ was adapted from the Physics Self-Efficacy Scale (PSES) constructed by Tezer and Asiksoy (2015) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. After undergoing confirmatory factor analysis (EFA), the SEQ was represented by five items with a seven-point Likert scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intrinsic Motivation Questionnaire (IMQ)</head><p>The IMQ was adapted from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMQ) constructed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">McAuley et al. (1989)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. After undergoing an EFA, the IMQ contained two subconstructs with a total of 10 items. The subconstructs included enjoyment (5 items) and values (5 items) with a sevenpoint Likert scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attitudes towards Physics Questionnaire (ATPQ)</head><p>ATPQ was adapted from the Attitude Towards Physics questionnaire by Ovute et al. <ref type="bibr">(2015)</ref>, which was initially adapted from the Test of Science Related Attitude (TOSRA) by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Fraser (1981)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. After undergoing an EFA, the ATPQ contains five subconstructs totalling 23 items namely interest in physics (3 items), physics career (5 items), physics learning (5 items), inquiry activities and practical physics (5 items) and physics teacher (5 items).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>All data collected through seven research instruments have been saved in SPSS software before being analysed using SEM-AMOS version 21. SEM-AMOS has the advantage of testing relationships between complex and dynamic variables simultaneously that other statistical analysis software cannot do <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. For data analysis, the researcher refers to two modelling steps that have been proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Chua (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kline (2011)</ref>, i) testing the measurement model for validity and reliability and ii) testing the structural model to test the hypotheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>i) Validity and Reliability of Measurement Model</head><p>Three criteria must be met before analysing the structural model: unidimensionality, validity, and reliability. Pooled CFA is implemented to achieve these three criteria. The items with a loading factor, λ &lt;0.5, are eliminated from the construct to achieve the reliability and validity indexes. Next, the measurement model is evaluated statistically using fitness indexes to ensure that the model fits adequately with the research data. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows the indicators for obtaining unidimensionality, validity and reliability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1: Indicator of unidimensionality, validity dan reliability</head><p>In this study, there are three categories of fitness indexes, i) absolute fit, ii) incremental fit and iii) parsimonious fit. Absolute fit consists of Root Mean Square of Error Approximation (RMSEA) and Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) while incremental fit consists of Adjusted Goodness of Fit (AGFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and Normed Fit Index (NFI). Parsimonious fit consists of Chi Square/ Degree of Freedom (Chi-Square/ df). GFI, CFI, TLI, NFI value should be equal to or greater than 0.90 indicates a good fit while a good fit value for Chi-Square/df is less than 0.3. RMSEA value below 0.10 indicates a good fit and below 0.05 is deemed a very good fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. One index that achieves the level of acceptance for each category is sufficient to allow for the next step to test the hypotheses from the structural model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model</head><p>After a pooled CFA process, a structural model was formed and analysed to eliminate items and obtain high validity and reliability. There are four path coefficients observed in the dynamic analysis between the variables studied. The coefficients are standard estimates or standard regression weights (β), standard error (S.E), critical ratio (C.R) and significant value (p). The necessary coefficients taken into account for accepting or rejecting the hypothesis are β and p.</p><p>The contribution value of β can be interpreted into three levels of contribution, i) small contribution for value β smaller than 0.10, ii) moderate contribution level for value β 0.10 to 0.50 and iii) high contribution level for value β greater than 0.50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Small (β &lt;0.10) and negative contribution levels were considered not practically significant predictors of physics achievement. Thus, β smaller than 0.10 and negative will not be accepted, thus rejecting the hypothesis even if the p-value is significant. The value of p is considered significant when p is smaller than 0.05. In other words, the significant values for hypothesis testing were p &lt;0.05 and β &gt; 0.10.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The distribution of respondents consists of 31 students from Kota Tinggi district, 103 from Johor Bahru, 90 from Pasir Gudang, 84 from Batu Pahat, 31 from Tangkak and 61 from Muar. Female respondents were 246 compared to 154 male respondents. Respondents representing the Malays are the highest with 234, followed by 102 Chinese, 55 Indians and 9 students from other race. The profiles of the respondents are summarized in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pooled CFA: Validity and Reliability of Measurement Model</head><p>There are seven constructs studied, two formative constructs (using test scores) and five reflective constructs (using scale measurement with indicators and have items). Only reflective constructs (SE, IM ATP, DTP, and SCP) were involved for the pooled CFA analysis while formative constructs (PA and TCT-DP) were not involved. Formative constructs were not analysed along with reflective constructs in the pooled CFA analysis because formative constructs were measured through scores with no indicators and items to be eliminated to obtain a good fit index <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> shows the pooled CFA analysis and Table <ref type="table">3</ref> shows the pooled CFA results.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 4: Fitness indexes of pooled CFA analysis</head><p>From the result in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> and Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, it can be concluded that there is a significant fit for the studied variables in the model and allows the next step to be done. The next step is analysing the structural equation model to identify the contribution of general creativity, divergent thinking in physics, scientific creativity in physics, intrinsic motivation, attitude towards physics, and self-efficacy to physics achievement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model Analysis</head><p>The structural equation model involves the analysis of cause-and-effect relationships of all seven variables. Analysis of the structural model was performed until each relationship was statistically (p &lt;0.05) and practically (β &gt;0.10) significant. In the first time analysis, seven paths were eliminated because the value of β was negative or β &lt;0.10 and p&gt; 0.05. The analysis results of the first structural model and the seven rejected paths are shown in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>.</p><p>After eliminating seven paths, a second-time analysis was performed, and the results showed two paths were eliminated because β was negative or β &lt;0.10 and p value&gt; 0.05. The analysis results of the second structural model and the two rejected paths are shown in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 5: Results of structural model analysis for the first time Table 6: Results of the second time structural model analysis</head><p>After eliminating seven paths on the first analysis and two paths on the second analysis, the structural model was analysed for a third time. The structural model results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. The analysis results show the nine paths tested in the final structural model are significant and practical. The final analysis showed that nine hypotheses were accepted (H3, H4, H8, H10, H11, H13, H17, H18, H19) while nine were rejected (H2, H5, H6, H7, H9, H12, H14, H15, H16). The hypotheses results and the coefficients for all significant paths in the final structural equation model are shown in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>.  <ref type="table">8</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 9. The strength of each relationship based on the standard regression weights, β</head><p>The DTPSCP contributes the strongest path in the model structural followed by SCPPA, IMSTF and SEIM. The most minor contributing relationships in this final model are the ATPDTP, followed by the SEDTP, SEATP, TCT-DPDTP and DTPA. The contribution strengths of DTPSCP, SCPPA and IMATP were in the high category while SEIM, DTPPA, TCT-DPDTP, SEATP, SEDTP and ATPDTP were in the moderate category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The results showed that there were nine significant relationships while the other nine relationships were insignificant. Significant relationships indicate that it is important and should be given attention to students to be nurtured <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The contribution of scientific creativity towards physics achievement</head><p>Three cognitive variables are predictors of physics achievement namely TCT-DP, DTP and SCP. The results of the analysis showed that the general creativity or TCT-PDPA relationship was statistically significant (p &lt;0.05) but not practically significant (β &lt;0.1). In contrast to the other two concepts of creativity, the analysis results showed that creativity domain physics, DTPPA and SCPPA relationship had a positive and statistically and practically significant effect. This study also provides an understanding that specific creativity in the domain of physics (DTP, SCP) plays an important role in influencing the achievement of physics compared to general creativity such as TCT-DP.</p><p>The strength of the relationship between DTPSCP and SCPA is also high. These findings provide meaningful information for believing that creativity domain physics make a valuable contribution to PA rather than general creativity. The role of scientific creativity in influencing academic achievement has been extensively studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Still, the findings obtained in this study are different from previous studies because the results of this study can distinguish the concept of creativity domain physics that directly influences PA from the concept of general creativity, which has no direct effect on the PA.</p><p>The differences in the findings are due to the context of DTP and SCP measurement were different from TCT-DP. DTP and SCP involve the same element as the physics achievement which is physics knowledge. Physics knowledge involved in the creativity domain physics such as DTP and SCP assists in problem-solving while answering physics questions. In this study, DTPT asked students to provide explanations using correct and accurate language by relating various concepts, principles and related theories of physics as a result of scientific observations and explanations. While SCPT is the ability to improve the quality of scientific products that encourages divergent and convergent thinking with the correct physics concept. It can be concluded that the DTP and SCP involves mastery of high physics knowledge and requires higher-order thinking skill. This mastery helps in solving PAT problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref> TCT-DP is not practical in improving physics achievement due to its small contribution strength (B &lt;0.1). The findings of this study are in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Urban (2004)</ref> stating that TCT-DP is not significantly related to academic achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Nevertheless, in other studies it has been shown that the general creativity of TCT-DP influences academic achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Various conflict findings of previous studies can be explained through the findings of the structural model analysis in this study. It was found that TCT-DP still influences physics achievement but not directly with the presence of mediator variables. The intended mediators that can be identified in the structural model are DTP and SCP. In other words, general creativity can still contribute to physics achievement but must involve both DTP and SCP.</p><p>The study of these direct and indirect relationships is important to ensure that the creativity cultivated in the classroom is appropriate to positively and effectively impact physics achievement. Based on the findings, it can be concluded that students' physics achievement can be improved by encouraging creative learning with divergent thinking and scientific creativity in physics. Not general creativity that has no implementation of scientific knowledge and skills in physics. In other words, physics achievement can be enhanced by cultivating student-centred activities that involve students generate many, varied, unique ideas and designing scientific products as an alternative to physics learning approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The contribution of affective factors to physics achievement</head><p>Many previous researchers have cited affective factors as important factors in influencing cognitive development and academic achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>. However, the findings indicate that the three affective factors studied have no direct effect towards physics achievement. The relationships of EKPF, STFPF and MIPF were eliminated from the structural model because the relationship was found not significant statistically and practically or were negatively effect to physics achievement. However, these affective factors still influence other variables such as ATPDTP dan SEDTP. This suggests that affective traits still exist but indirectly to physics achievement through DTP as a mediator.</p><p>The contradiction of these findings may be due to differences in study methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. SEM-AMOS analysis contains complex relationships between many variables. This may be why two theoretically positively related variables become negative when combined in one analysis in a structural model. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Son (2009)</ref>, the relationship between two variables being insignificant, low correlated or negatively related in a structural model can be due to several factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. One of them is a more dominant relationship influencing endogenous variables or the existence of mediator variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Another reason may be that the variables and indicators studied do not use accurate and appropriate measurements. For example, intrinsic motivation indicators i.e. enjoyment and value may be less accurate for measuring their effect on PA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Reiss (2009)</ref> studied intrinsic motivation indicators that differ from enjoyment and value: fear of failure, curiosity, ambition, being organized, responsibility, and competition. Reiss stated that intrinsic motivation with such indicators can help students who are less excellent in academic achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><p>According to Gungor, Eryılmaz and Fakioglu (2007), the appropriate motivation for physics achievement is achievement motivation, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Guido (2013)</ref> argues that the appropriate motivation to be studied together with physics achievement is extrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>. This provides a guide for selecting constructs and indicators is also very important in the analysis of structural equation models to obtain the significant practical effect.</p><p>Although the direct relationship of SE, IM and ATP with PA was respectively eliminated in the model, this does not mean that these three factors did not play an important role in contributing PA. Based on the structural model analysis, SE, IM and ATP still influence PA as stated in previous studies or models, however, in this study, the influence occurs indirectly on PA. These affective factors require cognitive factors such as DTP to contribute to PA. The indirect relationship of affective factors that interact dynamically with these cognitive factors is in line with most previous researchers who stated that affective factors need to be developed along with cognitive factors in influencing physics achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Fit</head><p>The structural modeling analysis carried out in this study has validated the theories and models constructed by previous studies and also there is added value contributed. In Bloom's Taxonomy of learning (1956) only exhibits a general illustration of the relationship between affective factors and cognitive factors without specific information how the factors may affect the students' achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. This study also validates the contribution not only three different creativity approaches but also three important affective factors towards physics achievement.</p><p>This added some values to the existing theory and model as Model of Scientific Creativity by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Son (2009)</ref> only involves scientific creativity, TCT-DP, intrinsic motivation and attitude in the field of science without self-efficacy while Amabile's (1983) theory involves only general creativity, scientific creativity and intrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. The result of this structural model analysis can provide more comprehensive information to improve T&amp;L physics practice among teacher and student in school.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Academic excellence, creativity, whether general or domain-specific, and positive affective development are important aspects to produce knowledgeable, creative, innovative, and high moral. Physics learning practices in the classroom need to be changed by allowing students to use their cognitive skills to the maximum. One way is to encourage students to think creatively and that creativity should be domain-specific creativity such as scientific creativity in physics. This follows the analysis of the structural equation model showing SCP and DTP give high contribution to PA. However, other predictive factors such as general creativity and affective factors also cannot be ignored. Although the relationship is indirect to PA, all of these factors contribute through a holistically practical and significant relationship in the structural model. This model can benefit teachers, students and schools to increase the determination to cultivate creativity and help students in terms of emotions and attitudes. The implication is that the factors in this model can be used as guidelines on things that need to be emphasized in students related to domain-specific creativity and affective factors. Teacher can focus the T&amp;L activities with creativity domain physics embedded because the skills found in this type of creativity can train future generations with creative and innovative skills and at the same time help in mastering physics concepts as well. Ongoing research is needed, and researchers hope that the findings of this study can benefit other researchers who are interested in conducting new research or continuing the existing structural model related to the physics achievement.</p><p>Further studies can be carried out using creativity instruments that measure other aspects or using more complex approaches such as creating creative products physically since the creativity measured in this study only uses pen and paper tests due to time constraints. In addition, SEM-AMOS analysis can analyze the effect of moderators, then further studies can examine the appropriate moderators to be studied and subsequently form a more comprehensive model to compare with the model in this study.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2 shows a hypothetical model of the contribution of cognitive factors and affective factors towards physics achievement.
