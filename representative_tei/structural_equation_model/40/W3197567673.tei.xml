<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper examines the variables influencing a consumer's satisfaction and continuous use of a multi-channel retailer's mobile application. Drawing upon the Expectation Confirmation Model for Information Technologies, post-adoption literature, and consumer behaviour literature, we assess pertinent factors on the continuous usage of multi-channel retailers' mobile apps. Through a sample of 1,009 consumers who retained a retailer's mobile app for more than six months and conducting Structural Equation Modelling, the findings illustrate that utilitarian variables (Perceived Usefulness, Ease of Use and Personalisation), hedonic variables (Perceived Enjoyment) and a brand-related variable (consumer loyalty intention toward the retailer's brand), play a significant role in influencing continuous usage of multi-channel retailers' mobile apps. In contrast to e-commerce research, the study outlines that escapism plays a negative role in both consumer satisfaction and intention to continue to use a multichannel retailer's mobile app. Previous research points to the fact that consumers' retention of retailers' apps is low. This paper contributes to the emerging literature on consumers' continuous use of retailers' mobile apps through enhancing our understanding of technology and non-technology related variables.</p></div>

As smartphone users are set to reach 4.3 billion worldwide in 2023 <ref type="bibr">(Newzoo, 2019)</ref>, the prevalence of retailers' branded apps is likely to continue to grow. In addition, the introduction of 5G technology and the resultant improvements in data transfer speeds will enable retailers to utilise a range of advanced technologies (e.g. Augmented reality) within their mobile apps without adverse effects on consumers' data allowances or loading speeds <ref type="bibr">(Ericsson, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the proliferation of retailers' mobile apps recent industry reports assert that, after the initial adoption of branded mobile apps, many consumers do not continue to use and retain them. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">CleverTap's (2019)</ref> e-commerce research, 42 percent of new app users uninstall an app after only one month and 96 percent become inactive on an app after three months. Previous literature also highlighted the low retention rates of mobile branded apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bhandari et al., 2015)</ref>. As such, there is a need for more research into what influences a consumer's continued use of a retailer's branded app <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fang, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Stocchi et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Previous research undertaken by <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">McLean et al.

(2020)</ref> surmised that factors that are not specifically related to the technological characteristics of the mobile app (e.g. loyalty toward the brand, attitude toward the brand, brand recognition,) can play a role in understanding consumers' continued use behaviour. Therefore, this paper aims to contribute to the mobile app literature by not only examining the technological characteristics of a retailer's app but the role of cognitive psychology and brand-related factors (e.g. escapism and loyalty intention toward the retailer) in influencing a consumer's intention to use a retailer's app.</p><p>The growth in the use of apps can clearly provide retailers, that are attempting to pivot to a multi-channel service offering (i.e. in-store, website, and mobile app), with increased opportunities to acquire new customers whilst retaining and building relationships with</p><p>Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications existing customers.

In turn, we review the IT acceptance, post-adoption, cognitive psychology, and consumer behaviour literature to assess potential utilitarian and hedonic factors that are related to the performance characteristics of the technology in influencing consumers' satisfaction with a multi-channel retailer's app and the resultant continuous intention to use the app. As such, this study involving data from 1,009 consumers of four large multi-channel UK retailers, uniquely considers the technological, cognitive psychology, and brand-related variables that influence the continuous use of a retailer's mobile application.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Retail Mobile Apps and Multi-Channel Retailing</head><p>The smartphone can be viewed as a device that enables consumers to communicate and accomplish multiple daily tasks and activities on the go <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Shankar et al., 2016)</ref>. The conceptualisation of the term mobile "app" relates to software downloaded from Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store onto a mobile device (e.g. smartphone, or tablet) <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Purcell et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Garg and Telang, 2013)</ref>. Featuring on a smartphone screen, apps can be seen to appear in the form of a tappable designed icon that carries the brand's identity (e.g. the brand's logo) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bellman et al., 2011)</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr">Newman et al. (2018, p.214</ref>) define a retailer's app as "a mobile application on a smartphone/tablet that is used for purchase or completion of some transaction [e.g. price checking, subscription renewal, product locator] that may result in a purchase". Unlike websites, app developers can take advantage of the distinguishing technological capabilities inherent in smartphone devices to perform specific tasks <ref type="bibr">(Purcell et</ref> Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications <ref type="bibr">al., 2010)</ref>. Accordingly, branded apps can increase a consumer's awareness, interest, and increase loyalty towards the brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Shankar et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bellman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Shankar et al., 2016)</ref>. In addition, retailers' apps may combine a range of categories to provide an enhanced interactive user experience and enable consumers to complete a variety of tasks on the go, such as planning and/or making a purchase, finding directions to the nearest physical store, viewing the latest deals and offerings from the brand, or reading product reviews that may help in the facilitation of a future purchase <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bellman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Wang et al., 2015)</ref>. Notably, consumers are often willing to download apps from brands that are familiar to them, and brands are keen to encourage consumers to engage with their mobile apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bellman et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In a multi-channel retail environment, mobile apps play a facilitating role to other operating channels (e.g. physical store, website), retailers need to successfully synchronise a satisfactory customer experience that reflects harmony among all operating channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Verhoef et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Blázquez, 2014)</ref>. In other words, multi-channel retailers need to offer equal state-of-the-art customer experience in all operating channels as consumers meander between channels. For example, consumers can browse and explore ideas relating to products they are interested in from the mobile app and then examine products in the physical store before deciding to make a purchase. More so, consumers may purchase products from the app and choose to collect the item in-store (i.e. click and collect). Additionally, consumers may use the mobile app in the physical store to check prices and/or make a purchase through the app and have the retailer deliver the product to a selected delivery address. Regardless of how the customer decides to shop from any of the retail channels, retailers need to maintain an equally pleasant customer experience in all operating channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Verhoef et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Blázquez, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Recent research is developing our understanding of mobile apps and consumer behaviour beyond just offering an overview on the technical aspects (e.g. ease of use, usefulness, and/or enjoyment) that are associated with the technology in motivating consumers to continue to use mobile apps (see: <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Newman et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">McLean et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fang, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Stocchi et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Newman et al. (2018)</ref> examined the app's ease of use and the role of the consumer's self-connection (i.e. self-concept) in motivating the consumer to recommend the retail app, purchase from the retail app, and purchase in-store. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">McLean et al. (2020)</ref> while investigating technical functional aspects (e.g. usefulness, ease of use, customisation) and the hedonic aspect of enjoyment in the continuous usage context of retail apps, they also examined the role of the consumer's attitude toward the app in influencing the consumer's attitude and loyalty toward the brand. In a related study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Stocchi et al. (2020)</ref> Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications investigated consumers' past experiences and its role in influencing consumers' continuous intention to use branded apps through two decision-making paths (i.e. the app recognition path, and the evaluation of utilitarian and hedonic benefits path). More so, Fang, (2019) investigated the role of the branded app value-in-use in influencing brand competence, brand warmth, the consumer's brand loyalty, and the continuous intention to use the app, while examining factors related to the affordances of mobile apps. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baek and Yoo (2018)</ref> investigated the influence of branded app continuance usage intention on consumers' brand loyalty, while accounting for branded app usability and branded app referral intention.</p><p>Furthermore, research has outlined that brand elements in the offline environment can play a role in our decision-making towards the online environment (see: <ref type="bibr">Kwon and Lennon, 2009a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kwon and Lennon, 2009b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Marianne et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Savila et al., 2019)</ref>. For example, what the consumer thinks and feels about a brand in the offline environment is transferred to the online environment <ref type="bibr">(Kwon and Lennon, 2009a)</ref>. Accordingly, consumers utilise their perceptions about a brand as a reference in their decision making to adopt that brand's online store <ref type="bibr">(Kwon and Lennon, 2009b)</ref>. In turn, the loyalty toward a physical store in the offline environment influences a consumer's loyalty to repurchase from the retailer's website <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Savila et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>A non-exhaustive overview of pertainant research from 2016-2020 on the continued use of retailers' mobile apps is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. &lt;Table 1. Overview of research on the continued use of retail mobile apps &gt; Recent literature outlines the value of looking beyond just the utilitarian and hedonic features of mobile apps through incorporating cognitive psychology factors and factors that are related to the brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(McLean et al, 2020)</ref>. To our knowledge and based on reviewing the mobile app literature and the presented research in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, an important relationship is not accounted for in past and recent research, which involves the role of satisfaction and its interplay with loyalty toward the retailer, and continuous intention to use the app. In addition, building upon the works of <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">McLean et al (2020)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Stocchi et al (2020), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fang (2019)</ref> we further investigate the utilitarian and hedonic factors that are related to the technical aspects of the app, and accounting for usage and purchase frequency. The following section provides a theoretical background for our conceptual development.</p><p>Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Framework</head><p>This study draws on the Expectation Confirmation Model for Information Technologies (ECM-IT). There are several reasons for utilising the ECM-IT in this study. The ECM-IT which was developed by <ref type="bibr">Bhattacherjee (2001b)</ref>, is one of the first theoretical models that is tailored to understanding the consumer's continuous usage of a technological system. The theoretical development of the ECM-IT brought two research disciplines together, as its theoretical foundation draws upon <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Oliver's (1980)</ref> Expectation Confirmation Theory (ECT), from the consumer behaviour research domain, while utilising significant work from Information Systems (IS) research, drawing on the work of <ref type="bibr">Davis et al.'s (1989)</ref> Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). ECT is a cognitive psychology theory that explains post-adoption satisfaction as a function of a consumer's expectations, their perceived performance, and disconfirmation of beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Oliver, 1980)</ref>. On the other hand, based on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975)</ref> the TAM is an information systems theory that explains how consumers come to accept and use technology based on the core factors of the perceived usefulness and the perceived ease of use of the technological system influencing consumers' attitudes and behavioural intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Davis et al., 1989)</ref>. Accordingly, <ref type="bibr">Bhattacherjee's (2001b)</ref> ECM-IT provides a combined knowledge from consumer behaviour and IS research, which provides a theoretical framework to enhance our understanding of retailers' mobile applications from both a consumer behaviour and information systems perspective.</p><p>Previous research has demonstrated that satisfaction strongly predicts the continuous usage of technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Hong et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Thong et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Kim, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Yuan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bhattacherjee, 2001b)</ref>. Studies drawing on the ECM-IT theory introduced additional drivers suggesting that perceptions individuals hold about a technological system may influence continuous intention directly, and/or indirectly through satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Kim, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Hsu and Lin, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hong et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Thong et al., 2006)</ref>. The ECM-IT aims to understand continuous usage by accounting for post-acceptance factors (confirmation and satisfaction) and the postconsumption aspect of continuous use in the form of ex-post expectations (e.g. perceived usefulness) <ref type="bibr">(Bhattacherjee, 2001b)</ref>. The ECM-IT theorises that the consumer's continuous intention to use a technology system is determined by the user's satisfaction (an affect reflected in a favourable, neither, or non-favourable feeling) when using the system <ref type="bibr">(Bhattacherjee, 2001b)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Bhattacherjee (2001b)</ref> asserts that satisfaction with using a system is influenced by post expectations (e.g. Perceived Usefulness), and confirmation. Importantly, <ref type="bibr">Bhattacherjee (2001b)</ref> asserts that the post expectations are mediated by satisfaction towards continuous Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications usage intention, while also having a direct influence on continuous usage intention, suggesting that consumers may continue to use a technological system because of the productive benefits it provides, even if they are not necessarily satisfied <ref type="bibr">(Bhattacherjee, 2001a)</ref>. Moreover, <ref type="bibr">Bhattacherjee (2001b)</ref> incorporated only the perceived usefulness variable from <ref type="bibr">Davis et al.'s (1989)</ref> Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), while excluding perceived ease of use from the model, by arguing that, in a continuous usage context, the effect of ease of use will reduce over time because it would make sense that a user would become more experienced with the system. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hausman and Siekpe (2009)</ref> also excluded ease of use when investigating the motivating factors influencing consumers' purchase and revisit intention in online shopping, because the subjects of the study were experienced at using the Internet. However, it is worth noting that some studies show support for the role of perceived ease of use towards continuous usage to use a technology system <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Thong et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hong et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Hong et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Venkatesh et al., 2003b)</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, the theoretical model presented in this research draws upon the ECM-IT, with some modifications to fit the context of this research. The post expectations from the ECM-IT in this study are viewed as perceived performance dimensions that capture the satisfaction with the app experience of consumers who continue to use and retain a retailer's mobile app. <ref type="bibr">Yüksel and Rimmington (1998, p.63</ref>) refer to perceived performance as "The subjective evaluation made by the consumer after a service encounter." <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Yüksel and Rimmington (1998)</ref> state that some academics have argued that expectation and experience of using a service may interrelate in a biased way. The authors suggest that perceived performance is as good at predicting customer satisfaction as is the complete expectancy confirmation-disconfirmation paradigm. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Halstead et al. (1994)</ref> argue that, when researching the continuous usage of services, performance becomes a priority to determine satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Halstead et al. (1994)</ref> further argue that it may be wrong to assume that confirming or disconfirming consumers' expectations impacts the satisfaction with a service, as based on Adaptation-Level (AL) theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Helson, 1959</ref>) a consumer's cognitive processing of expectations is "less active" when they are familiar with using the service. Accordingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hossain and Quaddus (2012)</ref> explain that Roger's (1995) Innovation of Diffusion Theory (IDT) views confirmation as a phase rather than a measurement in the decision-making process for technology adoption. Therefore, in this study, the motivating factors are driven by perceptions arising from consumers' continued usage experience (e.g. current consumers that are familiar with the service) of retail apps, and</p><p>Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications its influence on satisfaction and continuous intention to determine the behaviour (e.g. usage and purchase frequency).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived Usefulness</head><p>The role of perceived usefulness in predicting technology acceptance and usage is wellgrounded in IS research <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Davis et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bhattacherjee, 2001b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Rogers, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Taylor and Todd, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Davis and Venkatesh, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hong et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>. Perceived usefulness is defined as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance" <ref type="bibr">(Davis, 1989, p.320)</ref>. Accordingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Taylor and Todd (1995)</ref> explain that perceived usefulness is a consistent predictor of technology usage.</p><p>The ECM-IT asserts that perceived usefulness has a direct positive influence on consumers' continuous intention to use information technologies <ref type="bibr">(Bhattacherjee, 2001b)</ref>. Recent studies that examine consumers' continuous usage of branded mobile apps continue to reaffirm the importance of perceived usefulness in playing a direct significant role in motivating consumers to continue to use them (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chung et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kim et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Li and Fang, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Natarajan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Jeon et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Tseng and Lee, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Stocchi et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Yuan et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Bhattacherjee's (2001b)</ref> ECM-IT, perceived usefulness also has an indirect positive influence on consumers' continuous intention to use information systems through the consumer's satisfaction with the information system in question <ref type="bibr">(Bhattacherjee, 2001b)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Li and Fang (2019)</ref> confirm that consumers' satisfaction with the branded app mediates the relationship between perceived usefulness and consumers' continuous intention to use the branded app. In addition, perceived usefulness increases consumers attitude toward using mobile retail apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(McLean et al., 2020)</ref>, influences consumers' satisfaction with mobile banking apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Yuan et al., 2016)</ref>, and can lead to consumers' satisfaction when interacting with Self-Service-Technologies (SST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Meuter et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>In this regard, we hypothesise the following: H1a Perceived usefulness positively influences the continuous usage intention of a retailer's mobile app.</p><p>Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications H1b Satisfaction with the app's user experience mediates the relationship between perceived usefulness and continuous intention to use a retailer's mobile app.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived Ease of Use</head><p>One of the challenges that marketers must overcome when delivering services through mobile apps is making the technology easy to use <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Mishra et al., 2021)</ref>. The perceived ease of use is defined as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort" <ref type="bibr">(Davis, 1989, p.320)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Winer (2009)</ref> encourages marketers to innovate pull-based communications with consumers. <ref type="bibr">Shankar et al. (2016, p.41)</ref> assert that "apps need to be sticky to induce shoppers to continue using them and should be continuously updated and redesigned to remain the state-of-the-art." Building on this notion, retailers may update their branded apps to add new features to accommodate new services and offerings or make improvements to complement the app's ease of use and operation. Interestingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Yuan et al. (2016)</ref> explain that, due to the smartphone's small form factors, firms must creatively implement easy-to-use features in the app's interface due to the smartphone's small screen size.</p><p>However, the ECM-IT excludes the perceived ease of use, arguing that when users become more experienced with using a technology system, the effect of the perceived ease of use diminishes <ref type="bibr">(Bhattacherjee, 2001b)</ref>. In turn, subsequent studies have excluded ease of use in their theoretical models in an attempt to examine newer more pertinent variables that could advance our understanding (see: <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kim et al., 2016)</ref>. Despite this, caution should be noted over the exclusion of the perceived ease of use as several studies find that it plays a significant role in the continued use context of IS studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hong et al.,2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Thong et al., 2006)</ref> and the continued usage of branded mobile apps (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chung et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Natarajan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">McLean et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Newman et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Stocchi et al., 2018)</ref>.

A positive significant association is found between perceived ease of use and consumers' satisfaction in the continued use context of mobile shopping apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chung et al., 2016)</ref>.

The term personalisation of a mobile service can be defined as the ability of the service to adapt to and fit the consumer's needs and tastes to provide a tailored customer experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Jorstad et al., 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Persaud and Azhar (2012)</ref> assert that pull-based services and content delivered via a smartphone "must be personalised"; therefore, offering consumers a personalised experience is important for eservices in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Rowley, 2006)</ref>.

Accordingly, the retail apps investigated in this study provide several practical goal-directed personalised features, such as remembering consumers' login credentials, providing a personal dashboard that includes payment and delivery address information along with past purchase history, saving items in the virtual cart, utilising the user's GPS location, and providing personalised push notifications based on user activity. However, notably <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Jung-Hwan et al. (2009)</ref> did not find personalisation to significantly predict satisfaction when investigating e-loyalty. Despite this, the ability to personalise content to individuals' needs is inherent to mobile applications; drawing upon this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Clarke (2008)</ref> suggests that personalisation is important in the context of m-commerce considering the smartphone's small form factor and screen size, and therefore delivering services that are Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications tailored to consumers is essential to m-commerce.

(2016)</ref> discovered that personalisation increases consumers' satisfaction with using mobile shopping apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chung et al., 2016)</ref>. Drawing on this we expect that personalisation will play a role in motivating consumers' continuous intention to use retailers' apps. In this regard, we hypothesise the following:</p><p>H3a.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODOLOGY</head><p>This study applied a cross-sectional online questionnaire design to collect data from consumers in the UK. This study focused on consumers from four traditional high-street (brick-andmortar) retailers in the UK; John Lewis, Next, Marks &amp; Spencer's and H&amp;M. We define traditional high-street retailers as those retailers who had a physical store before the introduction of any other service delivery channels such as a website or mobile app. Traditional high-street retailers now offer an interesting context of study due to their provision across multiple service delivery channels (i.e. in-store, website, and mobile app) and their need to introduce such additional service delivery channels beyond their physical store in recent years.</p><p>At the time of conducting the research, the retailers' apps in this study included features such as enabling consumers to browse and purchase products, locate the nearest store, click and collect (e.g. purchase from the app and collect the product from the nearest store), add items to virtual baskets and to plan future purchases through saving items to wish-lists, save a delivery address or add billing details, save payment information, read reviews on a product, share the experience of products with others, and use GPS location information.</p><p>All consumers participating in the online questionnaire must have retained the retailer's smartphone application from one of the selected traditional retailers for more than six months to be in an adequate position to rate their responses in a continuous usage context. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Legris et al. (2003)</ref>, while a student sample minimises the costs of conducting research, it is more beneficial to conduct studies in an actual commercial setting. Thus, all participants in this study are non-student consumers, as student samples could inflate the strength of hypothesised relationships and reduce the external validity of the research <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Burnett and Dune, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, since the data was collected via a self-reported online questionnaire, it was important to utilise data collection techniques that would enhance the validity of the data and reduce response bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Osborne and Blanchard, 2010)</ref>. A Random Response Scale (RRS) was integrated into the online questionnaire to ensure that respondents were reading the questions and not randomly choosing answers in a computerised environment (e.g. Internet-based survey) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Beach, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Meade and Craig, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Osborne and Blanchard, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Beach (1989, p.102)</ref> defines RRS in the following way: "Such a scale is made up of questions that all subjects who read and understand the question can only answer in one way." In addition, a time filter was also added to evaluate speedy respondents. Therefore, each step taken in the study contributed to a well-designed cross-sectional survey.</p><p>The data collection involved employing a market research agency to facilitate distributing the online questionnaire to participants. After performing the data collection, a total of 1447 responses were received. To ensure only valid responses were included in the analysis, a data cleansing procedure was performed, which included flagging the responses of those who did not meet the sample characteristics, those who failed to answer the RRS (e.g. Answer this question disagree), missing values, or the speedy respondents who did not meet the industry standard time filter for this research. After screening the data collected based on the criteria mentioned above, a total of 1009 valid responses were achieved.

It is worth noting that the CFA analysis began with conducting a Common Latent Factor (CLF) method to evaluate if the dataset suffered from any bias issues by following the procedure suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Podsakoff et al. (2003)</ref>. This procedure requires the variables to be constrained so that they are equal in the CFA measurement model using an unmeasured CLF, where each standardised regression path value from the constrained measurement model is compared with the corresponding standardised regression path value from the original CFA measurement model. The difference in standardised regression values from the CFA original measurement model and the constrained CFA measurement model showed no noticeable variation. In addition, the CLF value from the constrained measurement model was 0.564 which, once squared, gives a Common Method Variance (CMV) value of 0.3181. Therefore, the CLF assessment shows a CMV value of approximately 32% which is below a threshold of 50% (also see: <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Lowry et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">McLean and Osei-Frimpong, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The CFA result for the estimated measurement model demonstrated adequate Goodness Of Fit (GOF) values.

Furthermore, The Average Variance Extracted (AVE) was calculated to assess the convergent validity, where all the values exceeded the recommended value of .5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hair et al., 2010)</ref>, demonstrating adequate convergent validity for all constructs.</p><p>Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications Concerning discriminant validity, none of the correlations in the CFA between constructs exceeded the absolute value of .85, which is an acceptable indication for establishing discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Kline, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Weston and Gore, 2006)</ref>.

The VIF values ranged from 1.558, being the lowest, to 2.961 being the highest, which is below the threshold value of 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hair et al., 2013)</ref>. The discriminant validity was further evaluated by calculating the square root of the AVE for each construct, where it should exceed the interrelated correlation for each of the constructs in the hypothesised measurement model <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref>. As the square root value of the AVE exceeded the values of the inter-construct correlation in the measurement hypothesised model, it is concluded that discriminant validity was established.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Byrne's (2016)</ref> approach, a configural invariance, measurement, and structural invariance tests to compare screen size, preferred shopping method, and app type usage to further investigate the effect between satisfaction with app's user experience, continuous intention, app frequency of use, and app frequency of purchase were calculated. Only the screen size groups passed the validity test for the multi-group analysis. The configural invariance tests for the screen size groups showed that each group fit the measurement model well, as the results reveal that for the small screen size group the CMIN/DF = 3.222; RMSEA = .055; CFI = .958. For large screen size group, the results reveal that CMIN/DF = 2.039; RMSEA = .062; CFI = .958. The results were then compared to the previously presented default CFA measurement model which revealed that CMIN/DF = 3.630; RMSEA .051; CFI = .963. Since all measurement models showed good model fit, it was decided to conduct measurement and structural invariance assessments. For the structural and measurement weights invariance assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cheung and Rensvold's (2002)</ref> approach was utilised to determine the Delta for the CFI values. The unconstrained structural model CFI = .953 the measurement weight CFI = .953 and the structural weight CFI = .952.</p><p>Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications Accordingly, we could proceed with the multi-group analysis. Consumers with a small screensized smartphone value satisfaction with the app user experience in influencing the continuous intention to use the app more than consumers with large screen-sized phones. This relation reflects that satisfaction with the app user experience is more important in small screen-sized phones. Furthermore, consumers with a large screen-sized smartphone value satisfaction with the app user experience in reinforcing their loyalty toward the retail brand more than consumers with a small screen-sized smartphone. Additionally, the relationship between loyalty intention toward the retailer and consumers' continuous intention to use the app is slightly stronger for consumers with a large screen-sized smartphone. More so, the results reveal that consumers with a large screen-sized smartphone who hold the intention to continue to use the app use and purchase from the app more than consumers with small-sized smartphones.</p><p>Next, the mediation hypotheses relating to satisfaction with the app user experience and loyalty intention toward the retailer were performed through utilising the <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hayes (2013)</ref> approach. The value of bootstrap samples was set to 5000, and the bias-corrected confidence level value was set at 95%. The results indicate that the perceived usefulness has a significant effect on the continuous intention with a standardised regression weight of .163 and a p-value of &lt;.001, confirming hypothesis H1a. Additionally, perceived usefulness had a significant effect on satisfaction with a standardised regression weight of .289 and a p-value of &lt;.001. The results also show that satisfaction with the app's user experience partially mediates the relationship of perceived usefulness to continuous intention to use the app, with a standardised regression weight value of .157 and p-value of &lt;.001, confirming hypothesis H1b.</p><p>Perceived ease of use had no significant effect on continuous intention as the value of the standardised regression weight was -.002 with a p-value of &gt;.05. Therefore, hypothesis H2a was not supported. Furthermore, perceived ease of use influenced satisfaction positively with a standardised regression weight of .229 and a p-value &lt;.001. The results show that satisfaction with the app's user experience fully mediates the relationship between perceived ease of use and continuous intention to use the app, with a standardised regression weight of .124 and a pvalue of &lt;.001, confirming Hypothesis H2b. While H2a is not supported, this finding is in line with ECM-IT theory in that perceived the ease of use becomes less important when individuals continue to use technology, but can still influence satisfaction with the user experience as shown in our results, thus marketers should not discard the importance of the on-going perceived ease of use of the app.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications</head><p>The perceived personalisation also had no direct influence on the continuous intention to use the app, as the standardised regression was .034 and the p-value was &gt;.05. Therefore, hypothesis H3a was not supported. However, the perceived personalisation had a positive relationship with satisfaction with a standardised regression weight of .189 and a p-value of &lt;.001. More so, the results detail that the perceived personalisation is fully mediated by satisfaction with the app experience towards the continuous intention to use the app with a standardised regression weight of .102 and a p-value of &lt;.001, confirming hypothesis H3b.</p><p>Thus, satisfaction with the user experience plays a pivotal role in the continuous usage of the app. Without the mediating role of satisfaction with the user experience, we would find that perceived personalisation has no positive influence on the continuous use of a retailer's mobile application.</p><p>Moreover, concerning the hedonic factors, perceived enjoyment had a significant positive direct relationship with the continuous intention to use the app with a standardised regression weight of .164 and a p-value of &lt; .001, confirming H4a. Furthermore, perceived enjoyment had a significant positive effect on satisfaction with the app's user experience with a standardised regression weight of .318 and a p-value of &lt; .001. The results show that satisfaction with the app's experience partially mediates the relationship of perceived enjoyment towards the continuous intention to use the app, with a standardised regression weight of .172 and a p-value of &lt;.001, confirming hypothesis H4b. Thus, our results pertain that the hedonic element of enjoyment is an important variable that motivates the continued use and satisfaction with a retailer's mobile app. Interestingly, escapism has a significant negative effect on the continuous usage intention with a regression weight of -.101 and a pvalue of &lt;.01. Therefore, H5a was not supported. Furthermore, escapism had a significant negative effect on satisfaction with app user experience with a regression weight of -.080 and a p-value of &lt; .05. The results show that satisfaction with app user experience fully mediates the negative relationship of escapism to the continuous intention to use the app with a standardised regression weight of -.043 and a p-value of &lt;.05. Therefore, hypothesis H5b was not supported. This surprising result may be due to consumers feeling guilt for spending time becoming immersed and lost in a retailer's app when time could have been used for alternative purposes.</p><p>More so, the results indicate that satisfaction positively influences continuous intention with a standardised regression weight of .465 and a p-value of &lt;.001, confirming hypothesis H6a.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Satisfaction also had a significant positive effect on loyalty intention towards the retailer with</head><p>Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications a standardised regression weight of .547 and a p-value of &lt;.001. Furthermore, loyalty intention towards the retailer mediates the relationship between satisfaction with the app's user experience and the continuous intention to use the app, with a standardised regression weight of .076 and a p-value of &lt;.001, confirming Hypothesis H6b. Additionally, loyalty intention towards the retailer had a significant positive effect on the continuous intention to use the app with a standardised regression weight of .139 and a p-value of &lt; .001, confirming hypothesis H7.</p><p>Lastly, the continuous intention to use the app had a significant positive effect on the frequency of use with a standardised regression weight of .562 and a p-value of &lt; .001, confirming hypothesis H8a. Furthermore, continuous intention to use the app had a significant positive effect on purchase behaviour with a standardised regression weight of .545 and a p-value of &lt; .001, confirming hypothesis H8b. Additionally, we also find that use frequency and purchase frequency have a significant positive effect to and from the continuous intention to use the app which creates a positive feedback loop effect. In this regard, use frequency had a significant positive effect on continous intention to use the app with a standardised regression weight of .244 and a p-value of &lt; .001, and the purchase frequency had a standardised regression weight of .141 and a p-value of &lt; .001. Accordingly, the theoretical model explains 71% of the variance in users' satisfaction with the app experience, 63% in the continuous intention to use the app, 30% in loyalty intention towards the traditional retailer, 30% in usage behaviour, and 32% for purchase frequency.</p><p>The hypothesised relationships in this study were supported with exception of H2a (the perceived ease → continuous usage intention), H3a (personalisation → continuous usage intention), H5a (escapism → continuous usage intention), H5b (escapism → satisfaction with the user experience). The path regression results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">Table 4</ref>. The results of the indirect mediated relationships are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref>. An overview of all supported and non-supported hypothesis tested in this research is presented in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>. The following sections will discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of our research. Our findings show that the perceived usefulness of the app positively influences a customer's intention to continue using the app directly and indirectly through satisfaction with the app's user experience. Thus, from Bhattacherjee's (2001b) ECM-IT perspective, when consumers' perceived usefulness of the app is positive, this results in consumers valuing the app in terms of its ability to enhance productivity while shopping, in turn resulting in satisfaction and continuous use.</p><p>Furthermore, the perceived ease of use of the mobile application influences a consumer's intention to continue using the retailer's app indirectly through satisfaction with the app's user experience, while having no direct influence on continuous intention. Therefore, ease of use is found to play an important role in driving the continuous usage of retailers' apps only through satisfaction with the app's user experience. Some studies have conceptualised that, as consumers become more experienced with using a technology system, the ease of use becomes less important. However, within the ever-evolving digital environment, consumers may find that the ease of use of the app is important for a satisfactory experience as retail apps may go through further development when brands offer new services, improve, alter or restructure the user experience of the app. At the same time, such apps may be part of a complex multi-channel</p><p>Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications customer journey, thus ease of use continues to present as a pertinent variable in influencing continued use. Moreover, while personalisation was previously found to have an insignificant influence on satisfaction when investigating the loyalty toward e-services <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Jung-Hwan et al., 2009)</ref>, in the context of mobile apps, this study finds that personalisation influences continuous usage intention indirectly through satisfaction while having no direct influence on continuous usage intention. In other words, satisfaction with the retailer's app's user experience fully mediates the relationship between personalisation and continuous intention to use the retailer's app. In this regard, when consumers perceive that they are receiving services that are specially tailored to their needs, they will be satisfied with the experience, which, in turn, will influence continuous usage. Examples of personalising the user experience may range from saving billing information, login information, a personalised viewing of relevant products and services, and the ability to store shopping items in a virtual basket <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Persaud and Azhar, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, in contrast to a body of literature on escapism in ecommerce <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Hoffman and Novak, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Rose et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chaouali, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Dennis et al., 2016)</ref>, escapism was found to be negatively associated with continuous use intention both directly and indirectly through satisfaction with the app's user experience. Thus, we conclude that, although a consumer may encounter escapism during the use of a retailer's mobile application, they may not like doing so, causing an adverse reaction to satisfaction and continuous intention when shopping through the retailer's mobile application. This can be explained in two ways. Firstly, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Wang et al. (2015)</ref> highlight, retailers' mobile apps are often used on the go in a utilitarian form; consumers may not want to escape. Secondly, consumers might spend more time than they would have liked on the app while shopping and, therefore, encountering escapism may result in guilt causing a low negative influence on satisfaction and continuous usage intention. The findings on escapism in this study support similar recent findings in the literature. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Mclean et al. (2018)</ref> show that spending more time than necessary on a retailer's shopping app results in a negative customer experience. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Anderson et al. (2014)</ref> show that saving time while shopping, positively influences purchase intention. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">McLean and Wilson (2016)</ref> also found that consumers are conscious of time during a utilitarian search for information through a company's website. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Konuş et al. (2008)</ref> discussed how consumers who are time conscious value online shopping, because they can complete transactions with retailers quickly. Additionally, such a finding may shed further light on the utilitarian nature of many consumers' usage of such apps, particularly when on the go ( <ref type="formula">Wang</ref>Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications <ref type="bibr">et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">et al., , McLean, 2018) )</ref> and thus consumers may prefer to use the app to complete tasks rather than to seek escapism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Blázquez (2014)</ref> found that while utilitarian and hedonic values are important in shopping online, the utilitarian value was stronger than the hedonic value. However, while the findings in this study highlight that individuals may not want to 'escape' while using a retailer's mobile application, the results show that enjoyment was positively associated with continuous intention directly and indirectly through satisfaction. Interestingly, enjoyment has a slightly stronger influence on satisfaction and continuous intention than perceived usefulness, which is known as a strong, stable driver in technology acceptance research <ref type="bibr">(Bhattacherjee, 2001b)</ref>. In this regard, consumers value retail apps when they are fun to use but may not want to use them for the hedonic purpose of escapism.</p><p>We also found that satisfaction with the app experience influences a consumer's intention to continue to use the app in the future directly and indirectly through loyalty intention towards the retail brand. Accordingly, satisfaction with the user experience strongly predicts the intention to continue using the retailer's app in the future. Importantly, satisfaction with the app's user experience significantly increases the loyalty intention towards the retailer's brand, indirectly influencing the continuous intention to use the retailer's app. Therefore, when consumers have a loyalty intention towards the retail brand and spread positive reviews to other consumers about the retailer, they are willing to purchase from the brand in the future, and thus are likely to retain the retailer's app.</p><p>In addition, the direct positive effect of loyalty intention toward the retailer and the continuous intention to use the retailer's app outlines that researchers should not only focus on factors specifically related to the characteristics of the technology when investigating continuous use of technology but also the factors related to the brand (i.e. loyalty towards the brand). Prior research has failed to explore the role of brand-related factors in influencing the continuous use of mobile applications. Given the effect of loyalty towards the brand influencing the continuous usage intention of the app, we call for researchers to further explore pertinent brand-related factors which could influence the continuous use of the ever-growing number of retailers' digital channels.</p><p>Moreover, the results affirm that the intention to continue to use a retailer's app positively influences consumers' usage behaviour and purchase behaviour, which reflects that consumers use mobile retail apps to gather information on products and services, and to make brand purchases, in line with other recent research on branded mobile apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fang, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stocchi et</ref> Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications <ref type="bibr">al., 2020)</ref>. In this study it was noted that usage behaviour and purchase behaviour have a significant positive effect to and from the continuous intention to use the app which creates a positive feedback loop effect that reflects on the relationship continuity between past and future behaviour (see: <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Stocchi et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>While <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cortimiglia et al. (2011)</ref> highlighted three different types of apps: (1) for communication, (2) for information, and (3) for purchase, in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bellman et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Wang et al. (2015)</ref>, we suggest that for continued usage of a retailer's app, consumers utilise the app for a combination of all three reasons. Therefore, retailers' shopping apps can deliver services to the consumer to accomplish a variety of tasks on the go that may involve communicating with brands for planning or making a relevant purchase, finding directions to the nearest physical store, viewing the latest deals and offerings from the brand, or reading product reviews that may help in the facilitation of a future purchase. Thus, consumers can complete a variety of tasks on a retailer's mobile app.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial Implications</head><p>Several key managerial implications are provided through this study. This research highlights that the utilitarian value of perceived usefulness, ease of use, personalisation, and the hedonic value of enjoyment are important in influencing satisfaction and the continuous usage of retailers' mobile apps. The direct impact of perceived usefulness and enjoyment on continuous intention and the indirect impact through satisfaction suggests that the usefulness and enjoyment influence continuous intention even if the customer was not fully satisfied with the app's experience. However, ease of use and personalisation are also important in increasing consumers' satisfaction with retailers' mobile apps, leading consumers to continue using and retaining the app.</p><p>In terms of perceived usefulness, retailers ought to offer consumers an app that provides value to the consumer differentiating it from the mobile website to encourage consumers to retain and continue to use the mobile application. In this regard, mobile apps have the advantage of utilising the smartphone's hardware, in turn, managers can utilise the smartphone hardware to provide consumers innovative shopping features to enhances the shopping experience through the smartphone. For example, managers could utilise the smartphone's camera (e.g. to scan the tag of a product, or offer augmented reality services), use GPS location data (e.g. to locate the nearest store or to locate the nearest convenient pickup or delivery location, or utilise geofencing technology), send push notifications (e.g. to get useful information on the delivery status of a purchased product, or to be notified of discounts and deals on items the customer is interested in, and/or to be notified when an item is back in stock) to enhance the shopping experience. It is important to note, that managers should always make sure that the consumers are in control of the way they want to shop; for example, concerning push notifications, consumers should be able to choose whether to receive them or not, as it is essential that retailers communicate with consumers through mobile devices in a non-intrusive manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Winer, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Persaud and Azhar, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In terms of perceived enjoyment, the findings highlight to managers that consumers value mobile shopping apps that are fun to use and offer a pleasant experience. The importance of the hedonic value is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Shankar et al.'s (2016)</ref> early research, encouraging brands to update their apps regularly to sustain the ability to offer consumers a fun customer experience.</p><p>Due to the use of the advanced features available in mobile apps (e.g. saving content to a user dashboard, utilising the camera for an augmented reality experience, or location-specific content), consumers may find their shopping experience more enjoyable than other service channels (i.e. a retailer's website) due to the apps ability to draw on the hardware and software of the mobile device. More so, managers should consider drawing on saved user preferences within their app to develop more playful messages and the use of gamification elements as ways to enhance the hedonic appeal of their app.</p><p>The findings demonstrate that the ease of use remains valuable to experienced consumers who already continue to use the app as it increases their satisfaction with the app experience.</p><p>Marketers can enhance the ease of use of retailers' apps by ensuring the clarity of information, graphics, and layout. For example, all informational content related to products must be easy to read and understand, while graphical content should be appealing and responsive to its environment, i.e. displaying information within the correct dimensions taking account of the screen size of a smartphone. In addition, the layout of the app's home page, user dashboards, and product pages should be developed in a user-friendly manner and well organised to enable consumers to easily navigate throughout the app. Accordingly, consumers should be able to effortlessly search for product features, select relevant categories and filter their selection based on their specific needs. More so, managers need to enable consumers to browse products freely through the app without forcing them to sign or create an account. While the collection of data through such activities can be beneficial to marketers, such action adds an additional step to</p><p>Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications the searching experience. For example, returning customers may have logged out of the app, and forcing them to sign in before browsing products adds an additional step to be able to shop which may hinder the perception of the app's ease of use. Similarly, new customers may like to browse first before they decide to invest time into creating an account with the retailer.</p><p>Furthermore, this research highlights that personalising the user experience leads to a satisfactory app experience influencing consumers to continue using a retailer's mobile app.</p><p>Thus, managers should continually innovate and utilise the unique hardware and software features of the mobile application to offer a tailored user experience that corresponds to a consumer's preferences, such as the app's ability to remember the consumer's login credentials, enabling consumers to save information in a personal dashboard (e.g. payment and delivery address information), a personalised view of relevant products and services, enabling the consumer to pre-select favoured categories, product sizes and features, the ability to favourite and save products, and to view previous orders. Retailers should continually test their app and use analytics programmes to identify and introduce the most relevant experiences that provide a personalised shopping experience.</p><p>This study also highlights that, although consumers who continue to use a retailer's mobile app value an app that is useful, easy to use, enjoyable, and offers a personalised experience, they may not want to spend much time when using the app, otherwise they may feel they are spending more time than they would like. The results of this research inform managers that, while consumers must enjoy the experience of using the app, they do not use the app to escape from the 'real world'. Therefore, spending more time on the app than is perceived necessary may result in dissatisfaction with the app's experience and consumers may reconsider whether to continue using the retailer's mobile app. Thus, managers should not be overly concerned if consumers are spending less time on the mobile application in comparison to other channels such as the e-commerce website. More so, managers could take a proactive approach and test the introduction of a time monitoring feature, indicating to the user how long they are spending on the app, such an addition could be a useful feature within a customer's dashboard or on each page of the app to keep the consumer informed on the length of time spent on the app.</p><p>Additionally, this research informs managers that loyalty intention toward the retailer influences continuous usage of mobile shopping apps, demonstrating that factors that are beyond and unrelated to the technology also influence consumers' continuous use of mobile</p><p>Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications shopping apps. Therefore, as traditional retailers operate through multiple (Omni) market channels (e.g. physical store, website, mobile app), traditional retailers must ensure a similar sustainable customer experience across all operating channels. In this regard, it is essential to develop a dynamic marketing strategy that stimulates customer loyalty through the brand's various operating channels, as each channel will influence consumers to continue to use services.</p><p>Finally, this study highlights that a favourable continuous usage intention increases the consumer's usage behaviour and purchase behaviour of the retailer's mobile app. In this regard, consumers who continue to use a retailer's app may use the app to search for information on products and services, locate a physical store, plan for future purchases, or make purchases through the app.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH</head><p>This research is constrained by certain limitations, which provide future avenues for research. This research was conducted on experienced consumers who had already retained and continue to use a retailer's mobile app. In addition, data collected on the actual frequency of use and frequency of purchase are self-reported, and therefore participants may have not recalled how much they use or purchase from the app accurately. Building on this, we encourage future research to explore innovative ways to collect data that reflect an accurate representation of use frequency and purchase frequency. In this regard, it would be interesting to investigate these relationships in a longitudinal setting to understand how the relationships in this study behave over time within the continuous usage context. In addition, it may be more robust for future studies to replicate and extend the theoretical framework in this study by collecting a sample of mobile app users from only one retailer in a longitudinal setting.</p><p>Furthermore, although the model in this research has good explanatory power, there may be other factors that impact behaviour. Therefore, further exploration and testing of antecedents related to the utilitarian, hedonic and brand-related factors presented in this study or factors that were not accounted for in this study should be explored. In addition, conducting a comparison between downloaders, and short-term and long-term users could significantly add to our understanding of consumer behaviour and mobile shopping apps. More so, it could also be plausible that the behavioural outcome variables examined in this study could be drivers of continued use, thus it would be advantageous for future research to explore this line of thinking.</p><p>Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applications It is also important to understand the factors that lead to an overall satisfactory customer experience when retailers integrate services and require customers to complete the service delivery transaction in a physical store, such as the click and collect service. In other words, how can retailers create the ultimate synergy between all operating channels, when services that are offered by retailers in the digital environment extend to the physical environment.</p><p>Additionally, as we found that escapism negatively influences satisfaction with the app experience, which is in contrast to the body of literature on escapism within the e-commerce domain, replicating the theoretical model of this study, or integrating the escapism variable into other theoretical frameworks to investigate continuous usage of mobile applications would help in understanding the role of escapism in the continuous usage of services within m-commerce.</p><p>Given the results of the role of escapism in influencing the continuous use of retailers' mobile apps, future researchers could explore this finding in greater detail through the theoretical lens of flow theory. It is worth noting that this research captures the role of escapism in the continued usage context of retailers' mobile apps in a general sense; therefore, investigating the role of escapism in a situational context could be interesting for future research. For example, can escapism influence satisfaction with the app experience positively in some situations and negatively in other situations? Furthermore, if negative escapism is a result of consumers' app use for a long period of time, at what point in time can a positive escapism effect becomes a negative one? Future research should also aim to understand how the effect of escapism extends to consumers' brand-related factors such as brand perception and loyalty.</p><p>Finally, this research was one of the first to combine technology, cognitive psychology, and brand-related factors to understand the continuous use of retailers' mobile applications. We call for future research to move beyond the exploration of technology-related factors and to further examine brand-related and cognitive psychology factors influencing the continued use of retailers' and other service providers' mobile applications.   This study examines variables influencing consumers' satisfaction with using a retailer's app and continuous intention to use the app in a multi-channel retail context with consumers in the UK.</p><p>Specifically, this research focuses on traditional retailers who had a high-street presence prior to the introduction of other digital channels (e.g. website or app). This study finds that utilitarian (usefulness, ease of use, personalisation), and hedonic (enjoyment) play a positive role in influencing consumers to continue to use a retailer's app. Interestingly, it is found that escapism negatively impacts consumers satisfaction with using the app and continuous intention to use a retailer's app. The study finds that loyalty intention toward the retailer is related to continuous intention to use the app. This research also demonstrates that the consumer's satisfaction with using the app positively influences continuous intention to use the app directly and indirectly through increasing the loyalty intention toward the retailer's brand. This study was conducted in the middle east. The study examined the learning, hedonic, personal, and integrative benefits that result from interacting with branded mobile apps on consumer satisfaction and purchase intention. This study did not focus on a particular industry. The study finds that learning benefits and hedonic benefits influence satisfaction and purchase intentions, while personal benefits influence satisfaction at the initial adoption of branded mobile apps. Study 2: purchase likelihood with the app, intention to purchase with the app instead of instore purchase with the app, and purchase in-store. Study 2 accounts for the app usage frequency's moderating role between ease of use and consumers' connection with the app, while examining a consumer's connection with the app, and perceived ease of use on purchase likelihood and intention to purchase with the app instead of in-store. This study focused on retailers that have a physical store. This research investigated the factors that motivate consumers to engage with branded mobile apps. The study is based on a mixedmethods approach. An exploratory qualitative approach was conducted for study 1 to identify relevant factors for theoretical development. Study 2 validated the theoretical framework through quantitative analysis. The results reveal that consumer involvement positively influences the utilitarian dimension (security, usefulness, and ease of use), and the hedonic dimension (interpersonal utility, attachment with the device and entertainment). In this study, a range of factors from the utilitarian and hedonic dimension influenced consumers' willingness to pay for the app and the willingness to recommend it. This research is conducted on apps from a variety of industries. The study investigated the factors that motivate consumers' usage intention of branded mobile apps while revealing the outcomes of consumers branded mobile apps usage intention. The study highlights that privacy, customisation and compatibility positively influence usefulness, ease of use and usage intention. The study also highlights that usage intention positively influences word-ofmouth and the willingness to pay to continue to use the app. This study examines the continued use of branded apps through the identification of two consumer decision-making routes. This research highlights that recent category usage, frequency of category usage, unaided branded app awareness, ease of use, usefulness, practical relevance, and entertainment play a positive role in influencing consumers to continue to use a branded mobile app. The study also reveals indirect effects that play a role in influencing the continued use of a branded app. This study was conducted in Australia on branded mobile apps from a variety of industries.

Overview of all supported and non-supported hypothesis tested in this research.&gt; Examining consumers' continuous usage of multichannel retailers' mobile applicationsDISCUSSIONTheoretical ImplicationsRetailers are continually competing for space on a consumer's smartphone device. Thus, we must understand what influences a consumer's continued use of a retailer's mobile application.Previous research outlines the variables that influence the adoption of a retailer's mobile application; however, this research moves beyond initial adoption and the singular information systems technology adoption viewpoint (e.g. TAM) and provides theoretical insight, drawing upon the ECM-IT theory, on the variables influencing continuous usage of a retailer's mcommerce mobile application. By drawing on information systems, cognitive psychology, and consumer behaviour literature (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b84">McLean et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fang, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Stocchi et al., 2020)</ref>, this study uniquely uncovers technological, cognitive psychology, and brand-related variables that are capable of influencing the continuous use of a retailer's mobile application. Previous research on the continuous use of mobile applications has failed to look beyond the technological factors in influencing consumer attitudes and behaviours. While this study continues to outline the importance of the utilitarian technological factors, it also affirms the importance of cognitive psychology and brand-related factors.</figDesc></figure>

This research finds that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness influences consumers' attitudes in the initial adoption stage and the usage stage. The study reveals that enjoyment and customisation become stronger over time. Additionally, subjective norms positively influence outcomes in the initial adoption stage but not in the usage stage. Furthermore, consumers' attitude towards the app do not influence purchase frequency or attitudes towards the brand in the initial adoption stage, however, this becomes significant in the usage stage.
