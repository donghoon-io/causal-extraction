<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>Given the purpose of this research is correlational research method is the method of structural equation. The population of this study consisted of managers of sports organizations formed. The population of this study is based on data received from these organizations recruiter about 550 people. Cochran's sample size formula for determining the permissible error ratio mentioned (0.05) was used. The sample size of 207 was obtained. In this study, cluster sampling was used to select the sample of the target population. Measurement tools included: Communication Skills Inventory Barton J. (1990) the three dimensions of communication including verbal, auditory feedback measures. The reliability of the questionnaire survey by <ref type="bibr">Nazari and et al (2012)</ref>, based on Cranach's alpha equal to 0.81 was reported. Cultural Intelligence Scale Early Wang <ref type="bibr">(2003)</ref>, which consists of four dimensions of cultural intelligence, metacognitive, cognitive, motivational and behavioral measures. The reliability of the questionnaire Abzry et al ( <ref type="formula">2010</ref>), based on Cranach's Alpha equal to 0.85 has been reported.

Statistical methods data analysis was both descriptive and inferential statistics. For data analysis software SPSS / 22 and 8.54 Lisrel / was at 95 percent. Kolmogorov Smirnov tests, Levine, t, F was While structural equation modeling (SEM) is a comprehensive statistical approach to testing hypotheses about the relationships between variables. Through this approach, the latent variables and the observed variables were used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Gender is distribution suggests that men and women are about 50.3 of 49.7 of the sample volume and sample size formed. The sample size of the group, with about 49% of bachelor's and associate it with the least amount of sample is 4%. The management of most of the sampled group with about 51% less than 5 years the smallest sample size was 11 to 20 years with 5 percent. Before beginning the research hypothesis of normality and homogeneity of variance and ensure that data. For the purpose of statistical analysis used KS and Levin. According to the results at the 95% level variables of normal distribution and homogeneity of variance of the variables are given.  LISREL output according to the chi-square value (164.36), which is a relatively high value.</p><p>The low level of the index reflects the small difference between the conceptual models of the observed data is present Outlet the show (0.037) RMSEA. The lower the index, the better is the fit .In other words, the model fit, and the fit is good, suggests that the directors approved classification based on structural equation modeling, communication skills and cultural intelligence in sport organizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and Conclusions</head><p>According to the results obtained forage, verbal components of communication skills, local director, manager, analytics, intuitive director, ambassador, duplication and category managers as well as cognitive, motivational, behavioral and intelligence have significant relationship with age. Results in a significant relationship between ages, verbal skills with <ref type="bibr">Nazari and et al (2012)</ref> result's noted that between age and skills of the sport's administrator's words, there was a significant relationship ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), is consistent. While no significant relationship between age and the other elements of cultural intelligence wit results Nasri and et al( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) that individual differences such a sage is an important factor in the process of cultural negotiation(13), consistent. The athletic directors in the areas of communication skills, including verbal skills, feedback skills, averaging 3.38with a mean of 3.36 and 2.92, respectively, were placed with an average listening skill. According to the results, communication skills, with an average of 22.03 in acceptable condition was above average but the situation was favorable significant differences this indicates that the sports administrator sin the province are not optimal in terms of communication skills, While the listening skills are at a disadvantage with a2.92average.The specific results of the Moein far and et al (2013) <ref type="bibr">Nazari and et al(2012)</ref> that the athletic directors of the poor communication skills were reported(10, 14), was consistent. Athletic directors in the province include Motivational cultural intelligence in areas with a mean of 3.58 and 3.40 with an average cognitive, behavioral, cognitive, averaging 3.33 and 3.06, respectively, were used. According to the results of cultural intelligence is above average, with an average of 3.34 in acceptable condition was but this intuition was favorable significant differences this indicates that the athletic directors of provincial cultural intelligence eared not in good condition. The results of the study <ref type="bibr">Rahimi and et al (2010)</ref> note that the Iranian industrial managers have a high level of cultural intelligence ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) are in consistent. It looks like two different nature and sports managers and administrators the Mismatch disproved Industry While the sample selected in the uniform of a cultural experience and the management of large industrial companies that have multi-cultural environments is of different nature.</p><p>Sports administrators in areas classified in the province, including managers, analysts, managers and local managers with an average of 3.43 with a mean of 3.52, with a mean of 3.36 ambassador directors, managers and administrators and intuitive imitation 3.32 and 3.24, respectively, were averaged. According to the results obtained with an average of 3.37 in the acceptable category manager salsa had a higher than average but this intuition was a favorable significant difference this indicates that the athletic directors of the classification of directors are not in good condition. Because it seems to be due to the position of athletic director Isfahan province should exercise analyst and manager with intuitive and ambassador of course be willing to give above average. The analyst manager that managers regularly assess the laws and cultural expectations, learning processes in organizations, it is important for the director, director of cultural affairs of the organization internal and external analysis gives to solve the problems, strengths and weak nesses and the opportunities and threats are analyzed. While intuitive managers to head out of the cultural issues of special importance, of great insights, insights in to the decision-making process for deciding other favors, to make decisions based on their beliefs finally, in dealing with multi-cultural vague terms of his intuitive judgment uses to control the situation. The intuitive approach to transformational leaders, managers and analysts close the results of the study should be ac knowledge Nasri and et al ( <ref type="formula">2012</ref>) has in dictated that the positive relationship between cultural intelligence and transformational leader ship exists (11). These finding suggest that cultural intelligence is a critical factor in leader ship development. <ref type="bibr">Rahimi and et al (2013)</ref>, given the positive relationship between cultural intelligence and transformational leadership style, pay attention to cultural intelligence Brzrvrt managers to better evaluate the stresses ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) is inconsistent.</p><p>Based on the research achievements, communication skills and cultural intelligence there is a significant relationship manager. Since the correlation coefficients positive, it can be said with a degree of cultural intelligence skills has increased. There Since is no direct research that examines the relationship between communication skills and their cultural intelligences not found, but research has been done in the case of indirect. They include <ref type="bibr">Dkvch and Kashon (2000)</ref> suggests that there lotion ship is important, it creates commitment(3), while Hengest (2003) communication cap abilities, most deciding factor of success when recruiting patients at the onset of I do not know(8), While Ghadampor and et al ( <ref type="formula">2010</ref>) among five distinct personality traits (extraversion, conscientiousness, compliance, Rvanjvry and openness to experience) and cultural intelligence, there was a significant relationship(5), Ziaadini and Mahmoodi (2013) found a significant positive association between happiness and intelligence personnel there cultural workers( <ref type="formula">21</ref>), the results of the present study is based on relationship between communication skills and cultural understanding is consistent with the results of the investigators noted. There based on the research achievements of a significant relationship between communication skills and category managers. In this context, no direct research that cans be directly compared with the results of the survey found. Because the interpretation of results in five categories, including managers, local officials, ambassadors, intuitive, analytical and communication skills are imitation is one of the important factors so that the ambassadors one of the attributes pointed managers Nvn example of this is the director to convincingly communicate with confidence and self-esteem refers to the imitation or the executives who head highbinder personal communication skills and the executive director of the insights that are intuitive recognize high sowed can say that the investigations properly classified and the communication skills of managers explained. Based on the research achievements of cultural intelligence and category managers, there is a significant relationship. In this regard, <ref type="bibr">RahimNia and et al (2008)</ref> suggest that theater-cultural intelligence and performance management tasks are related (17), <ref type="bibr">Nasr-Esfahani and et al (2013)</ref> the relationship between cultural intelligence and performance there. Incentives greatest effect on performance, while the least effect on behavioral aspects, while the direct relationship between cultural intelligence and transformational leader ship exist (11), these findings suggest that cultural intelligence is critical factor in leadership development. <ref type="bibr">Hussein-Nasab and Ghaderi (2010)</ref>, given the directed attain ship between cultural intelligence and transformational leadership style, pay attention to cultural intelligence Brzrvrt managers to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of stresses (9) ,Asgharzadeh (2010), <ref type="bibr">Ziaadini and Mahmoodi (2013)</ref> point out that the key relationship managers to predict efficacy successful development of cultural intelligence capacity keeps( 2, 21), <ref type="bibr">Abzari and et al(2009)</ref> suggests that managers can be classified according to their cultural intelligence(1)  <ref type="bibr">Barthion (1990)</ref> model's that the verbal communication skills, auditory feedback was presented a <ref type="bibr">Nazari and Nasri (2014)</ref> that the basic skills of communication among athletic directors, respectively, feedback, verbal and audio were provided (15), Non-coherent and is unique in this respect. It seems important language skills and communication skills are the most important component that directors exercise due to the complexities of the situation and the mission should be because they frequently with upstream managers, peers and supervision of bargaining and negotiations rein progress. The cultural intelligence model of the research areas of importance to them motivational, behavioral, has meant that the template pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abzri and et al (2009)</ref> the areas of cognitive and meta-cognitive cultural intelligence, motivation and behavior is (1) inconsistent. Perhaps this is due to the lack of consistency in the sport province multicultural environment there. On the other hand, most of the areas of motivation and behavior of the component areas of cultural intelligence is objective from the perspective of the provincial sports administrators is important. The classification of director's exercise due to Isfahan, Isfahan Province gains classified athletic director's ambassador to the managers, analysts, duplication, intuitive, and local requirements. Since most executives in sporting ambassador of property managers are therefore ambassador management features include: Director of behaving like a politician, administrator convincingly communicates with trust and confidence, Director of your well-represented and defended the honor of the good and the director is also confident of good who knows enough about what is humility. Manager's analyst characteristics include: Director of regular cultural rules and expectations of the evaluation, organizational earning processes is important for the manager director of cultural affairs of the organizations internal and external analysis gives and managers to solve problems, strengths and weaknesses and the opportunities and threats are analyzed. Properties include imitative executive director is to a large extent on the actions and behavior control, to people that it works director Pass a certain calm, director of communications skills is very important in inter personal communication, sometimes in conjunction with the director of her appear in the admin area. Intuitive management directors who represent the organization for cultural affairs director of special importance, director of insights is high, Intuitive management directors who represent the organization for cultural affairs director of special importance, director of insights is high, Manager in the decision making in sights to other decision-making processes prefers, Manager to make decisions based on their beliefs and finally director of the multicultural face of vague terms of their intuitive judgments aroused to control the situation. Local administrators and managers who head to interact with people with similar cultural backgrounds, director for cultural issues in organization alveolus and cultural backgrounds of the organization as director of corporate culture know. Survey results can become pared with those found in this part of the research. The model presented in this study was classified as managers that are unique in this respect. The general conclusions of the present study suggest that the variable communication skills, cultural intelligence and athletic directors in dictated category that of all the variables studied in the average level of sports organizations. This represents a weakness in communication skills and cultural intelligence is a province of sports administrators. In other words we can say that because managers do not have good communication skills and interpersonal communication overlook the role of employees in decision making, encourage people to communicate in organizations not organized for the purposes of the case not and the level of job satisfaction among employees have been brought down. Because of Directors intends to exercise remark able imitation of the managers tends Ambassador It should be noted that the authorities must have appropriate managements strategies In order to achieve the optimal level of communication and cultural intelligence indicators adopted choosing the right people to assume management positions at various level shave a specific concern Managers and analysts with intuitive because the reared righter prospects for the exercise of the imagination.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Structural equation modeling standard classification based management, communication skills and cultural intelligence in sports organizations</figDesc><graphic coords="5,80.73,92.15,435.35,252.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
