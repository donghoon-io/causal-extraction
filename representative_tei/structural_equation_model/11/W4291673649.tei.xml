<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Structural Equation Modeling or also known as SEM has gained popularity among researchers, academicians and students nowadays. It is due to its flexibility and generality besides can generate an accurate and precise estimation in making prediction. SEM analysis goes through the steps of model specification, data collection, model estimation, model evaluation and also model modification <ref type="bibr">(Zainudin Awang, 2012)</ref>. SEM is a unique method because the researcher can modify the structural model in order to increase the model fitness.</p><p>The assumption that data is collected from a single homogeneous population is often unrealistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Esposito Vinzi, 2007)</ref>. Assuming that data in empirical studies are homogeneous and represent a single population is often unrealistic in the social and behavioral sciences, such as information systems, management, and marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Rust and Verhoef 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Wedel and Kamakura 2000)</ref>. The failure to account for heterogeneity leads to ambiguous PLS path modeling results and, thus, to conclusions that are incomplete and ineffective <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Esposito Vinzi, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Analyzing the moderating effect for the model with latent constructs is very complicated. The normal modeling procedure using interaction terms is not practical with latent construct since it would cause problem with model convergence as well as distortion of standard errors. In the end, it result in model misfit and the procedure stops <ref type="bibr">(Zainudin Awang, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Modeling the moderating effect for latent constructs also known as Multi-Group Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). It was used for assessing the effect of moderator; in this case gender of respondents to the constructed model. Every path may have its' own moderation effect and the path(s) is/are selected in parallel to the research objective. Every path selected will be estimated separately; constrained and unconstrained model. Another method used is the critical ration difference tests which consist of z-test and z-score test. The independent sample z-test for a difference in proportion test the same null hypothesis as does the chi-square test with 1 degree of freedom, these test produce the same result in terms of reject or fail to reject decision (R. <ref type="bibr">Clifford et.al, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>According to Byrne, B.M. ( <ref type="formula">2001</ref>), critical ratio consists of z-test and z-score. This test has can be obtained by dividing the regression weight estimates to its standard error. However, this study will be using the t-statistics suggested by Chin et.al. (2010) since researcher is using SmartPLS which is appropriate for the nonparametric assumption study. The latest application of SmartPLS suggests this method since its ability to help researchers to analyze data even with small sample size and nonparametric assumption.</p><p>In this study, authors are interested to apply the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using Covariance Based Structural Equation Modelling (CB-SEM) since its character methodology fits with the parametric test. Then after, this model will be executed in Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) or Composites Based Structural Equation Modeling in obtaining of hypothesis testing. Indeed, hypothesis testing is applicable for the confirmatory purpose as deployed by the character of CB-SEM (theory driven), but, this study also paves away to better understanding the real relationship of Mathematics achievement with the corresponding factors. Plus, multi-group analysis was carry out to understand whether the observed variable based on socio demographic (gender) would provide an effect on mathematics achievement. If so, the observed homogeneity may influence on the parameter estimation of Mathematic achievement. Therefore, the study that involving of gender variable can be a pioneer to drive the practitioners conduct their research in future research due to the capability of PLS-SEM is more practical to predict the relationship of each factor that involves in the study in view of the gender variable also be tested. In order to investigate this issue, t-statistics was used for helping the researchers to obtain the family wise error rate (p-value) for hypothesis testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p>The population of the study is defined as the eighth grades (form two) students in Malaysia. Our target population is eighth grades students in Malaysia. A value of 5733 respondents was randomly chosen from 180 randomly chosen schools in Malaysia. In this case study, eighth grades student's attitude towards Mathematics acts as mediating variable, gender acts as moderator variable and achievement in Mathematics examination acts as dependent variable.</p><p>Data were obtained from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) international database. Respondents were normally selected through a two stage stratified cluster sampling technique in which consist of cluster sampling for the first stage, school sampling for the second stage and class sampling for the third stage. The questionnaire consists of four independent variables which are; school environment, teacher's characteristics, student's self-confidence in Mathematics and student's motivation in Mathematics besides student's attitude in Mathematics (mediation variable), student's gender (moderation variable) and student's Mathematics achievement (dependent variable). The data mining software SPSS AMOS was used. Several analysis used in this study are Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), Discriminant Validity, Path Analysis, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Chi Square test.</p><p>CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS (CFA) is a special form of factor analysis, most commonly used in social research. It is the extended analysis of Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and used to test whether measures of a construct consistent with a researcher's understanding of the nature of that construct (or factor). As such, the objective of confirmatory factor analysis is to test whether the data fit a hypothesized measurement model. Model fit measures could then be obtained to assess how well the proposed model captured the covariance between all the items or measures in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Zainudin, 2012)</ref>. All redundant items exist in a latent construct will be either removed or constrained. Model fitness estimations are as follow: </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">)</formula><p>DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY is the degree to which scores on a test do not correlate with scores from other tests that are not designed to assess the same construct. Correlation coefficients between measures of a construct and measures of conceptually different constructs are usually given as evidence of discriminant validity. If the correlation coefficient is high (&gt;0.85), then the discriminant validity is considered as weak, depending on the theoretical relationship and the magnitude of the coefficient. On the other hand, if the correlations are low to moderate, this demonstrates that the measure has discriminant validity. However, this threshold may meaningless if the correlation matrix and square root Average Variances Extracted (AVE) do not meet the requirement especially during the implementation of second order construct CFA. This method is usually quite restrictive and difficult to handle. The formula of AVE is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">) , ( 1 2    j p i h jh J x Cor p AVE </formula><p>MEDIATION or an indirect effect is said to occur when the causal effect of an independent variable ( X ) on a dependent variable ( Y ) is transmitted by a mediator ( M ) <ref type="bibr">(Preacher et.al., 2007)</ref>. In other words, X directly affects Y and indirectly affects Y through M . For further explanation, mediation variable can be estimated without the direct effect of exogenous on endogenous construct since the application used is partial least square algorithm (Ramayah, 2013). In this case, the causal effect of exogenous is imposing on mediator and endogenous construct simultaneously.</p><p>MODERATION according to <ref type="bibr">(Preacher et.al., 2007)</ref>, when the strength of the relationship between two variables is dependent on a third variable, moderation is said to be occurring. </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">r XW a W a X a a Y      3 2 1 0</formula><p>Where W is considered the moderator, the above equation may be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">r X W a a W a a Y      ) ( ) ( 3 1 2 0 Clarifying how the simple slope of Y regressed on X , ) ( 3 1 W a a </formula><p>, is the function of the moderator.</p><p>Formally, moderated mediation occurs when the strength of indirect effect depends on the level of some variable, in other words, when the mediation relations are contingent on the level of a moderator.</p><p>T-STATISTICS in path analysis aims to calculate the difference in paths between groups of sample. <ref type="bibr">Chin (2000)</ref> suggests a quick fix to treat the estimates of the bootstrap re-sampling in a parametric sense via t-test. In particular, studenditized t-test has two types of proportions namely equal and unequal variances that should be suit with the characteristics of sampling in population. However, Ott (1984) put forth that the result between equal and unequal variance is almost same as long the discrepancy of each group not higher than of 1.5. In this study, the authors claims that equal variance of t-test can be implemented since the required level of proportion is meet.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">                        n m STERR n m n STERR n m m Path Path t sample sample sample sample 1 1 * * ) 2 ( ) 1 ( * )<label>2 ( ) 1 ( 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 1</label></formula><p>where: m = number of samples 1 n = number of samples 2 To perform the moderated mediation analysis, a best fit model for all samples must be first done by using CFA, Discriminant Analysis and Path Analysis. In this study, researcher use Pooled CFA since it has been proven by (Eugenie Eugene Chong et.al., 2014) can obtain equal result as in individual CFA. Then, the data must be separated and saved into different files according to the groups of interest variable (i.e.: in this study, researcher separates the data into male and female groups). After that, execute the Bootstrap Analysis for overall, male and female samples to analyze the difference of before and after the data separation is done. To seek the moderation between (i.e.: male and female) samples, researcher must determine sample size, sample mean (M) and sample standard error (STERR) of path coefficient for male and female samples and calculate the difference in paths between groups of sample by using the t-statistics equation provided by <ref type="bibr">Chin (2000)</ref>. To proceed with the moderation mediation analysis, the sample size, sample mean (M) and sample standard error (STERR) of Total Effect for male and female samples must be determined before inserted into the tstatistics provided by <ref type="bibr">Chin (2000)</ref>.  Therefore, the model is good enough for the analysis. Besides that, all latent exogenous constructs are correlated with the correlation strength of less than 0.85. Therefore, the discriminant validity is achieved and all latent exogenous constructs are kept in the full model. The diagonal value (in bold) is the square root of AVE, while other values are the correlations between the respective latent construct. The discriminant validity is achieved when a diagonal value (in bold) is higher than the values in its row and column. Referring to the above table, it can be concluded that discriminant validity for all constructs are achieved.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows that all fitness indexes values had achieved the required level except for Parsimonious fit. Therefore, the model is good enough for the analysis.  Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> shows the original sample (O), sample (M) and standard error (STERR) for overall sample.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSION</head><p>From the results obtained, it is found that there is no significant difference between male and female samples in the direct effects and total effect including indirect effects of exogenous latent constructs toward endogenous latent construct. Based on the result obtained, both groups can be considered as a homogenous group even though there are some differences in the sample mean scores. However, it can't be concluded that the samples are from homogenous group because they might be distinguish in other observed and unobserved heterogeneity. For further study, researcher may consider other observed heterogenous groups or unobserved heterogeneity groups to be included in the study so that the path models for all heterogenous groups can be estimated.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>of standard error for i groups(s)</figDesc></figure>
