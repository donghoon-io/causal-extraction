<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this study, the combined use of structural equation modeling (SEM) and Bayesian network modeling (BNM) in causal inference analysis is revisited. The perspective highlights the debate between proponents of using BNM as either an exploratory phase or even as the sole phase in the definition of structural models, and those advocating for SEM as the superior alternative for exploratory analysis. The individual strengths and limitations of SEM and BNM are recognized, but this exploration evaluates the contention between utilizing SEM's robust structural inference capabilities and the dynamic probabilistic modeling offered by BNM. A case study of the work of, Balaguer, Benítez, de la Fuente, and Osorio (2022) in a structural model for personal positive youth development (PYD) as a function of positive parenting (PP) and perception of the climate and functioning of the school (CFS) is presented. The paper at last presents a clear stance on the analytical primacy of SEM in exploratory causal analysis, while acknowledging the potential of BNM in subsequent phases.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The pursuit of the "best" algorithm, primarily focused on achieving a better fit, irrespective of its logical coherence, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Darwiche (2017)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pearl (2019)</ref>, has been the cornerstone of recent developments in what can broadly be termed as machine learning (ML) technology. This approach parallels inductive models whose primary concern lies in being verified, yet unfortunately not falsified, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Reizinger (2023)</ref>. By adhering to Popper's argumentation, one can argue that if the objective is to verify the hypothesis under examination rather than to falsify it, this approach veers more towards dogmatism than science <ref type="bibr">(Popper, 1962, p. 51)</ref>. In this context, in recent years, serious ethical challenges have emerged in the use of ML, as pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Zhang, Zhang, Sun, Wang, and Sun (2023)</ref>, which underscores how the unidimensional focus on algorithmic efficacy can overlook critical considerations regarding its social and moral impact. This emphasis on predictive optimization over transparency and accountability amplifies the risk of adopting a dogmatic approach, limiting the field's capacity for self-correction and ethical evolution.</p><p>One cannot ignore that the results generated by ML are evident and of great utility, but they can be shown to be merely operationalizations of already achieved knowledge, with Pearl seeing in them "purely statistical relationships defined by the naked data", <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pearl (2019)</ref>. This approach to addressing the problem of knowledge acquisition falls within what is known as an inductive process, for which, although the evidence may statistically increase the probability of a hypothesis, this increase does not constitute genuine support. The evidence can counteract parts of the hypothesis that are not directly implicated by it, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Popper and Miller (1983)</ref>., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Popper and Miller (1983)</ref> propose different theorems within the epistemological context that emphasize:</p><p>Theorem 1: If the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence, p(h, e), is not equal to the probability of the evidence, p(e), then the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence is less than the probability of the hypothesis implied by the evidence:</p><p>p(h ← e, e) &lt; p(h ← e)</p><p>This shows that the evidence e counteracts the part of the hypothesis h that is not directly deduced from e. Theorem 2: Under the same assumptions, the difference in the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence and the probability of the hypothesis implied by the evidence is equal to the excess of the probability of their conditional over the conditional probability:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>p(h ← e) -p(h ← e, e) = p(¬h, e)p(¬e)</head><p>This excess p(¬h, e)p(¬e) is positive, demonstrating that e strongly countersupports h more than what is typically accounted for by p(h, e).</p><p>Thus, while statistical methods can provide operational utility, they often fail to offer the kind of inductive support required for genuine scientific advancement, as will be further demonstrated later in this text by, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pearl (2009)</ref>.</p><p>In this regard, if there is an aspiration to adopt a demarcated<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> approach from the scientific perspective, it is necessary to work on hypotheses that seek the falsification of hypotheses. In this context, the theory of causal inference, along with its derivatives: association, intervention, and counterfactual strategies, based on structural<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> models, becomes indispensable, Carey and Wu (2022); <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kasirzadeh and Smart (2021)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pearl (2019)</ref>.</p><p>However, any attempt to propose structural-inferential models must start from information captured by some type of experiment. For this purpose, the literature recognizes two types, manipulative experiments and mensurative experiments, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hurlbert (1984)</ref>. Manipulative experiments, those in which the researcher actively manipulates one or more independent variables, to date this is the only methodology that strictly satisfies the identification of causal dependence, provided that they are based on the assumption that controls are used, replications are present, the assignment of the independent variable is random, and the estimation of experimental error is unbiased, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hurlbert (1984)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Milliken and Johnson (1984)</ref>. For all other cases, i.e., mensurative experiments-those that measure variables without manipulation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hurlbert (1984)</ref>-alternatives for validating causality are based on theoretical structural assumptions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pearl (2009)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rubin (1974)</ref> or, in general, on hypothetico-deductive approaches, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Popper (1962)</ref>.</p><p>For many years, one of the methodologies for evaluating structural models was SEM. However, over time, many authors began to issue judgments arguing that this methodology lacked the capacity to assess inference models, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Baumrind (1983)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Cliff (1983)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Freedman (1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Freedman ( , 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Freedman ( , 2004))</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Goldthorpe (2001)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Guttman (1977)</ref>, initiating, in Pearl's words, one of the most "bizarre" stages in the history of science:</p><p>"We are witnessing one of the most bizarre circles in the history of science: causality in search of a language and, simultaneously, speakers of that language in search of its meaning.", <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pearl (2009)</ref> Pearl himself demonstrates that this confusion is related to conflating causality with algebraic equations in SEM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pearl (2009)</ref>, which had already been warned by, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Popper and Miller (1983)</ref> at the time. This is explained by the symmetry of algebraic expressions, summarized in that equations themselves do not imply causality; for instance, the equation y = βx+u Y can be algebraically manipulated to x = (y-u Y )/β, which might wrongly suggest that y causes x. In his time, Sewall <ref type="bibr">Wright, Wright (1921)</ref> observed this problem and introduced the concept of path diagrams that represent the direction of causality and differentiate it from mere algebraic association. The path diagram, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, explicitly shows the absence of a causal path from Y to X. In this formulation, β is the path coefficient quantifying the direct causal effect of the cause on the consequence, and the dashed arrows represent the contribution of unobserved exogenous variables. The variables U X and U Y are considered exogenous; they represent observed or unobserved background factors that the modeler decides not to explain, meaning they are factors that influence but are not influenced by the other variables (called endogenous) in the model. Unobserved exogenous variables represent factors omitted from the model but considered relevant for explaining the behavior of the variables within it. Thus, background factors in structural equations differ fundamentally from residual terms in regression equations. The latter are artifacts of analysis which, by definition, are uncorrelated with the regressors. The former are actual and responsible for the observed variations in the data. This difficulty in distinguishing the structural model from the regression model may explain why the aforementioned authors have declared that SEM analysis lacks the capacity to evaluate causality models.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Cause (X) Consequence (Y) Factors affecting X (U X ) Factors affecting Y (U Y ) β (Path coefficient)</formula><p>The consequences are still observed in work approaches, as many researchers relegate the ability of SEM to evaluate causal models, falling into even more bizarre situations where other methodologies that are openly not causal but associative like BNM are given roles of causal inference, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Zheng and Pavlou (2009)</ref>.</p><p>This paper seeks to demonstrate an approach adjusted to the causal inference functionalities that can be attributed to SEM and how, through its capacity to establish causal relationships in data, it can serve as a basis for using BNM. This can overcome some of the difficulties inherent in SEM, such as the non-linearity of the relationships between variables, and also expand its inferential capacity to what Pearl has proposed under the approaches of second and third-level causality: intervention and counterfactuals, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pearl (2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pearl ( , 2019))</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)</head><p>The use of randomized experiments, mentioned in previous paragraphs, only became a widespread practice from the second half of the 19th century, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rubin (1974)</ref>. Therefore, if it were considered that the only way to evaluate causality relationships was through this type of experiment, progress in many areas of science would be impossible. This is because the inability to control the assignment of factors ranges from ethical motivations to simple logistical problems (e.g., randomizing a person's gender or socioeconomic level), <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rubin (1974)</ref>. It is in this context that techniques such as SEM or non-randomized experiments become indispensable for their capacity to evaluate and estimate causal effects.</p><p>Specifically, SEM was developed to enable observational studies to make advancements in solving causal hypotheses, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pearl (2009);</ref><ref type="bibr">Wright (1921)</ref>. It offers increased flexibility in model specifications, including simultaneous and nonlinear equations (there are specific cases of applications to non-linear models in variables but linear in parameters, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bollen and Pearl (2013)</ref>), within a structural framework called path analysis. It allows for comprehensive modeling of complex and multiple causal relationships among variables, including mediating and moderating effects, which operationalizes the decomposition of direct and indirect effects in causal relationships, and facilitates the incorporation of latent variables. SEM provides metrics for assessing model fit and includes advanced techniques for handling missing data without the need for imputation. Furthermore, this framework enables the integration of existing theories for the direct evaluation of complex theories and allows for comparisons between different theoretical models to determine the best fit to the observed data. For a theory of causality, it employs a robust mathematical language to represent causal questions.</p><p>The only major restriction on the use of SEM is understood not from an instrumental viewpoint but from the relevance of its structural formulation, implying that if one intends to use SEM, the researcher must first have knowledge of the causality of the system. With this, the discussion is initiated that a model which does not preliminarily take into account the researcher's knowledge cannot be considered causal. In his early works, Jöreskog made this clear:</p><p>"A typical application of the procedure [SEM] is in confirmatory factor studies, where the experimenter has already obtained a certain amount of knowledge about the variables measured and is therefore in a position to formulate a hypothesis that specifies some of the factors involved." [Note: SEM refers to Structural Equation Modeling]. <ref type="bibr">(Jöreskog, 1969, p. 183)</ref> The model-building process of a SEM involves analyzing two distinct types of models: a confirmatory measurement (factor analysis) model that outlines the relationship between observed measures and their underlying constructs, allowing these constructs to intercorrelate freely; and a confirmatory structural (SEM) model that defines the causal relationships between the constructs as proposed by a specific theory, J.C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson and Gerbing (1982)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Jöreskog and Sörbom (1984)</ref>.</p><p>Utilizing the LISREL program notation, the confirmatory factor analysis model, also known as the confirmatory measurement model as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Jöreskog and Sörbom, Jöreskog and Sörbom (1984)</ref>, is articulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x = Λξ + δ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where x represents a vector of q observed measures, ξ is a vector of n underlying factors with n &lt; q, Λ denotes a q × n matrix of pattern coefficients or factor loadings that link the observed measures to the underlying construct factors, and δ is a vector of q variables symbolizing random measurement error and measure specificity. It is postulated within this model that E(ξδ ′ ) = 0. The variance-covariance matrix for x, designated as Σ, is defined by the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Σ = ΛΦΛ ′ + Θ δ , (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>with Φ being the n × n covariance matrix of ξ and Θ δ representing the diagonal q × q covariance matrix of δ.</p><p>Similarly, the confirmatory structural model that embodies the relationships among endogenous and exogenous constructs is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">η = Bη + Γξ + ζ, (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where η is a vector of m endogenous constructs, ξ encapsulates a vector of n exogenous constructs, B is an m × m matrix detailing the effects of the endogenous constructs on one another, Γ is an m×n matrix describing the influence of the exogenous constructs on the endogenous constructs, and ζ is a vector of m residuals indicative of errors in equations and random disturbance terms.</p><p>It is generally accepted that these analyses-measurement and structuralrepresent extremes of a continuum that, for operationalization reasons, are discretized, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Horn (1965);</ref><ref type="bibr">Lloret-Segura, Ferreres-Traver, Hernández-Baeza, and Tomás-Marco (2014)</ref>. That is, the structure and, therefore, causality are defined a priori by the researcher. This approach clearly differentiates the descriptive stage (conceptual structure) from the inferential stage (structural equations). Nonetheless, both new and old proposals have been presented that seek to integrate these two stages into either a single-step or a two-step process., J.C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</ref> show that the one-step modeling approach presents several challenges when compared to a two-step approach. First, interpretational confounding can occur, where the empirical meaning assigned to unobserved variables deviates from their theoretical meaning due to model parameter specification. This leads to significant changes in the interpretation of theoretical constructs. Second, coefficient estimates can change markedly when alternative structural models are estimated, suggesting that the meaning of estimated constructs may vary with different model specifications, complicating the accurate interpretation of variable relationships. Third, there's a tendency to maximize model fit at the expense of meaningful interpretability of constructs, potentially leading to misleading or incorrect understandings of the relationships between latent and observed variables. Finally, estimating measurement and structural models simultaneously can obscure the source of specification problems, making it difficult to determine whether issues arise from the measurement model, the structural model, or their interaction, potentially resulting in the acceptance of poorly specified models.</p><p>Later it will be seen how the argumentation by, J.C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</ref> has gone unnoticed by many practitioners of the BNM approach, seemingly unaware of the challenges: interpretational confounding, coefficient estimates, and maximizing model fit. These practitioners often relegate SEM to marginal positions or even to complete disregard.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Bayesian Network Modeling (BNM)</head><p>BNM, also known as Belief Networks or Bayes Nets, are graphical models that use graph theory and conditional probability to represent probabilistic relationships among a set of variables, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pearl (1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pearl ( , 2009))</ref>. Formally, it is defined as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) G = (V, E), where V is a set of nodes corresponding to the random variables X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X n and E is a set of directed edges (arrows with direction) between these nodes (parents to children). The parents of a variable represent its direct causes, while its ancestors encompass both its direct and indirect causes. Furthermore, a variable's children are those variables it directly causes, and its descendants are all variables that are either directly or indirectly caused by it, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kline and Santor (1999)</ref>. This model correspond to a Markovian model, where the state of the children depends only on the present state and not on the sequence of their ancestors.</p><p>A key theorem in this context is the Causal Markov Condition, which states that any distribution generated by a Markovian model can be factorized based on the structure of the causal diagram, that is, the joint probability distribution over the variables can be decomposed into a product of conditional probabilities, given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P (X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X n ) = n i=1 P (X i |P a(X i ))<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where P a(X i ) denotes the set of parent nodes of X i in the graph G, representing the variables on which X i is conditionally dependent (̸⊥ ⊥). The conditional independence (⊥ ⊥) properties of the BNM are determined by its graphical structure. If a variable X is conditionally independent of its non-descendants given its parents in the network, then the network structure can be used to simplify the computation of the joint probability distribution.</p><p>Exact inference in BNM is known to be an NP-hard problem, which means that solving problems of exact inference in BNM may require exponential time relative to the size of the network. To solve this problem, Judea <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pearl, Pearl (1988)</ref> introduced efficient approaches for approximate inference, such as belief propagation.</p><p>BNM have three basic structures (Markovian chains) which define the relationships between variables, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. In the simple chain, if W is not considered, X and Y are dependent, but if conditioned on W, X and Y are independent. For confounder, something similar occurs, and for collider, if W is not considered, X and Y are conditionally independent, but if W is considered, X and Y will be conditionally dependent. The origins of BNM can be traced back to the fields of artificial intelligence and statistics in the latter half of the 20th century. Initially, this methodology was developed to address ML issues, where it has been employed to model the joint probability of a set of variables. This provides a framework for representing uncertain knowledge and dependencies among variables. Thus, BNM serve as versatile tools for tackling problems that involve complex variable dependencies, uncertainty, and the need for probabilistic inference in ML applications. Being a Markovian model characterized by its acyclic structure and the joint independence of error terms, BNM plays a crucial role in evaluate causal inference, as they provide a framework for representing complex causal relationships in a structured and interpretable manner. This integration allows for the dynamic updating of beliefs regarding the causal structure upon the observation of new data, positioning BNM as a powerful tool for validating pre-existing causal theories, albeit often utilized in exploratory analyses.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">X W Y Simple X ̸⊥ ⊥ Y X ⊥ ⊥ Y | W X W Y Confounder X ̸⊥ ⊥ Y X ⊥ ⊥ Y | W X W Y Collider X ⊥ ⊥ Y X ̸⊥ ⊥ Y | W</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">BNM Structure Learning</head><p>Upon reaching this section, it is necessary to demonstrate the semantic inconsistencies of what a BNM represents:</p><p>"A Bayesian network is a representational device that is meant to organize one's knowledge about a particular situation into a coherent whole.", <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Darwiche (2009)</ref> This brings us back to the epistemological discussion of what is understood by the word 'knowledge', not just the word but what it represents and therefore the way it is obtained. Nevertheless, the search for learning structures from 'naked-data' inductive processes has prospered with the development of different algorithms that base their success on fitting data to probabilistically constructed models. Essentially, the process of learning the structure of the BNM involves two methodologies: constraint-based and score-based approaches, Glymour, Zhang, and Spirtes (2019); Huang, Zhang, Lin, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schölkopf, and Glymour (2018)</ref>. Constraint-based search algorithms aim to efficiently search for a Markov Equivalence Class (MEC)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">foot_3</ref> of graphs that most faithfully represent the observed conditional independence relationships. The goal is to find the causal structure that best fits these conditional independencies without contradicting them. Score-based search algorithms estimate the conditional dependencies or independencies of each variable with respect to independent noise. It uses this information to construct a directed graphical model. Instead of focusing directly on conditional independencies, these algorithms seek to maximize a scoring function that evaluates how well the proposed model fits the observed data.</p><p>All in all, these methods are based on the statistical properties of the data, referred to as 'data-driven' structure learning. This approach leaves little room for theorists in a field to incorporate their knowledge into the model's priors.</p><p>Faithful to the impossibility of inductive probability, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Popper (1962)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Popper and Miller (1983)</ref>, this article presents a third category, a 'theory-driven' structure learning. This method uniquely leverages the causal inference framework of SEM to inform the BNM's structure, integrating empirical data with established theoretical insights. Unlike the data-driven focus of constraint and score-based methods, the theory-driven approach endows the BNM with an architecture built on a complete and validated prior knowledge of causal relationships derived from SEM analyses. This approach not only enriches BNM with theoretically grounded insights but also ensures that the resulting models are closely aligned with substantive domain theories, offering a comprehensive strategy where theoretical knowledge and empirical data converge to define the network structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">BNM and SEM</head><p>It is intuitively observed that similar approaches are shared by both SEM and BNM. Instead of being considered to generate conflict regarding the use of one against the other, an increasingly wider use of their simultaneous application is being observed: in Medicine and Public Health, Duarte, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Klimentidis, Harris, Cardel, and Fernández (2011)</ref>, in Economics and Social Sciences, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Zheng and Pavlou (2009)</ref>, in Engineering and Technology, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gupta and Kim (2008)</ref>, in Transportation and Logistics, Díez-Mesa, de Oña, and de Oña (2018); <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mandhani, Nayak, and Parida (2020)</ref>, or in Environmental Studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Xu, Sun, Nie, Yuan, and Tao (2016)</ref>, among many others.</p><p>However, as expected, the "bizarre" era mentioned by Pearl has left its mark on methodological approaches, which can be divided into two groups: those that rely on SEM for proposing causal relationships in exploratory analysis and those that do not. Thus, it should be proposed that if the focus is on causal inference, using BNM in exploratory phases is conceptually and theoretically contradictory. For Pearl, the difficulties of this approach were clear:</p><p>"In Bayesian analysis, the sensitivity to 'priors' or initial assumptions generally decreases as the sample size increases. However, this is not true for causal assumptions. The sensitivity to prior causal assumptions, such as 'treatment does not change gender,' remains significant regardless of the sample size", <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pearl (2009)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, the assignment of values without any conceptual clarity, solely to allow the BNM algorithm to start its iterations in the hope that they will converge to the true value, carries a high risk of bias. In fact, initial works already report that the use of priors far from the true structure led to very high cross-entropy values, and even more so with increases in the equivalent sample size, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Heckerman, Geiger, and Chickering (1995)</ref>.</p><p>In the group that favors BNM starting the exploration process, works by , Zheng and Pavlou ( <ref type="formula">2009</ref>  <ref type="formula">2014</ref>), which has been widely reported in the social sciences where it has been the standard methodology for variable evaluation over the last decades.</p><p>Although the goal was not an exhaustive review of the literature on the topic, after inspecting the available literature, it was observed that the first approach is the most utilized. Despite the scarcity of examples supporting the alternative hypothesis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gupta and Kim (2008)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Xu et al. (2016)</ref>, these few studies presented address this issue by explaining why they opt for the approach in which the SEM model should provide the causal structure to the BNM. It is asserted that the ability of BNM to incorporate new information for model updating is a well-recognized advantage. However, inaccuracies in the foundational structure of the model may not be corrected with the introduction of new data; inaccuracies may be perpetuated or even exacerbated. In contrast, SEM offers greater flexibility, allowing structural adjustments based on theoretical justification and probabilistic reasoning. This adaptability is crucial for the model's applicability and relevance in various contexts.</p><p>Among the criticisms directed at SEM, one in particular is highlighted for its relevance: the difficulty of these models to evaluate nonlinear relationships, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bollen and Pearl (2013)</ref>. Although BNM also do not directly address nonlinear models, the methodology they use to construct networks of conditional probabilities allows the levels of the factors to be examined individually. This facilitates the identification of complex patterns without being restricted to any specific model.</p><p>Another limitation attributed to SEM models is their inability to perform model diagnostics, R.D. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anderson and Vastag (2004)</ref>, that is, to assess the impact of individual variables within the overall model context. However, this limitation might be more a reflection of the prevailing research approach than an inherent weakness of the SEM models. Since latent variables imply that observed variables are manifestations of broader constructs, any attempt to modify an individual observed variable might be futile without considering its relationship with the corresponding latent variable. Despite this, it is understandable that many researchers continue to evaluate models in a univariate manner, as this approach has historically been the most frequently used.</p><p>Lastly, under the causal inference approach, SEM models lack some properties, cannot evaluate intervention effects, counterfactual scenarios, and probabilistic relationships in a more general and flexible manner. In terms of intervention effects, SEM can be adjusted for this purpose but is not specifically designed for it. It is generally more suited for understanding structural relationships in observational data. SEM does not focus on counterfactual questions. Furthermore, although SEM can incorporate measurement errors and other sources of variability, its main focus is on modeling structural relationships rather than probabilistic ones.</p><p>Another difference is the idea that the BNM model can be improved with SEM, rather than thinking that they are complementary models that allow achieving the same goal of providing a better explanation of the underlying causal model, allowing the evaluation of non-linear relationships of the variables involved, or allowing the evaluation of the individual performance of explicit variables on the response variable, without blurring their effect into a globalizing latent variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Latent and Explicit Variables</head><p>Although the concept of latent variables is powerful in its ability to estimate unobservable effects and recognize complete theoretical constructs, it contrasts with traditional explicit approaches, such as path analysis <ref type="bibr">(Hatcher &amp; O'Rourke, 2013, p. 108)</ref>, where each variable is assessed independently with its own identity, the application of BNM predominantly occurs in contexts where explicit variables are emphasized.</p><p>However, integrating hidden or latent nodes within BNM offers a unique advantage. This approach not only compiles results but also enables the explicit evaluation of the impact of each indicator within the complete network, thereby providing a comprehensive analysis that leverages the strengths of both latent and explicit variables. Such a methodology allows for a more nuanced understanding of complex phenomena, bridging the gap between observable indicators and underlying processes that are not directly measurable.</p><p>This distinction is particularly evident in fields like medicine, where advancements have significantly relied on the use of explicit biomarkers, essentially following path models, for instance, in clinical research, work on factorial models, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bullen et al. (2021)</ref> could make use of these structural models with latent variables alongside explicit biomarkers in a Bayesian Network Model (BNM) could unveil deeper insights into disease mechanisms, patient outcomes, or treatment efficacy. This dual approach facilitates a more robust analysis, capturing both the measured effects of explicit variables and the inferred influences of latent factors. It enriches the model's explanatory power without sacrificing the detailed evaluation of explicit indicators.</p><p>In the words of other researchers, the causal network can be diagnosed, R.D. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anderson and Vastag (2004)</ref>. This statement underscores the potential of BNM with latent nodes to diagnose and interpret causal relationships in a way that traditional models, focusing solely on explicit variables, might not achieve. The inclusion of latent variables enables researchers to model and infer complex interactions and causalities that reflect the reality of the phenomena under study more accurately.</p><p>Additionally, the use of latent variables can be applied to different uses:</p><p>1. Handling of missing data: they can treat incomplete data by inferring the most probable values for the missing variables. 2. Abstraction: they can capture more abstract underlying structures or generative factors in the data, providing insights into complex phenomena. 3. Simplification: they reduce the model's complexity by grouping several observed variables under a more general concept, making the model more interpretable. 4. Incorporation of prior knowledge: previously established theoretical relationships can be incorporated into the model through latent variables, enhancing the model's accuracy and relevance.</p><p>In recent years, the focus on latent spaces or dimensions has become an important area of work in ML methodologies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahuja, Mahajan, Wang, and Bengio (2023)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lotfollahi et al. (2023)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Schölkopf et al. (2021)</ref>. This is because there has come a point where ML algorithms are being asked to explain their results, and one of the approaches being intensely pursued is causal models using latent dimensions or spaces. As Popper already predicted, being inductive approaches, these authors arrive at the same conclusions: the results "are not directly interpretable,", <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lotfollahi et al. (2023)</ref>. In conclusion, the complementary use of latent and explicit variables in BNM opens new avenues for research and analysis across various fields. By embracing both, researchers can construct more comprehensive models that capture the full spectrum of influences on the phenomena of interest, from the directly observable to the implicitly underlying. This study tested an empirical model of the relationship between PYD and two contextual factors: PP and CFS. The hypothesis tested was that a perception of positive parenting or positive relationship with parents and a positive perception of the climate and functioning of the school will contribute to the prediction of PYD. The sample was composed of 1507 adolescents recruited in seven Spanish schools, who were aged between 12 and 18 years; 52% were female. The structural model evaluated for PYD in function of PP and CFS was made in this way: constructs associated to PP: affect and communication (AfC ), autonomy granting (Aut), humor (Hum), and self-disclosure (Dis); constructs associated to CFS: 1) peer relations (Pee); 2) school bonds (Bon): belongingness (Bel) and support (Sup); 3) activities proffered (Pro); and 4) clarity of rules and values (Cla): rules (Rul) and values (Val); and constructs associated to PYD: optimism (Opt), pessimism (Pes), general self-efficacy (GSe), agency (Age), comprehensibility (Com), manageability (Man), and meaningfulness (Mea), Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. Previous reliability and validity analyses of the constructs were carried out, and correlational analyses and structural predictions were made. The results show that both PP and CFS were associated with better scores in PYD, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p></div>

(2022)</ref>, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. Then, these scores are discretized into quintiles, Q i , following the process:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Q i =                  1 if S i ≤ P 20 2 if P 20 &lt; S i ≤ P 40 3 if P 40 &lt; S i ≤ P 60 4 if P 60 &lt; S i ≤ P 80 5 if S i &gt; P 80</formula><p>where P 20 , P 40 , P 60 , and P 80 represent the 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th percentiles of the score distribution S i , respectively.</p><p>With the discretized values, under the structure given by the PYD model defined by the original authors, the model was re-estimated using two algorithms for BNM: the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pearl (1988)</ref> and the Bayesian Dirichlet equivalent uniform (BDeu) score, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Heckerman et al. (1995)</ref>.</p><p>EM focuses on maximizing the likelihood or posterior probability of parameters given data. Designed for incomplete data, it is also effective with complete data, particularly for efficiently estimating parameters in complex models. BDeu, using a uniform prior and focusing on the BDE score, is specifically designed for model selection and parameter estimation in BNM. This approach aligns with incorporating prior knowledge explicitly and facilitates comparing different network structures within the Bayesian framework. Thus, using BDeu is expected to perform better in estimation by significantly weighting prior values, especially when using SEM analysis results as initial values.</p><p>Once the estimates were obtained, the process of generating inferences began. In BNM the inference process leverages the network's structure and the estimated conditional probability (CP) distributions. Thus, the performance of the models was evaluated using classic indicators such as Accuracy, Recall, and F1-Score, for complete data (without missing data), both in the training set (70%, n = 710) and the validation set (30%, n = 305).</p><p>The selected model was evaluated using information gain (entropy) measurements. This statistic allows understanding the reduction in uncertainty about one variable given the knowledge of another. This is quantified by comparing a variable's entropy with its conditional entropy given another variable.</p><p>The entropy of a variable measures the uncertainty or randomness associated with the variable. It is calculated using:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">H(X) = - x∈X P (x) log P (x),<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where P (x) is the probability of each state of X.</p><p>Conditional entropy measures the amount of uncertainty remaining in a variable when the state of another variable is known. It is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">H(X|Y ) = - y∈Y P (y) x∈X P (x|y) log P (x|y),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where P (x|y) is the conditional probability of X given Y . Lastly, Information Gain (IG) quantifies the reduction in uncertainty about variable X due to the knowledge of variable Y and is calculated as the difference between the entropy of X and the conditional entropy of X given Y :</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">IG(X; Y ) = H(X) -H(X|Y ). (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>A higher value of IG(X; Y ) indicates that knowing Y significantly reduces the uncertainty in X. This analysis became pivotal in predicting PYD, with a focus on the examination of conditional probabilities and the information gain of variables related to it. The visualization of BNM and the generation of CP tables were conducted to provide insights into the network's structure and the relationships between variables.</p></div>

The Five Cs model by Lerner-Competence, Confidence, Connection, Character, and Caring-is one of the most comprehensive, incorporating social, moral, and personal dimensions. It underscores the development of cognitive, behavioral, and social competences, with empirical support for its role in youth flourishing and positive community contribution, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Benson, Scales, Hamilton, and Sesma (2006)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dvorsky et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model for PYD</head><p>The development of adolescents is significantly influenced by their immediate socialization contexts, notably family and school.

Similarly, schools contribute to PYD by fostering a supportive climate, clear rules, and positive relationships with adults, enhancing students' competency development and adjustment, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barber (2005)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Baumrind (1967)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Darling (1999)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Greenberg et al.

It was hypothesized that PYD would be fostered by PP-characterized by closeness and communication, promotion of autonomy, humor, and self-disclosure-and by a positive CFS-characterized by beneficial peer relationships, a sense of belonging and support, a clear understanding of rules and values, and enriching activities and resources in the school. The empirical results show these associations and predictions among Spanish adolescents, regardless of sex and age. PP emerges as the most significant factor in promoting PYD, while the role of the school context is less pronounced, aligning with previous research on asset promotion in adolescence, Balaguer, Martínez, and Naval (2020); <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Balaguer, Orejudo, et al. (2020)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Oliva Delgado et al. (2011)</ref>. These factors are interrelated, and all are associated with individual personal competencies, R.M. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lerner et al. (2005)</ref>. This approach moves beyond the individualistic view of personal competencies by including the effect of contextual variables, aligning with an interactive view of personal development and educational processes, de la Fuente-Arias (2017). Family and school environments are presented as essential regulatory contexts to promote personal development. The family, as a contextual factor, is emphasized over school variables, consistent with the findings that the perception of assets is a predictor of better competence development among students, Scales, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Benson, Leffert, and Blyth (2000)</ref>. Although the family context is the main factor influencing PYD, there is also a significant association between school and PYD, underscoring the importance of a combined effect of family and school environments in the direction of positive development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Result</head><p>The initial SEM showed adequate fit levels under the assumptions of, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hu and Bentler (1999)</ref>: comparative fit index (CFI) &gt; 0.95 and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) &lt; 0.09; or root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) &lt; 0.05 and SRMR &lt; 0.06, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>In this manner, the scores for each of the latent variables from the SEM were obtained, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Subsequently, using these scores and their translation into discrete values represented by the quintiles of their distribution, the conditional probability tables were generated, and from these, the inferences that were utilized to estimate the fit statistics of the BNM for each evaluated algorithm, Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. From this analysis, it is observed that generally, the algorithms provide similar results; however, the BDeu method, as expected given its emphasis on initial values, demonstrated better performance than the EM, which is why it was chosen to perform the final inferences on the entire data table. It is clear that the fit values are very low; this is due to the model being required to handle high complexity by dividing responses into quintiles. However, the interest before adjustment is to evaluate the model's ability to convert factor scores into ordinal variables that are interpretable from a theoretical perspective. Nevertheless, the model was also evaluated with the minimum number of levels (2), which corresponds to the division given by the median. In that case, the values of the three metrics reached 80%.</p><p>The information gain values for the latent variables of the model are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, where the effect of positive parenting is highlighted, within which AfC is the construct or latent variable contributing the most. Regarding the CFS, the Bon, represented to a greater extent by belonging, show the greatest contribution to the target variable, PYD.</p><p>Lastly, to evaluate the nonlinear behaviors of the assessed factors, contour figures were generated, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. These figures display the conditional probability tables for each level (quintile) of the latent variables PYD, based on the quintiles of the PP and CFS.</p><p>For the first level of PYD, it is observed that its greatest conditional dependency comes from the lower values of CFS, a situation not observed with PP. This finding, not evident in the SEM model, indicates that the linear relationships implied by the SEM model-that low levels of PP and CFS would conditionally lead to low PYD levels-may not hold. This suggests a reevaluation of assuming parenting styles have a linear effect.</p><p>At the second level of PYD, a similar pattern is observed, though PP starts to show a slight effect on PYD. However, it is clear that the probability of being at level 2 of PYD almost exclusively depends on CFS.</p><p>For the third level of PYD, CFS begins to interact with PP, where the highest probability of being at PYD level three depends on both levels two and three of PP, as well as levels 2, 3, and 4 of CFS.</p><p>At the fourth level of PYD, the proportional effect of PP and CFS consolidates, though an effect less pronounced at level 3 becomes evident. At this level, changes in CFS show less steep slopes than those in PP, meaning improvements in PP level have a more pronounced effect on the probability of PYD level 4 than changes in CFS levels do.</p><p>Finally, the fifth level of PYD somewhat replicates the behavior of level 1, where the most significant changes are due to increases in CFS levels. However, unlike PYD 1, this level shows that the highest probability values are achieved at high levels of both PP and CFS. This somewhat aligns with the SEM results, where both factors additively and positively influence PYD.</p><p>Overall, the effect of CFS is somewhat proportional to the levels of PYD; contrary to the effect of PP, which at its lower levels does not significantly impact the target variable. Its most significant impact is observed starting from the third level of PYD, reaching its maximum expression at the highest level of PYD.</p><p>The possibilities for diagnosis within a network of this style are numerous and depend on the researcher's interest in which explicit effects they want to evaluate on specific target variables. For this case, and as an example of the potential of the analysis of conditional probabilities, the relationship between the second-level latent variables in relation to the target variables PP, CFS, and PYD was analyzed, see Figures <ref type="figure">7, 8,</ref> and<ref type="figure">9</ref>.</p><p>For the second-level variables Aut, Hum, Dis, and AfC related to PP, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>, it is noted that these variables generally exhibit the same behavior regardless of the level of PP assessed; overall, AfC shows the highest conditional probabilities and Dis the lowest. It is also highlighted that the outcome is as expected, and it replicates the linear effect predicted by the SEM, that is, each level of PP is directly related to the levels of the variables it influences, only Dis does not clearly show this relationship at levels two and three, as seen in Figures <ref type="figure">7b</ref> and<ref type="figure">7c</ref>, with levels two and three of Dis having the same impact on levels two and three of PP. In other words, levels two and three of Dis do not discriminate in their ability to identify intermediate levels of PP.</p><p>For CFS, the variables with the best predictive capacity are, in order, Bon and Cla, Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>, and similarly to PP, here the variables with more problems to discriminate intermediate values of CFS are Pro and Pee, Figures <ref type="figure">8b, 8c</ref> and<ref type="figure">8d</ref>.</p><p>Regarding PYD and its second-level variables, the behavior does not present as much indefiniteness as with the previous constructs, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>. The predictive effect of Mea and the low prediction of Gse are highlighted. Moreover, Gse, Opt, and Pes are the variables with the greatest difficulties in identifying intermediate levels of PYD, as seen in Figures <ref type="figure">9c</ref> and<ref type="figure">9d</ref>.</p><p>This demonstrates the utility of complementing the use of SEM with BNM, by converting regression coefficient values β into probabilities, which have a clearer interpretation, not only when evaluating the model but also if the interest is to apply it in fieldwork.      The definition of an inferential causality model is inherently dependent on the researcher's hypotheses, viewing statistical and computational methodologies as instrumental yet subordinate to theoretical frameworks. This stance acknowledges that while methodological tools offer valuable insights, their evaluation must align with established theoretical requirements. In addressing the integration of BNM and SEM for causal inference, this discussion navigates from overarching methodological considerations to specific criticisms and advancements. The main challenge in employing BNM lies in their directional dependency relationships, which often do not distinguish between association and causality. Conversely, SEM's limitation is its fixed model structure post-definition, unable to adapt to new data insights. A proposed solution involves a two-step approach: initial measurement model identification via SEM, followed by exploratory structural relationship analysis through BNM. This iterative method balances theoretical rigor with data-driven flexibility, allowing for the adjustment of structural models based on emerging data patterns. Historical critiques often misinterpret SEM's approach to causal inference, suggesting an overreliance on associations without proper causal justification. Advances in methodological frameworks, such as graphical models and do-calculus" <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Pearl and Bareinboim (2014)</ref>, have clarified SEM's role in causal analysis, stressing the necessity of differentiating statistical from causal assumptions. Despite these clarifications, the application of BNM in a purely data-driven manner remains prone to establishing unfounded causal connections, emphasizing the need for theoretical grounding and careful interpretation of conditional dependencies. Within the specific context of PYD and its second-level variables, the predictive effect of Mea and the limitations of Gse in identifying intermediate levels of PYD were examined. These findings demonstrate the analytical value of combining SEM with BNM, transitioning from regression coefficients to probabilities for clearer interpretation. However, caution is advised in interpreting BNM' autonomously determined directionality, which may conflate probabilistic dependencies with causality. It should be noted that the model of, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Balaguer, Benítez, De la Fuente, and Osorio (2021)</ref> is used as a starting point, which considers the PYD as an adolescent who perceives themselves as not pessimistic and, at the same time, optimistic, efficient, and competent. They are capable of setting goals and achieving them, and perceive the environment in which they move as understandable, manageable, and meaningful. It is considered by the adolescent that the perception of a PP is characterized by affection and communication (AfC ) with their parents, who also promote their autonomy, possess good humor, and have the confidence to voluntarily reveal more personal aspects to them. The CFS is proposed as consisting of positive relationships of the adolescent with their peers and positive links with their school in terms of a sense of Bel and Sup, clarity of the rules and values of the school, and the provision of educational and recreational activities by the school. In general, it has been shown by information gain values that the AfC factor contributes the most to PP, Bon contribute the most to CFS, and Bel contributes the most to PYD. Furthermore, it is found that positive relationships with parents have a greater impact on the adolescent development and well-being than do school bonds, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Arslan, Burke, and Majercakova Albertova (2022)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Balaguer et al. (2021)</ref> or the school climate, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Balaguer et al. (2021)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Oliva Delgado et al. (2011)</ref>. However, one of the main contributions of this work is that the conditional probability of the PP and CFS quintiles for the PYD can be verified, thanks to the analysis provided by the BNM, particularly the contour figures. Thus, it is shown that a low CFS perception negatively affects PYD, independently of the parenting perception. A negative PYD may be had by the adolescent with a positive PP if their school context is negative. Therefore, Bel is identified as an essential mechanism that contributes to understanding the effect of positive, strengths-based parenting on the development and well-being of youth, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Arslan et al. (2022)</ref>. For a medium PYD level, it is observed that PP begins to become independent from CFS. Indeed, the family is recognized as the main agent of socialization and positive development. Family involvement is seen to facilitate adolescent adjustment and school identification, as well as bonds with their teachers and peers, which contributes to the youth's perception of acceptance and support from the school, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Law, Cuskelly, and Carroll (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Uslu and Gizir (2017)</ref>. Precisely, to reach high or very high PYD levels, the adolescent needs both high and very high PP and CFS levels, especially the latter. The adolescent requires support and bonds with school as well as positive relationships with classmates, in addition to family support characterized by frequent closeness and affection from parents, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Animosa, Lindstrom Johnson, and Cheng (2018)</ref>.</p><p>In this way, it is shown that the context plays a determining role in the interaction with personal adolescent development, de la Fuente-Arias (2017). In particular, a positive school context, which enables the adolescent to perceive school support and bonds, promotes their development at multiple levels: social, emotional, academic, and health, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Waters, Cross, and Runions (2009)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Wong, Dosanjh, Jackson, Rünger, and Dudovitz (2021)</ref>. An adolescent cannot develop positively with low CFS, regardless of the perceived quality of parenting. However, excellent positive parenting greatly enhances the effect of the school context for optimal positive personal development. Hence, the importance of schools actively involving parents to foster their children's school bonds, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Arslan et al. (2022)</ref>.</p><p>In conclusion, this article argues for the necessity of reinstating theorists in disciplines to their role in defining the structure of models. This role has attempted to be supplanted by machines, which have repeatedly shown that they cannot operate alone by merely hoping that the exponential increase in information will be sufficient to generate the needed knowledge. It is the collaborative work of causal theoretical models, computational algorithms, and statistical methods that should be proposed as a working methodology for advancing knowledge a synergistic rather than competitive effort between these approaches.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: The path diagram showing the absence of a causal path from Y to X</figDesc></figure>
