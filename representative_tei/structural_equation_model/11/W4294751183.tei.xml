<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manuel 5th Edition (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013a) describes autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) as involving impaired social interactions, repetitive behaviors, and problems with communication. Additional features can include poor eye contact <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Esposito and Venuti, 2008)</ref>, sensory modulatory dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baranek et al., 2005)</ref>, motor dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Ozonoff et al., 2008)</ref>, and cognitive developmental problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Esposito et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Edwards et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>There have been several potential advantages of the DSM classification suggested for disorders, such as ASD, as it attempts to standardize diagnosis and treatment across different treatment providers, provides a quick guide, and should eliminate guesswork <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Möller, 2014)</ref>. This should, in principle, provide a useful guide for both clinicians and researchers; however, the DSM classification approach also presents many disadvantages. One such disadvantage is that there may be issues with such a rigid classification taxonomy as the DSM adopts a latent disease model that is suggested by the American Psychiatric <ref type="bibr">Association (2013a,b)</ref> and assumes a medical illness model. This approach assumes that symptoms should reflect some specific sets of underlying and latent disease entities; however, latent categories are often not distinct. This can be found in the evidence which has found a high degree of comorbidity between these latent categories, indicating that these categorical clusters of symptoms advocated by the DSM are not linked to discrete functions as they were intended to do <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Kupfer et al., 2008)</ref>. Despite many attempts to overcome the problem of comorbidity, the DSM still does not provide clinicians and researchers with any treatmentspecific indications for those cases presenting with psychiatric comorbidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Dell'Osso and Pini, 2012)</ref>. These type of problems have led to growing disinterest in the most recent version, the DSM-5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Hayes et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Such growing disagreement with this rigid classification protocol approach for some times has led to calls for a move toward a process-based approach in the diagnostics and treatment of mental health disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Forgeard et al., 2011)</ref>. This has been most recently formalized in a process-based therapy (PBT) approach, which advocates that diagnostic and therapeutic efforts should focus more on the causal processes that underlie the efforts to produce change and not through rigid categories advocated by the DSM <ref type="bibr">(Hayes and</ref><ref type="bibr">Hofmann, 2017, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Hofmann and Hayes, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Hofmann et al., 2021)</ref>. PBT research emphasizes the Extended Evolutionary Meta Model (EEMM), which highlights the processes of change as multi-level and multi-dimensional rather than singularly focused through protocols of syndrome as suggested by the DSM. EEMM specifies six dimensions at the individual level where processes of change can occur; affective (positive and negative affects), cognitive (problem-solving skills, reappraisal, etc.), attentional (mindfulness, noticing in the present moment, awareness of feelings), self (self-esteem, self-efficacy, selfcompassion, and self-as-context), motivation (individual goals and values), and overt behavior (striving and commitment to goals). There are two additional levels in this model, that being the physiological level (such as autonomic functioning, predictive coding, interoception of the insular cortex), and social level (such as group motivations and values).</p><p>This problem of comorbidity when attempting to strictly classify disorders can be seen clearly in many clinical cases. For example, there are several autistic symptoms that have similarities and overlap with the symptoms in other clinically diagnosable conditions, such as schizophrenia, such that both conditions involve problems with emotional functioning and information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Lewis and Levitt, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Volkmar et al., 2004)</ref>. Indeed, evidence suggests that ASD and schizophrenia may share some commonalities in phenomenology <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Couture et al., 2010)</ref>, in biological pathway pathophysiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Pinkham et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Guilmatre et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Sugranyes et al., 2011)</ref>, and in treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(McCracken et al., 2002)</ref>. However, these two conditions have been clearly delineated for their unique aspects for many years <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Kanner, 1965)</ref>.</p><p>Such delineation has been more difficult when comparing conditions such as ASD and alexithymia <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Kinnaird et al., 2019)</ref>. Alexithymia, which is regarded as a personality trait and relates to the difficulties in emotional processing, such as recognizing emotions, has also been reported in ASD <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Silani et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Guastella et al., 2010)</ref>. More specifically, it has been suggested that problems with emotional processing observed in ASD stem from co-occurring alexithymia <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bird and Cook, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Cook and Shah, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Brewer et al., 2015)</ref>. Alexithymia was first recognized in the 1970s and has been described as a condition involving difficulties in recognizing and distinguishing different emotions,</p><note type="other">Edwards .</note><p>/fpsyg. . a lack of imagination, and thoughts centered on the external world rather than internal world <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Sifneos, 1973)</ref>. Though not always identified in individuals who have a diagnosis of ASD, alexithymia has been found to be more extreme in ASD individuals compared to the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Hill et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Berthoz and Hill, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Fitzgerald and Bellgrove, 2006)</ref>. Indeed, there is a growing body of research, which suggests that the problems associated with emotional processing in ASD individuals are driven by alexithymia. Evidence supporting this comes from studies that have shown, for instance, that when controlling for alexithymia and autism, it is the levels of alexithymia and not autism which predict problems with facial, vocal, and music emotional recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Heaton et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Cook and Shah, 2013)</ref>. A meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Kinnaird et al., 2019)</ref> identified 15 studies where alexithymia was found to be higher in an ASD population when compared to a neurotypical population (49.93 compared to 4.89%). They concluded that alexithymia represents a specific subgroup in ASD, and that further research was needed to understand the nature and implications of co-occurring comorbid alexithymia in ASD. This comorbidity is clearly a problem for the DSM, which favors distinct categories.</p><p>Another connection that is difficult to delineate is the connection between ASD (including with alexithymia) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms. For example, ASD traits (such as ritualistic behavior, attachment to objects, and in some cases low levels of sociability) have been identified in individuals with OCD <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Ivarsson and Melin, 2008)</ref>. There are also substantial similarities and overlap in the pathophysiology between OCD and ASD <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Meier et al., 2015)</ref>, though less is known about the clinical etiological cohesion between these disorders. Furthermore, it has been found that individuals with OCD had significantly higher levels of alexithymia than those who did not <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Grabe et al., 2006)</ref>, which echoes the comorbidity problem that ASD has.</p><p>Less work has linked ASD with alexithymia and OCD concretely. Some of the work in ASD have speculated; for instance, that deficits in localized areas of basal ganglia and cerebellum abnormalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Nayate et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rinehart et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Qiu et al., 2010)</ref> are responsible for gait function, movement problems, and also social and communication issues, which may also be applicable to explain alexithymia and OCD symptoms in some cases, but not all. However, one particularly interesting and promising psychophysiological pathway that may prove to be a crucial link to explain the comorbidity among alexithymia, ASD, and OCD is the interoceptive pathway.</p><p>Interoception is the representation of the internal system at any given moment. It is formed in the brain (primarily the insular cortex) by interpreting signals received from the bodily organs via general visceral afferent neurons (found in cranial nerves VII, IX, and X) of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cameron, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Craig, 2002)</ref>. The interoceptive pathway consists of unmyelinated C and myelinated Aδ afferent fibers which transmit a signal from the laminae I vertebra of the spine to the posterior gray column of the spinal column and then to the hypothalamus, anterior insular, and cingulate cortices <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Pollatos et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Craig, 2008)</ref>. These brain areas receive information signals from viscera, thermoregulatory, nociceptive, and endocrine systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Pollatos et al., 2007)</ref>. Once the brain has received these signals, it then integrates this information in terms of their varying motivational immediacy, such as determining whether to respond to sensations, such as prickly burning pain, warmth-coldness, hunger, need to urinate, and sensual touch <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Strigo and Craig, 2016)</ref>. The signals are then further processed for motivational and emotional relevant behaviors, through organizing it within primary emotional and motivational brain regions of the limbic system, the anterior insular, and cingulate cortices of the homeostatic sensorimotor cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Murphy et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Craig, 2014)</ref>. It has been suggested that at this stage, a meta-representation of "self " emerges allows for very specific regulatory responses to the signals to emerge.</p><p>Interoception is typically measured through an index of interoceptive accuracy (IAc) or interoceptive sensitivity (IS) (these measures are the same), which are recorded through the heartbeat perception task <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Schandry, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Pollatos et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Mallorquí-Bagué et al., 2014)</ref>, which asks participants to count their perceived heartbeats, and then, the following formula is applied:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 - | n beats actual -n beats perceived | (n beats actual + n beats perceived )/2 (1)</formula><p>Another approach is to use the multi-dimensional interoceptive awareness questionnaire (MAIA-2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Mehling et al., 2018)</ref>, which assesses a more conscious self-report measure (than the heartbeat perception task) of interoception. There is a distinction between the ability to detect interoceptive information (such as heartbeat detection) in the form of IAc and an individual's conscious beliefs about their interoceptive abilities, called interoceptive sensibility (ISen). The MAIA-2 assessment is a self-report questionnaire measure of ISen <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Mehling et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Smith et al., 2021)</ref>, whereas another measure of ISen is a simple confidence measure of how accurate the participants felt they were at the heart beat counting task <ref type="bibr">(Mehling, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Altered interoception is associated with an increase in psychopathological disorders, such as an increase in chronic pain, anxiety, depression, and eating disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Paulus and Stein, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Klabunde et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Di Lernia et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Duschek et al., 2017)</ref>, but is not predicative of a specific emotional regulation strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Pinna and Edwards, 2020)</ref>. Typically, lower IAc/IS scores lead to greater pathology, and it is suggested that inefficient or an impaired relay of interoceptive information, transmitting a greater number of interoceptive errors than usual from peripheral structures to higher cortical centers, leads to dysfunctional "body mapping" <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Craig, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Harshaw, 2015)</ref>. This eventually leads to dysfunctional self-regulatory processes and ultimately to aberrant emotional, behavioral, and autonomic sequelae <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Craig, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Increased IAw has been shown to have both positive and negative outcomes. For example, increased focus on physical sensations IAw has been associated with anxiety, hypochondriasis, somatization, and hypervigilance <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Paulus and Stein, 2006)</ref>. It has been suggested that what determines whether increased IAw/ISen leads to maladaptive or healthy outcomes depends on the interoceptive style <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Mehling et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Mehling et al.</ref> suggest that the maladaptive form of IAw/ISen that is associated with the maladaptive outcomes (e.g., of hypervigilance) is anxiety-driven interoception. They suggest that with the emerging field of mindful bodily awareness, maybe a more adaptive form of IAw/ISen can be promoted, rather than that driven by anxiety, which are more likely to lead to more positive mental health outcomes. Some evidence confirm this suggestion, as mindful IAw in the form of a body scan technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">(Ussher et al., 2014)</ref> has been shown to reduce painrelated distress and the degree to which pain interferes with social relations. Mindful IAw has also shown to reduce stress states in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Colgan et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In autism specifically, interoception appears to be atypical, but the degree and directionality is unclear due to the heterogeneous nature of the condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(DuBois et al., 2016)</ref>. There have been some controversies as to whether abnormalities in the interoceptive system actually cause autism, with some researchers saying that it does <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Quattrocki and Friston, 2014)</ref> and others suggesting that it does not <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Nicholson et al., 2018)</ref>. It is perhaps important to note that interoception is not just central to the processing of bodily signals for the requirement of homeostasis and allostasis but also the perception of these bodily signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cameron, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Craig, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Critchley et al., 2004)</ref>. As such, interoception is also central in a range of cognitive and emotional processing which includes memory, decision-making, emotional processing, social interactions, body ownership, a sense of self, and even consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Critchley et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Dunn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Shah et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Critchley and Garfinkel, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Tsakiris and De Preester, 2018)</ref>. With such a central system, it is likely that interoception plays a key role in autism and other related conditions.</p><p>One of these related conditions is alexithymia, and it has indeed been suggested that alexithymia is the result of impaired interceptive pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Herbert et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Brewer et al., 2016)</ref>. For instance, some suggestions are that the interoceptive pathway is thought to relate to developmental dysfunction of the connectivity among the limbic structures, the anterior insular (AntIn), and the anterior cingulate context (ACC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Lane et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Craig, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Singer et al., 2009)</ref>. This could also mean that alexithymia is the result of dysfunction with the homeostasis mapping of regulatory responses and the generation of a meta representation of "self " that is thought to be an important as part of the interoceptive pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Damasio and Carvalho, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Interoception in the form of IAc has been found to be attenuated in individuals with OCD <ref type="bibr">(Schultchen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Demartini et al., 2021)</ref> and did not change over time with standardized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). There have been mixed results in relation to whether individuals with OCD have increased or lowered IAc, whereby one study has reported that IAc was higher in OCD than healthy controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(Yoris et al., 2017)</ref> and another has indicated that it was lower <ref type="bibr">(Schultchen et al., 2019)</ref>. In addition to this, an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study has shown that sensory phenomena (SP) that are aversive uncomfortable sensations that accompany repetitive behaviors in OCD result in the hyperactivation of the insular (a primary area of interoceptive processing) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Brown et al., 2019)</ref>. These mixed results may provide further evidence that the type of interoception (e.g., mindfully or anxiety-based) is more important than whether there is a direct increase or decrease in overall interoception. One study specifically focusing on ISen showed that the MAIA subscales were differentially associated with the different OCD symptom dimensions.</p><p>Central to interoception is the vagus nerve, which is the main cranial nerve in the human body known to primarily relay visceral (interoceptive) signals to the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Critchley and Harrison, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Yoris et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Quadt et al., 2019)</ref>. The vagus nerve is the 10th cranial nerve (labeled CN X) and has a central role in transmitting interoceptive information to the brain, as well as being main anatomical component of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(Walker, 1990)</ref>. It has been largely acknowledged for its afferent neuron functions that make up 80% of the nerves which relay sensory information from viscero-somatic structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Porges, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bonaz et al., 2017)</ref>. It is assumed that the vagus nerve not only includes visceral homeostatic function, but also is involved in social, cognitive, and affective components <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Membrilla et al., 2020)</ref>. A recent systematic review of the literature showed that both indices of interoception along with more direct vagal activity were shown to be central to emotional regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Pinna and Edwards, 2020)</ref>. For example, the study found that individuals with higher parasympathetic activity and interoception were associated with higher levels of emotional regulation. This, therefore, shows the important role of vagal function and interoception in emotional regulation and mental health.</p><p>Vagal tone can be measured in a variety of different ways, all of which involve an electrocardiograph (ECG). A commonly used measure is heart rate variability (HRV), which measures the variability between each consecutive heartbeat, and is described more formally as measuring sequential R-R peaks in the QRS complex of an ECG measure Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology the North American Society of Pacing Electrophysiology <ref type="bibr">(1996)</ref>. HRV has been found to be a reliable indicator of psychosomatic functions that include emotional and behavioral regulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Laborde et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Pinna and Edwards, 2020)</ref>. The heart receives dual innervation from the ANS in the form of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and PNS. One of the common measures of this HRV construct is the frequency domain index, whereby the high frequency (HF) has been shown to provide a reliable index of vagal function <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(Thayer, 2009)</ref>. In addition to the HF index, HRV can be measured using a time domain index called the root mean square successive difference (RMSSDD), as well as the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) index, which provides a value of HRV in synchrony with the respiratory cycle. A high HRV measure indicates increased parasympathetic activity whereas lower HRV indicates lower parasympathetic and greater sympathetic activity.</p><p>One important observation is that HRV has been found to positively correlate with ISen in healthy individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Owens et al., 2018)</ref>. Interestingly, alexithymia has been found to negatively correlate with ISen but not IAc <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(Zamariola et al., 2018)</ref>. This link has been supported by another study, which showed that alexithymia was significantly negatively correlated with the dimensions of ISen as recorded by MAIA-2 (noticing, not-distracting, attention regulation, emotional awareness, selfregulation, body listening, and trusting body) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Edwards and Lowe, 2021)</ref>. Lower HF-HRV has also been found to be associated with higher alexithymia <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Lischke et al., 2018)</ref>, which is consistent with the ISen data, and indicates that these two indices are closely related (both abstracted from the vagal nerve).</p><p>In relation to autism, a recent meta-analysis showed that HRV in autism is lower at rest than healthy controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cheng et al., 2020)</ref>; however, ISen (when using the Porges Body Perception Questionnaire) was found to be higher in those with higher autism. For OCD, the results are more mixed.

Instead of simply concluding that higher or lower interoception is better or worse for mental health, rather a better distinction may be whether the interoceptive bodily awareness is adaptive or maladaptive <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Mehling et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Trevisan et al., 2021)</ref>.

However, one very interesting model of cardiac interoception is called the predictive coding model (or active inference), which suggests that the brain makes sense of multiple interacting streams of physiological interoceptive information by predicting their causes and generating prediction errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">(Seth, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barrett and Simmons, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barrett et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Seth and Friston, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Stephan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Owens et al., 2018)</ref>. This idea of psychopathology as a result of interoceptive error has been further developed by predictive coding frameworks.

The brain handles uncertainty (entropy) of new events and environments by integrating information and making rational use of it, through applying prior knowledge in the interpretation of new observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(O'Reilly et al., 2012)</ref>. In this case, their perception of the world corresponds to a negative perception which is consistent with their predictive (predictive coding) beliefs relating to their prior knowledge about the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Rief and Joormann, 2019)</ref>. This can include reinforced and derived failures that they have experienced in the world, and corresponding derived feelings of failure that they have made about themselves (their own concept of themselves).

It is assumed that as perceptual experience is shaped by the integration of stimulus information both incoming interoceptive and other sensory information and prior background information about the world, the ASD individuals' perception is modulated to perceive the world more biased through sensory information (i.e., in a more real way) and largely ignores prior information. This modulation of perception through sensory experience favors local (real world) perception over global (knowledge-based) perception.

This found that SAC mediated the association between some of the ISen subconstructs and mental health, so clearly it is linked. This also means that it is potentially linked to the predictive coding account, whereby lower SAC, and perspective-taking skills likely means greater predictive errors.</p><p>Given the following problems: (1) the lack of clarity from the DSM which assumes latent syndromes should form discrete categories and cannot explain why there is comorbidity between alexithymia, OCD, and autism; and (2) given that there seems to be a set of complex interactions between alexithymia, OCD, and autism in combination with SAC, psychological flexibility, and mental health, this study will seek to explore these in more detail. This study will therefore explore the complex causal sequences among ISen (interoception), mental health, psychological inflexibility, SAC, and how these relate to the conditions of OCD, alexithymia, and ASD. This will be done through constructing a conceptual model which will explore direct and indirect sequential causality through a structural equation modeling (SEM). Previous studies have largely explored associations with the use of standard regression modeling and related statistical approaches (such as analysis of variance, ANOVA). However, regression analysis is not well-suited for describing causal sequences where there are potentially complex interactions between the variables. Many variables can be added in a multiple regression model, which can make it more comprehensive, but it still does not show causal sequences. Path models such as SEM allow the chains of conditional relations to be explore; therefore, it is ideal for representing causal models and it allows for both confirmatory and exploratory modeling.</p><p>However, before a conceptual model is constructed, it needs to be developed in stages. Questions that must be asked are ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) what potential confounds should be controlled for? (2) What should the structure of the conceptual model look like? (3) Which of the variables should mediate, if any? To answer these, standard statistical approaches (ANCOVA, regression, and simple mediation will be used) given that the literature provides less clues as to what the overall structure of such a conceptual model which captures such complex causal sequences should look like. For this approach, there will be four main stages in informing the development of a conceptual model and SEM of direct and indirect causality between these variables, and these include the following:</p><p>(1) Exploring potential confounds to a conceptual model through exploring how age effects vagal functioning when controlling for body mass index (BMI), gender, and comparing HRV at different age groups. Though there is evidence that age does affect vagal functioning is affected by age <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">(Zhang, 2007)</ref>, this phase will explore this while controlling for gender and BMI. This will lay the foundation for demonstrating how vagal function (which ISen interoception is based on) may deteriorate as a result of natural aging (it is hypothesized that participants in the older groups will have lower HRV than the younger groups). This will, therefore, provide useful knowledge about whether this should be controlled for in the SEM.</p><p>(2) Backwards stepwise regression models will explore which variables are most predictive of alexithymia, OCD, and autism to inform stage 3. It is hypothesized that all subconstructs and total values of ISen, alexithymia, OCD, alexithymia, and age would predict autism; all subconstructs and total values of mental health, ISen, alexithymia, autism, psychological flexibility, and age would predict OCD; and all subconstructs and total of values mental health, ISen, autism, and OCD would predict alexithymia. SAC is not hypothesized to directly predict these outcomes as will more likely act as an indirect effect.</p><p>(3) Five independent simple mediation analyses will be conducted, whereby some of the outcomes in the final regression models (of stage two) will inform the mediation analyses to be made.

It is hypothesized that ISen self-regulation will mediate the association between OCD and autism, as well as alexithymia and depression.

Age was also negatively correlated with several of the ISen indices but did not correlate with either the alexithymia scale or OCD, suggesting that it is related specifically to autism (i.e., the older individuals were more likely to be autistic in this sample). SAC was negatively correlated with OCD, autism, and alexithymia scales. There was also a positive correlation among psychological inflexibility and OCD, autism, and alexithymia scales. Autism, OCD, and alexithymia all were negatively correlated with several of the ISen subscales, suggesting that their interceptive sensibility was low for these conditions. Autism, OCD, and alexithymia all positively correlated with several mental health (DAS-21) dimensions, suggesting that mental health issues were high in these conditions.</p><p>Tables <ref type="table">5</ref><ref type="table">6</ref><ref type="table">7</ref>show the outcomes of the three stepwise backwards regression models. Table <ref type="table">5</ref> specifically shows all of the variables (subscales were chosen instead of total scores where they were available) entered as predictors and regressed against autism as the DV. Here, the adjusted R 2 = 0.31, and the model was significant [F (6,217) = 17.51, p &lt; 0.001]. In the final step of the model, age (standardized beta coefficients expressed here, β = 0.18), gender (β = 0.13), OCD compulsion (β = 0.14), alexithymia DFF (β = 0.19), ISen attention regulation (β = -0.21), and ISen self-regulation (β = -0.17) were all selected.</p><p>For the second regression model (refer to Table <ref type="table">6</ref>), all of the variables (subscales were chosen instead of total scores where they were available) were entered into the regression model except for the two OCD subscales (obsession and compulsion), which were excluded as total OCD was the DV. Here, the adjusted R 2 = 0.43, and the model was significant [F (7,216) = 24.61, p &lt; 0.001]. In the final step of this model, age (β = 0.12), gender (β = -0.15), autism (β = 0.12), psychological inflexibility (β = 0.19), anxiety (β = 0.42), ISen not noticing (β = 0.18), and ISen self-regulation (β = -0.46) were all selected. For the third regression model (refer to Table <ref type="table">7</ref>), all of the variables (subscales were chosen instead of total scores where they were available) were entered into the regression model except for the three alexithymia subscales; DIF, DDF, and EOT which were excluded, whereby the DV was this time specified as total alexithymia. Here, the adjusted R 2 = 0.42, and the model was significant [F (6,217) = 27.49, p &lt; 0.001]. In the final step of this model, autism (β = 0.17), stress (β = 0.21), ISen not distracting (β = -0.20), ISen attention regulation (β = -0.20), ISen emotion awareness (β = 0.15), and ISen trusting (β = -0.29) were selected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediation models</head><p>A number of five separate mediation models were conducted, and these are displayed in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and stacked in a conceptual hierarchy. The structure of the mediation models was informed by both the literature and also the regression models performed previously. In the first, OCD (X) was explored as a predictor for autism (Y), and ISen self-regulation was chosen as a mediator (M). The direct association between OCD (X) and autism (Y) was significant [c = t (221) = 2.66, p &lt; 0.01, β = 0.17]. The direct association between OCD (X) and the mediator (M) ISen self-regulation was also significant [a = t However, as the variance of the direct path of X to Y did not reduce to zero after the mediator was added (i.e., the c' path), this indicated a partial mediating effect.</p><p>In the second mediation analysis, autism (X) was explored as a predictor for alexithymia (Y) and SAC was chosen as a mediator (M). The direct association between autism (X) and alexithymia (Y) was significant To indicate a mediation effect, the indirect path of X to Y via M was significant as confidence intervals at 95% did not cross zero [CI = 0.14, 0.59]. However, as the variance of the direct path of X to Y did not reduce to zero after the mediator was added (i.e., the c' path), this indicated a partial mediating effect.</p><p>In the third mediation analysis, alexithymia (X) was explored as a predictor for depression (Y) and ISen trusting was chosen as a mediator (M). The direct association between alexithymia (X) and depression (Y) was significant To indicate a mediation effect, the indirect path of X to Y via M was significant as confidence intervals at 95% did not cross zero [CI = 0.09 to 0.28]. However, this was a partial mediation as the variance of the direct path of X to Y did not reduce to zero after the mediator was added (i.e., the c' path).</p><p>In the fourth mediation analysis, ISen self-regulation (X) was explored as a predictor for SAC (Y) and psychological inflexibility was chosen as a mediator (M). The direct association between ISen self-regulation (X) and SAC (Y) was significant To indicate a mediation effect, the indirect path of X to Y via M was significant as confidence intervals at 95% did not cross zero [CI = 0.69 to 2.13]. However, this was a partial mediation as the variance of the direct path of X to Y did not reduce to zero after the mediator was added (i.e., the c' path).</p><p>In the fifth mediation analysis, SAC (X) was explored as a predictor for ISen trusting (Y) and psychological inflexibility was chosen as a mediator (M). The direct association between SAC (X) and ISen trusting (Y) was significant [c = t (221) = 8.65, p &lt; 0.001, β = 0.52]. The a path association between SAC (X) and the mediator (M) psychological inflexibility was also significant [a = t To indicate a mediation effect, the indirect path of X to Y via M was significant as confidence intervals at 95% did not cross zero [CI = 0.004 to 0.02]. However, this was a partial mediation as the variance of the direct path of X to Y did not reduce to zero after the mediator was added (i.e., the c' path).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SEM analysis</head><p>The first SEM was conducted to explore autism and mental health as two separate DVs. The first step in the process was to identify applicable latent variables. This was done first through exploratory factor analysis (EFA), whereby the Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy (KMO = 0.81) exceeded the desired cutoff score of 0.70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Kaiser, 1974)</ref>, indicating the data represented high sampling adequacy. Bartlett's test of sphericity [χ 2 (120) = 1677.08, p &lt; 0.001] was significant, indicating that the matrix was not an identity matrix, which means the variables are sufficiently related to one another, therefore, indicating that it is acceptable to use EFA. The communalities table which utilized maximum likelihood as the extraction method revealed that three items were smaller than 0.3, and these were EOT = 0.11, ISen not distracting = 0.09, and ISen not worrying = 0.19. Total variance loaded onto four factors, whereby the cumulative value of four factors equaled 54.79% of the variance, and goodness of fit was at an acceptable level and significant [χ 2 (62) = 158.01, p &lt; 0.001]. The pattern matrix demonstrated that EOT, ISen not distracting, and ISen not worrying were removed from the factor loading (as their communality extraction values were below 0.3 and therefore deemed too low). There were no cross-loadings, and the pattern matrix is illustrated in Table <ref type="table">8</ref>. The factor correlation matrix indicated that no factor loadings were &gt;0.7 and were, therefore, within an acceptable range.</p><p>Following the EFA, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted whereby the four variables groups created by EFA were converted into latent variables called mental health, alexithymia, OCD, and ISen. Covariance was then added between all latent variables and combinations (threshold for modification indices was set to 10 and the number of bootstrap samples was set to 1000). However, the initial CFA did not indicate a good model fit, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was &gt;0.1, and comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) were lower than 0.9. As a result of this, modification indices were checked and was the standardized residual covariance matrix table. Several ISen items were above a standardized residual covariance value of two and were removed with RMSEA, CFI, and TLI retested for fitness of model. Once high values were removed, only the item ISen selfregulation was maintained from the ISen latent variable and kept as a standalone direct measure of itself. "Anxiety" and "stress" were removed from the latent variable "mental health, " leaving depression as standalone direct measure of itself. All other items within the latent variables "alexithymia" and "OCD" were maintained. The final model fit indicated RMSEA = 0.30, CFI= 0.99, and TLI = 0.99 indicating an excellent fit. CFI and TLI values ≥0.95 and RMSEA values ≤0.08 indicate the data which are well fitting <ref type="bibr">(Hu and</ref><ref type="bibr">Bentler, 1998, 1999)</ref>. The acceptable range for the standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) index is between 0 and 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Hu and Bentler, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>The remaining conceptual model was tested within a SEM (refer to Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) (with 1000 bootstrap samples). SEM fits (through RMSEA, CFI, TLI, and SRMR) were explored. This model produced a model fit: [X 2 (df =13) = 15.19, p = 0.29], whereby this X 2 test indicates the extent to which the model covariance matrix deviates from the sample covariance matrix and tests that deviation against a null hypothesis of zero (i.e., it is not significantly different) <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Peugh and Feldon, 2020)</ref>. So, a non-significant finding here indicates that the proposed model is a good fit of the data (it is not significantly different from the representation of the data). In addition to this, RMSEA = 0.03, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.99; Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) = 0.99, GFI = 0.99, SRMR = 0.03. Alexithymia covaried with OCD (correlation values given, r = 0.39), with age (r = 0.06), with gender (r = 0.17); OCD covaried with age (r = 0.10), with gender (r = -0.09); and age covaried with gender (r = -0.11).</p><p>For direct effects, alexithymia was significantly positively associated with psychological inflexibility (reporting standardized beta coefficients) (β = 0.36, CI = [0.21, 0.52], p &lt; 0.001); alexithymia was also significantly positively associated with autism (β = 0.27, CI = [0.10, 0.49], p &lt; 0.001); alexithymia was not significantly associated with ISen self-regulation (β = -0.13, CI = [-0.31, 0.05], p = 0.11); OCD was significantly positively associated with psychological inflexibility (β = 0.39, CI = [0.24, 0.53], p &lt; 0.001); psychological inflexibility was significantly negatively associated with ISen self-regulation (β = -0.24, CI = [-0.41, -0.07], p &lt; 0.01). ISen self-regulation was significantly negatively associated with autism (β = -0.26, CI = [-0.39, -0.11], p &lt; 0.001). For control measures, age was significantly negatively associated with ISen self-regulation (β = -0.19, CI = [-0.29, -0.07], p &lt; 0.01]. Age was also significantly associated with autism (β = 0.22, CI = [0.12, 0.32], p &lt; 0.001). However, age was not significantly associated with psychological inflexibility (β = -0.  In the second SEM (refer to Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>), depression was added as a second DV in addition to autism, which also included adding SAC into the model to account for this. This model produced again a good model fit: [X 2 (df = 24) = 34.75, p = 0.07], RMSEA = 0.04, CFI = 0.99; TLI = 0.97. GFI = 0.97, SRMR = 0.03. Some of the beta coefficients change as a result of the new variables added while others remained the same. Alexithymia covaried with OCD (correlational values given, r = 0.39), with age (r = 0.06), with gender (r = 0.17); OCD covaried with age (r = 0.10), with gender (r = -0.09); and age covaried with gender (r = -0.11).</p><p>The standardized beta coefficients can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> in the graph model, sharing many of the same associations as the first SEM but with the addition of the SAC and depression scales (note that the addition of new variables resulted in different associations than the first SEM in some cases with different corresponding coefficients and confidence intervals). As such, for direct effects, alexithymia was significantly positively associated with psychological inflexibility (reporting standardized beta coefficients) (β = 0.36, CI = [0.21, 0.52], p &lt; 0.001); alexithymia was also significantly positively associated with autism (β = 0.27, CI = [0.10, 0.51], p &lt; 0.001); alexithymia was not significantly associated with ISen self-regulation (β = -0.08, CI = [-0.26, 0.11], p = 0.29). OCD was significantly positively associated with psychological inflexibility (β = 0.39, CI = [0.24, 0.53], p &lt; 0.001). Psychological inflexibility was no longer significantly negatively associated with ISen selfregulation (β = -0.08, CI = [-0.27, 0.08], p = 0.32) (this has been significantly associated in the first SEM, indicating indirect mediation effect of SAC). ISen self-regulation was significantly negatively associated with autism (β = -0.26, CI = [-0.39, -0.11], p &lt; 0.001). Novel to this SEM was the introduction of an association between psychological inflexibility and SAC which was significant (β = -0.51, CI = [-0.61, -0.39], p &lt; 0.001). Also, there was an association between psychological inflexibility and depression which was also significant (β = 0.60, CI = [0.51, 0.70], p &lt; 0.001); a significant association between SAC and depression (β = -0.14, CI = [-0.26, -0.01], p &lt; 0.05); and a significant association between SAC and ISen self-regulation (β = 0.36, CI = [0.21, 0.49], p &lt; 0.001). For control measures (age and gender), age was significantly negatively associated with ISen self-regulation (β = -0.21, CI = [-0.31, -0.09], p &lt; 0.001) and autism (β = 0.22, CI = [0.12, 0.32], p &lt; 0.001). However, age was not significantly associated with neither psychological inflexibility (β = -0.10, CI = [-0.19, -0.00], p = 0.06) nor SAC (β = 0.04, CI = [-0.07, 0.13], p = 0.52), nor depression (β = -0.03, CI = [-0.13, 0.07], p = 0.51). Gender was not significantly associated with neither ISen self-regulation (β = 0.06, CI = [-0.04, 0.17], p = 0.32), nor autism (β = 0.11, CI = [0.00, 0.21], p = 0.05), nor psychological inflexibility (β = -0.01, CI = [-0.11, 0.09], p = 0.88), SAC (β = -0.10, CI = [-0.23, 0.01], p = 0.08, nor depression (β = 0.05, CI = [-0.06, 0.12], p = 0.36).</p><p>In terms of mediating indirect effects, age was not indirectly associated with ISen self-regulation (β = 0.04, CI = [-0.01, 0.09], p = 0.09) (this had been a significant indirect effect in the first SEM). However, age was significantly indirectly associated with SAC via psychological inflexibility (β = 0.05, CI = [0.00, 0.10], p &lt; 0.05) and depression via psychological inflexibility and SAC (β = -0.07, CI = [-0.14, -0.01], p &lt; 0.05). There were significant indirect effects between alexithymia and SAC via psychological inflexibility (β = -0.19, CI = [-0.28, -0.10], p &lt; 0.01), alexithymia and ISen self-regulation via psychological inflexibility (β = -0.10, CI = [-0.21, -0.03], p &lt; 0.01), and alexithymia and depression via psychological inflexibility and SAC (β = 0.14, CI = [0.14, 0.36], p &lt; 0.01).

Within a graph theory approach, an exogenous parent variable is a source node with incoming connectivity equal to 0. They are also two types of endogenous variables called "connectors" with nonzero outgoing connectivity, and another called "sinks" which have no outgoing connections. There are three types of path diagrams in graph theory: (1) directed acrylic graphs (DAG) which use beta coefficients β jk , to give a magnitude to directed edges (k → j) within the graph., but all covariances are assumed null (ψ jk = 0); (2) covariance models in which only covariances have non-zero values and coefficients can only equal to zero (β jk = 0); (3) bow-free acrylic graphs (BAPs), which have acrylic directed edges (k → j), and bidirectional covariance relations (k ↔ j) only when the k-th and j-th variable do not share a directed edge, therefore, if β jk = 0 then ψ jk = 0.

For example, tree agglomerative hierarchical may be useful when dealing with complex multi-level networks, such as incorporating individual factors plus societal factors.</p><p>Several measures in this study were ACT consistent, such as psychological inflexibility and SAC. However, at more basic behavioral functional analytic level, relational frame theory (RFT) underpins these processes of change <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Hayes et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Blackledge, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barnes-Holmes et al., 2015)</ref>. This is a post-Skinnerian behavioral model for higher cognition, related to symbolic reasoning, and based on functional contextualism. It assumes that language can be thought of as patterns of generalized contextually controlled derived relational responding. It focuses on the role of context via contextual cues in facilitating the emergence of patterns of relating in which functions of stimuli become connected to these patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Hayes et al., 2001)</ref>. It assumes that relational responding can either be arbitrary or non-arbitrary. Non-arbitrary responding relates to basing responding on physical and actual features of the environment, whereas arbitrary applicable responding relates to responding being controlled by historical contextual cues. There are several patterns of arbitrary applicable responding, which include the following: coordination (e.g., stimuli x is equivalent to stimulus y), causation (IF, THEN), comparison (A is bigger than B), opposition (e.g., up is the opposite of down), distinction (e.g., C is not the same as D), hierarchy (e.g., a Labrador is a type of dog), and perspective-taking (deictic) involving the interpersonal (I vs. YOU), spatial (HERE vs. THERE) and temporal relations (NOW vs. THEN).</p><p>In total, three essential properties are important for relational frames to develop and to organize a network <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Torneke, 2010)</ref>: (1) mutual entailment (ME), relating one stimulus entails relating to a second stimulus; (2) combinatorial entailment (CE), relating a first stimulus to a second, and the second to a third, facilitates entailment between the first stimulus and the third;</p><p>(3) the last one is the transfer (or transformation) of stimulus function (ToF) whereby the functions (e.g., fear) of any stimulus that participates within a relational frame may be transferred or transformed in line with the relations that the stimulus shares with other stimuli also participating in that frame. The individual frames can network, forming complex networks of relational frames, and can even be relationally framed with other relationally framed networks (relating relational networks) (Barnes-Holmes et al., 2017) becoming infinitely complex. Idiographic approaches of PBT such as when collecting EMA data, longitudinally, are ideal for capturing such complexity of these relational networks and how they transform (ToF) over time.</p><p>This functional analytic level of RFT applied at an ideographic level in line with EEMM and PBT could further expand the graphs (depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>) utilizing community cluster networks. This could allow for basic level relational frame process of change properties, such as ToF to be mapped onto a PBT graph. Some works <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Smith and Hayes, 2022)</ref> have already explored this level of analysis with graphs, such as through implementing a graph model specific to RFT properties, such as ME bidirectionality. Such an approach could also allow for complex community networks (relations of relational frames) to be explored along with the traditional middle level ACT constructs of psychological flexibility and SAC. This may allow for an implementation of RFT community graphs as discussed in recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Edwards et al., 2022)</ref> and conceptually illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Each node represented as a set, and therefore giving graphs the ability to represent and update in real time ME or ToF from one community set to the next, could be possible and beneficial. For example, ToF can be represented as a combination of two sets as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">C func [C rel {AR x B and BR y C{B f1 Rp and C f2 Rq B|||A f3 }}]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Here → is used to show the direction of the ToF from one stimulus to another.</p><p>Where C func is a context that controls the ToF, C is a contextual relation, and f is a function, in this case "fear." Here, "A" is a neutral socializing event and is related to (R x ) you ("B") as you try to decide will attend the socializing event, and you ("B") are also related to (R y ) your own verbalself ("C, " a community network in itself which relationally frames many thoughts and feelings about yourself, and its dominated by fear, thoughts about failure, and low selfesteem). THEN you (B) become fearful ( f1 Rp ) of the social event (A) as the function of A (A f3 ) transforms from neutral to fear ( <ref type="formula">f2</ref>Rq ) (C→A ToF) as your feelings of failure about yourself, and fear, become mutually entailed (|||) with the social event, (as you think about failing in socializing at this event, and how scared you will be) which now shares the fear function A f3 of your verbal self (C f2 ). This leads the individual to decide to avoid the social situation (A), to prevent further pain of fear and failure thus causing the individual to isolate further.</p><p>These community networks of verbal self and the resultant avoidance behaviors (and their associated relational frames) not only act to transfer a fear function, but they act to reinforce one another. Low self-esteem and fear of the verbal self lead to a greater probability of avoidance (isolation from others due to ToF), and the resultant avoidance then further reinforces low self-esteem and fear of the verbal self (as you may tell yourself that you have again failed), which then increases the chances of further avoiding social events (and communicating more generally) in the future. This is called a negative feedback loop (or a self-reinforcing loop of maladaptation) in PBT <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Hayes and Hofmann, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Hofmann et al., 2021)</ref>. It is suggested that these should be identified and targeted with the correct interventions (ACT or CBT) (as seen in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> for an example) to undermine this negative feedback loop.</p><p>Such modeling at the level of the relational frame could ultimately give the PBT therapist very strong influence over the entire network, thus making them more able to influence processes of change at a basic functional contextual level, in a dynamic way which is consistent with EEMM. This approach is more relevant at the ideographic level as individuals each form their own unique relational networks through their unique learning histories.

The measure for this was HRV (HRV is closely correlated with the ISen interoceptive measures used in the questionnaires), and BMI and gender were added as covariates. There was a significant decrease in HRV given age, and this finding highlighted the importance of controlling the SEM for age, as it would likely be a significant control in the SEMs and having a direct effect on autonomic functioning (ISen interoception) within the network regardless of the autistic condition. Within the SEM, age was found to significantly affect both ISen self-regulation interoception and autism directly as expected, though the indirect effect between age and autism via ISen self-regulation interoception was non-significant.</p><p>The second part of the study's goal was to develop a conceptual SEM. However, the literature gave limited clues as to what the structure of the SEM should consist of (other than demonstrating there was much covariation between OCD, alexithymia, and autism). Recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Edwards and Lowe, 2021)</ref> had given some clues in how alexithymia relates to psychological inflexibility and SAC, but not in the cases of covarying OCD and autism. So, to explore this further, three linear (backward) regressions were explored, to first (in the first regression model) determine whether the measures of mental health, OCD, interoception (ISen), alexithymia, psychological inflexibility, and self-as-context predicted ASD as an outcome. The second regression model was used to determine whether the measures of mental health, OCD, interoception (ISen), autism, psychological inflexibility, and self-as-context predicted alexithymia. The third regression model was used to determine whether the measures of mental health, alexithymia, interoception, autism, psychological inflexibility, and self-ascontext predicted OCD. The outcomes in the final regression step models informed the third part of the study in terms of which variables were most likely to directly predict each of the three variables (OCD, alexithymia, and autism).</p><p>One problem with the regression models is that they only show direct associations and give no clues how the variables may indirectly associate with one another. In the third part of the study, five independent simple mediation analyses were conducted to give some clues about how these variables indirectly relate to one another. Here, some of the outcomes in the final regression models (of part two) informed the mediation analyses to be made. The first mediation analysis showed that ISen attention regulation partially mediated the relation between OCD and autism. The second mediation analysis showed that SAC partially mediated the relation between autism and alexithymia. The third showed that ISen trusting partially mediated the relation between alexithymia and depression. The fourth showed that psychological inflexibility partially mediated the relation between ISen attention regulation and SAC. The fifth showed that psychological inflexibility partially mediated the relation between SAC and ISen trusting. What is interesting about these mediation analyses is that at a hierarchical level (as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), psychological inflexibility seems to at least partially mediate all of the different relations at the highest hierarchical level. This provided some insights into a conceptual model, indicating that psychological inflexibility should be a key indirect pathway between the IVs (OCD and alexithymia) and DVs (autism and autistic-related depression).</p><p>In the fourth part of the study, the conceptual models for causal pathways were developed concretely, whereby IVs were identified as OCD and covarying alexithymia, while the DVs were autism (in model one) and autistic-related depression (in model two, with autism as a DV). These were tested through two SEMs, but before this could happen, the first steps were to utilize EFA and CFA to assign (explore then confirm) item variables to latent constructs where possible. However, when utilizing these factor analysis approaches items within the same questionnaire constructs did not always load well together. Items variables were removed from the latent variables when the standardized residual covariances were significantly different from the data to improve the overall SEM fit. This meant that items such as the many subsections of the ISen questionnaire did not fit well together in the context of the data and conceptual model and were removed when they did not. Once these were removed, the final first SEM that included autism only as a DV showed that alexithymia was directly significantly positively associated with autism and psychological inflexibility, but it (alexithymia) was not directly significantly associated with ISen self-regulation. Alexithymia was instead indirectly associated with ISen self-regulation via psychological inflexibility. OCD was not directly or indirectly associated with autism, but it was indirectly associated with ISen selfregulation mediated by psychological inflexibility. Psychological inflexibility was not directly associated with autism, but it was indirectly associated with it via ISen self-regulation. Gender was not a significant control, but age was a strong controlling variable (as expected given the data from the ANCOVAs). Age was directly associated (a direct control) to autism and was significantly negatively associated with ISen self-regulation directly and indirectly via psychological flexibility. Age was marginally outside of significance in its association (control) with psychological inflexibility directly.</p><p>In the second SEM, these findings were extended further, by including a second DV in the form of depression. Psychological inflexibility was directly associated with depression and indirectly associated with it via SAC, while SAC was directly associated with depression. Neither age nor gender has any direct associations with SAC or depression. Age was significantly indirectly associated with SAC via psychological inflexibility and depression via psychological inflexibility and SAC. There were also indirect effects between alexithymia and SAC via psychological inflexibility, alexithymia and ISen self-regulation via psychological inflexibility, and alexithymia and depression via psychological inflexibility and SAC. There was an indirect effect between OCD and SAC via psychological inflexibility, OCD and ISen self-regulation via psychological inflexibility, and OCD and depression via psychological inflexibility. There were indirect effects between psychological inflexibility and ISen selfregulation via SAC, psychological inflexibility, and depression via SAC, and between SAC and autism via ISen self-regulation.</p><p>Perhaps, the most important findings in this study are that the SEMs show the clear indirect causal association relation between alexithymia and OCD with autism. Though alexithymia and OCD shared a strong correlation with autism, the model confirmed that the best fit of the data were through an indirect causal association with autism, indirectly through psychological inflexibility and SAC and then indirectly through ISen self-regulation interoception. This indicates that there exists a complex relation between psychological flexibility and vagal nerve related interoception, and this is supported by an increasing number of evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Pinna and Edwards, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Edwards and Lowe, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">O'Brien et al., 2021)</ref>. This could even include connections with embodied knowledge of psychological flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Falletta-Cowden et al., 2022)</ref> as the ISen interoceptive measure used relates to confidence in embodied interoceptive signals. The findings also suggest that these complex associations are causally related to autism, and this is not captured in the current diagnostic DSM protocol. The SEMs show causally how alexithymia and OCD are comorbidly showing up with autism.</p><p>The findings also show that autistic-related depression is caused indirectly through psychological inflexibility and SAC, and there was no direct causal path between depression and autism (despite there being a strong correlation between depression and autism). Much of the causal pathway traffic in the associations between alexithymia and autism and its associated depression was via psychological inflexibility. The causal diagram shows psychological inflexibility to be a central gateway to the link between alexithymia and OCD with autism (which was predicted from the results of the mediational analysis, in the third part of the study given its hierarchical position), whereby ISen self-regulation bodily interoception is a secondary gateway for the link between alexithymia and OCD with autism severity specifically. SAC association with psychological inflexibility and autistic-related depression also seems a key secondary causal path gateway for the depression specifically. As SAC relates to perspective-taking skills, it seems likely that the onset of depression is linked to the lack of ability of ASD individuals to connect and communicate with others (for which perspective-taking skills is crucial). Building such perspective-taking skills may be a key and useful intervention in reducing depression in autism, given this nomothetic model.</p><p>This SEM path analysis helps to delineate the associations between alexithymia, OCD, and ASD more concretely. This highlights why these conditions cannot be taken as singular discrete categorical syndromes with an independent set of symptoms and underlying etiology which is treatable through a static protocol for treatment as specified by the DSM (American Psychiatric Association, 2013a). Instead, this study results support the claim that there is great comorbidity between these conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Kupfer et al., 2008)</ref> whether direct or indirectly. They also support the claim that any specified singular treatment protocol (such as what is specified by the DSM) would lack treatment specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Kupfer et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Insel et al., 2010)</ref>. Given such comorbidity, as seen in the casual diagram, any individual changes, or differences at any of the intersecting indirect pathways, could lead to quite different outcomes and have cascading effects. Therefore, a more dynamic and ideographic (individual level) process-based approach is likely to be more effective to access and initiate processes of change within then complexity, rather than a strict and rigid DSM protocol from treatment in treating individuals with autism.</p><p>This work supports the conclusions made by PBT and EEMM research advocates that suggest dynamic, longitudinal, and multi-level (e.g., biological and psychological) approaches are required to identify important change processes rather than singular protocols for syndromes <ref type="bibr">(Hayes and</ref><ref type="bibr">Hofmann, 2017, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Hofmann and Hayes, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Hofmann et al., 2021)</ref>. The SEM presented here (though nomothetic data) fits well with the EEMM as it emphasizes that autism is a multilevel condition. For example, it identifies that interoception (ISen self-regulation) fits well with both the individual level dimension of "attention" as it relates to noticing bodily feelings and the level of "physiology" as the vagal nerve carries bodily information to the brain and is processed in the insular cortex. SAC fits with the "self " dimension and psychological flexibility with the "cognitive" dimension at the individual level.</p><p>In relation to the theories of interoception more generally, interoception defined as a predicting coding error <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">(Seth, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barrett and Simmons, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barrett et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Seth and Friston, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Stephan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Owens et al., 2018)</ref> overcomes some of the issues with directional predictions typically associated with interoception. Higher ISen selfregulation interoception represents high confidence in the interoceptive signals, and therefore, this is consistent with the predictive coding theory, as low confidence should mean high prediction errors. This interpretation of interoception suggests that autism is a condition whereby there are high bodily prediction errors. To lower these predictive errors using the PBT EEMM approach, the "attentional" dimension may be an important domain (as illustrated in intervention point 4 of Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>), whereby engaging in exercises which promote mindfulness, noticing in the present moment, and awareness of feelings may lower interoceptive predictive errors and thus improve the autistic condition. Again, this would be most accurately done through ideographic assessments, such as EMA longitudinally overt time giving precise everchanging interoceptive predictive coding data within the complex network.</p><p>In relation to ASD, the predictive coding model explains why autistic individuals tend to focus on local information (ignoring contextual prior background knowledge) as it suggests that the predictive priors of contextual background information are weaker in ASD individuals when compared to healthy individuals, as observed in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Happé and Frith, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Mottron et al., 2006)</ref>. As such when developing a longitudinal EMA PBT study, we would expect to see contextual relational frame community clusters (as conceptually illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>) more heavily weighed to recent events. This would mean, for example, something recently learned, i.e., whereby a function in the network transfers from one stimuli of a cluster to the next (through ToF), then the impact would be greater for more local recent events than something learned further back in time. This would perhaps mean targeting the verbal self with a cognitive defusion intervention to undermine the negative feedback loop of avoidance (as illustrated in intervention point 1 of Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>) resultant from destructive verbal self-language (e.g., "I will fail"), thus preventing such negative transformations of functions. It could also mean targeting SAC with perspective-taking building skills to help the individual communicate and see others perspective (as illustrated in intervention point 2 of Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Crucially, it should mean targeting the key gateway of the network, psychological inflexibility such as through values orientation, mindfulness, openness to pain exercises, and cognitive defusion (as illustrated in intervention point 3 of Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</p><p>The advantage of the longitudinal approach advocated by the PBT developers <ref type="bibr">(Hayes and</ref><ref type="bibr">Hofmann, 2017, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Hofmann and Hayes, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Hofmann et al., 2021)</ref> is that this longitudinal and ideographic approach would allow therapists and researchers enough detail (data) to model these types of transformations of functions in real time and ideographically for each individual. Existing graph approach such as group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME) approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Gates and Molenaar, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Beltz and Gates, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Weigard et al., 2021)</ref>, which combines the elements of graph theory with SEM, is useful for modeling ideographic longitudinal EMA type data and is advocated by PBT researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Hayes et al., 2019)</ref>. However, these may be further developed in line with an ideographic version of what is proposed in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, which would help to account for dynamic and ongoing relational frame processes, such as ToF. This may be further helpful for clinicians and researchers alike and would allow for interventions to target and undermine these negative functions directly and affect the overall network at the level of the relational frame.</p><p>All studies include limitations. Questionnaire data in this study required participants to answer all questions, so this may have impacted attrition rates as some may have dropped out of the study due to frustration. Another limitation was that the data used here were solely cross-sectional nomothetic (population-based). However, PBT approaches are optimized when exploring longitudinal ideographic data, such as through EMA, therefore, it would be useful to explore this SEM in a longitudinal and ideographic way to see whether the model is still supported by the data. Finally, ideally, a physiological measure such as HRV would have supplemented the interoceptive measure greatly, though these are related.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated that autism is a complex and dynamic condition, which is not easily definable and is in part caused by alexithymia and OCD indirectly through psychological inflexibility, SAC, and interoception (ISen self-regulation). Though some of these associations are quite predictable such as covarying OCD with alexithymia, the novelty of this study was to capture the complex processes (psychological inflexibility, SAC, and interoception) that indirectly related to OCD, alexithymia, and autism. Further studies exploring the ideographic level and longitudinally may be able to generate more complex graphs that can model specific relational frame processes, such as ToF and dynamically in real time, which may greatly benefit both researchers interested in PBT and therapists utilizing this approach to support autistic individuals.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>higher autism.
