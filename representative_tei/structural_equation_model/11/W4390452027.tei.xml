<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Individuals start to be in need for various reasons from the moment they start to exist. The basis of these needs can be psychological or physiological. The inadequacy of individuals due to physiological or psychological needs is expressed as needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. In another expression, needs are the lack of the necessary conditions for individuals to maintain their development and to provide a harmonious relationship with their environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Among basic psychological needs, physical needs are the needs of the individual such as eating, drinking and sleeping. Psychological needs, on the other hand, are the needs of the individuals such as loving, being loved, being respected and self-actualisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Individuals' fulfilment of their basic psychological needs in the periods that they can spare for themselves outside working hours is thought to create a positive emotional state in individuals. In particular, it is believed that the satisfaction achieved as a result of meeting basic psychological needs will contribute positively to the individual's life satisfaction and play an essential role in forming a psychologically healthy situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. The concept of life satisfaction is a concept that varies according to the state of the difference that emerges as a result of comparing what the individual has achieved with what he/she wants to achieve <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. It can also be expressed as a holistic cognitive evaluation of an individual's life <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Life satisfaction covers the whole life of an individual and many different dimensions of this life. In other words, it can be said as satisfaction towards all experiences rather than satisfaction towards a certain situation. In addition to being expressed as the dominance of positive emotions over negative emotions in daily relationships, it also indicates the state of well-being in dimensions such as happiness, morale, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. Life satisfaction, which is defined as the whole quality of life and the level of positive development, also indicates satisfaction with one's life <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. As a result, life satisfaction can be expressed as the degree to which individuals' expectations from life are fulfilled. Life satisfaction should not be considered as a single satisfaction or time in an individual's life. Life satisfaction can also be expressed as a situation that is realised as the total of the situations encountered by the individual throughout his/her life. In other words, it can also be explained as the formation of an emotional state in which positive emotions in daily life prevail over negative emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p><p>The definitions and research have shown a relationship between life satisfaction and the fulfilment of basic psychological needs. If these needs cannot be fulfilled, some deficiencies and inadequacies may occur in individuals. In particular, in our study, individuals' own free time periods in working life or busy daily life, the fulfilment of basic psychological needs of some demographic variables and their contribution to life satisfaction were determined as the subject of study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Design</head><p>Our study, which was conducted according to the general screening model, was conducted with the relational screening method. The relational survey model was a research approach that explained the change of two or more variables together <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Group</head><p>The research group of this study consisted of physiotherapists working in Ankara in 2022. The data were sent to the participants via Google Forms and the volunteer participation was essential. In total, 260 participants were reached and 7 forms showing outlier values were not used in the evaluation, 253 forms filled in completely and accurately were used for analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection Tool</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personal Information Form</head><p>In the first part of the study, a personal information form consisting of four items was developed by the researchers was used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basic Psychological Needs Scale in Leisure Activity (BPNSLA)</head><p>The "Basic Psychological Needs Scale in Leisure Activity" developed by <ref type="bibr">Vlachopoulos and Mchailidou (29)</ref> and adapted into Turkish by Güneş (10) consisted of 12 items and 3 sub-dimensions (competence, autonomy and relatedness). The Basic Psychological Needs Scale in Leisure Activity was a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from "Completely Disagree" (1) to "Completely Agree" (5). Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient of the scales was reported to be between 0.73 and 0.80 in sub-dimensions and the total score <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. In our study, cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient for the scale was found to be 0.85. As a result of the CFA analysis, the 5th item with a factor load below 0.40 was excluded from the analysis, and as a result of the CFA analysis performed again, it was found that the values of the Fit Indices were χ2/df: 1,721, RMSEA: ,53, GFI: ,94, AGFI: ,91, CFI: ,95, SRMR: ,044. According to these results, it was concluded that all goodness of fit values showed excellent fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Life Satisfaction Scale (LSS)</head><p>The Satisfaction with Life Scale developed by Diener et al. ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) had a 7-point Likert-type rating between 1=strongly disagree and 7=strongly agree, consisting of five items and one dimension. High scores obtained from the scale indicated that the life satisfaction of the participant was high. In the exploratory factor analysis conducted during the development process of the scale, it was concluded that it explained 66% of the total variance. The cronbach alpha internal consistency coefficient of the scale was 0.87 and the test-retest reliability coefficient was 0.82. In the Turkish adaptation of the scale by <ref type="bibr">Köker (12)</ref>, the internal consistency coefficient was found to be 0.86 and the test-retest reliability coefficient was 0.73. In our study, cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient was found to be 0.51. As a result of the CFA analysis, the 5th item with a factor load below 0.40 was excluded from the analysis, and as a result of the CFA analysis performed again, it was determined that the Fit Indices values were χ2/df: 1,441, RMSEA: ,42, GFI: ,98, AGFI: ,92, CFI: ,92, SRMR: ,039. According to these results, it was concluded that all goodness of fit values showed excellent fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>The data obtained in this study were analysed in AMOS 21.0 and SPSS 25.0 package programmes. Statistically, percentage, frequency and reliability coefficient calculations were performed. Structural equation modelling (path) analysis was applied to look at the effect between variables. Independent sample t-test was applied in the analysis of binary variables and ANOVA test was applied in the analysis of more than two variables.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> showed the frequency table indicating the demographic characteristics of the physiotherapists who participated in the study. It was seen that male participants were in the majority in the gender variable (72,3%); those with 2-3 years of professional experience were in the majority in the professional experience variable (26,2%); single participants were in the majority in the marital status variable (77,9%) and participants with 16-20 hours of weekly leisure were in the majority (31,2%).  A model was created to investigate the effect of basic psychological needs in leisure activity on life satisfaction. As a result of the analysis, it was observed that autonomy, competence and relatedness did not have a statistically significant effect on life satisfaction (p&gt;0.05). Considering the beta values, an increase of 1 unit in the autonomy variable caused a non-significant decrease of -,537 in the negative direction (β: -,537 p&gt;0.05). An increase of 1 unit in the competence variable caused a non-significant increase of ,629 in the positive direction (β: ,629 p&gt;0.05). A 1-unit increase in the relatedness variable caused a non-significant increase of ,1142 in the positive direction (β: ,114 p&gt;0.05). This explained 1% of the change in life satisfaction (R 2 0.010).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>, according to the result of the ANOVA test between the participants' professional experience variables and Basic Psychological Needs in Leisure Activity and Life Satisfaction, a statistically significant difference was detected in the total score of Basic Psychological Needs in Leisure Activity, competence and relatedness sub-dimensions (p&lt;0.05). When we look at the Tamhane test conducted to determine the source of the difference, it was revealed that the scores of the participants with 1 year or less and 2-3 years of professional experience were higher than the scores of the participants with 6 years or more of professional experience in all three variables.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>, according to the results of the Independent Sample T-Test between the marital status variables of the participants and Basic Psychological Needs in Leisure Activity and Life Satisfaction, a statistically significant difference was detected in all variables except the autonomy sub-dimension of Basic Psychological Needs in Scale Leisure Activity (p&lt;0.05). It was concluded that the scores of single participants were higher than married participants in the total score of Basic Psychological Needs in Leisure Activity, competence and relatedness variables; and the scores of married participants were higher than single participants in life satisfaction scores.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>, according to the result of the ANOVA test between the participants' Weekly Leisure variables and Basic Psychological Needs in Leisure Activity and Life Satisfaction, a statistically significant difference was detected only in the autonomy sub-dimension of Basic Psychological Needs Scale in Leisure Activity (p&lt;0.05). When we look at the Tamhane test performed to determine the source of the difference, it was revealed that the scores of the participants with 16-20 hours of leisure per week were higher than the scores of the participants with 26-30 hours and 31 hours and more leisure per week.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</head><p>A model was created to investigate the effect of Basic Psychological Needs in Leisure Activity on life satisfaction. As a result of the analysis, autonomy, competence and relatedness did not show a statistically significant effect on life satisfaction (p&gt;0.05). In a study conducted by Çivitçi <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> with psychological counselling and guidance students, no difference was found between life satisfaction and autonomy sub-dimension, and in another study, it was stated that the increase in the autonomy sub-dimension score reflected positively on life satisfaction (3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>According to the Independent Sample T-test result between gender variables and Basic Psychological</head><p>Needs in Leisure Activity and Life Satisfaction, a statistically significant difference was detected in favour of male participants only in the variable of relatedness sub-dimension (p&lt;0.05). Özmaden et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, in their study with sports sciences students, concluded that as a result of the analysis between the leisure psychological needs of the participants and the gender variable, a situation occurred in favour of female participants in the autonomy sub-dimension. Yasul <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> concluded in a thesis study that there was no statistically significant difference in terms of gender variable in the Autonomy, Relatedness, and Competence sub-dimensions of the basic psychological needs scale. Sarı et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> reported that there was no significant difference between basic psychological needs in terms of gender. In another study, Waters et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> found that the scores of basic psychological needs of male individuals were higher than the total scores of female individuals. Moreover, Cihangir Çankaya (4) found that autonomy and competence needs did not show a significant difference in terms of gender, while the need for relatedness showed a significant difference in favour of females. When the studies were evaluated, it was seen that the results were different from each other. In the comparison between female and male teacher candidates by <ref type="bibr">Recepoğlu (19)</ref>, it was concluded that females had higher life satisfaction than males. In another study conducted by Liang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, no difference was detected in terms of gender variables in Japan, but in the same study, male participants in China and Korea had higher life satisfaction scores than female participants. When the studies were examined, the results showed differences and this difference was thought to be due to the demographic characteristics of the participants.</p><p>According to the result of the ANOVA test between the participants' professional experience variables and Basic Psychological Needs in Leisure Activity and Life Satisfaction, a statistically significant difference was detected in the total score of Basic Psychological Needs in Leisure Activity, competence and relatedness sub-dimensions (p&lt;0.05). When we look at the Tamhane test conducted to determine the source of the difference, it was revealed that in all three variables, the scores of the participants with 1 year and less and 2-3 years of professional experience were higher than the scores of the participants with 6 years and more professional experience. In the study conducted by Ünal <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>, it was concluded that experience did not affect life satisfaction. Gürer and Kılınç (9) found that there was no significant difference in the experience in their study on Basic Psychological Needs in Leisure Activity, but concluded that the mean scores were good. Toy <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> concluded that life satisfaction increased as the professional experience increased in the study on wrestler athletes. Our research findings differ from the findings of similar studies in the literature. In another study, it was reported that there was a significant positive relationship between sports experience and life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. Tabuk <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> found that there was a positive relationship between the duration of professional sportsmanship and life satisfaction.</p><p>According to the result of the ANOVA test between the participants' Weekly Leisure variables and Basic Psychological Needs in Leisure Activity and Life Satisfaction, a statistically significant difference was detected only in the autonomy sub-dimension of Basic Psychological Needs in Leisure Activity (p&lt;0.05). When we look at the Tamhane test performed to determine the source of the difference, it was revealed that the scores of the participants with 16-20 hours of leisure time per week were higher than the scores of the participants with 26-30 hours and 31 hours or more of leisure time per week.</p><p>According to the results of the Independent Sample T-Test between the marital status variables of the participants and Basic Psychological Needs in Leisure Activity and Life Satisfaction, a statistically significant difference was detected in all variables except the autonomy variable of the Basic Psychological Needs Scale in Leisure Activity (p&lt;0.05). It was concluded that the scores of single participants were higher than married participants in the total score, competence and relatedness variables of Basic Psychological Needs in Leisure Activity, and the scores of married participants were higher than single participants in life satisfaction scores. Ünal <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> concluded that the life satisfaction of married participants was higher than single participants in his study on deskbound working individuals. Ünal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> reported that being married was a factor that increased life satisfaction in their study on doctors. In another study, Linn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> reported that the life satisfaction of married individuals was higher than single individuals. Studies showed that being married had a positive contribution on life satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>As a result of the results obtained in the study, the following suggestions can be given:</p><p>The addition of participants who continue their lives in different regions, including various professional groups, may help to provide different levels of feedback in comparisons related to Basic Psychological Needs and Life Satisfaction in Leisure Activity.</p><p>Various informative studies can be performed for individuals to use their leisure more qualified and more consciously.</p></div>
