<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study was conducted to examine the relationship among university students' new media literacy, epistemic emotions, argumentativeness, online self-regulation learning, and online learning self-efficacy perceptions. An associational research design guided the study including structural equation modeling analysis. A total of 3395 students from a state university in Turkey participated in the study through online learning management system of the university during Covid-19 pandemic period. Five different Likert scales were utilized to collect data. Analyses showed that university students' self-efficacy perceptions and online self-regulated learning skills seemed to be effective on their epistemic emotions, argumentativeness and new media literacy skills. Also, participants' epistemic emotions partly predicted their argumentativeness and new media literacy skills. Considering these results, designing online learning environments respectful for university students' intellectual differentiation was suggested.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In the 21st century, issues such as organ transplantation, obesity, consumption of GMO foods, establishment of nuclear power plants, smart tools, cyborg applications, and the ways to protect against coronavirus are surrounding us. Individuals find themselves in these discussions through various media tools such as news channels, WhatsApp and Facebook. In the citizen typology that individuals should have in such environments, it is observed that individuals have to perform a series of actions such as accessing information and evidence sources using media tools, evaluating this information, adding content, affecting the opinions of others and respecting ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anagun, Atalay, Kilic, &amp; Yaşar, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chen, Wu, &amp; Wang, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Koc &amp; Barut 2016)</ref>. These chains of actions mentioned are collected under the concept of media literacy as an umbrella concept. The concept of media literacy, which is one of the popular literacy concepts of the 21st century, has once again made its importance felt in the recent pandemic process experienced by the world countries. Many citizens of the countries have reached local and global statistics about the pandemic, measures and sanction decisions taken by the countries, the types of pandemics that occurred in history, news and scientific content about Covid 19 and the discussions and suggestions of scientists through media tools during the pandemic process. Many countries have also managed to continue their citizens' education and training processes through different types of media tools and online systems. As it is stated by <ref type="bibr">Thoman and Jolls (2008, p. 42)</ref>, "Media no longer just influence our culture. They are our culture" and seem to continue.</p><p>In this case, it has now become an obligation for individuals to demonstrate practices such as accessing information, using evidence sources and evaluating them fairly, sharing their own knowledge, and being aware of their own identity and social values in creating media content through media tools, in brief to grow up as media literate individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen et al., 2011)</ref>. Because only media literate individuals will have characteristics that can make effective decisions in the media environments that include manipulative and propaganda elements along with correct and necessary information and can filter the contents in media. These structures have been recently discussed under the title of New Media Literacy (NML) in the literature due to some distinguishing features (e.g., media is not just consumption but production) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee, Chen, Li, &amp; Lin, 2015)</ref>. When NML's four main literacies, including Functional Consumption Literacy, Critical Consuming Literacy, Functional Prosuming Literacy, and Critical Prosuming Literacy, and its components under these literacies are examined, it can be concluded that the theoretical elements of NML are closely associated with the key concepts of educational psychology literature. Despite this relationship which is implicit and waiting for being discovered, it is observed that there is a limited number of NML studies and that there is a need for studies showing the relationship of NML with other variables in different contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Tugtekin &amp; Koc, 2020)</ref>. In this context, to reveal the cognitive and affective factors with which NML is associated may contribute to the literature. Therefore, in this study, it was aimed to examine the relationship of NML with the concepts of epistemic emotions, argumentativeness, selfregulation, and self-efficacy by structural equation modeling. The theoretical reasons for the selection of these concepts are presented in the following titles.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Self-Regulation</head><p>Self-regulation focuses on the fact that individuals are responsible for their own learning, can control their own learning processes, make regulations in the learning process when needed and motivate themselves throughout the learning life <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Zimmerman, 2000)</ref>. Self-regulated students can control their learning processes by developing metacognitive strategies such as planning, being organized and motivated <ref type="bibr">(Yukselturk &amp; Bulut, 2007)</ref>. Individuals with self-regulation skills are expected to manage their resources effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anderton, 2006)</ref>. These individuals are expected to keep their own learning process under control without needing for teachers and family <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Zimmerman, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The characteristics of self-regulated learners can be explained under three titles: metacognitive, behavioral and motivational <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gaskill &amp; Woolfolk-Hoy, 2002)</ref>. In this context, when self-regulation is considered in terms of learners, they are individuals with metacognitive characteristics, such as goal setting, planning, monitoring and evaluating their own learning process. From behavioral aspects, they have characteristics such as seeking help, organizing their own learning environment and realizing their own reinforcement in learning. Motivationally, they are self-confident and self-aware individuals who are aware of the responsibility of learning outcomes.</p><p>Self-regulated learning also refers to students' systematic efforts to manage learning processes to achieve their goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pintrich, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zimmerman &amp; Schunk, 2011)</ref>. Self-regulated learning is usually described in the context of the integration of motivation, emotion and learning strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abar &amp; Loken, 2010)</ref>. Students who have self-regulation skills in terms of motivation tend to gain competence by specializing in what they do <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pintrich, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zimmerman, 2011)</ref>. The studies indicate that motivation and emotion, which are among the components of self-regulation, significantly affect the student's learning experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cho &amp; Heron, 2015)</ref>. The metacognitive, motivational and behavioral characteristics of successful online experiences under the control of online learners should be examined to observe this effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Shea &amp; Bidjerano, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Self-Efficacy</head><p>Self-efficacy is individuals' beliefs about how well they can do the necessary actions to deal with possible situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bandura, 1977)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zimmerman (1995)</ref> defined self-efficacy as the judgment of an individual about his/her ability to perform and achieve a job. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Pajares (2002)</ref>, self-efficacy is the key concept of Social Cognitive Theory, which defends that individuals need to have self-confidence before they can use their skills effectively. When this concept is considered in terms of online learning, it can be defined as an individual's belief in his/her ability to organize and execute the related actions to perform online tasks or activities.</p><p>Alqurashi (2016) examined self-efficacy studies in terms of online learning. According to the study the issue is addressed multidimensionally by being not only limited to computer, internet and information seeking skills would make significant contributions to the literature, while revealing the relationships between self-efficacy and online learning. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Shea and Bidjerano (2010)</ref> indicated that self-efficacy is a component of self-regulation, which has a great structure in understanding success in online learning environments.</p><p>Furthermore, some studies argue that self-efficacy can be a key component of academic achievement in online learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hodges, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Shen, Cho, Tsai and Marra (2013)</ref> indicated that self-efficacy was also associated with students' previous online learning experiences and gender, apart from success in online learning. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Zimmerman and Kulikowich (2016)</ref> also stated that students with a high level of online learning self-efficacy are more likely to be successful in online classes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lim (2001)</ref> indicated that students' computer self-efficacy had a significant effect on their satisfaction and their thoughts about attending online courses in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">New Media Literacy</head><p>Along the spread of media tools such as smartphones, tablets, twitter and facebook, individuals have reached a position in which they not only consume the media but also produce. These new technological tools, which are developed and reached individually, have constituted a new phenomenon that appears in the form of new media. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Koc and Barut (2016)</ref> state that NML is a relatively new phenomenon and define it as a combination of socio-cultural environments created by network technologies, in which any message is digitally generated and distributed by any user. Unlike traditional media literacy, individuals experience a process in which they create, analyze and evaluate their knowledge and content in these socio-cultural environments. In this context, NML includes basic process skills such as access, analysis, evaluation, criticism, production and/or participation in media content <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lee et al., 2015)</ref>. Therefore, in the 21st century, individuals should be raised as individuals with NML who comprehend the technical and socio-cultural characteristics of the new media, unlike classical literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen et al., 2011)</ref>. In their study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chen et al. (2011)</ref> unpacked the NML, and they based this concept on three main mottos. As a result of these three main mottos, including "From Consuming to Prosuming Media Literacy", "From Functional to Critical Media Literacy" "From Computer Literacy to New Media Literacy", <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chen et al. (2011)</ref> proposed a conceptual framework for NML consisting of (a) functional consuming, (b) functional prosuming, (c) critical consuming and (d) critical prosuming literacies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lin, Li, Deng, and Lee (2013)</ref> revised this framework by justifying that this quadruple structure roughly depicts NML and that this structure is unable to distinguish between cultural environments served by some technological tools (Web1 and Web2). After this new framework, they defined the NML which consisted of ten components under the titles of (a) functional consuming, (b) functional prosuming, (c) critical consuming and (d) critical prosuming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accordingly, NML includes specific skills such as</head><p>• creating media content by critically understanding a series of technical skills (Consuming Skill) required to consume media content and understanding the meaning of media content at the text level under the functional consuming literacy,</p><p>• being able to structure media messages on their own (analysis), significantly sampling and rearranging media content (synthesis), questioning, criticizing and appealing the reliability of media content (evaluation) within the context of critical consuming literacy, • a set of technical skills (prosuming skill) required to produce/create media content, activities for distributing the available information (distribution), increasing (partially or completely) or mixing (production) media contents within the context of functional prosuming literacy, • interactive and critical participation in the media (participation), socio-cultural values and ideology issues within the context of critical prosuming literacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Epistemic Emotions</head><p>Epistemic emotions are related to the knowledge-producing qualities of cognitive tasks and activities <ref type="bibr">(Brun, Doguoglu, &amp; Kuenzle, 2008)</ref>. Knowledge and the production of knowledge in terms of epistemic emotions are the objects of emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pekrun, Vogl, Muis, &amp; Sinatra, 2017)</ref>. In brief, individuals' knowledge and the emotions they feel during the acquisition of knowledge can be called epistemic emotions. These emotions generally reveal themselves during cognitive congruity and cognitive incongruity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Muis et al., 2015)</ref>. However, the factor to take into account here is that cognitive congruity or incongruity does not only arouse epistemic emotions, it may also trigger other emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pekrun et al., 2017)</ref>. The distinctive factor here is the focus of emotion. For instance, a student's disappointment on failure to find a correct solution to the math problem is considered an epistemic emotion if it is focused on cognitive incongruity caused by unresolved problem. However, the student's disappointment is considered a sense of achievement if the focus is on personal failure and failure to solve the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pekrun et al., 2017)</ref>. In general, individuals have epistemic beliefs that they are familiar with knowledge and the acquisition of knowledge. When individuals encounter a situation that contradicts their epistemic beliefs, negative emotions are triggered in them, while positive emotions arise in case of epistemic equilibrium. These positive (e.g., enjoyment, curiosity) and negative epistemic emotions (e.g., anxiety, frustration) are effective in maintaining or abandoning a behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Muis et al., 2015)</ref>. In this context, cognitive congruity and incongruity that individuals encounter in new media environments with regard to their epistemological beliefs may trigger individuals' positive and negative emotions about obtaining knowledge, which may enable individuals to choose different strategies in media environments. For instance, in the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Muis et al., (2015)</ref>, it was found that epistemic emotions were effective in choosing deep or shallow processes strategies in learning processes. Therefore, epistemic emotions can be an effective parameter on individuals' media literacy levels and this relationship is worth exploring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Argumentativeness</head><p>Individuals have different orientations during argumentation processes. While some individuals tend to argue (argument approach) during discussions, others tend to avoid (argument avoidance) discussion. This individual tendency that individuals adopt for argumentation is defined as the concept of argumentativeness in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Infante &amp; Rancer, 1982)</ref>. Argumentativeness is an individual's disposition and explains the attitudes adopted by individuals in the discussion. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Infante and Rancer (1982)</ref>, the reason for this individual feature is closely associated with the emotions that individuals have during the discussion. While some individuals consider the argumentation process as an exciting intellectual activity and exhibit an argument approach attitude, some individuals move away from the argumentation through the discussion itself and the negative emotions they have during the argumentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Infante &amp; Rancer, 1982)</ref>.</p><p>Recent studies include important evidence of the relationship between the concept of argumentativeness and epistemological belief <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Nussbaum &amp; Bendixen, 2003)</ref> epistemic emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bahcivan, 2019)</ref> and selfregulation skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Yavuzalp &amp; Bahcivan, 2021)</ref>, although their number is limited. For instance, in a study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bahcivan (2019)</ref>, it was concluded that advanced epistemological beliefs triggered positive epistemic emotions and that these emotions predicted whether individuals participate in argumentation. In that study, a sophisticated epistemological belief also directly affected the attitude of being argument approach. In another study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Demirbag (2021)</ref> concluded that the development of metacognitive-self regulation skills positively predicted being an argument approach. As can be seen, the concept of argumentativeness is closely associated with other main concepts (self-regulation, epistemic emotions) selected for this study.</p><p>When it is considered in the context of NML, new media tools developed today support the tasks of individuals to create their own products, share them, reflect their social values and identity, and even their ideology. In such environments, individuals share their ideas, open them to the criticism of others and experience a socio-cultural discussion environment. The argument approach or avoidance in such an environment may affect the attitude that individuals adopt in media environments. While individuals who are inclined to discussion consider discussion as an exciting activity and exhibit practices such as creating their own arguments, seeking evidence and problem solving using new media tools related to challenge or conflict issues, individuals with an avoidance attitude may prefer a passive position away from discussion in media environments. Therefore, this individual feature may be effective in predicting the level of media literacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The Proposed Model and Hypotheses</head><p>As can be seen, NML theoretically consists of four main titles and ten components. When the studies are examined, it can be said that the concept of NML is a relatively new concept, and perhaps for this reason, the number of studies examining this concept is considerably limited. Therefore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tugtekin and Koc (2020)</ref> pointed to this situation and examined the NML's relationship with communication skills and democratic tendencies by indicating the need for new studies aimed at developing the scale related to NML, determining the NML levels of individuals and investigating the effects of NML on social and political life, apart from the conceptual structure of NML. In our opinion, despite these enterprising efforts, it is necessary to increase the number of studies on NML and to reveal other variables related to its theoretical background.</p><p>In particular, according to the literature search we conducted, the relationship of NML with the main keywords in the field of educational psychology is waiting to be discovered.</p><p>In this sense, it is highly important to reveal cognitive and affective variables that affect NML. Revealing the relationship of NML with these concepts will contribute to understanding which parameters should be changed and what kinds of interventions should be made to improve NML in the whole picture. Therefore, in this study, it was aimed to test the relationship of NML with the concepts of epistemic emotions, argumentativeness, self-regulation, and self-efficacy by the structural equation modeling.</p><p>In the selection of these concepts, the concepts with which the different dimensions included in NML are (probably) associated, even if NML is not directly associated with them were selected. For instance, according to some researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen at al., 2011)</ref>, it is known that the concept of digital literacy in the content of NML is intertwined with epistemological beliefs (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gunes &amp; Bahcivan, 2018)</ref> self-regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Perera, Gardner, &amp; Peiris, 2016)</ref> and self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Prior et al., 2016)</ref>. We also have evidence indicating that these concepts are associated with epistemic emotions and argumentativeness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bahcivan, 2019)</ref>. These indirect relationships triggered the idea of discussing these variables together with NML as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, the theory of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rokeach (1968)</ref>, which is one of the strong theoretical frameworks of educational psychology literature, was used to determine the theoretical relations of the main concepts and to establish the proposed model presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. According to this theory, individuals' behaviors and practices are fed by a belief system that is layered from a central core structure to the surface (from Type A to Type E) and leaks between each other, as in an atomic model. Accordingly, since the variables related to self (self-efficacy and self-regulation) are accepted between Type A and B beliefs, they are among the most central beliefs of the belief system and shape all other belief types. Furthermore, Type C beliefs are called authority beliefs and include beliefs about the source of knowledge. From this point of view, Type C beliefs can be associated with epistemological beliefs. In this study, epistemological beliefs were represented by emotions based on the result that they predicted epistemic emotions strongly <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bahcivan, 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rokeach (1968)</ref> defined a cumulative relationship from the very center to the surface. In this case, Types A and B beliefs should predict Type C. Furthermore, it should be accepted that everything that Type C predicts is predicted by Types A and B.</p><p>The NML and argumentativeness variables in this study are not among the belief types indicated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rokeach (1968)</ref>. These variables can be considered as knowledge and skill-focused variables surrounded by belief systems. As it was previously demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bahcivan (2019)</ref>, argumentativeness has a very close relationship with epistemic beliefs since it is directly knowledge focused, in other words, it is the way of knowing. On the other hand, NML appears as a comprehensive type of literacy affected by both ways of knowing skills and various belief types. In this context, it can be indicated that argumentativeness is a structure that is affected by epistemic emotions and is closer to epistemic beliefs, while NML is a larger structure that is affected by all the variables mentioned here. Therefore, within this theoretical framework, argumentativeness appears as a variable that also affects NML. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The Problem Statement</head><p>Considering the purpose and the proposed model presented above, this study was conducted to respond the following research problem:</p><p>• What are the structural relations among university students' online learning self-efficacy perceptions, online self-regulated learning skills, epistemic emotions, argumentativeness and new media literacy skills?</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Participants</head><p>3395 university students studying at state university participated voluntarily in the study. A convenience sampling was applied to reach maximum number of participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Creswell, 2008)</ref>. The distribution of participants in terms of certain demographic properties was represented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Accordingly, students' ages were mostly observed between 19-26 (M=22.29 and Sd=3.79). Most of participants were faculty students (77.8%). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">The Questionnaire</head><p>It involved 5 scales measuring participants' scores related to the variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online Self-Regulated Learning Scale</head><p>This scale was firstly developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lan, Bremer, Stevens and Mullen (2004)</ref> to measure university students' self-regulation skills in online learning environments. The scale originally included 86 five-point (from 1 for completely disagree to 5 for completely agree) Likert items distributed to 6 dimensions labeled as goal setting, environment structuring, task strategies, time management, help seeking and selfevaluation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barnard, Paton and Lan (2008)</ref> validated a short version of this scale which included 24 items. This short version of the scale adapted into Turkish by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kilis and Yildirim (2018)</ref> with a sample of 321 university students. These researchers validated the instrumentation results with confirmatory factor analysis and reported acceptable fit indices (χ2/df=2.45, CFI=0.90, TLI=0.89 and RMSEA=0.06) as well as alpha reliability scores between 0.67-0.87. In this study, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (n=3395) and found acceptable fit indices for the statistical model (χ2/df=11.76, CFI=0.97, TLI=0.96 and RMSEA=0.06). Alpha reliability scores were observed as 0.94, 0.94, 0.87, 0.89, 0.86 and 0.88 respectively for goal setting, environment structuring, task strategies, time management, help seeking and self-evaluation dimensions. Also, factor loading values (standardized regression weights) were observed between 0.74-0.91. Therefore, this scale was utilized to produce valid and reliable testing results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online Learning Self-Efficacy Scale</head><p>The scale was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Zimmerman and Kulikowich (2016)</ref> to measure university students' selfefficacy perceptions in online learning environments. It originally involves 22 five-point (from 1 for completely disagree to 5 for completely agree) Likert items distributed to three factors labeled as learning in the online environment, time management and technology use. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Yavuzalp and Bahcivan (2020)</ref> adapted the scale into Turkish with a sample of 2087 university students and reported a one factor solution covering 21 items considering the exploratory factor analysis results.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Epistemic Emotions Scale</head><p>This scale was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pekrun, Vogl, Muis and Sinatra (2017)</ref> to measure university students' epistemic emotions. It originally involves 21 five-point (1 for not at all and 5 for very strong) Likert items distributed to 7 emotions (factors): curiosity, surprise, anxiety, enjoyment, confusion, frustration and boredom. Each emotion was represented with three adjectives in the scale. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bahcivan (2019)</ref> adapted the scale by exploratory factor analysis with a sample of 612 university students. The analysis resulted with a two-factor solution: positive emotions (5 items) and negative emotions (8 items). Alpha reliabilities were also reported as 0.74 and 0.85. In this study, we validated scaling results with a confirmatory factor analysis (n=3395) which resulted in acceptable fit indices (χ2/df=23.52, CFI=0.95, TLI=0.94 and RMSEA=0.08). Alpha reliability scores were calculated as 0.88 and 0.93 respectively for positive and negative emotion dimensions. Factor loading values were observed between 0.62 and 0.84. Considering these results, it can be claimed that this scale produces valid and reliable results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Argumentativeness Scale</head><p>The scale was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Infante and Rancer (1982)</ref> to measure university students' argumentativeness. It involves 16 five-point (from 1 for completely disagree to 5 for completely agree) Likert items which are equally distributed to 'argument approach' and 'argument avoidance' factors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bahcivan (2019)</ref> previously adapted the scale into Turkish with a sample of Turkish university students and reported 0.79 and 0.80 alpha reliability scores for each dimension. In this study, a confirmatory factor analysis (n=3395) was conducted for validation. Accordingly, statistical model had acceptable fit indices (χ2/df=14.19, CFI=0.96, TLI=0.95 and RMSEA=0.06). Alpha reliability scores were calculated as 0.93 and 0.91 respectively for argument approach and argument avoidance dimensions. Also, factor loading values were observed between 0.69-0.85. Therefore, it was decided that the scale would produce valid and reliable results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New Media Literacy Scale</head><p>This scale was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Koc and Barut (2016)</ref> to measure university students' media literacy skills.</p><p>The scale is composed of 35 five-point Likert items distributed to 4 factors: functional consumption, critical consumption, functional presumption and critical presumption. The researchers conducted factor analyses for validation and reported good fit indices (SRMR=0.050, RMSEA=0.049, GFI=0.89, CFI=0.98 and NFI=0.97). They also reported Cronbach alpha reliability scores as 0.85, 0.87, 0.89 and 0.93 respectively for functional consumption, critical consumption, functional presumption and critical presumption. In this study, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (n=3395) for validation and found acceptable fit indices (χ2/df=23.33, CFI=0.94, TLI=0.93 and RMSEA=0.08). Alpha reliability scores were observed between 0.97-0.98 for all the factors. Factor loading values of each item were also observed between 0.82-0.93. Therefore, according to validation results, this scale was accepted to produce valid and reliable results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Data Collection Process</head><p>Data collection process was realized through learning management system of the university so that participants responded to the scales through online learning mediums. This process comprised of three sessions. In the first session, participants were requested to reply for online learning self-efficacy and epistemic emotions scales. The second session was realized two weeks later to collect data for online selfregulated learning and argumentativeness scales. Two weeks later, the last session was conducted to reply for the new media literacy scale. Participants were informed about the variables and data collection processes at the beginning of each session. If they selected to participate voluntarily, they were not allowed to leave any item unanswered. After the last session, the data of the participants, who responded to all scales, were combined in the dataset file. This file also involved participants' demographic variables which were provided automatically by the learning management system of the university. All the data was collected solely for this research study during Pandemic session (April-May 2020).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Data Analysis</head><p>Data analyses included two steps. The first step was realized for validation. Confirmatory factor analysis was preferred to produce evidence for validation, because, all the scales were previously adapted into Turkish and/or utilized with a sample of Turkish university students <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2013)</ref>. Reliability of scaling results were examined by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficients with SPSS. The second step of data analyses was conducted by structural equation modeling (n=3395) for responding the research problem of the study. Both confirmatory factor analyses and structural equation modeling analyses were conducted with AMOS program. In these analyses, fit index values were examined to check fit of data to the model. Among them, 'χ2/df' is critically important; however, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kline (2016)</ref> states that chi-square test is very sensitive to sample size. Therefore, high number of participants in the sample may be responsible for high value of 'χ2/df' in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Result and Discussion</head><p>A structural equation modeling analysis was conducted to examine the possible connections among university students' online learning self-efficacy perceptions, online self-regulated learning skills, epistemic emotions, argumentativeness and new media literacy skills. Analyses yielded a model (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) holding acceptable fit indices (χ2/df=7.59, CFI=0.91, TLI=0.90 and RMSEA=0.04). Complex relationships among the variables of the study get lowered clarity in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Therefore, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> was prepared to represent all the relationships among these variables. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> demonstrated also level of significance for these standardized regression weights (β). As can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, most of the proposed relations were observed in the statistical model. In general, university students' self-efficacy perceptions seemed to be effective on their epistemic emotions, argumentativeness and new media literacy skills. A very similar result was also handled for participants' online self-regulated learning skills. However, results also showed that participants' self-regulation skills under goal setting and environment structuring dimensions were not related to their new media literacy skills. Just a limited number of relationships were observed between self-regulated learning skills, classified under goal setting and environment structuring, and other variables of the proposed model. In addition, results showed that the relationship between positive epistemic emotions and other variables seemed limited in terms of amount. Positive epistemic emotions were just positively related to argument approach. Whereas negative epistemic emotions significantly related to all dimensions in argumentativeness and new media literacy skills. Finally, results showed that both dimensions of argumentativeness were significantly related to all dimensions of new media literacy. The results of this study are mostly coherent with previous findings and theoretical approaches in the literature. For example, self-regulation and self-efficacy beliefs, labeled as Types A and B beliefs, predicted epistemic emotions (Type C) as Rokeach (1968) stated. Also, epistemological emotions were significantly related to argumentativeness. Similar findings were declared by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bahcivan (2019)</ref>. When the results on NML are examined, while argument approach positively predicts all components of NML, argument avoidance negatively predicts all components of NML. This is an expected result according to the clues we obtained from certain research studies, although there is no study directly on these two variables. Because, when it is examined carefully, it will be observed that the strategies such as questioning, evaluating and criticizing sources of evidence, which are frequently used in argumentation environments by the individuals who are inclined to argue, are closely associated with NML <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lee et al., 2015)</ref>. Furthermore, individuals with argument approach participated in the discussion through new media and exhibited their own ideas, which may have positively predicted their new media literacy features. Similarly, NML levels of those with avoidance attitude may therefore be negatively predicted. Because many studies showed that new media environments are positively related to the communication abilities and democratic engagement that can be considered to be closely associated with the discussion action <ref type="bibr">(Kim &amp; Yang, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tugtekin &amp; Koc, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>When the relationship between epistemic emotions and NML is examined, negative epistemic emotions predicted NML negatively, which is also an expected result, although it is not a study directly based on these two concepts. Because negative epistemic emotions generally trigger shallow learning processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Muis et al., 2015)</ref>. Furthermore, negative epistemic emotions are triggered by naive epistemological beliefs. Naive epistemological beliefs negatively predict digital literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen et al., 2011)</ref>, which can be considered as one of the sub-components of NML <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gunes &amp; Bahcivan, 2018)</ref>. The data obtained from these studies confirmed the result we found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions and Implications</head><p>In conclusion, considering the results and the discussions presented above, it can be stated that university students' beliefs about self, epistemic emotions and argumentativeness are effective on their NML skills. Therefore, it can be suggested that online learning environments respectful for intellectual differentiations can be arranged and implemented for university students. Online learning environments may affect university students' beliefs about self positively so their NML skills. Following researchers should conduct research studies to examine the possible effects of such learning environments on NML skills via experimental designs. These learning environments may also involve digital technologies related to argumentation focused pedagogies. These technologies and learning experiences handled through them will most probably be effective on students' argumentations skills positively. According to the results of the study, argument approach students presented better literacy skills related to new media in comparison to argument avoidance students. Therefore, argumentation focused pedagogies should be implemented in university learning mediums.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
