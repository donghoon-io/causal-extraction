<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Entering the industrial revolution era 4.0, MSMEs are required to have products with special characteristics, unique and different than other competitors. Therefore, MSMEs can develop its local wisdom as Competitive Advantage and create a market with its own characteristics. So that competition in this case is no longer related to "excellence" but "related to efforts to create and maintain product uniqueness". To be competitive does not mean to win by eliminating competitors, but because of the element of difference and worthy of juxtaposition without turning off the opponent's product. The sampling technique uses Convenience Sampling. The samples are 300 MSMEs. Data analysis uses the Structural Equation Model program. The results of this research indicate Organizational Learning Capability and Organizational Innovation have a positive and significant effect on the Competitive Advantage and Competitive Advantage has a positive and significant effect on the Business Performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT</head><p>Organization Learning Capabilities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Spott, (2015)</ref> innovation is part of organizational learning, some research that shows the relationship between innovation and learning ability. Previous research stated that empirically companies were motivated to engage learning abilities in improving the performance of technical innovation. However, there is no detailed research related to the effect of organizational learning capacity on non-technical innovation.</p><p>While the research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Moustaghfir and Schiuma (2013)</ref> shows different results, namely the external relational learning capacity and internal relational learning capacity are significantly influence the intensity of non-technical innovation.. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">King (2009)</ref> learning ability can support organizational innovation through different channels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cross and Sam (2009)</ref> Quality management practices and organizational learning are complementary tools. <ref type="bibr">Chen et.al (2009)</ref>, the formation of external relations supported by organizational learning". Based on the explanation above, we propose the following hypothesis: H1: Organization Learning Capabilities has a positive and significant effect on Organizational Innovation.</p><p>Organizational Innovation. According to Camisón and Villar, 2010 innovation is the core and main source of competitive advantage, while in other case Competitive advantage can be created by implementing corporate value creation strategies that are still not used by major competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Howard and Marshall, 2012)</ref>. While in other opinion <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Walker (2009)</ref>, stated that competitive advantage is related to a company's dynamic ability to innovate, adapt and maximize its resources and capabilities. Bansemir, (2013) Organizational innovation implements a specific system that can help companies; this system involves various kinds of relationships and participants among the people involved in the organization. <ref type="bibr">"Walker et.al, (2010)</ref> analyzed the relationship between innovation and company performance, finding supportive results". While previous studies do not provide clear conclusions about the relationship between organizational innovation and competitive advantage. Organizational innovation is a factor that leads to superior performance. Instead, the research discusses the concept of competitive advantage and examines the effect of organizational innovation on competitive advantage, which usually considers organizational innovation as a part of broader latent construction that also includes the product and process innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Nandram, 2014)</ref>. From the discussion above, we propose the following hypothesis: H2: Organizational Innovation has a positive and a significant effect on Competitive Advantage.</p><p>Competitive Advantage. There are changes related to the process of value creation, because changes are related to the competitive ability of intangible physical forms, based on the activities and knowledge of the company. Competitiveness is determined by scarce, valuable and difficult to imitate resources in an organization, so that competitiveness is not created by technology, economies of scale and natural resources, because if guided by those factors, the impact of competitiveness is easier to imitate <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">( Shams, (2013)</ref>. Shams, (2013) defines competitive advantage as the ability to generate investment returns continuously above the industry average, and that competitive advantage can be achieved by implementing a value creation strategy that is not implemented by other competitors. Research conducted by McGrath, (2013) concluded that intellectual capital has a positive and significant effect on competitive advantage and business performance. Companies can create competitive advantage by applying their intellectual capital in the form of their knowledge, strategic capabilities, technological skills and experience. From the discussion above, we propose the following hypothesis: H3: Competitive Advantage has a positive and a significant effect on Business Performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS OF RESEARCH</head><p>This research was conducted at MSMEs in the Pragaan District, Sumenep Regency. The reason of choosing Pragaan District it because Pragaan is one of the business centers in Sumenep Regency and also rich in local wisdom it is worthy of calculation and has a commitment to improve business competitiveness globally. Pragaan District which consists of 14 villages that each village has their own uniqueness related to local wisdom. The list of 14 villages were Aeng Panas, Jaddung, Kaduara Timur, Karduluk, Larangan Perreng, Pakamban Daya, Pakamban Laok, Pragaan Daya, Pragaan Laok, Prenduan, Rombasan, Prangaan, Sendang, Sentol Daya and Sentol Laok. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bentler and Chou, (1987)</ref>, the rules regarding the normal size distribution of samples to calculate free parameters, namely the lowest ratio of 5 respondents in each observed variable will suffice for normal distribution when a latent variable has several indicators or observed variables and a ratio of 10 respondents per observed variable will be sufficient for other distributions, so that the sample size in this study is 156 samples. However, in order to obtain reliable data, this study published 300 questionnaires for MSMEs managers in the Pragaan District. This research is including in Exploration research category. The researcher does the Hypothesis testing in order to support or reject hypotheses. Following this research model as follows: The variables of the research were measured on a Likert scale with a range from 1 to 7 where 1 equals "Strongly disagree" and 7 equals "Highly agree". The variables studied consisted of exogenous variables and endogenous variables. This study uses Structural Equation Model analysis to study about linear relationship between variables, testing hypotheses and causal relationships between variables using the software AMOS 17. As for the requirements that must be discussed in Structural Equation Modeling test can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> as follows (MacCallum and Sugawara, 1996) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hooper and Mullen, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>There are 2 steps in the analysis of the Structural Equation Model. The first is Measurement Model and the second is Structural Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kaplan, 2000)</ref>.  Measurement models are performed using the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) method. The eligibility measurement requirements include Chi-square (χ2), Adjusted Goodness of Fit (AGFI), Comparative fit index (CFI), Goodness of Fit (GFI), Root Mean Square of Approval (RMSEA), and other indicators that added as an overall indication of the Feasibility Measurement model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hooper and Mullen, 2008)</ref>. The results of data analysis in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> show that χ2 / df-ratio is 2.02, namely at interval 3. This shows that the model has been accepted. NNFI, CFI, NFI and GFI, which is greater than or beyond 0.9, It can be regarded that NNFI, CFI, NFI and GFI, has met the acceptable requirements. The RMSEA value is 0.07, and is still accepted because according to MacCallum and Sugawara (1996), an RMSEA value of 0.05 to 0.10 is acceptable. Regarding measurements in this study indicate eligibility for the model.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, it can be seen that the Composite Reliability is placed between 0.8, the value recommended by <ref type="bibr">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref>. The Composite approval value greater than 0.60, based on the results of these tests, it can be concluded that the Measurement Model related to reliability has obtained all the requirements for the test variable.</p><p>Convergent Validity scale measurement in this study is using Confirmatory Factor Analysi (see table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>), the value of t test shows greater than 1.96, it means that the Standardized Loading for all observed variables is significant. All this shows that the path coefficient value is significant, and this is evidence that the results of the indicator meet the Convergent Validity requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson and Gerbing, 1988)</ref>.</p><p>The purpose of discriminant validity testing is to find out the high or low correlation coefficient between two variables. The higher the correlation coefficient between two variables, then there is a possibility that the discriminant validity indication cannot be fulfilled. To test the discriminant validity of this research is to compare "Organizational Learning Cability" and " Business Performance" with a correlation coefficient of 0.81, with p-values &lt;0.05 and "Organizational Learning ability" and "Competitive Advantage " with coefficients correlation of 0.72 with p-value &lt;0.05, all was done to prove that both pairs of variables have discriminant validity. The test results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> show the chi-square value between the test of unidimensional model and the measurement model for one pair are different. It can be concluded that the value is significant. In general, all measurements show the discriminant validity test has been fulfilled, as evidenced by the greatest correlation value between the variables is significantly different.</p><p>This study aims to determine the effect of Organizational Learning Capability and Organizational Innovation on Competitive Advantage and its impact on Business Performance.</p><p>This study uses the Structural Equation Model for hypothesis testing. Schumacker and Lomax (2004), as for the normal range of receipt of the chi-square value, which is between values 1 to 3.Generally, the results of tests for the goodness fit of structural models can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. The value of Chi-square (χ2) / df-ratio is 3.90. Based on table 6, the NNFI value is 0.90 and the GFI value is 0.92, all of these values are still acceptable because they are greater than 0.8 and close to 0.9.For the RMSEA value is 0.03 and it is still acceptable because the value is equal to or less than 1. So all requirements are related to goodness fit indices of structural models in the structural model have been accepted. The structural model of the RNFI must be greater than 0.9, approaching 1 is better. RPR is use to detect structural models of parsimony degrees. Ring values start from 0.0 to 1.0, the greater the better the goodness of fit. The RPFI is very useful for selecting models that simultaneously maximize fit and parsimony in the structural portion of the model. With a higher RPFI value, more is needed. It can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, the value of RPFI is 0.41, RNFI is 0.93, and RPR is 0.31, in conclusion the structural model shows the goodness of fit and parsimony. This section will discuss the ratification of hypothesis testing. The cause and effect of the path between the variables in hypothesis testing (H1 to H3) and the results of the study can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>. The results of structural model path values are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The path coefficient is Organizational Learning Capability → Competitive Advantage is 0.31; Organizational Innovation → Competitive Advantage is 0.27; Competitive Advantage → Business Performance is 0.89. Furthermore, "Competitive Advantage» as the dependent variable, r2 value is 0.58; and "Business Performance" value of r2 is 0.87. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kline (2016)</ref>, the influence size category r2 is small 0.02, moderate 0.13, and large 0.26. So it can be concluded that Competitive Advantage and Business Performance have a high level of contribution. The results of path analysis can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>In Conclusions Organizational Learning Capability and Organizational innovation have a positive influence on the Competitive Advantage and Business Performance. The Role of Organizational Learning Capability, Organizational Innovation, Competitive Advantage on Business Performance is based on existing research findings with changes in the business environment, these roles can change over time. Based on previous research, this research has limitations and suggestions for future researcher. Limitation of this research only focused on MSMEs in Pragaan District, Sumenep Regency, so that the results of this research cannot be generalized to other companies. This research focused on the MSMEs sector in the Pragaan District. Future studies can expand the results by analyzing other cities including large companies. The purpose of this research is to analyze in detail the Role of Organizational Learning Capability, Organizational Innovation, and Competitive Advantage in a certain period of time and its influence on the Business Performance. However, the effect of some variables may change over time so that the results also change. Therefore, this research suggests that future studies can develop research models to obtain more comprehensive results / information.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -Research model</figDesc></figure>

It indicates that the implementation of Organizational Learning Capability is very important to create Organizational Innovation. MSME manager can improve Organizational Innovation by increasing the following four alternatives: (1) Managerial commitment. For example, (a) manager should have good adaptability in dealing with various changes in the business world. (b) pay attention with the employee's learning ability, because it is a key factor in the success of the company and (c) giving an</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>by increasing the following three alternatives: (1) Organizational innovation in business practices For example (a) The company should implements a Quality Management System. (b) The company uses a lessons and knowledge and database of best practices. (c) The company implements practices for increases worker retention and employee development. (2) Innovation in workplace organizations. For example, (a) managers should implement work responsibilities more flexible. (b) manager should use decentralization in decision-making. (c) managers should implement a functional working groups. (3) The latest organizational method for external relations. For example, (a) the company should implement outsourcing business activities. (b) the company uses a method for integration with suppliers. (c) the company should collaborate with customers. Competitive Advantage has a positive influence on Business Performance (H3 accepted). The results of the data analysis show that Competitive Advantage has positive influence on MSMEs performance (coefficient = 0.89, t = 23.20, p &lt;0.001). The findings are consistent with the results of research by Kearns and Lederer (2003) and Hooley and Greenley (2005), this study supports that Competitive Advantage has positive influence on MSMEs Performance. It shows that Competitive Advantage Innovation is very important to create influencing MSMEs Performance. an MSMEs manager can increase competitive advantage by increasing the five alternatives as follows: (1) Differentiation. For example, (a) the company should increase the credibility and prestige of the organization. (b) the company should provide new products / services to customers. (c) the company should improve brand characteristics. (d) the company should provide better products / services to customers. (e) the company should accelerate the transaction. (f) the company should provide customized products / services. (g) the company should provide easier customer access to information. (2) Cost reduction. For example, (a) the company should reduce the cost of information distribution. (b) the company should reduce research and development costs (c) companies should save costs by reducing labor. (d) the company should reduce advertising costs. (e) the company should reduce communication costs. (f) the company should reduce marketing costs. (g) the company should save costs by reducing travel costs. (3) Innovation. For example, (a) the company should make efforts to use other applications to be developed more quickly. (b) the company should shorten the time period for product development (c) companies should change the way organizations do business. (d) the company should be better at coordinating business operations. (e) the company should ensure that previous applications are not suitable for implementation. (f) the company should respond to changes more quickly. (4) Growth. For example, (a) companies should be better at achieving organizational goals. (b) the company should increase customer satisfaction. (c) the company should improve business efficiency. (d) the company should increase ROI (Return on Investment). (e) the company should increase market share.</figDesc></figure>
