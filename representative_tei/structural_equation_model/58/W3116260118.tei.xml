<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Aim: To identify the main drivers of local dung beetle species richness in the Neotropics Location: Neotropics Major Taxa Studied: Dung Beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p>We used a multi-model approach to identify which drivers correlate better with the variations in local dung beetle species richness. To do this, we surveyed published literature on dung beetle communities to extract information on species richness, abundance, type of bait, type of habitat, and sampling effort (as hours/pitfall) for different localities, discarding sites with low sampling effort.</p><p>We used environmental variables to account for six possible explanations of species richness gradients: productivity, water-energy, ambient energy, habitat heterogeneity, resource heterogeneity, and seasonality, as well as spatial data to account for other geographically-structured phenomena. We used mixed models -with abundance, ecoregion, and bait type as random factors-to select the best model among the variables accounting for each explanation. Finally, we used structural equation models to assess which explanations are associated with variations in dung beetle diversity and how they interact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Resource heterogeneity was the best single correlate of dung beetle richness. However, the best multiple model comprises three different explanations: productivity, resource heterogeneity, and other spatially structured factors. Structural equation models show that abundance is directly (positively) associated with richness, followed by primary productivity and soil variablesa proxy for resource heterogeneity, together with mammal richness.</p><p>Main Conclusions: Several explanations need to be considered to account for Scarabaeinae local richness patterns. The diversity of dung beetle communities correlates with the interaction of water-energy dynamics and heterogeneity in both resources and habitats. However, while heterogeneity variables are directly associated with richness, energy relates with it through abundance, and water through resource diversity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Geographical gradients of species richness were perhaps the first patterns investigated in ecology and biogeography <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hawkins, 2001)</ref>. Why and wherefore some places host more species than others has long been subject to debate since Alexander von Humboldt (1850) noticed that there are more species in the tropics than in temperate regions and tried to explain it with recourse to climate and species resistance to freezing. Strikingly, almost 40 different hypotheses have been put forward to explain the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG)-based on climate, habitat, physiological responses, and many other factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pianka, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hawkins et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hawkins, 2008)</ref>. Among these, three major groups of explanations outstand: species-energy hypotheses -which assume that richness varies according to the differences in the amount of energy available or produced <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hutchinson, 1959)</ref>; heterogeneity hypotheses -where richness gradients are associated with the variance in climate, resources, and/or habitat <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lack, 1969)</ref>; and Historical and Evolutionary hypotheses -in which the LDG would be the outcome of historical and/or evolutionary processes (such as climatic stability, diversification rate, evolutionary origin or temporal changes in extinction rates) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mittelbach et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Three main groups of drivers have been traditionally associated to species-energy hypotheses, accounting for productivity, water-energy dynamics, and ambient energy. Productivity may affect species richness through the production rate of the resources of interest for each particular species group; the higher the production rate, the larger the number of individuals that an ecosystem can host, and with it the larger the total number of species it can reach in equilibrium (the so-called more-individuals hypothesis; <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wright, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Storch et al., 2018)</ref>. Many variables have been used to account for productivity, but for plants it is common to use solar radiation or actual evapotranspiration (AET; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Whittaker &amp; Field, 2000)</ref>, while for animals a direct measure of the quantity of the resource produced such as Net Primary Productivity may be used. In contrast, the explanations based on water-energy dynamics attribute the origin of diversity gradients to the geographical variations in the availability of energy and water (generally indicated by temperature and AET): in temperate or cold areas species richness is mainly constrained by energy inputs, whereas in warmer conditions, where energy is not at stake, water availability is the main constrain for hosting species-rich assemblages <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hawkins et al., 2003)</ref>. Finally, ambient energy relies on the direct ecophysiological responses of individuals of different species to temperature as an explanation for species richness gradients <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Turner et al., 1987)</ref>. In warm regions both ecto-and endotherms feed and reproduce better, since energy consumption for maintaining body heat and/or movement is lower, so more resources can be devoted to reproduction, thus increasing reproductive rates and with it population size and, lastly, species numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Turner, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, heterogeneity explanations include three main groups of drivers, namely environmental and resource variability, and seasonality. According to niche theory, the higher the environmental variability (in terms of habitats or other environmental conditions) within an area, the greater the diversity of species with different niches it can host, thus diminishing the effects of competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Tilman, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tews et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Stein et al., 2015)</ref>. This stands for both habitat heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hortal et al., 2009)</ref> and resource heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Ricklefs, 1977)</ref>.</p><p>In the case of seasonality, however, strong seasonal changes may result in short growing and reproductive seasons, hence reducing survival and reproductive rates, so regions suffering higher seasonality may present poorer species communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sanders, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gouveia et al., 2013)</ref>. Finally, historical events and long-term evolutionary processes also affect species richness gradients, as increased extinction rates or the lack of adaptations to face novel environmental conditions may constrain species richness in certain regions, while long-term temporal stability and high geological dynamism foster net diversification rates in other territories <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Wiens &amp; Donoghue, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rangel et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Such variety of explanations indicates that geographical diversity gradients are the result of a complex array of factors affecting organisms in different ways.</p><p>To find general principles in ecology, it is necessary to consider multiple hypotheses and use different explanatory variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lawton, 1999)</ref>. Problems arise when single explanations are understood as the sole drivers of diversity gradients and are treated as rivals rather than complementary pieces of a wider picture. Therefore, seeking general explanations for the, arguably complex, origin of biodiversity patterns requires adopting an analytical framework that allows incorporating the effects of different models.</p><p>Dung beetles (Coleoptera, Scarabaeinae) are known to be affected by multiple factors across scales. They respond rapidly to environmental changes, are easy to survey, and play important ecosystem functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gardner et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Nichols et al., 2008)</ref>. Indeed, the drivers of dung beetle diversity gradients in temperate regions are relatively well-known <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hortal et al., 2011)</ref>. However, in the Neotropics, knowledge on their diversity is limited to local studies, and the determinants of geographical variations in their communities cannot be easily extrapolated from other regions. Neotropical dung beetles present certain particularities <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Scholtz et al., 2009)</ref> since their evolutionary radiation in this region is linked to forest habitats, in contrast with the Afrotropical and Palearctic history of grassland evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Monaghan et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gunter et al., 2016)</ref>. That said, several climatic and environmental variables are known to correlate with dung beetle diversity, including temperature, habitat changes, mammal diversity, or seasonality. This latter factor has a strong influence on dung beetle richness since in dry seasons dung beetles are less active and represent a sub-sample of rainy season communities <ref type="bibr">(Hanski &amp; Cambefort, 1991)</ref>. This knowledge enables constructing hypotheses that include not only which variables may affect richness but also the nature and direction of their effects. Unfortunately, the lack of wellresolved phylogenetic information for Neotropical Scarabaeinae prevents from assessing the existence of evolutionary constrains in the current distribution of this group's diversity. Also, the limited number of surveys in Austral South America (see below) does not allow us to explore the eventual association of current dung beetle richness with climatic conditions during the glaciation.</p><p>However, the available knowledge allows us to relate local Scarabaeinae richness with variables accounting for several species-energy and heterogeneity explanations into a single evaluation framework.</p><p>In this work, we aim to identify the main drivers of local dung beetle species richness in the Neotropics and assess their relative importance. To do this, we use data from a comprehensive compilation of local studies to conduct a multimodel evaluation of six groups of drivers related with species-energy and heterogeneity explanations (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). In a first phase, we assess the information provided by the variables accounting for each one of these explanations using model selection analyses. Then, we use structural equation models to evaluate the relationships between the most informative explanations and dung beetle abundance and species richness altogether. This not only allows us to assess the degree of association of each competing explanation with species richness but also the eventual interactions between concurrent explanations and their relationship with the more-individuals hypothesis (through abundance; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wright, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Storch et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection and filtering</head><p>Dung beetles have been surveyed in different places for a long time in the Neotropics, making it possible to compile a database that represents the variations in local diversity throughout this region. To construct the database, we searched for ecological works on dung beetles in Web of Science and Google Scholar with the following keywords: "dung beetle*", "Scarabaeinae", and the names of all the countries with territory in the neotropical region. We only selected works that were based on field surveys with baited pitfall traps (a standard for dung beetle collection), presented a list of all dung beetle species recorded, and for which information on the location of the surveys could be georeferenced with a spatial precision of at least 10 km. From each work, we extracted information about the number of species recorded, total abundance, type of habitat (classified in open or closed), type of bait used (classified in omnivorous, herbivorous, rotten fruit, and rotten meat), year, trap hours as a measure of sampling effort (calculated by the number of pitfall traps*time in the field*number of collects), and country.</p><p>Our literature search retrieved 170 articles with local studies on dung beetle communities in countries with territory on the Neotropical realm. These articles rendered data on a total of 298 local sampling sites with 20 or more pitfall traps in the literature survey (supplementary Appendix S1). Brazil and Mexico were the countries with more sites due to their size and long tradition of research on dung beetle ecology. From this initial list of sites, we filtered out all those that had been surveyed devoting less than 960 trap hours (see supplementary Appendix S2), surveys that were conducted before 1999 (to match the time frame of the NDVI data, see below), and/or lacked data on the precise location or any of the required information. After this process, 190 sites located throughout most of the Neotropics -except Austral South America-were selected for further analyses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Supplementary Appendix S1). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictor Variables</head><p>We extracted information on a series of predictor variables from several widelyused climatic and environmental geodatabases using QGIS <ref type="bibr">(QGIS Development Team, 2019)</ref>. Data on climate was obtained from WorldClim 2.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fick &amp; Hijmans, 2017)</ref> and actual evapotranspiration (AET) from CGIAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Trabuco &amp; Zomer, 2010)</ref>, both at a resolution of 30 arcseconds (c. 1 km). For Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), we used the NASA-MODIS database <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Didan, 2015)</ref> at a resolution of 10 minutes (c. 20 km), assigning to each study the annual mean from the year when the survey was conducted; for works performed in more than one year, we estimated the average NDVI for all years surveyed. To account for habitat heterogeneity we calculated land cover richness (i.e., habitat diversity, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hortal et al., 2009)</ref> as the number of land cover categories in a buffer of a 10 km radius around the georeferenced point of each study, using the Global Land Cover by National Mapping Organizations (GLCNMO Version 3; <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Tateishi et al., 2014)</ref> at a resolution of 15 arcseconds (c. 500 m). Besides, data on habitat type were collected in each article and classified in open, closed, or both when the study did not provide a list with separate types of habitats. We extracted the maximum and minimum altitude from the FAO elevation database <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fischer et al., 2012)</ref>, using the same buffer as for land cover at a resolution of 30 arcseconds (c. 1 km). For soil structure, we extracted the proportion of sand, silt, clay, coarse fragments and bulk density at three depths to account for species that nest at different depths: 0.15 m, 0.6 m, and 2 m, at a resolution of 250 m from the World Soil Information database <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hengl et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Then we performed a PCA and used the broken stick criterion to choose the most representative axes as measures of soil structure (see Appendix S2). To account for mammal species richness in each study we used Biodiversitymapping data <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Pimm et al., 2014)</ref> at 10 km resolution, excluding all volant and marine mammals. Finally, since several ecological and historical processes may shape the patterns analyzed beyond environmental variations by creating spatial structure in the data, we used the latitude and longitude of each study to construct a Trend Surface Analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Legendre &amp; Legendre, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hortal et al., 2008)</ref> and spatial eigenvectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Diniz-Filho &amp; Bini, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>We then selected the predictor accounting for the six explanations evaluated (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for details) from the environmental variables described above, as follows. For primary productivity, we selected AET plus NDVI. For water-energy, we used AET plus annual precipitation, precipitation of wettest quarter, and precipitation of the driest quarter. For ambient energy, we selected annual mean temperature plus mean temperature of the warmest quarter and mean temperature of the coldest month. For habitat heterogeneity, we used land cover richness plus altitudinal range, PCA axis of soil structure, and type of habitat (Supplementary Appendix S2). For temporal heterogeneity and seasonality, we used Isothermality plus Temperature Seasonality and Precipitation Seasonality.</p><p>For resource heterogeneity, we used Mammal richness. And to account for other spatially structured factors, we used Trend Surface Analysis and eigenvectorbased spatial filtering to include the spatial data in the models <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Diniz-Filho &amp; Bini, 2005)</ref>. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for further details. We processed all these variables in R environment, using the packages vegan <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Oksanen et al., 2019)</ref> for PCA analyses, and letsR <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Vilela &amp; Villalobos, 2020)</ref> for the spatial data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to assess the association of all explanations with species richness in a multi-model approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Burnham &amp; Anderson, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Harrison et al., 2018)</ref>. Since abundance, type of bait, and ecoregion can strongly influence the observed richness of the studied local communities, we included the first variable as a covariate and the latter two as random factors in the GLMM to control their effects on the multi-model selection.</p><p>We did not use sampling effort as a covariate because, in a preliminary analysis, traps/hour had a low effect on richness and abundance (r 2 =0,06 for richness, r 2 =0,05 for abundance), once the localities with low sampling effort were discarded (see above). Models were constructed by subsequentially adding hypotheses.</p><p>That is, we evaluated each hypothesis individually and then all subsequent combinations of two, three, four, five, and six hypotheses. In each step, we selected the most informative model as the one with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Burnham &amp; Anderson, 2002)</ref>. In the last step, we compared the lowest AIC of each model in the previous step with the model including all the hypotheses. We included all hypotheses in a conceptual model that accounts for the relationships between dung beetle richness and abundance, and the variables used to describe all six hypotheses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). These analyses were conducted in R environment using the nlme <ref type="bibr">(Pinheiro et al., 2020)</ref> package.</p><p>We used structural equation models (SEM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Grace, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Shipley, 2016)</ref> to evaluate the relationships among the different concurrent hypotheses and dung beetle diversity. We used generalized linear models as the component models, without including random factors to avoid losing many degrees of freedom. In addition, we set trap hours as offset in the abundance model to control for the effect of sample effort in abundance estimates. Unlike the multi-model approach,</p><p>for SEM analyses we did not use the isolated climatic variables. Instead, we used a Principal Components Analysis to summarize total climatic variation into a limited set of uncorrelated factors using the broken stick criterion to determine the number of axes retained (Supplementary Appendix S2), in this case the first and the second PCA axes. To construct the conceptual model, we took into consideration the resolution of variables and the known relationships between them (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hawkins et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Schemske et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Storch et al., 2018)</ref>. Based on this, we assumed that mammal richness, the variable with the coarsest spatial resolution, was only affected by climate and by land cover richness (this variable was calculated with a buffer and summed up the distinct land uses). Importantly, since our data on resource availability did not have any measure of quantity, we did not assume a relationship between mammal richness and dung beetle abundance. We performed the SEM framework in a piecewise approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Shipley, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lefcheck, 2016)</ref>. We applied a test of directional separation (d-separation) to evaluate if the relationships hypothesized in this initial conceptual model (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) fit the observed data <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Shipley, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Shipley, , 2009))</ref>.</p><p>If any relationships were missing from the model, we added new paths (i.e., new relationships) until it fitted the observed data (reached by a d-sep &gt; 0.05, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Shipley, 2009)</ref> and excluded non-significant paths, and until all remaining variables were informative (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Calatayud et al., 2016</ref> for a similar approach). Then we interpreted the final clean structural model. SEM analyses were conducted in R environment using the package piecewiseSEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lefcheck et al., 2019)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The 190 local communities used in the analyses show higher species richness in tropical latitudes, with a decrease towards Mesoamerica and Subtropical South America (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Local richness varies from 1 to 105; the highest being at a single site in Ecuador, in the Eastern Cordillera Real Montane Forest ecoregion.</p><p>Seventy-eight percent of these studies presented data from forest habitats (including works that surveyed both forest and pastures), and Omnivorous feces was the most common type of bait (65%). Increasing species abundance is depicted in progressively larger circles and on a continuous scale from white (lowest richness) to red (highest richness).</p><p>Resource heterogeneity was the most informative single driver of species richness, as it presented the lowest AIC compared to other explanations (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). However, after evaluating all possible combinations of variables (117 models), a model including Productivity, Resource Heterogeneity, and Spatial Structure was selected as the most parsimonious, as it provided lower AIC values with less complexity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and Supplementary Appendix S3). The  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Our results evidence that the geographical variations in the species richness of dung beetle communities in the Neotropics cannot be attributed to a single, simple explanation. The explicit treatment of multiple sets of drivers through multimodel and structural equation modeling analytical frameworks allowed us to pinpoint the complexity of the interactions between climate, soil, habitat, and mammal richness in their influence on the diversity of Neotropical dung beetle communities. Strikingly, the strong direct associations of abundance and, to a lesser extent, productivity indicate that local richness is primarily determined by the amount of energy and resources. However, soil, habitat, and mammal richness also present multiple direct and indirect influences on dung beetle species richness. In fact, resource heterogeneity stands out as the most informative single explanation, rather than one of the species-energy explanations that would be expected given the strong association between richness and abundance (which is unavoidably determined by productivity; <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wright, 1983)</ref>.</p><p>That habitat heterogeneity is an important influence on dung beetle local richness is not surprising. (Micro)climatic conditions exert a strong influence on dung beetle activity, affecting their metabolic rates and altering resource volatility and availability time <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Davis et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Medina &amp; Lopes, 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, most Neotropical Scarabaeinae species have evolved to exploit tropical and subtropical forest environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Monaghan et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Scholtz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gunter et al., 2016)</ref>. As a result, dung beetle communities are strongly dependent on habitat structure <ref type="bibr">(Hanski &amp; Cambefort, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Nichols et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gardner et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Martello et al., 2016)</ref> and the microclimatic differences induced by the variations in forest structure (da Silva &amp; Hernández, 2016) and elevation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Nunes et al., 2016)</ref>. Further, dung beetles are also affected by soil conditions, since their soil burial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Halffter &amp; Edmonds, 1982)</ref> imposes a selection pressure in relation to soil structure (i.e., the amount of clay, sand and silt, and soil compaction; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Davis, 1996)</ref>. It is important to note, however, that we found an unexpected negative relationship between altitudinal range and Scarabaeinae abundance. We have not been able to identify any possible reason why dung beetle populations should be smaller in steeper areas, except perhaps that cattle herds are generally more abundant in the plains. In any case, this intriguing relationship deserves further exploration.</p><p>Scarabaeinae dung beetles use mammal dung as their primary resource for feeding and nesting <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Halffter &amp; Matthews, 1966)</ref>, so their communities are often related with mammal diversity and abundance <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Raine &amp; Slade, 2019)</ref>. In general, dung beetles present low levels of trophic specialisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Raine et al., 2018)</ref>, and faeces from humans or other omnivores are used by most species in the Neotropics. However, a number of species present a certain degree of specialization, so all Neotropical mammals have some dung beetle species specialized in their excrements <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Halffter &amp; Matthews, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Howden &amp; Nealis, 1975)</ref>. Perhaps due to this, dung beetle richness and abundance decline when mammal richness declines <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Nichols et al., 2009)</ref> or when native mammal species are substituted by exotic mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Filgueiras et al., 2009</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Raine &amp; Slade, 2019)</ref>. This interdependence with mammals is confirmed by the direct effects found in our structural equation models and the presence of resource heterogeneity in the set of explanations selected in the multi-model analysis.</p><p>Besides habitat structure and resource availability, energy affects richness by regulating productivity, altering individual metabolic rates, and increasing niche packing. The relative importance of these factors varies geographically, so the inclusion of spatial factors in our final model could be partly supporting the influence of water-energy dynamics on dung beetle diversity (i.e., that species richness is determined by a balance of water availability and ambient energy).</p><p>However, according to this explanation, tropical areas would be expected to be more affected by water availability because population growth is typically not limited by temperature in these areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hawkins et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Tshikae et al., 2013)</ref>, while in temperate regions temperature is the main constraint to dung beetle diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lobo et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hortal et al., 2011)</ref>. Indeed, the effects of rain on the composition and richness of Neotropical dung beetle communities are wellknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Liberal et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Novais et al., 2016)</ref>. However, in our SEM, only temperature variables (Climate PCA axis1) present an indirect correlation on richness. Therefore, although our results do not call for a change in the hierarchy of the importance of the effects of water and energy variables for this group, they do challenge the simple interpretation that limitations to water metabolism of dung beetles impose a major constraint to their diversity. Rather, such influence may be related to either the constraints imposed by water metabolism to mammal diversity, the effects of water availability on the attractiveness, texture, and nutrient accessibility of mammal dung, or both.</p><p>Nonetheless, the strong effect of abundance stands out as the most important association with richness in our structural equation model, mediating most of the effects of productivity, ambient energy, and altitudinal range.</p><p>Regardless of the importance of other factors, this indicates that the main mechanism driving dung beetle local richness in the Neotropics may be the species-energy relationship, as outlined by the more individuals' hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Wright, 1983)</ref>. According to this hypothesis, high energy permits sustaining larger populations, diminishing extinction rates, and increasing niche packing, allowing the coexistence of larger numbers of species <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Evans et al., 2005)</ref>. Note here that this strong effect of abundance was not explicitly evaluated in our multihypothesis evaluation framework since abundance was included as a cofactor in all these models. Given the SEM results, we can assume that the general effect of abundance on dung beetle diversity extends over all the hypotheses evaluated in this work, thus providing support for its role as the main regulator of the effects of productivity on species richness <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Storch et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The community data compiled in our database comes from local dung beetle inventories sampled using a large variability of survey methodologies and sampling efforts. In many cases, surveys were poorly described and lacked a clear description of the locality, habitat, and/or method of capture. In some cases, such limitations prevented us from distinguishing the abundances of each species in each type of habitat or the individuals captured with different kinds of bait. This hampers a more in-depth assessment of several important factors that operate at the local scale, but it does not affect our ability to assess variables operating at larges scales. Indeed, the a priori selection of sites surveyed with a sufficiently large sampling effort (in our case, 960 trap/hours) ensures that all inventories considered for our analyses were reasonably complete. The ulterior use of sampling effort as an offset of abundance on the SEM analyses also accounts for any possible spurious effect due to unevenness in sampling effort in the data analyzed. This makes unlikely the existence of any consistent bias in our data and results, beyond the obvious exclusion of Austral South America from the domain of our analyses. Thus, although future works based on more detailed data on the location and characteristics of the surveyed sites may enhance our knowledge on the local effects on dung beetle diversity, we do not expect significant changes in the structure of relationships among large-scale factors and the local diversity of dung beetles identified in this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Ecological communities are complex systems where multiple mechanisms operate at the same time. Such complexity may apparently create incongruent patterns in different localities and regions. Therefore, a joint analysis of the different hypotheses raised to account for diversity gradients can provide a better understanding of their origin. In this work, at least three out of the six explanations evaluated need to be considered to account for the local species richness patterns of Neotropical Scarabaeinae. The diversity of dung beetle communities in the region studied can be explained by a combination of primary productivity, ambient-energy balance, habitat heterogeneity, and resource heterogeneity hypotheses. The influence of energy, temperature, and altitudinal range occurs indirectly through the effects of these factors on abundance (in accordance with <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Storch et al. ,2018)</ref>, which is the most important direct determinant of richness in our analyses. In contrast, habitat and resource heterogeneity present direct associations with dung beetle diversity. Taking this comprehensive picture into consideration, in the tropical and subtropical areas of Meso-and South America, the species richness of dung beetle communities can be primarily explained by the more-individuals hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Wright, 1983)</ref>, through both productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Storch et al., 2018)</ref> and niche packing <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hutchinson, 1959)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

An explicit analysis of the relationships between the different sets of drivers allowed us to identify the existence of a complex array of interactions between predictors, from which the strong positive association of abundance and the negative association of open habitats with dung beetle species richness stand out (Fig.4and Supplementary Appendix S3). Besides those major relationships, Soil4 (a PCA axis related to volume of coarse fragments) and Mammal Richness also showed direct positive associations with dung beetle richness. The association of ambient energy (a PCA axis related to temperature WorldClim variables) and NDVI with richness was positive, though indirect through their direct influence on abundance. Furthermore, while resolving the model, a new relationship was added to fit the data based on the d-separation test, which identified a negative association between altitudinal range and dung beetle abundance (Fig.4).</figDesc></figure>
