<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose: Extant literature reported that the perceptible experience of work-family conflict (W-F conflict) is determined by any of work/family role-specific characteristics. This study is done under the premise that the perception on the occurrence of W-F conflict is influenced by person-specific personality characteristics. Authors have used big five personality dimensions as the independent variables and bi-directional nature of W-F conflict as dependent variable. It was hypothesized that extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness positively predict W-F conflict and neuroticism negatively predicts W-F conflict.</p><p>Design/methodology/approach: A self-reported questionnaire consisting of items borrowed from published literature was used to collect data. This study comprised of 205 IT/ITES (Information technology/Information technology enabled services) employees working in Chennai city. The cross sectional data was collected using snow-ball sampling technique.</p></div>

One major reason that could be attributed is the perceptible quasi -egalitarian change in the thinking of both men and women in India. Men, for whom home was a safe haven after work once, have increasingly started participating in household activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Wesley &amp; Muthuswamy, 2009)</ref>. The prescriptions made by the ancient Indian literatures such as the Vedas where men play the role of a breadwinner and the sole provider for the family while women a subordinate role of being an obedient, devoted and dutiful wife, nurturing and loving mother in the family social structure is undergoing a part reversal. In short, the paradigm role-reversal has been commensurately increasing since last decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anafarta &amp; Kuruuzum, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baral &amp; Bhargava, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chincholkar &amp; Krishna, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Harvey, Novicevic &amp; Breland, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Karadogan, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Paulin &amp; Lee, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Sahibzada, Hammer, Neal &amp; Kuang, 2005)</ref>. After globalization of the Indian economy and with its gradual implementation, more and more multinational companies have made their inroads into the country. These companies have brought with them different work patterns and cultures. These have obliterated the traditional time boundary between work and family hours. As a result work-family conflict occurs that leads to juggle between their work and family lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Zoharah &amp; Aminah, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Researchers have identified various work and family related factors that lead to W-F conflict.</p><p>Work related factors are work demand, work-conflict and supervisor support; and family related factors are family demand, family-conflict and family support. However, researchers in the last one decade have started arguing that individual differences that make up the personality of individuals such as extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism and openness to experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Malekiha, Abedi &amp; Baghban, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baltes, Zhdanova &amp; Clark, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruck &amp; Allen 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dijkstra, Dierendonck, Evers &amp; Dreu, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Grzywacz &amp; Marks 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lin, 2013)</ref> would also predict the conflict between roles individuals participate.

The bidirectional nature is referred to as the conflict (hereafter referred to as W-F Conflict) that occurs due to work interfering into family (hereafter represented as WFC) and family interfering into work (hereafter represented as FWC).</p><p>There are relatively little research was done to facilitate the understanding of individual differences that influence W-F Conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baltes et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Friede &amp; Ryan, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lin, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, recently researchers have called for a closer examination of the relationship between personality traits and W-F Conflict (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Malekiha et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lin, 2013)</ref>.

Time-based conflict refers to overlapping schedules with pressures between work and family roles, due to which it may be impossible to be both physically and psychologically present within both roles as expected. Strain-based conflict refers to work and family related stressors that produce mental and emotional strain due to which the demands of other life domains are difficult to fulfill. Behavior-based conflict refers to different behavioral expectations within work and family domains and the inability to adjust one's behavior according to these expectations within each life domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fu &amp; Shaffer, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Greenhaus &amp; Beutell, 1985)</ref>.

The behavior of the individual is determined by characteristics of his/her personality. Researchers agree that almost all personality measures could be categorized according to the five -factor model of personality (also referred to as the "big five" personality dimensions) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Goldberg, 1992)</ref>, though, the basic dimensions of the five factors have been shown to include hundreds of personality traits proposed by theorists to describe individual differences in behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fleeson, 2001)</ref>. Thus, big five factor seems appropriate for capturing a broad picture of individual personality and their behavioral patterns and interpretation of objective situations in variety of life domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Judge &amp; Higgins, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">McCrae and John (1992)</ref>, the big five personality dimensions were five broad domains or dimensions of personality that were used to describe human personality. They were 1) Extraversion: Kind of persons who are usually active, assertive, energetic, enthusiastic, outgoing and talkative <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(McCrae &amp; John, 1992)</ref>; they prefer to be around people most of the time. 2) Agreeableness: Persons who are cooperative, likeability, forgiving, kind, sympathy for others and trusting <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(McCrae &amp; John, 1992)</ref>; generally they are warm and trusting. 3) Conscientiousness: Persons who are responsible, organized, achievement oriented, dependable, maintains orderliness, efficient, thoroughness and hardworking <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Judge &amp; Higgins, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">McCrae &amp; John, 1992)</ref>; these kinds of persons are generally have high standards and strive to achieve goals. 4) Neuroticism: Individuals experience emotional instability like anxiety, insecurity, irritability, defensiveness, tension, worry and sadness <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Judge &amp; Higgins, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">McCrae &amp; John, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Stoeva, Chiu &amp; Greenhaus, 2002)</ref>. 5) Openness to experience:</p><p>Persons with this trait exhibit intelligence, unconventionality, imagination, curiosity, creativity and originality <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Judge &amp; Higgins, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">McCrae &amp; John, 1992)</ref>; generally they have broad interests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Personality and work-family conflict</head><p>Earlier, research has argued that W-F Conflict is not only a function of work and family circumstances, but also includes individual characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Wayne, Musisca &amp; Fleeson, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Theoretically, personality traits can have direct as well as indirect effects on W-F conflict.</p><p>Personality traits serve primarily to either enhance or mitigate existing condition. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Extraversion and Work family conflict</head><p>Extraversion is recognized for its importance to social relations <ref type="bibr">(Jensen-Cambell &amp; Graziano, 2001)</ref>. Extraversion can be defined in terms of warmth, gregariousness, assertiveness, activity, positive emotionality, excitement seeking, joyful and they show a preference for and enjoyment of others company <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992)</ref>. Thus, highextraverts tend to be outgoing and energetic, while individuals low on extraversion are more introverted and reserved <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(McCrae &amp; John, 1992)</ref>. The positivity and energetic nature of extraverts may well interpret a conflict situation in a way that buffers the negative influence on their well-being.</p><p>We therefore predict negative relationship between Extraversion and work family conflict in our hypothesis:</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Extraversion is negatively related to WFC</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Conscientiousness and Work family conflict</head><p>Conscientiousness can be defined in terms of competence, order, dutifulness, self-discipline, deliberation, and achievement striving <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992)</ref>. People high in conscientiousness tend to be achievement oriented, dependable, orderly and deliberate <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barrick &amp; Mount, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992)</ref>. Individuals high in conscientiousness adopt effective strategies and implement them properly to minimize negative work-family spillover.</p><p>Researchers examining conscientiousness as an antecedent to work-family conflict have generally reported a negative relationship (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruck &amp; Allen, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baltes et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lin, 2013)</ref>. The literature generally supports a negative relationship between work family conflict and conscientiousness. We therefore predict negative relationship between conscientiousness and work family conflict in the second hypothesis, as:</p><p>Hypothesis 2: Conscientiousness is negatively related to work family conflict</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Agreeableness and Work family conflict</head><p>Agreeableness is defined in terms of cooperation, like ability, forgivingness, kindness, sympathy and trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carlson, 1999)</ref>. Highly agreeable individuals should have more opportunities to reach out to their social networks in both the work and family domains. It was found that agreeableness related positively to facilitation from the family domain to the work domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Wayne et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Devi &amp; Rani, 2012)</ref>. It is possible that individuals who are high on this dimension may have a tendency to over exert themselves in an effort to help and/or please others such as coworkers or family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bruck &amp; Allen, 2003)</ref>. Thus we predict that agreeableness is negatively related to work family conflict in our third hypothesis, as:</p><p>Hypothesis 3: Agreeableness is negatively related to work family conflict</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4.">Neuroticism and Work family conflict</head><p>Individuals high on neuroticism tend to be self-pitying, tense, and worrying, while individuals low on neuroticism are described as emotionally stable, relaxed, and even-tempered <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(McCrae &amp; John, 1992)</ref>. Compared to other dispositional antecedents examined in the work-family conflict literature, neuroticism has received the most research attention and support. Across various samples and studies, neuroticism has been positively linked to negative spillover from work to family and family to work (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Grzywacz &amp; Marks, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bruck &amp; Allen, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Devi &amp; Rani, 2012)</ref>. Among the five dimensions in big five factor model neuroticism has been constantly positively related to W-F Conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andreassi &amp; Thompson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruck &amp; Allen, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Wayne et al., 2004)</ref>. Individuals who are high on neuroticism may be less likely to deal with the pressures between the work and home domains, and therefore, will be more likely to report high levels of W-F Conflict than individuals who are low on neuroticism. Thus we predict that neuroticism is positively related to work family conflict as our fourth hypothesis:</p><p>Hypothesis 4: Neuroticism is positively related to work family conflict</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5.">Openness to experience and Work family conflict</head><p>Openness kind of personality has active imagination, aesthetic sensitivity, intellectual curiosity, preference for variety, and independence of judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992)</ref>. Individuals high on openness are full of ideas and they are interested in novelty. Since they are creative, they are also capable of finding creative solutions to manage their conflict. Open individuals are curious about both inner and outer worlds, and their lives are experientially richer <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Rothmann &amp; Coetzer, 2003)</ref>. Thus we predict that openness to be negatively related to work family conflict as the fifth hypothesis:</p><p>Hypothesis 5: Openness is negatively related to work family conflict</p></div>

However, we personally met the respondents or contacted them over phone, to solicit their kind cooperation in filling up the questionnaire. To instill confidence in the minds of the respondents, the questionnaire was attached with a covering letter, describing the purpose for which the data was collected. They were ensured that their responses would be used only for academic purpose and were assured absolute confidentiality and anonymity on the information sought. We requested them to fill the questionnaire comprised of questions related to W-F conflict and Big-five factor personality test questions developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">McCrae &amp; John, 1992.</ref> We distributed 304 questionnaires out of which 205 completed and usable questionnaires were returned, yielding a response rate of 67.43 percent.

While the results of this study do not preclude the possibility of common method variance, they do suggest that CMV is not a great concern and thus is unlikely to confound the interpretations of the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Descriptive statistics and Hypothesis testing</head><p>The data collected from the respondents was tabulated and analyzed using appropriate statistical techniques. Total activities are presented as a mean of the summated score of the individual items of each variable with standard deviation in the parenthesis. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> presents the mean and the inter-correlations among the study variables. It is seen that the correlations among the variables are significant at 0.05 level. The results indicate low (r = 0.03) to high correlations (r = 0.54). We contend that there is no evidence of multi-collinearity among any of the variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Green, Tull, &amp; Albaum, 1999)</ref> and hence agreed that any of the independent variables do not exert serious confounding influence on the relationships between the identified independent and dependent variables, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Campbell &amp; Fiske, 1959)</ref>. This also shows that the measures that should be related are in reality related. Majority of the inter-correlations for all items within respective constructs are significant and hence provides evidence that the items related to the same construct are supported. We are aware that while the significant intercorrelations demonstrate that the items are probably related to the same construct that does not automatically mean that the construct is absolutely supported. Maybe there is some other construct that these items are related to but, at the very least, the researcher assumes from the pattern of correlations that the items are converging on the same thing.</p><p>We evaluated the degree to which the measurement hypotheses are consistent with actual data by running confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). CFA allows examination of three key sets of results -fit indices and parameter estimates.  This model received support from the fit indices. Subsequently, the researchers interpreted and reported its parameter estimates. On examination of the standardized loadings in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, all items loaded well on the two factors except neuroticism. For example, openness loaded at 1.15 on the personality dimensions and agreeableness loaded at 1.34 on personality dimensions at 0.05 significance level. Similarly, FWC loaded at 1.81 on W-F Conflict.</p><p>The researchers summarize the implications of the items' loadings, stating that they confirm (except neuroticism) each of the two components as defined by its items as all item loadings exceeded .60 and differed reliably from zero (p &lt; .05) except neuroticism. So the researchers have re-specified the model after excluding neuroticism and re-run CFA to confirm the model. As reported for CFA, the most widely respected and reported fit indices are used to examine the model fitness.</p><p>The χ² value = 13.459; df = 8; p = .097, comparative fit index (CFI) = .969, χ² / df = 1.682, the Tucker-Lewis fit index (TLI) = .941, NFI = .929, and the RMSEA = .058. Looking at the cut-off mentioned earlier, it is understood that different fit indices assess fit in different ways.</p><p>The parameter estimation is done to generate unique values for the free parameters in the model developed. There are seven methods available to estimate the parameters though the researcher has used Maximum Likelihood (ML). The maximum likelihood estimation is efficient and unbiased when the assumption of multivariate normality is met <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hair, Anderson, Tatham &amp; Black, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wu, 2006)</ref>. The researcher decided to use ML because of its iterative nature and robustness under the assumption of multivariate normality in providing more statistically efficient estimates. Moreover, it is a full-information technique and less sensitive to moderate departures. On examination of the regression weights in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, all items are significant at 0.05 level of significance. On examination of the standardized regression weights, it is seen that the prediction of W-F Conflict by the personality dimensions are in the direction hypothesized. It is noted that personality dimensions strongly predict W-F Conflict negatively.</p><p>It suggests that W-F Conflict is a function of the individual's personality dimensions. When the individual's personality improves, W-F Conflict captured as a bi-directional construct decreases.</p><p>The total effect results suggest that personality dimensions strongly predict FWC (β = -.241) followed by WFC (β = -.185). The standardized estimates are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussions and implications</head><p>The aim of this study is to find out whether personality is the determinants of work-family conflict. This study presents several key findings. We believe that the findings have emerged in this pattern because of the significantly exclusive characteristics of IT/BPO sample. The measurement model was supported support the hypotheses. However, neuroticism alone does not get loaded in the personality dimension constraint and subsequently it was removed from the measurement model CFA re-run thereafter. The personality variables do play a role in W-F conflict experience.</p><p>Five sets of hypotheses were proposed, involving the relationship between extraversion, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness. In the following sections, the results for each set of study hypotheses are discussed.</p><p>W-F Conflict was expected to be related to extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness, however, unfortunately, neuroticism had to be dropped from the structural model. Although many research findings states that the relationship between neuroticism and WFC received the most support (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruck &amp; Allen, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Devi &amp; Rani, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dijkstra et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Malekiha, Abedi &amp; Baghban, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Wayne et al., 2004)</ref>, this study shows an antithetical result. Research findings coupling extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness and openness with work-family conflict are more consistent with the results across various studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baltes et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruck &amp; Allen, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Devi &amp; Rani, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dijkstra et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Malekiha et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Wayne et al., 2004)</ref>. Despite some inconsistencies in the literature, several researchers have reported significant association between neuroticism and W-F Conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bruck &amp; Allen, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Devi &amp; Rani, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dijkstra et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Malekiha et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Wayne et al., 2004)</ref>. The void relationship in the present study is unforeseen. This may perhaps be due to the educated nature of the samples -69 percent completed their under graduation and 30 percent completed their post graduation.</p><p>So the rating of neuroticism is low when compared to all other personality dimensions and consequently, the individuals are energetic, confident and self motivated and they have the ability to control their personality characteristics and able to balance their work and family domain with the influence of their positivism and control their own circumstances. Neurotics do not perceive incompatibility between work and family as a conflict.</p><p>The relationship between extraversion and W-F Conflict is as hypothesized. Since extraverts are the person who are recognized for their positivism, energetic, joyful and has the ability to develop and maintain social relations. They are more likely to seek resources and solutions to minimize negative work and family spillover. Due to their high energy level they accomplish more task in given time which may reduce their incompatible pressures and able to cope with their demands and they are negatively correlated with work-family conflict.</p><p>The hypothesized relationship between conscientiousness and W-F Conflict is well supported.</p><p>Conscientious individuals view problem solving or conflict in positivity and find solutions when they get conflict. Since they always well planned and scheduled they overcome conflicts between domains by organizing things in order. They adopt effective strategies to minimize the conflict between work and family.</p><p>In case of agreeableness, individuals can adapt and adjust to various situations they will find more opportunities both in their work and family domains. Openness individuals are generally more creative and able to find their own solutions when they experience conflict. Further, individuals with high level of agreeableness would have more adaptability and adjust to various situations.</p><p>Practically this study insists organizations could develop trainings based on individual personality differences so that the employee may effectively manage their work and family stressors.</p><p>Our findings have practical implications as to how to manage W-F conflict among employees in this business world. The association between W-F Conflict and personality insists organizations could develop trainings based on individual personality differences so that the employee may effectively manage their work and family. At this juncture, that profiling of employees' based on the profiling is very imperative. It would be easier for the employer to counsel their employee on issues relating to work or family by knowing their personality. With the fast pace of modernization in India, and increased conflicts at home are reported owing to demanding nature of work and changing family characteristics, companies can set up helplines for employees to speak their problems and seek solutions connected to W-F Conflict. Such helplines would help employees to capture the personality as well as to share their problems in work and family.</p><p>W-F Conflict specific personality inventories may be developed that so that training programs based on such dimensions would help them with coping behaviors. This type of training would likely benefit organizations, because work-family conflict has been linked with increased interest to leave an organization and higher levels of job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allen, Herst, Bruck &amp; Sutton, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Work-family conflict has become a societal issue. This issue leads to health-related problems such as over stress, mental imbalance, emotional exhaustion and life dissatisfaction. In order to reduce these health-related problems, the society needs to promote the meaning of balancing the work and family roles and emphasize the important of personal interests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Limitations and directions for future research</head><p>This study has number of limitations. This study has been done among IT/BPO professionals in Chennai city so generalizability of the results is difficult. The cross-sectional nature of the data prohibits us from testing the temporal relationship among the variable of interest, so in future longitudinal data should be studied in order to find the relationship between personality and work-family conflict. An alternative causal flows among the variable may possibly exist. Selfreported data has been used in this study, so the respondent might have given biased answers. Also, a larger sample size could be used to establish the relationship and thus prove the stability of the results.</p><p>Although this study provides preliminary evidence of the effect of personality in work-family Based on the measurement model, neuroticism has been dropped from the final model. This is surprising and contrary to the expectation of extant literature and so further studies could be undertaken to validate the exclusion of neuroticism in Indian setting.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

CFA provides many fit indices that emerge from the correspondence between the items' variances/covariances implied by the hypothesized measurement model and the items' variances/covariances found in actual responses to the scale. However, we concentrate on only a few, though they seem to have differing preferences. the Tucker-Lewis fit index (TLI) = .95, NFI = .92, and the RMSEA = .049. Chi-square value itself is clear and convincing with evidence that the model is adequate indicating no significant difference between the observed sample and the measurement model covariance matrices. The significant value suggests that the researcher's model capably reproduced the observed variables' covariance matrix. It is understood that different fit indices assess fit in different ways and the researcher has relied on the most widely used indices to reach a judgment concerning the overall fit of the model. The results of these indices used in conjunction indicate a good overall model fit and paint a fit model.</figDesc></figure>
