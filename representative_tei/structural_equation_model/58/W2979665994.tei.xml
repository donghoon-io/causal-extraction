<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The role of stress in health is complex and multifactorial, with variation in psychosocial stressors as well as individual responses contributing to a range of stress impacts upon health <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ayers &amp; Steptoe, 2007)</ref>. While stress can be considered as both objective external factors and internal perceptual factors, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lazarus and Folkman (1984)</ref> offered a transactional approach in which stress results from personal appraisal of the environment in which environmental demands are perceived as exceeding or taxing one's resources to respond. Individuals with depression are particularly vulnerable to stress, due to a weakened stress resistance capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Carstens &amp; Spangenberg, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Skärsäter et al., 2009)</ref> which can result in exacerbated depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hammen, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hammen, , 2015;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Pittenger &amp; Duman, 2008)</ref>. Therefore, identification of resources among people with depression that may be mobilized to resist the ill effects of stress provides targets for therapeutic intervention. Leisure behavior generates resources (i.e., leisure-generated resources) that have been advocated as having benefit for preventing, coping with and transcending life stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Caldwell, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Iwasaki, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Kleiber &amp; Hutchinson, 2010)</ref>. While leisure's common connotation largely references free time, leisure scholars characterize leisure behaviors as those behaviors that are autonomously chosen, intrinsically motivated and producing an element of pleasure <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kleiber, Walker, &amp; Mannell, 2011)</ref>. Two principal leisure-generated resources have been identified as contributing to the stress-health relationship. The first has asserted that stress-coping resources are built through leisure behavior's ability to divert attention from negative emotion, increase experience of positive emotion, and facilitate companionship <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Iwasaki &amp; Mannell, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Another leisure-generated resource has been identified through meaning making <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Iwasaki, Coyle, Shank, Messina, &amp; Porter, 2013)</ref> in which life meaning derived through leisure behaviors enable greater stress-coping <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Iwasaki, MacKay, Mactavish, Ristock, &amp; Bartlett, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>To date, the link between leisure and depressive symptoms appears to be established <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Janke et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Lu, 2011)</ref>; however, the true effects of leisure might be confounded because previous studies did not consider the potential effects from stress-resistant dispositions such as sense of coherence (SOC), which is also known to be associated with depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Carstens &amp; Spangenberg, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Skärsäter et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Weissbecker et al., 2002)</ref>. What makes the overall stress-health relationship more complicated, however, is the link between leisure and SOC. Researchers have demonstrated that there is a link between leisure and SOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Caldwell, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lammel, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lee, 2018)</ref>, in samples without depression. Considering the importance of a stress-resistance capacity, the relationship between leisure and SOC is important because it may call an attention to include leisure into treatment in community psychology. In addition, clarifying the direct effect of leisure on depressive symptoms and indirect effect through SOC and stress may provide hints to focus on leisure-based therapeutic programs. As a result, the purpose of this study was to: (a) identify the relationship between leisure-generated resources and SOC among individuals with depression; and (b) to identify the direct and indirect outcomes of leisure-generated resources on depressive symptoms through SOC and stress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Review The Impact of Stress on Depression</head><p>Research has established a strong link between stress and depression. It has been demonstrated that stress is relevant to depression, as stress is associated with onset as well as relapses and recurrences of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hammen, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hammen, , 2015;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Monroe, Slavich, &amp; Georgiades, 2009)</ref>. Stress, at the same time, is associated with depressive symptoms in the present, as individuals who perceive more stress experience elevated depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Monroe et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Muscatell, Slavich, Monroe, &amp; Gotlib, 2009)</ref>. Additionally, evidence from neuroscience indicates that stress exposure inhibits neurogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Frodl et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Pittenger &amp; Duman, 2008)</ref>, which is a key neurophysiological mechanism for recovery from depression. Thus, stress has been demonstrated to affect depression, precipitating its onset, maintaining symptoms, impeding recovery and contributing to relapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hammen, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Pittenger &amp; Duman, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sense of Coherence as a Mediator of Stress -Depression Relationship</head><p>Although stress is implicated in depression, there are many people who experience stress without developing depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Kessler, 1997)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Antonovsky (1979)</ref> examined the role of stress resistance capacity in overall health and developed the concept of sense of coherence (SOC) as an embodiment of this capacity to resist the health detriment of stress. SOC is defined as: … a global orientation that expresses the extent to which one has a pervasive, enduring, though dynamic feeling of confidence that (1) the stimuli deriving from one's internal and external environments in the course of living are structured, predictable, and explicable; (2) the resources are available to one to meet the demands posed by these stimuli; and (3) these demands are challenges, worthy of investment and engagement. 1 <ref type="bibr">(Antonovsky, 1987, p. 19)</ref> Individuals who have a high SOC perceive that: (a) their life is comprehensible such that their past makes sense, and their future is predictable, (b) the adversities they face are manageable through available resources, and (c) their lives are meaningful and worthy and deserving of full engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Antonovsky, 1987)</ref>.</p><p>Empirical evidence supports that SOC mitigates stress and alleviates depression. Crosssectional and prospective studies found that higher SOC predicted lower perceived stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Delgado, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Flannery &amp; Flannery, 1990)</ref>. Higher SOC has also been found to be associated with lower depressive symptoms, both among general population and among individuals with depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Carstens &amp; Spangenberg, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Skärsäter et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Weissbecker et al., 2002)</ref>. These findings suggest that SOC is associated with level of perceived stress as well as depression outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Potential Link between Leisure Behavior and SOC</head><p>Leisure behavior is defined as self-determined activities that happened outside of obligatory time, in which one experiences freedom, positive emotions, sense of control, and intrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Caldwell, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chick, 2010)</ref>. This definition, therefore, includes not only an activity but also perceptions about the activity. Therefore, some activities, such as watching TV alone, might not be perceived as leisure behavior because one may not experience freedom, positive emotions, or intrinsic motivation. In addition, research evidence suggests that leisure experiences bring about positive psychological changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kleiber, Walker, &amp; Mannell, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, in leisure studies, perceived experiences from leisure are used as an indicator of leisure behavior instead of time and frequency of leisure participation. Some perceived experiences from leisure are identified as resources to resist stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson &amp; Heyne, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hood &amp; Carruthers, 2002)</ref>. Such leisure-generated resources include leisure as a coping resource <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Iwasaki &amp; Mannell, 2000)</ref> and meaning derived from leisure <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Porter, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Kleiber et al. (2002)</ref> asserted that leisure behavior is often be associated with a psychological state of Flow, which is an effective way to divert attention from the negative situations surrounding the person. Such temporary diversions allow an individual to cope with stress. In addition, positive emotions experienced from leisure and positive social interactions with others in leisure contributes stress-coping <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Iwasaki &amp; Mannell, 2000)</ref>. Meaning derived through leisure participation is advocated as another resource to resist stress. For example, through engaging in leisure, an individual may recognize positive skills and qualities about oneself, building a greater sense of self. It gives the person energy to combat with stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Porter, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Iwasaki et al. (2013)</ref> demonstrated that leisure coping and meaning derived from leisure are correlated constructs. Taking closer look at these leisure-generated resources, there are reasons to believe that leisure-generated resources might improve SOC by addressing all dimensions including comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness.</p><p>Leisure-generated resources and comprehensibility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Antonovsky (1987)</ref> defined comprehensibility as the core element of his original conceptualization of sense of coherence, noting that it refers to the extent to which one perceives internal and external stimuli as ordered, consistent and structured and making cognitive sense. Such a perception also leads to expectations that future stimuli encountered will be predictable or at least explicable and bearable <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Antonovsky, 1987)</ref>.</p><p>One way that leisure-generated resources may contribute to comprehensibility is through providing a sense of continuity and structure to people's lives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hutchinson, Loy, Kleiber and Dattilo (2003)</ref> found that among people who had experienced a spinal cord injury, leisure behaviors could be a way for them to see themselves as "the same person as before" (p. 150) thus providing continuity and stability in one's sense of self. Another potential avenue is through leisure activities providing structure and predictability to daily experience, particularly for those without adequate levels of employment <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Goodman, Geiger, &amp; Wolf, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hutchinson, et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Another way that leisure may contribute to comprehensibility is through the development of optimism. Being exposed to stressors may be overwhelming; however, optimism can be mobilized to frame the source of stress as a thing that can be coped with by thinking that things are going to work out. Leisure is indeed a source of optimism and hypothesized to be a pathway to comprehensibility development <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kleiber et al., 2002)</ref>. Further, when individuals engage in leisure activities, they have social interaction with others who are similar to them, or have an opportunity to take another person's perspective to see their situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Scott &amp; Godbey, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Through the perspective taking, they would realize that their situations are not as pessimistic as they subjectively perceived. In addition, observing these similar others who are successfully adapting to their adverse situations would make them realize that there is a hopeful future <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Yoshida, 1993)</ref>. As a result, they can assess their situation more objectively, which helps to develop an optimistic worldview.</p><p>Leisure-generated resources and manageability. Manageability is defined within SOC as the extent to which people perceive they have adequate resources at their disposal to meet the demands of internal and external stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Antonovsky, 1979)</ref>. Leisure-generated resources may influence manageability in two ways. First, leisure activities provide opportunities to employ their problem solving skills, and experience a sense of control <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Caldwell, 2005)</ref>. Previous studies with individuals with depression reported that leisure contributed to sense of control <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Fullagar, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Nimrod, Kleiber, and Berdychevsky, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Second, leisure-generated resources can also influence manageability through stresscoping. The role of leisure as a stress-coping resource has been studied for more than two decades (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Coleman &amp; Iso-Ahola, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Craike &amp; Coleman, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Iwasaki &amp; Mannell, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Iwasaki et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Nagata, McCormick, &amp; Piatt, 2018)</ref> with some consensus on the ways through which leisure can be a resource to manage stressors. One approach is that leisure can be employed to divert attention from negative feelings associated with stress, producing a palliative effect on the experience of stressors <ref type="bibr">(Havitz &amp; Mannell, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Kleiber, Walker, &amp; Mannell, 2011)</ref>. Another stress coping resource that may be derived from leisure behavior is the experience of positive emotional states <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Denovan &amp; Macaskill, 2017)</ref> which have been shown to build durable personal resources such as resilience, which is defined as an ability to adapt to stress and recover from the ill effect from stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fredrickson, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">2013)</ref>. According to the Broaden and Build Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fredrickson, 2004)</ref>, temporary achievement of relief in combination with the uplifted moods through leisure contributes to increased motivation to manage problems at hand. Finally, leisure may provide a stress resistance resource through the development of social relationships and the ensuing support from those contacts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Iwasaki and Mannell (2000)</ref> characterized this coping resource as leisure companionship, noting that "when experiencing stress, a person actually seeks out companionship" (p. 168), adding that discretionary contacts, such as those made through voluntary relationships formed through leisure, are more important stress buffers than those derived from less discretionary contacts.</p><p>Leisure-generated resources and meaningfulness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Antonovsky (1987)</ref> characterized meaningfulness as the motivational element of SOC, referring to the extent to which one can make emotional sense of life, and see that at least some of life's challenges are worth investment of energy, engagement and commitment. Previous research suggested that leisure-generated resources may influence in meaningfulness through its meaning-making processes. Some individuals would realize their life meaning through self-discovery that takes place in leisure context, and others would perceive their life meaning by social connectedness that are created through their leisure pursuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Iwasaki, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Iwasaki, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Porter, 2009)</ref>. These meaningmaking processes through leisure provide opportunities to experience that their lives are meaningful.</p><p>Another potential association with meaningfulness is through identity and self-worth. For example, identity loss and lack of self-worth are major issues in the context of living with depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Karp, 1994)</ref>, but engaging in activities people truly valued in the past can reassure them of who they are, and regain lost identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Fullagar, 2008)</ref>. In addition, positive social interactions that happen in leisure can influence one's sense of self-worth through making a small difference in someone else's life such as making people smile and laugh during leisure engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Nimrod et al., 2012)</ref>. Identity and self-worth are known to be predictors of resisting and adapting to the life demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Miller-Smedema et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical studies on relationship between leisure-generated resources and SOC.</head><p>Although a small number of studies have examined the direct associations between leisuregenerated resources and SOC, findings have been positive. In a cross sectional study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lammel (2003)</ref> examined the relationships between leisure-derived social support, intrapersonal outcomes of leisure, including self-efficacy and meaning of leisure, and SOC among adults with traumatic brain injury. Leisure-derived social support was measured with subscales from Leisure</p><p>Coping Belief Scale and Leisure Coping Strategy Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Iwasaki &amp;Mannell, 2000)</ref>, intrapersonal outcomes of leisure was developed by the author based on multiple existing scales, and SOC was measured with 13-item Orientation to Life Questionnaire (SOC-13; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Antonovsky, 1987)</ref>. The results of multiple regression analysis found a significant relationship between leisure-derived social support and SOC; however, there was no significant association between intrapersonal outcomes of leisure and SOC. The limitations of the study were the author-developed intrapersonal outcome measurement and small sample size, which might have been resulted in an inaccurate estimation of the relationship with SOC. In contrast, a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lee et al. (2018)</ref> that used standardized scales and significantly larger sample (n=423) reported that positive leisure attitude and self-efficacy were associated with better SOC among community-living retired older adults. Although the results of structural equation modeling demonstrated positive associations between leisure attitude (Leisure Attitude Scale: Tiexeira &amp; Frier, 2013), leisure self-efficacy (New General Self-Efficacy Scale: Chen, Gully, &amp; Eden, 2001), and SOC (SOC-13: <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Antonovsky, 1987)</ref>, the relationships were relatively weak (.16 -.36). Additionally, a cluster randomized controlled trial with individuals with psychiatric diagnoses that provided weekly meetings to engage in physical leisure activities, found statistically significant improvement in SOC (SOC-13, Antonovsky, 1987) over 12 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Forsberg et al., 2010)</ref>. The intervention, however, was group-based and prescribed, thus it is not clear if the participants regarded the activities as their leisure.</p><p>These pieces of evidence demonstrate a link between leisure-generated resources and SOC; however, it is far from conclusive and generalizable for individuals with depression. One consistent issue across the above studies is the instrument used to measure leisure. The previous studies did not measure constructs that are most relevant to stress resistance (i.e., leisure coping and meaning derived from leisure) with reliable and valid instruments. In addition, the sampling population of the previous studies might not be generalizable to the population with depression because people with depression have been shown to have lower levels of SOC <ref type="bibr">(Carsten &amp; Spangenberg, 1997)</ref> and have different patterns in leisure involvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Blanco &amp; Barnett, 2014)</ref> compared to people without depression. To clarify the relationship between leisure and SOC among individuals with depression, valid and reliable measures for leisure-generated resources with samples with depression are necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relationship between Leisure-generated Resources, Stress, and Depressive Symptoms</head><p>There are mixed results regarding the relationship between leisure and stress. <ref type="bibr">Iwasaki (2003)</ref> examined the relationship between leisure coping and stress among police and emergency response service workers. Leisure coping was measured with Leisure Coping Strategy Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Iwasaki &amp; Mannell, 2000)</ref>, and stress was measured with a researcher-developed instrument that consisted of potential stressful life events that were identified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Mattlin et al. (1990)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Moos and Moos (1994)</ref>. Although structural equation modeling in this study identified no significant direct relationship between leisure coping and stress, leisure coping did contribute to immediate adaptational outcomes to address stressful events <ref type="bibr">(Iwasaki, 2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chang (2015)</ref> examined associations between leisure social support, leisure self-determination, and stress among community dwelling older adults (mean age = 76.20; n=322) and nursing home dwelling older adults (mean age = 79.41; n=141) in Taiwan. Leisure social support was measured with Leisure Social Support Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Iwasaki &amp; Mannell, 2000)</ref>, leisure self-determination was measured with Leisure Self-Determination Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chang &amp; Yu, 2013)</ref>, and stress was measured with Perceived Stress Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983)</ref>. The results of multiple regression analysis found that leisure social support and leisure self-determination were significant predictors of stress. Although the results from both studies support a relationship between stress and leisure, highly specified samples who might be already resistant to stress like police and emergency response workers and who might be vulnerable to stress like older adults makes the findings difficult to generalize into a population with depression. In addition, inconsistency of the stress measurements, such as life events measure of Iwasaki's and subjective experience measure of Chang's, makes it difficult to compare their results.</p><p>In contrast, relationships between leisure-generated resources and depressive symptoms consistently demonstrate significant inverse associations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Janke et al. (2008)</ref> investigated the associations between leisure participation and depressive symptoms among adult women, including widows (mean age = 68.5). Leisure participation measure was a self-report instrument including informal, formal, and physical leisure participation frequency, rated with 6-point scale.</p><p>Depressive symptoms was measured with modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D: <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Radloff, 1977)</ref>. The results of a multiple regression analyses found that all types of leisure participation were significant predictor of depressive symptoms (β = .39 -.44). <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Lu (2011)</ref> examined the relationship between leisure-generated meaning and depressive symptoms using a Taiwanese representative middle-age sample, which was consisted of 1,143 individuals (46.8% male) who were age 45 to 64 (mean age = 56.19). Leisure-generated meaning was measured with selected items from Leisure Satisfaction Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beard &amp; Ragheb, 1980)</ref>, and depressive symptoms were measured with the CES-D <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Radloff, 1977)</ref>. The results of regression analysis found a weak but significant inverse relationship between leisure-generated meaning and depressive symptoms, after controlling for demographics, physical health, and social support. As highlighted by the above results, active engagement in life, through behaviors such as leisure, made a difference in clinical outcomes such as depression; however, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Caldwell (2005)</ref> theorized, the mechanism of change might have been through improved SOC. It is not clear if the effect of leisure on depression is explained completely by SOC, or there might be other factors that are beyond SOC. To date, no study has examined the mediating role of SOC between leisure-generated resources and depression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary and Proposed Model</head><p>Stress tolls individuals with depression because it causes and exacerbates depressive symptoms. Therefore, the ability to resist the ill-effects of stress, as represented by SOC, needs to be strengthened. Theoretically, leisure-generated resources might strengthen SOC; however, there is insufficient evidence from direct examination to confirm this effect. Based on a review of the current literature, a structural model was proposed (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The current study aimed to examine this model in order to: (a) identify the concurrent relationship between leisure-generated resources and sense of coherence (SOC) among adults with depression; and (b) identify the direct association between leisure-generated resources and depressive symptoms as well as indirect associations of leisure-generated resources through SOC and stress among the same population.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> around here</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The protocol of the current study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Indiana University. Participants were recruited from an outpatient psychiatric service facility, local depression support groups, an online depression research portal, and a state-wide research registry to participate in an anonymous online survey. Self-selection bias is possible in such volunteer approaches such that those who are interested in the topic may more likely to participate. In order to assess the degree of bias, a 4-item scale that measured the centrality of leisure to participants was included in the survey. 1 The inclusion criteria were people who were ages 18 or older, and who self-reported being diagnosed at some point in their lives with depression. A total of 155 individuals (59 males and 96 females) comprised the sample and were analyzed in the current study. A summary of sample demographic information is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1 around here</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments</head><p>Perceived stress. Perceived stress was defined as the concurrent burden an individual felt from major life events s/he experienced recently. A modified version of the Social Stress Indicator (SSI: <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Turner, Wheaton, &amp; Lloyd, 1995)</ref> was used to capture perceived stress. This instrument asks respondents to report their experience of 34 common negative life events in the past 12 months. The SSI was chosen because of its conciseness to minimize the mental burden of the participants, as other life event instruments have larger numbers of items (e.g., 102 items in the Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Interview (PERI) Life Events Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dohrenwend et al., 1978)</ref>; 43 items in the Social Readjustment Rating Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Holmes &amp; Rahe, 1967)</ref> . The authors modified this instrument with a follow-up question for each event, asking the extent to which the life event currently bothers them. The answer choices included "1 = a little", "2 = somewhat", and "3 = quite a bit". These responses were used for weighting each experienced life event, and the sum of the weighted scores were used as the perceived stress scores. The nature of the checklist-type instrument makes it difficult to establish reliability; however, a previous study reported a concurrent association with depression (r = .24), which serves as an evidence of validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Glazier et al., 2004)</ref> Depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were measured with the short version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D10: <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andresen, Malmgren, Carter, &amp; Patrick, 1994)</ref>. The questions probe the frequency of depressive symptoms experienced in the past two weeks. CES-D10 was selected because of its consciences and its history of use in research with individuals with depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andresen, et al., 1994)</ref>. A previous factor analysis study reported that the scale had only one construct with a psychiatric sample, and had a high Cronbach's alpha (α = .89: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Björgvinsson, Kertz, Bigda-Peyton, McCoy, &amp; Aderka, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sense of coherence (SOC).</head><p>To be consistent with the previous studies, SOC-13 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Antonovsky, 1987)</ref> was selected to measure participants' SOC. The SOC-13 has three dimensions (i.e., comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness). Sample questions and answer choices are "do you have the feeling that you are in an unfamiliar situation and don't know what to do," 1 = very often, 7 = very seldom or never (comprehensibility); "has it happened that people whom you counted on disappointed you," 1 = always happened, 7 = never happened (manageability); and "doing the thing you do every day is:" 1 = a source of pain and boredom, 7 = a source of deep pleasure and satisfaction (meaningfulness). According to <ref type="bibr">Eriksson and Mittelmark (2016)</ref>, the original SOC scale was meant to be unidimensional <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Antonovsky, 1993)</ref>, but more recent studies found that the three subdimensions could be separated factors under an overarching factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Feldt et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kivimäki et al., 2010)</ref>. Thus, the current study followed the second-order three-factor model. The internal consistency of the SOC-13 has been found to be satisfactory across different ages (α = .85 -.86: <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Feldt et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Leisure-generated resources. Leisure-resources was operationalized as perceived experiences and outcomes from leisure participation. It was treated as a latent variable with two indicators: a measure of meaning gained from leisure, and a measure of the intentional and situational use of and the perceived effect of leisure in coping with stressful situations (i.e., leisure coping). These indicators were selected because those constructs reflect the discussed relevance to SOC.</p><p>Meaning gained from leisure. The multidimensional meaning that participants gained through leisure participation (i.e., connection and belonging, internal balance, identity, control and power, freedom and autonomy, and competence and mastery) was measured with the Leisure Meaning Gained Scale (LGMS: <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Porter, 2009)</ref>. It consists of 28 items with 5-point Likert type scales. The LMGS prompts participants to recall their favorite leisure activity, and asks a number of questions regarding meaning gained from the activity. Sample questions include "it makes me feel a sense of wholeness: more together," and "it is a time when I can speak my mind and do what I want to do." The response options ranged from 1 = never, to 5 = always. The summed total score was used. A previous study with participants with mental illness reported high internal consistency of the scale (α = .94: <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Iwasaki et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The use and effect of leisure coping. The Leisure Coping Strategy Scale (LCSS: <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Iwasaki &amp; Mannell, 2000)</ref> was used to measure the extent to which individuals use leisure in stressful situations as well as perceived effectiveness of leisure in coping with stress. The LCSS includes items regarding positive coping influences to frame both intention of stress-coping and unintentional results <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Iwasaki &amp; Mannell, 2000)</ref>. The LCSS primed participants by stating typical cases of leisure stress-coping: sometimes, they might use leisure intentionally as stress coping strategy, and other times, they might engage in leisure with other reasons but it turned out to be a stress relief. Then, the LCSS prompts participants to recall stressful situations they experienced in the past month and how they dealt with stress. The LCSS has 9 items with 7point Likert-type scale. Sample questions include "leisure helped me manage my negative feeling," "leisure provided me an opportunity to gain renewed energy to better deal with stress," and "spending leisure time with my friends helped me better deal with stress." Response options ranged from 1 = very strongly disagree to 7 = very strongly agree. The summed total score was used. The LCSS has demonstrated good internal consistency with individuals with mental illness (α = .93: <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Iwasaki et al, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Covariates. At the end of the survey, covariates including age in years, sex (female = 1, and male = 2), and the categories of highest education level completed were included.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary Analyses</head><p>The internal consistency of the CES-D scale was α=.85 within the current sample. In addition, the SOC total scale as well as subdimensions demonstrated adequate internal consistency: SOC total scale α = .87; comprehensibility α = .71; manageability α =.62; and meaningfulness α = .76. SOC was treated as a latent variable with three subscales as indicators.</p><p>Finally, the leisure-generated resources scales of leisure meaning and leisure coping demonstrated good reliability with internal consistencies of α=.89 and α=.90, respectively. Mean, standard deviation (SD), skewness, and kurtosis of the variables are shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. The original scale of perceived stress had severe skewness and kurtosis (Mean = 5.88, SD = 5.45, Skewness = 2.05, Kurtosis = 5.29), thus the scale was log-transformed.

The non-significant results of model fit chi-square test suggested that the model adequately fit the data. The point estimate of RMSEA suggested a fair fit. The other indices including CFI, TLI, and SRMR suggested a good fit. The significant results of the baseline chisquare test suggested that the model is significantly better than the baseline (i.e., no relationships among variables).</p><p>Standardized parameter estimates are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">4</ref>. The final model with standardized coefficients are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. There were significant effects from leisureresources to SOC (β = .484, p &lt; .001), and leisure-resources to depressive symptoms (β = -.333, p &lt; .001). The results suggest that one SD increase in leisure-resources would bring about .484 SD increase in SOC and .333 SD decrease in depressive symptoms. Leisure-resources did not have a significant effect on perceived stress (β = .207, p = .066). The relationship between SOC and depressive symptoms (β = -.290, p = .001) and SOC and perceived stress (β = -.227, p = .041) were significant. The results suggest that one SD increase in SOC would bring about .290 SD decrease in depressive symptoms and .227 SD decrease in perceived stress.</p><p>Leisure-generated resources latent variable was also associated with depressive symptoms indirectly. There was a significant path from leisure-generated resources through SOC to depressive symptoms (.484 × -.290 = -.140, p &lt; .01), while there were two nonsignificant paths from leisure-generated resources through SOC and perceived stress to depressive symptoms (.484 × -.227 × .217 = -.024, p = .118) and from leisure through perceived stress to depressive symptoms (.207 × .217 = .045, p = .137).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The purposes of the current study were to: (a) identify the concurrent relationships among leisure-resources and SOC; and (b) identify direct and indirect associations between leisure-resources and depression, through SOC and stress. Findings demonstrated that there was a significant positive relationship between leisure-generated resources and SOC, and that leisure had a significant direct and indirect effect on depressive symptoms. The final model indicated that 36.4% of the variance in depressive symptoms was explained by leisure resources, SOC, and stress. In total, the current study demonstrated the link between resources derived from leisuregenerated resources and SOC, and different pathways such leisure resources can influence depressive symptoms among individuals with depression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Association between Leisure-Generated Resources and SOC</head><p>There was a positive association between resources derived through leisure and SOC, and the degree of association was nontrivial (β = .484, p &lt; .01). This finding supports the hypothesis introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Caldwell (2005)</ref> regarding possible links between leisure and SOC. The current study provided stronger evidence to demonstrate the link by addressing an issue in existing empirical studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lammel (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lee et al. (2018), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Forsberg et al. (2010)</ref>. Namely, we used valid and reliable measures for leisure-generated resources. The current study exemplified that leisure-generated resources may help to build SOC among individuals with depression.</p><p>One potential reason for the strong association may be through social support obtained through leisure. In a study that followed individuals with depression 12 months after their first episode of major depression, persons who did not recover had lower social support as well as lower SOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Skärsäter et al., 2005)</ref>. Leisure is well known as a venue to develop social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Coleman, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Glover &amp; Parry, 2008)</ref>. The instruments used in the current study, meaning gained from leisure and leisure coping, have social components including connections to others, belonging to a group, and companionship <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Iwasaki &amp; Mannell, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Porter, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, experiences derived from leisure's social aspects may be associated with the dimensions of SOC. First, social interactions in leisure can influence comprehensibility through developing close relationships that facilitate talking about problems openly with others and bringing about a catharsis <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Scott &amp; Godbey, 1992)</ref>. Second, social support developed through shared leisure can influence manageability because it creates social resources to solve problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Coleman &amp; Iso-Ahola, 1993)</ref>. Finally, social interactions and engagement provides a basis for meaning making through sharing experience, and development of relationships in which people feel they are needed and important <ref type="bibr">(Argentzell, Hakansson, &amp; Eklund 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Nimrod et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Another potential reason for the strong association between leisure and SOC is the sense of control people often experience when engaging in leisure. Individuals experience their own time and space during leisure, which are controlled by themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kleiber et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Porter, 2009)</ref>. Those opportunities to feel a sense of control are important for individuals with depression because they may not experience a sense of control in other arenas of their daily life <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Fullagar, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Nimrod et al., 2012)</ref>. In addition, if individuals use a leisure activity for coping with stress, they are exercising their control and possibly regaining a sense of control over life <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Iwasaki &amp; Mannell, 2000)</ref>. The sense of control itself may be strongly associated with manageability, and the perception that one has a place or a setting under one's control is a source of comprehensibility. In short, meaning gained through leisure and leisure coping strategies may have captured the factors that are associated with components of SOC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Association between Leisure-Generated Resources and Depressive Symptoms through SOC and Stress</head><p>The current study adds clarification to the understanding of the relationship of leisure and depressive symptoms. Leisure-generated resources had a direct effect on depressive symptoms (β = -.333, p &lt; .01), and it was significant after the effect of SOC, stress, and sex were statistically controlled. SOC, as a stress-resistant disposition, is known as a predictor of lower depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Carstens &amp; Spangenberg, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Skärsäter et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Weissbecker et al., 2002)</ref>. The results implied that leisure-generated resources had effects on depressive symptoms that are not explained by SOC, which was not clear from the previous studies. Some potential factors that might not be explained by SOC are diversion and positive emotions derived from leisure <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kleiber et al., 2002)</ref>. The findings of the current study asserts that leisure-generated resources have significant effects on depressive symptoms beyond SOC.</p><p>The relationship between leisure and stress is another finding of the current study. The results found the direct path from leisure-generated resources and stress was non-significant, which is consistent with <ref type="bibr">Iwasaki's study (2003)</ref>. However, the current study also found an indirect path from leisure-generated resources to stress through SOC. It suggests that leisure might not control stress itself, but may contribute to dispositions such as SOC and building stress-resistance resources.</p><p>As a whole, leisure-generated resources were directly and indirectly associated with depressive symptoms through SOC and stress. In total, the effect size of leisure-generated resources was medium (β = .484, p &lt; .01). <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Iwasaki et al. (2014)</ref> stated that the extent of active engagement in life, such as leisure behavior, predicts recovery and overall health among individuals with mental illness. The findings of the current study imply that perhaps the impact of active engagement in life on overall health was partially mediated by improving a person's orientation toward life in general as well as how to deal with stress. Leisure is often overlooked in depression studies and treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Davidson et al., 2006)</ref>; however, the results of the current study highlighted a potential contribution to lower depression outcomes, and it suggests that leisure is worth including in future depression research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>The fact that meaning gained from leisure and leisure coping strategies composed a reliable measure has practical implications. The final model found that, in combination, meaning gained through leisure and leisure coping strategies were strongly associated with SOC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Carstens and Spangenberg (1997)</ref> stated that active engagement in life is a source of SOC.</p><p>Narratives from women who were on a path of recovery from depression similarly highlighted the point that personally meaningful activities gave them a break from being a constrained and stigmatized self and rediscover a true self <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Fullagar, 2008)</ref>. Personally meaningful leisure activities and the use of them as coping strategies has strong potential to improve SOC. In psychiatric services, coping skill development is an important intervention, and clients may be taught to use leisure as a coping strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hutchinson, Bland, &amp; Kleiber, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Snethen, McCormick, &amp; Van Puymbroeck, 2012)</ref>. The results of the current study indicate that leisure activities that are seen as meaningful to the individual are associated with fewer symptoms and better stress management. Practitioners should help reinforce the benefits to their clients of those leisure behaviors to which they are already attached, or help the clients learn a new activity with cultivated meaning.</p><p>The final model of the current study highlighted the benefits of leisure, but previous studies demonstrated that individuals with depression have disadvantages in making use of leisure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Breslin, Gnam, Franche, Mustard, &amp; Lin, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Nimrod et al., 2012)</ref>. Constraints such as anhedonia and amotivation should be treated appropriately by medical professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Craske, Meuret, Ritz, Treanor, &amp; Dour, 2016)</ref>. Psychiatric service providers will need to address such constraints while helping clients to regain leisure functioning, and professionals specifically trained in these areas, such as recreational therapists, may be particularly useful <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hood &amp; Carruthers, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Dieser, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Although the findings of this study are promising, some limitations regarding the nature of this study should be taken into consideration. First, the sample was drawn from volunteers and did not involve randomization. Although participants were recruited via different venues, the generalizability of the findings across all those with major depressive diagnoses is unknown.</p><p>Second, this study utilized a cross-sectional design; thus, causal assumptions cannot be made. Thus, while it establishes the constructs co-vary, it cannot be determined that leisure-generated resources causes SOC. Future studies should utilize longitudinal and or experimental designs to clarify.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Leisure-generated resources, such as leisure coping and leisure-generated meaning, were associated with higher stress resistance capacity, which was represented by SOC. The empirical evidence of the link between leisure-generated resources and SOC confirms the claims of existing literature. A stronger SOC was associated with lower stress level as well as lower depressive symptoms. Leisure generated resources had both a direct and indirect relationship with depressive symptoms, and the effect size was found to be nontrivial. The current study demonstrated the significance of leisure behavior within a model including major contributors to the onset, maintenance and recovery from depression. Interventions that involve leisure behavior are a largely untested approach to resist the ill effects of stress among people with major depression; however, continued replication research and further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the link among leisure, SOC, stress, and depression. Footnotes 1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Antonovsky's (1987)</ref> meaningfulness is a nuanced construct. The premise of this is that meaninglessness cause a surrender to stress. Meaninglessness, in Antonovsky's term, means lack of life goals, not caring what goes on around the person, and pessimistic future outlook. Thus, a person who feels meaninglessness give up resisting with the stress. Meaningfulness, thus, involves in having life goals, care for surroundings, and positive future outlook.</p><p>2.
