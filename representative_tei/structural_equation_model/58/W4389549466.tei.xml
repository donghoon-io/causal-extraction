<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In the last several years, information security management (ISM) researchers have investigated the behaviors of employees or organizational insiders that lead to serious organizational security problems and other incidents. These behaviors often result from inadequate or nonexistent training, carelessness, job stress, personal financial distress, low morale, malicious noncompliance, technostress, criminal computer abuse, poor management, poor controls or monitoring, lack of measurement, lack of incentives, or poor institutional influence or governance <ref type="bibr">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr">26,</ref><ref type="bibr">86,</ref><ref type="bibr">97,</ref><ref type="bibr">151]</ref>. Many organizations have thus adopted a peoplecentric security paradigm that focuses on improving employees' security posture and, more ideally, transforming them into allies who actively protect organizational assets <ref type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr">86,</ref><ref type="bibr">118,</ref><ref type="bibr">148]</ref>. Establishing security training and awareness (SETA) programs <ref type="bibr">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b253">135]</ref>; forming information security policies <ref type="bibr">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr">46,</ref><ref type="bibr">52]</ref>; and promoting buy-in and cultural support from organizational leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b192">74]</ref> are well-known related organizational practices.</p><p>Existing ISM research offers some guidance on the use of various incentives and persuasion theories and techniques to motivate change in employee behavior in real organizational settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">[135]</ref>. Protection motivation theory (PMT) has become a leading theory in ISM research [e.g., <ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">82,</ref><ref type="bibr">83,</ref><ref type="bibr">104,</ref><ref type="bibr">112,</ref><ref type="bibr">117,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b249">131,</ref><ref type="bibr">147]</ref> because it explains a person's motivations to engage in adaptive and protective responses based on their personal appraisals of the threats involved and their ability to adaptively deal with them. PMT originated from health research <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr">119,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b244">126]</ref> and uses persuasive messaging-called fear appeals-to communicate threat and efficacy to foster protection motivation (PM). 1 The extended parallel process model (EPPM), a related theory <ref type="bibr">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr">153,</ref><ref type="bibr">154]</ref>, claims to make crucial improvements to PMT, and because the EPPM includes defensive motivation (DM), ISM research has used it widely as an alternative to PMT.</p><p>Three recent ISM publications have leveraged the EPPM as a variance model <ref type="bibr">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr">109,</ref><ref type="bibr">148]</ref>, and several ISM studies, though framed as PMT studies, have adopted EPPM assumptions, some of which conflict with PMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr">100,</ref><ref type="bibr">106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b254">136]</ref>. As a result of using PMT and the EPPM as well as their derivative theoriessuch as the technology threat avoidance theory (TTAT) and the health belief model (HBM)-the broader ISM fear-appeals literature has now amassed a large body of empirical findings. However, many unresolved empirical and theoretical inconsistencies in the findings have emerged in the ISM fear-appeals literature. In our review of 341 empirical ISM fear-appeals articles (Appendix A), we identify three major areas of inconsistency and disagreement that need to be addressed: <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> disagreement on the nature of threat appraisal and coping appraisal and how to measure and predict them; <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> disagreement on the relative importance of fear and how to model and measure it; and (3) disagreement on the importance of accounting for maladaptive predictors and maladaptive outcomes such as emotionfocused coping. The aim of our study is to empirically address several of these controversies using an advanced form of meta-analysis called two-stage meta-analytic structural equation modeling (TSSEM).</p><p>Next, we further address our motivation to address these three areas of research controversy.</p><p>First, explanations of the effects of key predictors of PM vary widely among ISM fear-appeals studies in terms of the roles of threat appraisal and coping appraisal. Formally, two appraisal processes that foster PM occur in both PMT and the EPPM. The first is the threat-appraisal process; the second is the process of coping (efficacy) appraisal, which is triggered only if a personally relevant threat arises. Many studies have advocated modeling the effects of threat constructs and efficacy constructs based on the assumption that threat and efficacy contribute equally to PM <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">117,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b249">131]</ref>, which is not necessarily true. Other studies have emphasized the importance of fostering coping appraisals or efficacy without first formally modeling the effects of threat and fear <ref type="bibr">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr">81,</ref><ref type="bibr">92,</ref><ref type="bibr">148]</ref>. Many other studies have used mixed and sometimes conflicting conceptualization approaches to these processes and their related constructs. For example, an ISM study found a negative relationship between threat and efficacy <ref type="bibr">[82]</ref>; another study added fear but dropped self-efficacy <ref type="bibr">[163]</ref>; and another used response efficacy as a predictor of threat <ref type="bibr">[85]</ref>. Some studies have used threat as a direct predictor of efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">70,</ref><ref type="bibr">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b247">129]</ref>, whereas others have omitted efficacy altogether and focused on threat <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">53,</ref><ref type="bibr">89]</ref>. Other research has considered multiple forms of efficacy <ref type="bibr">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr">19]</ref>. Finally, scores of studies have made related decisions about the threat-or coping-appraisal process that departed from core assumptions of PMT and the EPPM or mixed the two theories. These issues raise the question of how to properly model the threat-and coping-appraisal processes, including their associated constructs, when conducting ISM fear-appeals-based research and practice:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ1.</head><p>To what extent do threat appraisal and coping appraisal promote PM in a fear-appeals context, and how should they be modeled?</p><p>Second, ISM research has used fear inconsistently, and several debates concerning threat and fear have long simmered even in ISM research that uses PMT <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">83,</ref><ref type="bibr">112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b249">131,</ref><ref type="bibr">147,</ref><ref type="bibr">149]</ref>. Some researchers have argued that fear (operationalized through fear appeals) applies only in personal contexts, not organizational contexts <ref type="bibr">[149]</ref>, implying that fear may be entirely irrelevant in an ISM context. By contrast, other studies advocate using a "full PMT model," along with fear appeals, to motivate subjects to protect themselves <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b249">131]</ref>. More recent research argues that fear is involved differentially in predicting both PM and defensive motivation (DM), a path that is implied but not modeled with PMT <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>. These inconsistencies could be due in part to the complete omission of fear in the original conceptualization of PMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">[124]</ref>, but later research directly included fear as a result of a breakthrough meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[58]</ref>. Moreover, many ISM researchers appeared to be following older PMT assumptions by excluding fear or otherwise decided that fear was not important enough to consider. In our review of 383 empirical ISM fear-appeals studies (from 341 articles), 292 studies (76.2%) did not use fear appeals and did not measure fear; 29 studies (7.6%) measured fear but did not use fear appeals; 25 studies (6.5%) used fear appeals but did not measure fear; finally, only 37 studies (9.7%) used fear appeals and measured fear. Clearly, there is disagreement over and perhaps a fundamental misunderstanding of the relative importance of fear and its measurement in this body of research. This problem leads to our second research question: RQ2. What is the role of fear and its relative importance in fostering PM and DM in ISM fear-appeals research, and how should fear be modeled with these outcomes?</p><p>A final example of divergent claims and findings in ISM fear-appeals research relates directly to the use of single-route versus dual-route models and associated assumptions. PMT is a single-route model focused on the prediction of PM and omits the maladaptive path leading to DM, a fear-control response whereby a person attempts to control their emotional response to fear instead of resolving the situation that has elicited the fear <ref type="bibr">[153,</ref><ref type="bibr">154]</ref>. Response costs and maladaptive rewards are maladaptive constructs that reduce employees' PM and are included as core assumptions of PMT <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b244">126]</ref>. Conversely, the EPPM, a dual-path model, includes the adaptive PM path and maladaptive DM path; however, the EPPM omits PMT's maladaptive constructs of response costs and maladaptive rewards in the interest of parsimony <ref type="bibr">[153]</ref><ref type="bibr">[154]</ref><ref type="bibr">[155]</ref>. In our review of empirical ISM fear-appeals articles, we find that several PMT-based ISM studies <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">117,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b249">131,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b250">132]</ref> have strongly advocated the use of response costs and maladaptive rewards, whereas several studies have omitted these constructs entirely <ref type="bibr">[82,</ref><ref type="bibr">83,</ref><ref type="bibr">145]</ref> or used only one of the constructs <ref type="bibr">[102,</ref><ref type="bibr">105,</ref><ref type="bibr">113,</ref><ref type="bibr">163]</ref>. Moreover, several PMT-based ISM studies have departed from PMT by adding DM-in effect creating dual-route models that more explicitly acknowledge emotion-focused coping and maladaptive outcomes <ref type="bibr">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr">48,</ref><ref type="bibr">100,</ref><ref type="bibr">106,</ref><ref type="bibr">114]</ref>, thus aligning their models more closely with the EPPM. A few other PMT-based studies have ignored PM and focused solely on maladaptive outcomes (i.e., DM) <ref type="bibr">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b246">128]</ref>. Others have added a maladaptive coping process or mediation but have focused only on adaptive outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">[137,</ref><ref type="bibr">162]</ref>. Given the broad use of response costs and maladaptive rewards in the PMT literature, this inconsistency raises the question of whether ISM research that explicitly predicts dual routes that include maladaptive outcomes is justified in omitting these constructs, which is the current operating assumption in these studies [cf. <ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">95,</ref><ref type="bibr">148]</ref>. Overall, the inconsistent use of dual routes and of maladaptive predictors and outcomes in ISM fear-appeals research has resulted in a quandary about how and why they should be modeled. This quandary leads to our final research question: RQ3. What is the relative importance of maladaptive influences and outcomes and single-and dualroute models in ISM fear-appeals research, and how should these be modeled?</p><p>To address these challenging research questions, we employ TSSEM, the latest second-generation meta-analysis technique, which combines covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) and meta-analysis. Our study is the first in the ISM fear-appeals literature to use TSSEM. Formally, a metaanalysis quantitatively determines the significance and reliability of corroborating or conflicting findings across numerous studies in a specific domain of scientific literature. CB-SEM is used to test hypotheses and to estimate goodness-of-fit indices for theoretical models and the empirical data used for analysis. IS researchers have traditionally used meta-analysis for structural equation modeling (MASEM) for such purposes, but this approach has several serious statistical flaws that increase type I and type II errors <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[79]</ref>, as we explain in the method and analysis sections. Using TSSEM with random-effects analyses that overcome MASEM's flaws and by fully addressing potential file drawer biases allow us to generalize findings outside of the unique studies our analysis includes <ref type="bibr">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">65,</ref><ref type="bibr">121]</ref>. To do so, we used 341 systematically selected empirical ISM articles (representing 383 unique studies) to pool a large series of five datasets to test six models, from which we examine the effects of constructs and paths in the ISM fearappeals literature. We compare and test six versions of PMT and the EPPM, which are inspired by questions that arise from our analysis of the broader fear-appeals literature. The largest sample size for a given model was 153,507 and the smallest was 145,331. Next, we address the theoretical foundation, the tensions in the literature, and the hypotheses that serve as the basis of our TSSEM analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Foundation of ISM Fear-Appeals Research Early Fear-Appeals Models on Which Later Models Build</head><p>The prevailing fear-appeal approaches used in empirical ISM research to explain insiders' security intentions and behaviors are rooted in the fear-as-acquired-drive model <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[71]</ref> and the parallel process model (PPM; also known as the parallel response model) <ref type="bibr">[93]</ref>. Each model posits that an individual's encounter with a perceived threat 2 results in an internal state of fear, which then motivates the threat recipient to take action to reduce the fear. Formally, the fear-as-acquired-drive model assumes that the action an individual initiates to successfully reduce the fear will eventually become the learned, habitual response to the threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[71]</ref>. The premise is that human behavior is a learned response to a subsequent reward. Thus, if an individual encounters a similar threat, the individual will instinctually respond to the threat in the same manner to receive the later reward of reduced fear levels. Accordingly, fear can be reduced adaptively by following recommendations or maladaptively by engaging in defensive avoidance.</p><p>Leventhal's <ref type="bibr">[93]</ref> PPM classifies people's adaptive and maladaptive reactions to fear appeals as <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> an emotionally driven fear-control process or (2) a cognitively driven danger-control process. In the fear-control process, risk appraisal and decision-making are primarily affective-comprising a range of emotional responses to a threat including fear, worry, and anxiety. Consequently, the behavioral reaction is to control the fear through denial, avoidance, or reactance. In the danger-control process, risk appraisal and decision-making are primarily cognitive and thus involve a deliberative process of evaluating the likelihood of vulnerability to the threat and the threat's severity and taking direct actions to avert it. The amount of fear an individual experiences determines which of the two actions they will take, and a moderate level of fear is optimal. Any increase in fear beyond a certain threshold will theoretically increase an individual's propensity to respond maladaptively <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">[80]</ref>. A notable drawback of the PPM, however, is that it explains neither the causal mechanisms nor the situational influences that catalyze each of the processes <ref type="bibr">[116]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PMT Introduced as a Variation of the PPM</head><p>Shortly after the PPM's introduction, Rogers <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">[124]</ref> proposed PMT, building on the PPM with the primary aim of explaining the causal mechanisms in the cognitive danger-control process. He and his colleagues later revised PMT extensively <ref type="bibr">[99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b243">125]</ref> to better explain that two conditional appraisal processes, or causal mechanisms, determine whether a person engages in protection motivation (PM), which is an adaptive danger-control process to protect oneself efficaciously from a threat. First, a person makes a threat appraisal, which is a cognitive calculation of a threat in each situation; this calculation is performed by appraising both (1) threat severity (a person's perception of the threat's seriousness) and (2) threat susceptibility (a person's perception of the likelihood of experiencing the threat) <ref type="bibr">[99,</ref><ref type="bibr">153,</ref><ref type="bibr">157]</ref>. 3 Second, if and only if a person perceives a personally relevant threat, they will engage in a coping appraisal, which is a cognitive appraisal of two components: <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> response efficacy (whether they believe the recommended action will reduce the threat) and (2) self-efficacy (whether they believe they will be able to perform the recommended action) <ref type="bibr">[153,</ref><ref type="bibr">156]</ref>. 4   The EPPM: A Variation of the PPM Introduced to Address Purported Issues with PMT Witte <ref type="bibr">[153,</ref><ref type="bibr">154]</ref> later proposed the EPPM by building on the original PPM danger-control and fear-control outcomes and incorporating the causal mechanisms from the PMT danger-control process. Designed to supplant PMT, the EPPM specified that varying levels in the threat-and coping-appraisal processes can cause adaptive, maladaptive, or no reactions to fear appeals. The EPPM explains that when faced by threats delivered through external stimuli, individuals typically engage in one of two types of response: an attempt to control the danger conveyed by the threat (i.e., an adaptive danger-control response) or an attempt to control the fear arising from the threat (i.e., a maladaptive fear-control response). A danger-control response is an adaptive cognitive state in which a person attempts to control the source of a threat in an effort to reduce or eliminate it through adaptive protective behavior, or PM <ref type="bibr">[156]</ref>. A fear-control response is a maladaptive cognitive state in which a person attempts to control their emotional responses to a threat, primarily fear, instead of responding to the threat itself, resulting in DM <ref type="bibr">[156]</ref>. Thus, the EPPM describes the conditions in which the perceived threat and the perceived efficacy of responding to it interact and thus (mal)adaptively influence different behavioral decisions.</p><p>Aside from the explicit addition of a dual route that includes DM as well as PM, a key difference between PMT and the EPPM is that the latter combines the threat-appraisal constructs-threat susceptibility and threat severity-into one second-order construct, that is, threat <ref type="bibr">[153]</ref>. Likewise, the EPPM combines the two coping-appraisal constructs-response efficacy and self-efficacy-into the second-order construct of efficacy <ref type="bibr">[156]</ref>. The EPPM also posits that modeling maladaptive rewards and response costs undermines parsimony and is unnecessary by the inclusion of the fear-control response, so it omits these constructs.</p><p>These choices have given rise to several of the conflicts that motivate this paper's research questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theory and Hypotheses</head><p>Although the EPPM encompasses theoretical mechanisms from PMT and the original PPM, ISM research and practice have used PMT more heavily-but with several derivations, including several inspired by the EPPM. This environment has led to multiple conflicts in ISM research regarding the modeling of fearappeals constructs, because a few studies have integrated assumptions from each theory (and others) that may not theoretically align when combined into a single model. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> depicts the modeling differences between PMT and the EPPM, and Table <ref type="table">1</ref> provides a summary of the key theoretical differences. 1. Threat and efficacy are combined as second-order constructs from their first-order counterparts. Understanding the role of fear 2. Fear measurement was originally optional. 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Models and Hypothesis Development</head><p>Much of the earlier fear-appeals literature used PMT and the EPPM as process-like models. However, in ISM fear-appeals research, including the most recent EPPM studies-Wang et al. <ref type="bibr">[148]</ref>, Liang et al. <ref type="bibr">[95]</ref>,</p><p>and Chen et al. <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>-PMT and the EPPM are operationalized as variance models. Thus, we model PMT and the EPPM according to extant ISM fear-appeals literature. To address our research questions, we explain the key related empirical and theoretical conflicts exhibited by the literature and propose hypotheses in an effort to resolve some of these conflicts. We then argue that certain assumptions should hold according to the theoretical understanding of PMT and EPPM nomologies.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ1: The Roles and Relative Importance of Threat and Efficacy</head><p>RQ1 concerns the importance of the two appraisal processes (i.e., threat appraisal vs. coping appraisal) and the related constructs (i.e., threat constructs vs. efficacy constructs). We address it to determine which mechanisms and constructs best explain insiders' PM responses in broader ISM fear-appeals research and practice. Both PMT and the EPPM assume that high levels of personally relevant threat are crucial for fostering PM, but only if the perceived threat is supported by high efficacy <ref type="bibr">[99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b243">125,</ref><ref type="bibr">153]</ref>. Several ISM studies have shown a similar empirical pattern and assumed that high levels of threat and high levels of efficacy contribute to PM roughly equally <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">117]</ref>. Still, because various ISM studies have departed from these assumptions, the extant practice recommendations are scattershot. The original PPM <ref type="bibr">[93]</ref> and subsequent fear-appeals research, including studies that have used PMT or the EPPM <ref type="bibr">[99,</ref><ref type="bibr">119,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b242">124,</ref><ref type="bibr">153,</ref><ref type="bibr">154]</ref>, have shown that the threat-appraisal process initiates the coping-appraisal process, but in variance studies, these processes are pragmatically modeled as though they are simultaneous. However, the research has made several departures from the basic assumptions of threat and coping appraisal and their associated constructs.</p><p>For example, some have argued that security threats may not be personally relevant in an organizational context <ref type="bibr">[149]</ref>, but if that is the case then fear would not be generated and a person may not engage in coping appraisal. Therefore, omitting the modeling of threat to focus solely on efficacy may lead to imprecise results, which may lead in turn to faulty recommendations for future research, theory, and practice. If these theories hold, both threat and efficacy should have a considerable influence on PM; moreover, the firstorder constructs of threat (i.e., threat severity and threat vulnerability) and efficacy (i.e., self-efficacy and response efficacy) in PMT and the second-order constructs of threat and efficacy in the EPPM should similarly explain PM. However, these assumptions have not been tested across the results of the entire body of related ISM literature. Assuming these claims hold true in an ISM context, we predict: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ2: The Role of Fear in Fostering PM and DM</head><p>RQ2 addresses the role of fear in the broader ISM fear-appeals literature. Our theoretical review indicates that whereas the EPPM has always viewed the generation (and hence the measurement) of fear as requisite to research and practice, the role of fear in PMT has changed over time. Initially, PMT attributed no role to fear <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">[124]</ref>; then, it conceptualized fear but generally gave precedence to threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">[126]</ref>, so many researchers continued to omit fear; finally, PMT granted fear a pivotal role, especially as an indicator of personallyrelevant-threat generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[58]</ref>. Many recent PMT-based ISM studies have continued the debunked tradition of completely omitting fear modeling and measurement and focusing solely on threat instead, even though PMT maintains that a threat must be significant and personally relevant. This raises the question of whether it is possible to generate a meaningful personal threat without generating or measuring fear as a relevance check [cf. <ref type="bibr">153,</ref><ref type="bibr">154]</ref>.</p><p>We assume that when an insider perceives a threat as relevant and severe, the threat will generate fear as a negative emotional response. As Boss et al. <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> illustrated, in PMT, fear should also serve as at least a partial mediator between threat and PM <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b244">126]</ref>, but it may not have a full mediation role, as the EPPM predicts <ref type="bibr">[154]</ref>. Warkentin et al. <ref type="bibr">[149]</ref> countered that fear likely does not apply well in organizational contexts. However, if fear could be measured in an organizational context as a relevance check, it would offer a pragmatic means of assessing whether the messaging or training employees receive results in behavioral change, as a recent study showed <ref type="bibr" target="#b249">[131]</ref>. In the introduction, we detail how most ISM fear-appeals studies omit both fear appeals and fear measurement. Moreover, recent studies have indicated the presence of dual-channel coping-that is, cognitive alongside emotional coping-in ISM contexts <ref type="bibr">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr">95,</ref><ref type="bibr">148]</ref>. If these indications hold true, both threat (a cognitive phenomenon) and fear (an emotive phenomenon) should influence PM in the ISM context. Thus, we agree with the creators of PMT and the EPPM <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b244">126,</ref><ref type="bibr">154]</ref> and with supporting ISM research <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">147]</ref> that it is important to model both threat and fear and that fear results from a personally relevant threat. Thus, both threat and fear should influence PM in the ISM context, as follows:</p><p>H3. A positive relationship will exist between threat and fear [using the EPPM] and between both (a) threat severity and (b) threat vulnerability and fear [using PMT].</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H5.</head><p>The relationships between threat and PM [using the EPPM] and between both (a) threat severity and (b) threat vulnerability and PM [using PMT] will be mediated by fear.</p><p>Recently, several qualitative ISM articles have made the case that PM and DM are not merely opposites <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr">86,</ref><ref type="bibr">90,</ref><ref type="bibr">91]</ref>. For example, Karjalainen et al. <ref type="bibr">[86]</ref> argued that the literature has led to the misleading conclusion that if a specific mechanism results in compliance, the lack of that mechanism must therefore explain noncompliance. They warned that "such symmetric assumptions" do not "explain cases where the reasons for noncomplian[ce] . . . are different from those for complian[ce]" (p. 689). They also suggested that an employee may change from compliance to noncompliance or vice versa because of changes in efficacy, in job roles, or in working conditions. This claim then relates to the dual-route possibility and the tipping point between compliance and noncompliance proposed by the EPPM <ref type="bibr">[153]</ref>. The EPPM posits a tipping point between compliance and noncompliance that is dependent on the level of fear an individual experiences because of the threat. The EPPM tipping point is engaged "when perceptions of threat begin to outweigh perceptions of efficacy, causing people to shift from danger control to fear control" <ref type="bibr">[156, p. 321]</ref>.</p><p>Chen et al. <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref> recently provided an empirical validation of the tipping-point calculation and its applicability to ISM research. Thus, focusing only on the effect of fear on PM could lead to serious issues in practice. That is, if the EPPM holds, fear could at a certain point foster DM, a maladaptive outcome that can take the form of avoidance, reactance, anger, and the like <ref type="bibr">[154]</ref>. Consequently, the following relationships should be supported if DM were to be added to ISM-based fear appeals models:</p><p>H6. A positive relationship between fear and DM will occur.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H7.</head><p>The relationships between threat and DM [using the EPPM] and between both (a) threat severity and (b) threat vulnerability and DM [using PMT] will be mediated by fear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ3: The Relative Importance of Maladaptive Influences and Outcomes</head><p>Finally, RQ3 concerns a major inconsistency between PMT and the EPPM that strongly affects their relevance for broader ISM fear-appeals research and practice. Fundamentally, PMT is a single-route model, and the EPPM is a dual-route model. The PMT literature models only adaptive pathways and PM because it assumes that adaptive pathways and DM function inversely and that modeling DM is thus unnecessary [cf. <ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">68]</ref>. Based on the premise that this is not the case, the EPPM maintains that both must be addressed or crucial theoretical and practical insights will be lost <ref type="bibr">[153]</ref><ref type="bibr">[154]</ref><ref type="bibr">[155]</ref><ref type="bibr">[156]</ref><ref type="bibr">[157]</ref>.</p><p>We reason that the more pragmatic position for security practice is to consider both adaptive and maladaptive pathways and that doing so should result in improved advice for practitioners. Non-IS EPPM research has shown that these routes, and the related PM and DM, do not function inversely; in fact, DM is much more complex and has more negative possibilities than PM has positive possibilities-including avoidance, reactance, noncompliance, malicious noncompliance, and anger <ref type="bibr">[154]</ref><ref type="bibr">[155]</ref><ref type="bibr">[156]</ref><ref type="bibr">[157]</ref>. In PMT-inspired ISM research, Liang and Xue <ref type="bibr">[94]</ref> further leveraged this response duality in the form of the TTAT, which includes the emotional-coping concept developed by Leventhal <ref type="bibr">[93]</ref>. In EPPM-related ISM research, Moody et al. <ref type="bibr">[109]</ref> integrated constructs from the EPPM into their unified security model, which includes the dual outcomes of intention and reactance. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr">[148]</ref> modified the EPPM to examine anxiety about phishing and conceptualized a second-order construct that included adaptive coping (task-focused)</p><p>and maladaptive coping (emotion-and avoidance-focused). Crucially, they emphasized that coping can take two forms: (1) problem-focused coping (PFC), which is primarily a cognitive approach to addressing the security threat, and (2) emotion-focused coping (EFC). Liang et al. <ref type="bibr">[95]</ref> built on the concepts of PFC and EFC, but on a TTAT foundation. Likewise, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref> operationalized the EPPM in an ISP-compliance context to determine employees' compliance behaviors using PFC (i.e., message acceptance, adaptive behavior) and noncompliance behaviors using EFC (i.e., message rejection, maladaptive behavior), and used the dual roles of PM and DM in the calculation of the tipping point of these outcomes. Thus, in addition to the assumption that adaptative influences will hold-as predicted by both PMT and the EPPM-we assume that maladaptive outcomes will hold and that PM and DM are not merely opposites, such that ISM phenomena are best modeled and dealt with in practice as dual-route phenomena. We thus predict: Another conflict that introduces a paradox into the development of recommendations for practitioners involves the way ISM fear-appeals research has handled maladaptive predictors and outcomes. PMT adds two maladaptive predictors that are considered during threat appraisal (i.e., maladaptive rewards) and coping appraisal (i.e., response costs), but it does not theorize and measure the maladaptive outcome (i.e., DM) represented by the PPM and the EPPM. <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. That is, PMT's account of the threat-appraisal process posits that a person will consider an adaptive response only if the perceived threat outweighs the negative influence of maladaptive rewards (i.e., incentives to ignore a security threat, such as getting back at one's boss or saving time) <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">99]</ref>. PMT further posits that as part of the coping-appraisal process, a person will consider the response costs, which are any expected costs (e.g., money, personal costs, time, or effort) associated with performing the recommended response that can dissuade a person from performing an adaptive coping appraisal <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">58]</ref>. Thus, PMT's account of the coping-appraisal process uniquely posits that a person will behave adaptively only if efficacy is greater than response costs <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">58]</ref>. By contrast, the EPPM fully embraces the representation of both adaptive and maladaptive outcomes but does not directly theorize or measure the actual maladaptive predictors, such as maladaptive rewards and response costs, that lead to DM <ref type="bibr">[153,</ref><ref type="bibr">154]</ref>.</p><p>Several ISM fear-appeals studies have thus modified PMT and the EPPM-and their derivative theories in the form of the TTAT and HBM-by adding, omitting, or interchanging these constructs and assumptions. Following an older PMT discourse, many ISM studies have omitted response costs or maladaptive rewards. By contrast, several PMT-based ISM studies have adopted assumptions and constructs from the EPPM's dual paths. These inconsistencies in the ISM literature <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">147,</ref><ref type="bibr">149]</ref> prompted Wall and Buche <ref type="bibr">[147]</ref> to question why ISM researchers have ignored maladaptive fear-control factors (and fear measurement) despite their crucial role in fear appeals. Our guiding assumption is thus that both maladaptive predictors and outcomes are relevant in the ISM fear-appeals literature; if this assumption holds true, some of the underlying assumptions of ISM fear-appeals research and practice would need to change. Thus, the following hypotheses should hold irrespective of the fear-appeals model used:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H10. (a)</head><p>A negative relationship will exist between response costs and PM, (b) but a positive relationship will exist between response costs and DM.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology: Two-Stage Meta-Analytic Structural Equation Modeling (TSSEM)</head><p>Given the richness of our theorizing and the large volume of empirical studies that have proposed so many disparate results in ISM fear-appeals research, we test our hypotheses and exploratory relationships with an advanced form of meta-analysis that has been refined for CB-SEM. We implemented the latest R packages and refinements of MASEM in an advanced approach, that is, TSSEM <ref type="bibr">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr">30,</ref><ref type="bibr">32,</ref><ref type="bibr">35]</ref>. We pulled and processed the core data from 341 empirical ISM articles (representing 383 distinct empirical studies) to create large, pooled data files of 155,413 observations used to test our ISM models. The methodological purpose of traditional MASEM and TSSEM is the same: to empirically compare and test competing theoretical models and their associated theories and boundary conditions <ref type="bibr">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr">33]</ref>. They differ only in their statistical-analysis assumptions and approaches, which we detail in the analysis section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect Sizes and Meta-Analysis</head><p>MASEM and TSSEM build on meta-analysis, a statistical technique that enables the systematic review of a research stream's literature by combining and analyzing its empirical results <ref type="bibr">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">60,</ref><ref type="bibr">98,</ref><ref type="bibr">146]</ref>. By using the power of effect-size statistics pooled across many studies, meta-analysis can illuminate pragmatic research and practice problems by demonstrating which treatments or relationships are meaningful, thus overcoming the deficiencies of individual papers <ref type="bibr">[155]</ref>. 5 However, meta-analysis is highly limited as an approach to theoretical-model testing:</p><p>Meta-analysis is a fine approach to use when investigating the moderating effects of features of a study . . . (e.g. the year of publication, the country in which data were originally gathered), but does not address theoretical links such as mediation and causation of theoretical variables. <ref type="bibr">[142, p. 473</ref>]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling Approach to Decrease Source Bias</head><p>To decrease source bias, maximize the number of relevant studies included, and increase statistical significance, an effective meta-analysis must involve rigorous and exhaustive searches <ref type="bibr" target="#b252">[134,</ref><ref type="bibr">160]</ref>. Data completeness is one of the most important criteria for conducting a robust meta-analysis <ref type="bibr">[47]</ref>. To decrease source bias, meta-analysis traditionally requires researchers to maximize the number of relevant studies included by conducting rigorous and exhaustive searches that capture all relevant publication sources, including journal articles, book chapters, conference and workshop proceedings, working papers, and dissertations <ref type="bibr">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">160,</ref><ref type="bibr">161]</ref>. By including these additional sources in our literature search, we reduced source bias (i.e., publication bias) <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">56]</ref>. Our sample of ISM papers thus included all extant studies, regardless of whether they were published or unpublished and regardless of their discipline or publication outlet. Working papers were anonymized to protect the integrity of peer review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Target Sample and Search Process</head><p>Our target sampling frame included all available empirical ISM studies accepted, published, or in workingpaper format through the end of March 2022. The studies had to be at least partially based on PMT, the EPPM, or the derivative theories of HBM or TTAT. The oldest publication was from 2005 <ref type="bibr">[158]</ref>. To find all the relevant articles, we performed multiple rounds of a rigorous search and selection process, as follows.</p><p>Two of the authors and two carefully trained research assistants (who were PhD students) performed a redundant and exhaustive search using our target keywords against the full text of articles from multiple research resources. Keyword combinations were divided into two sets, such that an article had to have at least one term in Set A (general topic area) and one term in Set B (general theory area). Set A comprised "security," "privacy," "malware," "password," "intrusion," "policy," "compliance," and "phishing." Set B comprised "protection motivation theory," "PMT," "extended parallel process model," "EPPM," "health belief model," "HBM," "technology threat avoidance theory," "TTAT," "protection motivation," and "fear appeal." Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> lists the research resources that were targeted by every search combination.</p><p>Searches based on each term were performed systematically for each bibliographic resource until a given researcher could not find any more unique papers. All newly found papers were shared in a common online repository. Each researcher then continued to the next bibliographic resource and repeated the process until the search space was exhausted. At this point, we checked the bibliographies of the retrieved articles to find any relevant missing articles. To ensure that no key articles were overlooked, we performed an additional three rounds of looking up in-scope articles on Google Scholar, Scopus, and the publishers' websites to find suggested articles and recently cited articles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria and the Final Sample</head><p>For meta-analysis data collection, it is crucial to establish explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies in the sample from the population of studies to ensure that all the studies included are comparable and aggregable <ref type="bibr">[96]</ref>. Our criteria were as follows. First, we filtered potential articles to remove qualitative studies, nation-level studies, and nonempirical commentaries, review articles, and theory articles. Given the interdisciplinary nature of our context, we did not exclude any target outlets or disciplines. Second, we excluded studies that did not meet search term criteria (e.g., several ISM papers cited but were not based on PMT). Third, we excluded empirical studies that were not conducted at the individual level (e.g., studies conducted at the group or organization level). Fourth, we excluded studies that exhibited poor reliability (based on α) or indicators of poor data quality or procedures, such as failing to use validated scales or accepted scientific practices <ref type="bibr">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">75]</ref>. Fifth, we excluded studies that did not use any of the constructs that were among the constructs of interest we used to create our models (see Appendix B). Sixth, the papers selected for analysis were required to provide correlations between the constructs or the information needed to derive the correlations <ref type="bibr">[121,</ref><ref type="bibr">160]</ref>. 6 Seventh, if two different studies analyzed the same data, the earlier data were excluded. 7   After applying our filtering criteria, and based on a discussion with at least two members of the research team for each article [e.g., 49], the final sample included 341 articles, 383 unique studies (several articles contained two or three studies), and 155,413 observations. Our goal was to test six versions of PMT and the EPPM; thus, we created Python scripts that automated the creation and testing of two baseline data files:</p><p>one data file contained the three datasets with which to test the three PMT models (Models 1, 3, and 5); the other contained the two datasets with which to test the three EPPM models (Models 2, 4, and 6; the latter two shared the same dataset). 8 We summarize all the steps for determining inclusion and exclusion in Appendix A. the key studies our analysis excluded and why they were excluded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deriving Meta-Analytic Calculations from the Articles</head><p>Meta-analysis focuses on effect sizes (not the articles in which they appear) as the unit of analysis <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">11]</ref>. In pulling these effect sizes, we followed the Hunter and Schmidt <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">[75]</ref> approach of adjusting them for measurement error, because it is pervasive in behavioral data, including IS and management data. This approach adjusts for error using the reliability statistics of the measures involved. Namely, all the effect sizes were adjusted for the Cronbach's alpha (α) statistic for the bivariate data (each construct pair) used to calculate effect size. 9</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mapping Constructs</head><p>To map constructs, we followed leading process recommendations for meta-analysis <ref type="bibr">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr">55]</ref>, with the three team members leading the effort. We also followed King and Jun <ref type="bibr">[87]</ref> by creating a careful protocol for coding our constructs to avoid "the problem of attempting aggregation of too diverse a sampling of studies" (p. 672). Part of this protocol, for example, is examining the measurement items and construct definitions to verify a construct's name rather than blindly relying on an article's choice of terms. The resulting construct mapping is detailed in Appendix B. At least two team members mapped the constructs for each article. All the construct mappings were categorical and dichotomous; thus, we required 100% agreement among multiple raters to be reached. 10</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Checking Study Independence</head><p>We also ensured that each reported study was independent <ref type="bibr">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">75]</ref>. Recall that we first dropped earlier versions of the studies that used the same data. Independent data in a publication with two versions of the same or related DV were also treated as separate studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr">161]</ref>. If a given study had multiple versions of the same constructs, we integrated them into one weighted construct if they used the same measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr">161]</ref>. However, if there were two or more measures of the same construct that could not be aggregated, we chose the measure with the highest reliability and significance, because TSSEM does not allow for more than one measure per study to be mapped to a broader construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">[140]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessing the File Drawer Problem</head><p>The file drawer problem, also known as the missing-studies artifact or publication bias, occurs when a meta-analysis study omits studies that report nonsignificant findings <ref type="bibr">[121,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b245">127]</ref>. We used three strategies to assess the robustness of our analyses with respect to the file drawer problem. 11 First, we calculated the "fail-safe" statistics to ensure that the file drawer problem did not affect our analyses. The fail-safe k value represents the number of studies with null results needed to render a significant meta-analytically synthesized effect size nonsignificant <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr">108,</ref><ref type="bibr">115]</ref>. If the fail-safe k is large, the results are more robust to the file drawer problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">[127]</ref>. We used Rosenthal's <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">[127]</ref> method, implemented by R's metafor package version 3.4, to calculate fail-safe k values for the pooled correlations of each hypothesis in Models 3, 5, and 6 (our best fit models) for an α of 0.05 <ref type="bibr">[120,</ref><ref type="bibr">144]</ref>. The fail-safe k of a weighted effect size should exceed 5k+10, where k refers to the number of observed effect sizes corresponding to that weighted effect size <ref type="bibr">[110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b245">127]</ref>. Except for H8 (T2n  DM) in Model 6, in which the fail-safe k (252) was less than the threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b393">(275)</ref>, we found that all the fail-safe k values were well above this threshold (Appendix C Tables C.1-C.3).</p><p>Second, we created and visually inspected funnel plots-showing the observed effect sizes on the xaxis and a measure of precision on the y-axis-for each hypothesis in Models 3, 5, and 6 using their observed effect sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b257">[139]</ref>. A symmetrical funnel plot indicates that statistical significance is unrelated to effect-size reporting, indicating the absence of the file drawer problem <ref type="bibr">[54]</ref>. We used R's metafor package version 3.4 to draw the funnel plot (Appendix C Figures C.1-C.3) by using standard error as the index of precision <ref type="bibr">[144]</ref>. Our visual inspection showed that all the funnel plots were symmetrical.</p><p>Third, using R's metafor package version 3.4 <ref type="bibr">[144]</ref>, we tested the asymmetry of the funnel plots with Egger's test, which determines whether the standard error predicts the effect sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">[138]</ref>. Here, the null hypothesis is there is no funnel plot asymmetry. Nonsignificant p-values (&gt; 0.05) indicate an absence of the missing-studies artifact <ref type="bibr">[103]</ref>. Our results showed nonsignificant p-values for all the hypotheses, indicating no funnel plot asymmetry (Appendix C Tables C.1-C.3). We thus conclude that our TSSEM analyses were robust to the file drawer problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Power Calculation to Address Type II Errors</head><p>We assessed the risk of type II errors by calculating the statistical power of the pooled correlations pertaining to each hypothesis in Models 3, 5, and 6 based on their corresponding pooled sample sizes <ref type="bibr">[121]</ref>. 12 We used R's pwr package version 1.3 to calculate the statistical power <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>, which revealed that the statistical power of all of our TSSEM analyses was above 0.95, exceeding the minimum threshold of 0.80 <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> (Appendix C Tables C.1-C.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessing the Correlations for Multicollinearity</head><p>We used two strategies to assess the pooled correlations for multicollinearity, 13 which undermines the SEM assumption of independence of factors in a research model <ref type="bibr">[121]</ref>. First, we examined whether the pooled correlations between predictors were less than the accepted threshold of 0.7; lower pooled correlation values indicate lower chances of multicollinearity <ref type="bibr">[121]</ref>. The pooled correlations between predictors in the pooled correlation matrices of our five datasets derived from the random-effects stage 1 estimation (see Appendix C Tables C. <ref type="bibr">4</ref>-C.8) were below 0.7, indicating that the predictors were not highly correlated.</p><p>Second, using R's psych package version 2.1.9, we calculated the variance inflation factor (VIF) scores 14 of Models 3, 5, and 6 (our best fit models) based on the pooled correlation matrices of these models derived from the random-effects stage 1 estimation <ref type="bibr">[123]</ref>. VIF values greater than 5 indicate a higher chance of multicollinearity <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr">108]</ref>. The highest VIF score for a predictor across the three models was 1.56, well below the accepted threshold of 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr">108]</ref>. Therefore, we conclude that our data were unlikely to violate the SEM assumption of independence of factors or multicollinearity <ref type="bibr">[121]</ref>. The VIFs for all three models are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_35">C</ref>.9.</p></div>

First, MASEM uses the PCM as the observed covariance matrix to fit the SEM <ref type="bibr">[121]</ref>. In MASEM, each of the entries (i.e., the pooled effect sizes) in the PCM (i.e., the final correlation matrix used to fit the SEM) is individually estimated using traditional meta-analysis, also called the univariate-R approach to MASEM <ref type="bibr">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr">32]</ref>. Given that CB-SEM statistically assumes a proper covariance matrix-not a correlation matrix-MASEM's approach is statistically flawed and results in consistently incorrect chi-square statistics and standard errors of the parameter estimates <ref type="bibr">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr">38,</ref><ref type="bibr">50]</ref>. By contrast, TSSEM uses a proper covariance matrix to fit the structural model for SEM and thus does not violate SEM's assumptions. 17   Second, by treating the PCM as a covariance matrix, MASEM ignores sampling variation in effect sizes across primary studies because it neglects the standard errors of the pooled correlations <ref type="bibr">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr">121]</ref>. Relatedly, it is likely that effect sizes covary across behavioral studies, but MASEM ignores this interdependency among effect sizes <ref type="bibr">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr">108]</ref>. Instead of ignoring sampling variation and covariation among effect sizes in primary studies, TSSEM estimates the SEM model by correcting for sampling variation and covariation among effect sizes. 18   Third, in any large meta-analytic study, it is extremely unlikely that every included study will include all of the targeted effect sizes for the desired construct pairings, and due to this missing data, each pooled correlation's sample size should differ <ref type="bibr">[41]</ref>. Instead, MASEM researchers have used ad hoc approaches to estimate sample sizes, such as harmonic means or mean sample sizes, which are not founded on robust statistical theory and conflict with SEM <ref type="bibr">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr">38,</ref><ref type="bibr">121]</ref>. Such approaches compromise the reliability of findings, because an accurate sample size is a foundational factor for standard errors of the parameter estimates, goodness-of-fit indices, and type I errors of the chi-square statistics when performing SEM <ref type="bibr">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr">108]</ref>. Thus, TSSEM uses the actual sample sizes corresponding to each effect size to compute the covariance matrix, as is expected with SEM. 19 Relatedly, the use of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)</p><p>in Stage 1 is pivotal to the success of TSSEM analysis because it allows the model to compute unbiased estimates of the parameters when estimates are missing (i.e., missing at random or missing completely at random in nature); MASEM, by contrast, lacks this capacity <ref type="bibr">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr">39,</ref><ref type="bibr">108]</ref>.</p></div>

But this tau 2 value was significant (p = 0.07) at an α of 0.10, with a high I 2 value of 0.899, indicating heterogeneity. ***With the exception of M4 and M6, which used the same dataset, each model's results are based on a different number of studies because of the preprocessing steps where studies were removed because (a) some studies had no effect sizes for a model <ref type="bibr">[41]</ref>, and (b) the correlation matrices were non-positive definite (this removal is based on prior literature) <ref type="bibr">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b261">143]</ref>.</p><p>Overall, we rejected the assumption of homogeneity, supporting our choice of the random-effects model for all of our TSSEM analyses in computing the PCM and ACM <ref type="bibr">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr">39]</ref>.

Our goal in Stage 2 was to assess the fit of competing models from our five datasets and determine which model best fit the data <ref type="bibr">[41]</ref>. However, before interpreting model-fit statistics, the TSSEM researcher must distinguish between nested and nonnested models, and check whether the models are built on the same variables and the same dataset. Among our six models, only Model 4 and Model 6 are directly comparable as nested models (i.e., Model 4 is nested within Model 6). The likelihood ratio test (i.e., the chi-square difference test), the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) can only be used to compare nested models  <ref type="bibr">[41]</ref>); SE = standard error; ns = not significant; * = p &lt; .05; ** = p &lt; .01; *** p &lt; .001; AIC = Akaike information criterion; BIC = Bayesian information criterion; CFI = comparative fit index; RMSEA = root mean square error of approximation; TLI = Tucker-Lewis index; SRMR = standardized root mean square residual.</p><p>(i.e., Model 4 and 6) <ref type="bibr">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr">41,</ref><ref type="bibr">88]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Contributions to Theory, Research, and Practice</head><p>In this study, we conducted the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date in the ISM literature using the most advanced form called TSSEM. By using TSSEM with random-effects analyses that fully addresses the traditional analysis flaws of MASEM and by fully addressing potential file drawer biases, our greatest contribution is that we can make inferences from our findings that generalize outside of the 383 unique ISM PM ↔ DM, mixed "yes" (in green or light shading) = hypothesis supported statistically and in the correct direction; "yes full" = full mediation is supported; "yes partial" = partial mediation is supported; "no" (in red or dark shading) = hypothesis not supported; "no med." = no mediation supported; + = would be significant if alpha set to 0.10; ± = only significant with simple and incomplete model and thus rejected given further evidence from more complete models fear-appeals studies that we analyzed <ref type="bibr">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">65,</ref><ref type="bibr">121]</ref>. Based on our analyses, we offer the following generalizations to ISM research and practice using fear appeals, regardless of the theory used (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">7</ref>):</p><p>1. Both the threat-appraisal and coping-appraisal processes and associated constructs must be included in ISM fear-appeals research and practice; omitting portions of either fosters incorrect conclusions about the predictors of PM and proper interventional practices (e.g., Model 2 and Model 4 had the worst model fit and R 2 statistics).</p><p>2. Fear is a stronger predictor of PM than is threat; thus, fear should be included in any ISM fearappeals study or practice intervention, or the role of threat will be overplayed (e.g., β for fearPM is higher in every model with fear than threat constructsPM).</p><p>3. Fear should be assumed to be and modeled as a full mediator of the threat  PM relationship (e.g., it is either a partial or full mediator in every model with fear; it is a full mediator in Model 5, the best overall model in terms of fit and predictive power).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>It is crucial to model the threat fear relationship. Threat is the strongest predictor of fear, partially confirming research claims that fear is a result of personally relevant threat. Thus, researchers and practitioners need to ensure that the threats conveyed are personally relevant; if they are not, fear will not be generated, thus serving as a relevance check. Although threat severity is significant in the absence of fear measurement, it is no longer significant when fear is included (e.g., threat predicts fear in Models 2-5, and in every case, these have the highest β's in every model).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>More emphasis should be placed on efficacy than mere threat. When fear is considered, threat has a secondary role in predicting PM, in contrast to efficacy, which is a much stronger predictor; thus, it is crucial that training and interventions emphasize not just the threats but how to efficaciously address them. 27 Here, self-efficacy ("Can I respond?") and response efficacy ("How do I respond?") have similar effects and thus should receive equal emphasis (e.g., in every model, the β's for the threatPM relationships were lower than those of the efficacythreat relationships).</p><p>6. Fear-appeals messages should be rebalanced. A fear appeal is a message (or training program) that conveys a combination of threat and efficacy, which fosters PM. In an ISM context, the threat message needs to be personally relevant, but these messages should not overplay threat. Instead, they should place increased emphasis on both self-and response efficacy, which are often lacking (cf. #4 and #5).</p><p>7. Maladaptive rewards should be considered in any ISM fear-appeals study or practice intervention because maladaptive rewards strongly negatively predict PM and are the strongest positive predictor of DM, supplanting response costs-contrary to traditional PMT and the traditional EPPM (e.g., β's for maladaptive rewards  DM are the highest in M5 and M6 than for any other DM predictor).</p><p>8. Response costs, as currently operationalized, are ineffective maladaptive predictors across the literature and thus need to be omitted, reconceptualized, or better measured in the ISM context 28  (e.g., response costs are only significant in the worst predictive model, which is highly flawed: M1). 9. Both PFC (danger control; PM) and EFC (fear control; DM) should be assumed and modeled, because they are not opposite constructs on the same spectrum, because few of the predictors of PM work with DM in opposite fashion, and because maladaptive predictors and outcomes are extremely serious issues in practice. More research on EFC is desperately needed 29  (e.g., consider vast differences in the predictors of PM versus DM in the M5 and M6 results).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical and Practice Contributions through Model Comparisons</head><p>Here, we provide objective empirical evidence for what are likely the best models for ISM researchers to start with, depending on their research goals. TSSEM conducts statistically correct SEM; thus, unlike traditional MASEM, TSSEM follows the same considerations of model fit and underlying statistical theories as would conventional SEM. Crucially, apart from Model 4 and Model 6, which are nested, the other four models are non-nested models and contain different sets of variables from different datasets;</p><p>thus, the standard model-fit statistics apply only to a specific model and cannot be used to compare models.</p><p>See further details in the analysis model fit section. We compared the nested models 4 and 6 using the likelihood ratio test, and the AIC and BIC values. The likelihood ratio test (∆χ2 =54.807, ∆df =4, p &lt; 0.001) was significant, which indicates that we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that Model 6 fits the data significantly better than Model 4. The lower AIC and BIC values for Model 6 further support that Model 6 is better than Model 4. We cannot do other direct model comparisons based on fit. Thus, the most important consideration is that each model demonstrates proper model-fit statistics for its covariance matrix.</p><p>Given the strong model fit statistics and the fact that we cannot horse race the six models using the AIC and BIC, we then considered which paths were significant and strong, the maximization of equation-level fit through R 2 , and the tradeoff between parsimony and theoretical explanation. Of the PMT models, Model 1 is clearly the most parsimonious, but it has the lowest R 2 and lacks nomological validity because it omits key constructs, especially fear, which is a particularly problematic omission. We thus recommend against its use, because omitting key relevant constructs (e.g., fear, maladaptive rewards) not only undermines nomological validity but also increases endogeneity bias. Models 3 and 5 are highly similar in terms of model fit and explanation. Model 3 ("PMT full") is thus adequate if the researcher is interested only in considering PM and has the advantage of parsimony. However, the advantage goes to Model 5 if the researcher is interested in explaining both PM and DM.</p><p>The EPPM-model results are messier, because the EPPM is used less frequently in the ISM literature, and thus its nomological network of constructs is less extensively tested and established in this context.</p><p>When including maladaptive rewards, Model 4 outperforms Model 2-the traditional EPPM-in terms of R 2 . However, both models are inadequate for predicting DM, because fear has little predictive power on its own. We thus conclude that because Model 6 best explains both DM and PM, it is the best starting point for ISM researchers who want to use the more parsimonious EPPM. However, if a researcher wants to maximize the prediction of DM, Model 5 is the better starting point, because prediction can be better maximized with first-order threat and efficacy constructs than second-order versions. A case in point is Model 6, in which second-order threat is marginally significant. Model 5 clarifies why this is the case by showing that threat severity is significantly negatively associated with DM, whereas threat vulnerability is not. Thus, it is less theoretically precise to use the second-order version of threat when threat vulnerability is not a significant predictor. Theoretically, such a case indicates that a person perceives a threat is serious but that the threat is unlikely to affect them-thus failing a fundamental assumption involved in coping appraisal and the desired adaptive response. Thus, it is likely that the person is merely ignoring the threat as opposed to engaging in a more malicious behavior like reactance, anger, or purposeful noncompliance.</p><p>If so, it is likely that not all DM outcomes-such as ignoring, avoidance, reactance, noncompliance, malicious noncompliance, anger, workarounds, and so on -represent fear control and that some represent either threat control or lack of personal salience. This points to context-specific theorization that needs to occur within ISM research to account for specific predictors for specific maladaptive responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion: Limitations and Future Research</head><p>Given the generalizations we can and cannot make based on these studies, ISM fear-appeals research is nowhere near its full maturity; many compelling theoretical, research, and practice issues have yet to be resolved. We thus conclude by outlining some compelling limitations and future research directions. First, we do not know why response costs are ineffective. This could be a measurement or context issue; regardless, it is much more difficult for recipients of fear appeals to formulate a meaningful cost that can be used for prediction in an ISM context than to do so in the health context, in which all the extant fearappeals theories were formulated. This is particularly fascinating in view of the clear roles of threat, efficacy, fear, and maladaptive rewards.</p><p>Second, contrary to the traditional EPPM or ISM models, we find that maladaptive rewards strongly negatively predict PM and are the strongest positive predictors of DM. In addition, we find that DM and PM are clearly not opposites or constructs on the same spectrum, because few of the predictors of PM work in opposite fashion with DM. Thus, we suspect there is more going on with the tipping point in an ISM context, especially involving maladaptive predictors. This is because fear strongly predicts only PM and may weakly predict DM. Although maladaptive rewards, PM, and DM are crucial components that ISM researchers and practitioners must consider, formally modeling the tipping point at which fear begins to foster defensive motivation in an organizational setting requires much more empirical research [cf. 25]. A fascinating aspect of DM is that it can take many more forms than PM, because it can include activities such as ignoring a threat, avoiding a threat, negative reactance against a threat, malicious compliance, malicious noncompliance, and so on. Thus, there is substantial opportunity for ISM researchers and practitioners to further contextualize a dual-route model that better incorporates DM.</p><p>Third, our results clearly indicate that the extant ISM literature is missing some key constructs that could improve explanation and prediction in a fear-appeals context. For example, the current theoretical foundation does little to explain and predict the full range of DM in organizations, where such behaviors include but are not limited to avoidance, ignoring, reactance, noncompliance, malicious noncompliance, anger, and workarounds <ref type="bibr">[154]</ref><ref type="bibr">[155]</ref><ref type="bibr">[156]</ref><ref type="bibr">[157]</ref>. Some of these behaviors are passive (e.g., avoidance, noncompliance); some are irrational and emotional (e.g., reactance, anger); some involve the appearance of compliance (e.g., workarounds, malicious noncompliance); and some involve highly problematic-even illegal-behaviors, depending on the employee's actual course of action (e.g., reactance and malicious noncompliance). In our attempt to remain theoretically consistent with the underlying fear-appeal theories we leveraged, we did not consider the many possibilities of adding or mixing multiple non-fear-appeals theories and constructs, which have been prevalent in the ISM literature. Although proper theorization is not based on mixing and matching constructs from unrelated theories, there are certainly compelling reasons to combine elements of alternative theories to newly contextualized models that are ISM-specific. Possible theories include selfdetermination theory (SDT), the theory of planned behavior, deterrence theory, rational choice theory, reactance theory, and several others. Earlier research has assumed that individuals behave in a rational manner. However, fear can be cognitive (a rational fear of a harm) or emotional (an irrational response to a stimulus). Thus, emotion-based outcomes (i.e., EFC) have simply received less attention than the more traditional intention-based outcomes, which are based on rational theories of behavior <ref type="bibr">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr">95]</ref>. Following Moody et al. <ref type="bibr">[109]</ref>, many defensive motivations might be better explained with emotion-focused theories (e.g., the theory of interpersonal behavior, self-regulation) or even criminological theories (e.g., control balance, social learning). These possibilities need to be examined by more theoretical and empirical studies in the ISM context. Currently, it is difficult to attain a complete picture using TSSEM, because of insufficient k for studies involving DM. As more studies are added to the ISM corpus involving DM, TSSEM can be used more effectively to study DM.</p><p>Another key issue is the assumption of both PMT and the EPPM that a threat must be personally relevant to generate fear and a coping response. We find that fear is central regardless of the model or theory chosen. Fear generation is an evolutionary signal that a threat is personally relevant to a recipient; thus, if a threat does not generate fear, it is not a salient threat <ref type="bibr">[153,</ref><ref type="bibr">154]</ref>. However, outside of the studies we analyze, it is highly likely that an organization could be concerned about a specific security threat that simply does not register as personally relevant with its employees. What then? One answer has been to customize SETA programs to make such threats relevant through SDT <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">[135]</ref>. However, other theoretical possibilities should be considered further, such as the use of DT and sanctions for these scenarios <ref type="bibr">[83]</ref>. This pragmatic finding also explains why several researchers advocate the measurement of fear <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">153,</ref><ref type="bibr">154]</ref>:</p><p>fear measurement can provide a manipulation check that indicates whether the participants consider a threat personally relevant. We thus encourage ISM researchers to measure fear any time a threat is being delivered as a key manipulation check of personal relevancy for the given organization.</p><p>Fourth, traditional meta-analysis research has heavily emphasized the use of moderation analysis of categorically coded variables to better understand contingency or contextual effects <ref type="bibr">[45]</ref>. Similarly, researchers have attempted to use MASEM with categorical moderation analysis, but because MASEM is built on a flawed statistical foundation, the results of subsequent moderation analyses merely compound its underlying flaws and are subject to type I and II errors. To resolve these issues, TSSEM and its R libraries have been further extended to support both categorical and continuous variable analysis while strictly adhering to the proper statistical foundation of SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">79]</ref>. Thus, there are many compelling research opportunities for examining contingency and contextual effects using rigorous moderation analysis that TSSEM can perform using both categorial and continuous variables. For categorial analysis, there are many possibilities, such as looking at (1) participant type, (2) organization type, (3) use of fear appeals, (4) type of fear appeals used (e.g., abstract vs. concrete, ISP, training intervention), ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) quality of publication outlet, (6) number of security behaviors involved, (7) method used, (8) analysis used, (9) adherence to best research practices (e.g., contextualized measures, preventing common methods variance, assessing nonresponse bias, manipulation checks), and <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref> and national cultural setting.</p><p>More interesting, however, would be the use of continuous moderation analyses, which could further tease out some key interactions, such as (1) threat X fear  PM, (2) threat X fear  DM, (3) threat severity X threat vulnerability  fear, (4) efficacy X fear  PM, (5) efficacy X fear  DM, (6) threat  maladaptive rewards  PM, (7) threat  maladaptive rewards  DM, (8) efficacy X maladaptive rewards  PM, and ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) efficacy X maladaptive rewards  DM. Moreover, TSSEM now allows for the considerations of a myriad of contextual factors measured on continuous scales, such as the Big-Five personality traits, age, employment tenure, organizational commitment, upper-management support, low self-control, and so on. Our research reveals that many of the questions about why people are motivated to engage in PM or DM in a security context have yet to be answered, leaving many research opportunities that can be addressed through traditional studies and further advanced applications of TSSEM.</p><p>Finally, TSSEM cannot directly assess the realism of processes, because the realism of the empirical data and associated theoretical arguments depends on the individual studies we aggregated. This is no easy task, especially in organizational studies. Corley and Gioia <ref type="bibr">[44]</ref> urged management researchers to expand the scope of theoretical work not just by emphasizing scientific utility or by "struggling to find holes in the literature" (through "gap spotting"), but by improving practical utility, which arises when "theory can be directly applied to the problems practicing managers and other organizational practitioners face" (p. 18). In closing, we concur that ISM research needs to place a greater premium on ecological validity so that the ISM interventions, processes, and constructs involved have a meaningful relationship to real-world organizational conditions-involving often-conflicting employee motivations and expectations-and actual security behaviors over time <ref type="bibr">[97]</ref>.  PM is people's attitudes, intentions, or behaviors to protect themselves from a perceived threat per the recommended action <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr">119,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b244">126]</ref>. 2 Formally, a threat is defined as an individual's perception that something or someone has the intention to cause them harm <ref type="bibr">[153]</ref>. 3 A threat can be perceived to exist by the individual only if both conditions are met. For example, an illness that results in death (high severity) but that has been completely eradicated (no susceptibility) results in no threat, whereas the current threat of H1N1 flu is considered high due to the highly uncomfortable symptoms (severity) and the ease with which it is passed to others (high susceptibility). 4 A person's ability to cope with a perceived threat is possible only if they believe that the response can reduce or remove the threat (i.e., by reducing the severity or susceptibility) and that they can execute this response. Extending the previous example, an individual who perceives H1N1 flu as a threat will appraise their ability to cope as high if they believe that the H1N1 vaccine reduces the susceptibility of H1N1 flu and that they are able to receive the vaccine. However, if the individual is either unable to obtain the vaccine or does not believe it reduces the possibility of getting H1N1 flu, the coping appraisal will be low. 5 Effect size is fundamentally about "what works" and thus has long been a bridge between research and practice. The effective analysis of effect size allows scientists to remove copious amounts of noise (significant vs. not significant) and find the signal (does it matter, and does it work in a meaningful way that would change practice outcomes?). In basic meta-analysis, studies are compared by calculating an effect size, which "reflects the magnitude and directionality of the association between the two variables" <ref type="bibr">[11, p. 478]</ref>. Meta-analysis has been applied in many fields, and it has been used successfully in traditional management and IS research [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">59,</ref><ref type="bibr">84,</ref><ref type="bibr">98,</ref><ref type="bibr">107,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b251">133,</ref><ref type="bibr">160]</ref>. Meta-analysis is designed primarily for the testing of simple pairings of relationships between one independent variable and one dependent variable and for the testing of simple moderation. 6 Papers that only had descriptive data or data that could not be used to derive correlations were excluded. Whenever a study should have been in scope but the authors did not provide correlation data, we contacted the authors and requested the correlations (or raw data) two times; the studies were excluded if the authors did not respond or could not provide the necessary data. 7 For example, if authors published a conference paper and used the same dataset for a subsequent journal publication, then the conference publication was excluded from the sample population. We used the latter to ensure the unit of analysis involved only independent studies <ref type="bibr">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">75,</ref><ref type="bibr">98</ref>]. 8 The two data files with five datasets are necessary because of an interesting nomological network difference between PMT and the EPPM: PMT uses two first-order representations of threat (severity + vulnerability) and two first-order representations of efficacy (self-efficacy + response efficacy). Conversely, the EPPM combines and uses these as second-order constructs called threat and efficacy. Thus, to test the EPPM-related models (2, 4, and 6), all the existing first-order threats and efficacies needed to be collapsed into second-order constructs and we could not use any first-order versions of these. By contrast, all the PMT-related models required only first-order versions of these constructs, whereas any second-order version had to be excluded. 9 If any reliability data were missing, we used an assumed level of .80, but only if the study's other reliabilities were .80 or higher and the authors followed expected methodological procedures, as suggested by research <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">11]</ref>. Otherwise, the study was dropped. 10 We also followed other meta-analytic studies in dealing with results that are generalizable across a broad domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b251">133]</ref>; consequently, we did not consider the number of measurement items used for a given measure and treated all such measures equally, as suggested by leading guides to meta-analysis <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">14,</ref><ref type="bibr">22]</ref>. However, we did gather reliability statistics for each measure (α) to make adjustments for measurement reliability, as suggested by leading MASEM research <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. 11 Assessing the file drawer problem for MASEM, including TSSEM, is still in its infancy <ref type="bibr">[32]</ref>. Thus, we used conventional meta-analysis (i.e., analyzing single correlations instead of correlation matrices) to assess the file drawer problem. We used the random-effects model to aggregate the observed effect sizes of each hypothesis in the best fit models (Models 3, 5, 6). The observed effect sizes were Fisher r-to-z transformed before applying the random-effects model <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. The resultant aggregated effect sizes were used to assess the file drawer problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b248">[130]</ref>. 12 A type II error occurs when a statistical test fails to reject a null hypothesis when it is false. Statistical power is the probability that a statistical test will reject a null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref>. 13 Multicollinearity exists when a factor in the research model is highly correlated with one or more factors <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. 14 The VIF score of a focal predictor is calculated as 1 divided by 1 -R 2 , where R 2 is the R-squared value obtained by regressing that focal predictor on all other predictors in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr">108]</ref>. 15 See the following URL for full documentation of and access to "metaSEM" for implementing TSSEM: <ref type="url" target="https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/metaSEM/vignettes/Examples.html">https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/metaSEM/vignettes/Examples.html</ref>  16 TSSEM has already been extensively developed and compared to other techniques (e.g., traditional MASEM, SEM, regression, and meta-analysis) and has been peer reviewed in multiple elite interdisciplinary journals, including multiple publications in Psychological Methods, the top APA journal on methodology and statistics <ref type="bibr">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr">31,</ref><ref type="bibr">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">79]</ref>; Structural Equation Modeling, the leading interdisciplinary journal on SEM <ref type="bibr">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr">29,</ref><ref type="bibr">39]</ref>; Behavior Research Methods <ref type="bibr">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">78]</ref>; Journal of Applied Psychology <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>;</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">publication</formula><p>Research Synthesis Methods <ref type="bibr">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr">40]</ref>; Health Psychology Review <ref type="bibr">[41]</ref>; Multivariate Behavioral Research <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[77]</ref>; and other outlets. However, to date, its use is absent from top management journals, which are still using the older, flawed version of MASEM. 17 To resolve this issue with traditional MASEM, the PCM in TSSEM is not an observed correlation matrix and is not used as an "inputted covariance matrix" to fit the structural model (as in traditional MASEM). Only the final covariance matrix is used to fit the model with a CB-SEM analysis. 18 To resolve this issue with traditional MASEM, TSSEM accounts for the sample variation and interdependency among effect sizes across primary studies by weighting the PCM using the ACM <ref type="bibr">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr">121]</ref>. Such weighting means that the larger the sampling variation, the lesser the weight given to the correlations, an approach consistent with traditional meta-analysis <ref type="bibr">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">75]</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, TSSEM provides each observation with its appropriate weight to be considered when estimating the final parameter values <ref type="bibr">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr">121]</ref>. 19 To resolve this issue with traditional MASEM, through the weighting approach, TSSEM uses the total sample size corresponding to each effect size to compute the final covariance matrix rather than using ad hoc approaches such as harmonic mean or mean sample <ref type="bibr">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr">38]</ref>. Consequently, in TSSEM, the type I, type II, and standard errors of parameter estimates are controlled so that correct inferences can be made from them <ref type="bibr">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr">108]</ref>. 20 A fixed-effects model assumes effect-size homogeneity, in which a single true population effect size applies to all the primary studies included in the analyses <ref type="bibr">[108]</ref>. This model applies when primary studies in a meta-analytic dataset share common conditions and measures. Thus, the pooled effect size is considered the population effect size, and effect-size variations across studies are attributed to sampling errors <ref type="bibr">[108]</ref>. 21 By contrast, a random-effects model assumes effect-size heterogeneity, in which each study has its own true population effect size <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[76]</ref>. This model applies when there is variation in study conditions and measures, as is the norm for organizational or behavioral datasets. Thus, the pooled effect size is the mean of the distribution of effect sizes, and the effect-size variations across studies are attributed to sampling errors and between-study heterogeneity <ref type="bibr">[108]</ref>. 22 The latest standard is to exclude nonpositive definite matrices before proceeding with the TSSEM Stage 1 analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">[143]</ref>. A nonpositive definite matrix indicates that the values of the matrix are inconsistent <ref type="bibr">[41]</ref> and challenge the structural equation modeling assumptions <ref type="bibr">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b248">130]</ref>. Adjusting effect sizes for reliability, a procedure applied in our analysis as is common for metaanalysis, is one of the sources of nonpositive definiteness <ref type="bibr">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b261">143,</ref><ref type="bibr">159]</ref>. 23 A good-fitting model will have a comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) of 0.9 or higher, a root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) of 0.08 or lower, and standard root mean residual (SRMR) values below 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr">108]</ref>. 24 Crucially, the chi-square test is sensitive to large sample sizes such that the larger the sample (e.g., &gt; 400) the higher the likelihood that the null hypothesis is rejected <ref type="bibr">[121]</ref>. This issue is more pronounced in TSSEM (and traditional MASEM) because where the total samples are extremely large and, as a result, the exact fit rarely holds <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[78]</ref>. Thus, in conducting TSSEM, we use RMSEA, SRMR, CFI, and TLI to assess model fit, as is the standard TSSEM practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr">121]</ref>. 25 The AIC is an especially effective means of non-nested model selection, because it estimates the quality of each model relative to that of each of the other models <ref type="bibr">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b259">141]</ref>. The BIC has properties comparable to those of the AIC but is slightly more conservative in penalizing potentially unwieldy non-nested models that have a higher likelihood of overfitting. Like the AIC, the BIC is recognized by leading methodologists as an effective criterion for model selection among a finite set of non-nested models, based on a likelihood function, with the lowest BIC indicating the most preferred model <ref type="bibr">[111,</ref><ref type="bibr">122,</ref><ref type="bibr">152]</ref>. However, in both cases, these must be based on the same covariance matrix, and thus they cannot be used to compare models with different variables and different datasets. This is why we can only horse race Models 4 and 6. 26 An indirect effect between a given pair of independent and dependent variables indicates the effect of that independent variable on the dependent variable transmitted through an intervening (i.e., mediating) variable <ref type="bibr">[108]</ref>. The indirect effect is estimated using the product of the direct effects on the indirect route between the independent and dependent variables <ref type="bibr">[108,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b261">143]</ref>. For example, in Model 6, the indirect effect of 0.090 (0.049, 0.130) between T2n and PM is the product of T2n  Fear and Fear  PM direct effects. This indirect effect indicates the extent to which the effect of T2n on PM is transmitted through the intervening variable, Fear. The total effect refers to the sum of the direct and indirect effects between a given pair of independent and dependent variables <ref type="bibr">[108]</ref>. For example, in Model 6, the total effect 0.194 (0.157, 0.230) is the sum of the direct effect of 0.104 (0.046, 0.162) and the indirect effect of 0.090 (0.049, 0.130) between T2n and PM. The total effect if 0.194 (0.157, 0.230) indicates that a one standard deviation increase in T2n results in 0.194 standard deviation increase in PM. 27 For example, in PMT Model 5, the average efficacy effect size is .226 and the average threat effect size is .0585, for a 384% higher effect; in EPPM Model 6, efficacy is .307 and threat is .104, for a 295% higher effect. 28 Response costs work well only in incomplete models when maladaptive rewards are not considered. 29 Only maladaptive rewards works as a positive predictor of DM, and only threat severity acts as a negative predictor.</p></div>

This is a combination of PMT's self-efficacy and response efficacy. The fail-safe k value represents the number of studies with null results needed to render a significant meta-analytically synthesized effect size nonsignificant. Fail-Safe k threshold (the value that must be exceeded) = 5k+10, where k refers to the number of observed effect sizes corresponding to a weighted effect size; Fail-Safe k test = "Yes," if the Fail-Safe k value exceeds the Fail-Safe k Threshold, and "No" if not. Malr = maladaptive rewards; PM = protection motivation; Self = self-efficacy; RE = response efficacy; Rec = response costs; Tsev = threat severity; Tvul = threat vulnerability          , including a lack of multicollinearity in all of the predictors for three models.
