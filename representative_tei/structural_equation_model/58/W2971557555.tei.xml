<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Introduction: Teaching methods and techniques represent important classroom practices that promote both academic achievement and the efficacy of learning processes: the use of a complex array of teaching practices by educators in the classrooms has been frequently associated with better student academic outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hattie, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hattie, , 2009))</ref>. So far, less is known about the psychological aspects linked to the working endeavors able to promote the adoption of different teaching techniques in educational contexts.</p><p>Aim: The present cross-sectional quantitative research aimed at estimating the cumulative network of associations between psychological resources at work (e.g., social support, sense of autonomy, and job satisfaction) and both work engagement and the use of teaching classroom practices.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The teaching and learning processes in the school setting are a typical object of study in many disciplines of the human and social sciences. Psychology, sociology, and pedagogy agree that teacher resources, competencies, skills, and behavioral repertories, along with students' needs, are considered critical points of paramount importance for research in the education field. Being an effective teacher today requires the implementation of different teaching strategies and techniques (e.g., classic lecture, case-study, simulation, and discussion) to achieve academic goals and support students' learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Wray et al., 2000)</ref>. From a formative point of view, teachers' teaching skills are conceptualized as the ability to implement different practices depending on the specific needs of the students <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Stronge, 2018)</ref>. Coherently with the idea of studying factors affecting the experience of being a professional teacher, the scientific literature has mainly focused on understanding their professional characteristics as being indicative of their conceptions and professional competencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Park and Oliver, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Fiorilli, 2009)</ref>. Other research has been conducted on linking practices to skills learned by students as an indication of students' progress (e.g., OECD programs for international student assessment, such as the PISA project). That said, fewer studies have focused on exploring the psychological, contextual, and organizational features of teachers' work that might promote or inhibit the adoption of a variety of teaching practices and techniques. Although the scientific literature extensively examines the connection between teacher practices and classroom characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dudek et al., 2019)</ref>, teacher beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Farrell and Guz, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mills et al., 2019)</ref>, or the presence of technological devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Uerz et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Nelson et al., 2019)</ref>, much remains to be learned about psychological resources that might promote or inhibit the use of practices in classroom teaching. Studying how teaching strategies are linked to psychological and environmental resources is critical to determining which strategies to favor over others and expand the implementation of flexible teaching practices in empirical contexts.</p><p>According to the paradigms of positive psychology and by adopting the theoretical framework of self-determination theory (SDT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Ryan and Deci, 2000)</ref>, the present research aims at exploring the patterns of association among the variety of practices adopted in the classroom, psychological resources related to contextual working conditions (i.e., social support, sense of autonomy, job satisfaction), and levels of work engagement. This is the focus because a satisfied and engaged person not only performs better in teaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bakker et al., 2008)</ref> but also have a subsequent impact on students' learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Mercer, 2010)</ref>. The expected results are aimed at identifying a model capable of evaluating psychological resources in relation to the use of a wide array of teaching practices in the classroom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Review</head><p>The study of teaching practices is the cornerstone and antecedent of studies on the evaluation of the effectiveness of teaching and learning processes. Longitudinal research at the international level has reported that improvement in education and the academic success of students is closely related to the daily processes that take place in the classroom <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Willis, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Zierer and Wisniewski, 2019)</ref>. In other words, a connection between the daily training practice and the scholastic and learning results of the students has steadily emerged from the field.</p><p>In recent years, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hattie (2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hattie ( , 2008) )</ref> and later <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Masters et al. (2015)</ref> conducted over 800 meta-analyses on a set of 52,637 international scientific studies (i.e., mainly in the Anglo-Saxon context) to identify the aspects that, more so than others, have a positive impact on learning. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Masters et al. (2015)</ref> studied the teacher-student relationship, identifying the following 12 elements (hierarchically ordered on the basis of their impact-effect size) able to influence learning in a direct way: first, the expectations of the students (+1.44), followed by class discussions (+0.80), the clarity of the teacher (+0.75), the ability to give feedback (+0.75), skills (+0.62), classroom management (+0.52), cooperative learning (+0.40), homework (+0.29), exercise/rest ratio (+0.28), group skills (+0.12), rejection (-0.13), and mobility (school change, -0.34). In addition, the study identified the following five emerging characteristics of "excellent teachers" (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Masters et al., 2015)</ref>: the ability to identify the essential representations of their students; the ability to guide learning through the interactions that take place in the classroom; the ability to provide continual feedback, and the ability to demonstrate empathy and express positive emotions toward students and families; and finally, the ability to influence students' results and to know how to "make a difference." All these aspects can be considered complex constructs resulting from interactions among cognitive aspects, emotions, empirical experiences, and attitudes of teachers.</p><p>Another interesting line of research has focused on the relationship between students and their teachers as a core critical determinant in the development of teachers' behavior and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Douglas et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Pianta et al., 2008)</ref>. In this sense, the goodness of fit theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Thomas and Chess, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lerner and Lerner, 2018)</ref> has long described how the teaching/learning process is, to a large extent, influenced by the student-teacher degree of fit and relationship. The participation of the students and the flexibility of the training devices can be the focus of both educational objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Saravani and Haddow, 2011)</ref> and interactive orientation to competence, which refers to the way in which teachers and students work together on ideas and knowledge or mis-knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Molinari et al., 2013)</ref>. In particular, innovative teaching practices must be studied in their developmental contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Honigsfeld and Dove, 2019)</ref> since adopting innovations in teaching depends on the sustainability of contextual conditions as well as the attitude of the teachers, which is also the result of their current teaching experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ghavifekr and Rosdy, 2015)</ref>. Teaching practices are therefore also influenced by a teacher's expectations, and the concepts become powerful mediators of the teacher-student relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Roorda et al., 2011)</ref>. In fact, the extent to which teachers feel free to use new and innovative teaching practices is determined not only by their professional skills and knowledge but also by other psychological drivers (e.g., motivation and feelings of efficacy; <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Pyhältö et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Self-Determination Theory: Social Support, Job Satisfaction, Teachers' Autonomy, and Work</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Engagement as Shaping Elements of Teacher Practices</head><p>In recent years, positive psychology (i.e., the scientific study of human resources and optimal functioning; <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2014)</ref> has gained increased attention in educational contexts. This approach has tried to counterbalance the traditional focus of psychology on disease, damage, or disorder by paying particular attention to the functional facets of the human experience. These recent shifts have also been adopted by applied psychology to "study positively oriented human resource strengths and psychological capacities that can be measured, developed, and effectively managed for performance improvement in today's workplace" <ref type="bibr">(Luthans, 2002, p. 698)</ref>. One important contribution that emerged from this new conceptual wave was SDT <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Ryan and Deci, 2000)</ref> as a general functioningfocused framework for the comprehension of people's behavioral tendencies and innate psychological needs. In addition, the SDT "is concerned primarily with explicating the psychological processes that promote optimal functioning and health" <ref type="bibr">(Deci and Ryan, 2002, p. 262)</ref>. In other words, SDT represented a general approach to the comprehension of human behaviors that was based on organismic metatheory and that emphasized the centrality of evolved inner psychological resources for individual development in relation to behavioral self-regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Ryan et al., 1997)</ref>. The core idea of STD is that human beings "are assumed to be active, growth-oriented organisms who are naturally inclined toward the development of an organized coherence among the elements of their psychological makeup and between themselves and the social world" <ref type="bibr">(Deci and Ryan, 2002, p. 262)</ref>. From this perspective, psychological needs represent the basic elements for self-motivation and goal-oriented behaviors in a given environment and provide a possible explanation for context-specific behavioral decisions. Some examples of empirical application of SDT in educational settings include studies on student motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Reeve et al., 2018)</ref>, teachers' best practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Stupnisky et al., 2018)</ref> and innovative behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Klaeijsen et al., 2018)</ref>, leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Eyal and Roth, 2011)</ref>, classroom processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Pianta and Hamre, 2009)</ref> and teaching style <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bartholomew et al., 2018)</ref>, and student violent behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Assor et al., 2018)</ref>. According to SDT, human beings can experience different types of motivation with respect to their work. The presence of the different types of motivation is important given that, compared to controlled regulation (introjected and extrinsic motivation), autonomous regulation (intrinsic and identified motivation) leads to more positive individual and organizational outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Slemp et al., 2018)</ref>. From this point of view, teachers' experiences seem to be deeply affected by perceived working conditions and the presence of specific psychological resources. In addition, SDT provided an integrated theoretical framework able to conceptualize what stances stand behind a behavior and how people make sense of their own and others' behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Deci et al., 1989)</ref>. As a result of such important conceptual innovation, a full spectrum of new constructs emerged, supporting both the comprehension of the educational field and teachers' behavior in the workplaces.</p><p>More specifically, SDT identified three general psychological domains able to influence external behaviors: need for competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Elliot et al., 2002)</ref>, social relatedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Baumeister and Leary, 1995)</ref>, and autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Deci and Ryan, 1987)</ref>. The need for autonomy refers to the need to have a sense that one can exercise free will and that any activity one undertakes is freely chosen rather than imposed. The need for relatedness is the need to feel a sense of belonging, simply to be loved and cared for ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Van den Broeck et al., 2010)</ref>. Finally, the need for competence is the need to develop mastery over tasks that are important to one <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Deci and Ryan, 2002)</ref>. These areas were saturated by a constellation of psychological constructs that appear to be of paramount importance for "facilitating optimal functioning of the natural propensities for growth and integration, as well as for constructive social development and personal well-being" <ref type="bibr">(Ryan and Deci, 2000, p. 68)</ref>. The present study selected two of three domains (i.e., social relatedness and perceived autonomy) presented by the SDT as specific areas linked to working conditions in the educational setting. In fact, the third domain (e.g., need for competence) seems to be more focused on internal aspects of individuals and less related to mechanisms shaping professional teaching practices. From this point of view, other constructs (e.g., job satisfaction, social support, and work engagement) appear more informative in relation to teacher work and the use of different practices. In fact, teaching work is entirely based on relationships, given that teachers engage in continuous interaction with students, families, and colleagues. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Klaeijsen et al. (2018)</ref> report that job satisfaction affects both intrinsic motivation and occupational self-efficacy and that the latter strongly supports innovative behavior in classrooms. In this sense, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Pindek et al. (2019)</ref> affirm that: "It is certainly not surprising that inadequate resources would adversely affect job performance and that [. . .] perhaps the most important contribution is to show that the most common harmful elements in terms of motivation do arise from colleagues and managers" (p. 91).</p><p>The term job satisfaction usually refers to the degree to which employees like the components of their job <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Spector, 1997)</ref>. Over time and across different paradigms, many definitions of the construct have also been adopted <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Van Saane et al., 2003)</ref>. Even with the variations in this broad range of available definitions, the majority of them share the knowledge that job satisfaction is essentially an effective and positive job-related reaction to the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Addimando, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Judge et al., 2017)</ref> that explains how people feel about their work <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kianto et al., 2016)</ref>. Job satisfaction in teaching is a crucial focus for educational research, mainly because of the benefits, for both teachers and students, that "satisfied" teachers are known to contribute to organizational outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Zee and Koomen, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Other important constructs were represented by both the internal support provided by professional figures such as peers, senior teachers, tutors, head teachers, or psychologists and the external support provided by private relational networks such as partners, relatives, and friends. As confirmed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Betoret (2006)</ref>, the feeling of being exhausted or oppressed by the demands of the job is markedly lower when a social support network of colleagues, superiors, and tutors is available <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fiorilli et al., 2015)</ref>. Social support is also associated with the sense of being related to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Wentzel, 1998)</ref> and appears to be an important promoting factor of well-being and efficacy in schools <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Collie et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, job autonomy was found to be significantly and positively correlated with organizational commitment and work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gillet et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Van Wingerden et al., 2018)</ref>. Teachers' job autonomy is the freedom given to teachers to make their own decisions while doing their job, whereby they elect their practices, design their tasks and/or materials, evaluate outcomes, cooperate with others to solve problems, take responsibilities for their own decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Balkar, 2015)</ref>, get involved in organizational decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Tims et al., 2015)</ref>, and improve their professional skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Guglielmi et al., 2016)</ref>. When autonomy is enhanced, teachers are more involved in achieving new skills, and they are more responsible for difficulties at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Swartz and Perkins, 2016)</ref>. Job autonomy has been consistently linked to employee satisfaction as a positive factor in job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dou et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, throughout the decades, organizational studies have found that work engagement is defined as a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lisbona et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Carmona-Halty et al., 2019)</ref>. Rather than a transitory and specific state, engagement refers to a more persistent and pervasive affective-cognitive status that is not specifically focused on any object, event, individual, or behavior. Work engagement was operationalized using three different work-related domains: vigor, dedication, and absorption. Vigor is characterized by high levels of energy and mental resilience while working, the willingness to invest effort in one's work, and persistence even in the face of difficulties. Dedication refers to being actively involved in one's work and experiencing a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge. Finally, absorption is characterized by being fully concentrated and happily engrossed in one's work, whereby time passes quickly, and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from work. Accordingly, vigor and dedication are considered direct opposites of the core burnout dimensions of exhaustion and cynicism, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Maslach et al., 2001)</ref>. The scientific literature has demonstrated the effect of job satisfaction and teachers' autonomy on work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alonderiene and Majauskaite, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Van den Broeck et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cassidy et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Vangrieken et al., 2017)</ref> and the protective role of satisfaction in relation to teacher burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fiorilli et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">(Fiorilli et al., , 2017a))</ref>.</p><p>The intrinsic features of teachers' job autonomy, satisfaction, and social support (as framed within the SDT) as antecedents of work engagement support the idea that such constructs could be conceived as important structural antecedents of teachers' behaviors, especially in relation to their roles in favoring positive organizational outcomes and student achievement. In addition, teaching strategies and techniques are highly influenced by the personal evaluation of psychological inner states <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Stronge, 2018)</ref>, and there is a lack of empirical studies focusing on how teachers' appraisals of their psychological resources linked to working environments (expressed in terms of autonomy, satisfaction, and social support) affect the engagement and teaching practices adopted by the teachers. Hence, it is relevant to study whether and to what extent psychological intrinsic inner states are related to engagement and teaching processes in a fully comprehensive model tested on empirical data gathered in real educational settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Objectives and Hypotheses</head><p>In line with the aforementioned reviewed literature, the present study aimed to focus on the following three objectives: (1) to examine the relationship between psychological intrinsic basic factors (perceived job autonomy, satisfaction, and social support) and work engagement; (2) to examine the relationship between work engagement and teaching practices; and (3) to examine an integrated cumulative model assessing the total, direct, and indirect effects on the appraisal of "psychological resources" linked to the working environment, engagement, and teachers' direct practices in the classroom. Following that, three directional hypotheses were formulated: H1: Perceived job autonomy, social support, and job satisfaction are directly and positively associated with work engagement. H2: Work engagement is positively associated with the heterogeneity of educational practices adopted by teachers in the classroom.</p><p>H3: Psychological resources linked to working environment and engagement favor the use of different didactic practices in the classroom.</p><p>The full conceptual model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) was designed with three latent endogenous variables and their corresponding empirical indicators. In line with social determination theory, the first latent variable was the appraisal of "psychological resources" linked to working environments, as estimated by the following three empirical measures: teachers' perceived job autonomy, job satisfaction, and social support. Work engagement was estimated using the standard model of measurement (i.e., physical, cognitive, and emotional energy) expressed by teachers in performing their jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lisbona et al., 2018)</ref>. The last latent target variable (criterion) of the study included teaching practice techniques and strategies. The variable years of teaching were modeled as a potential source of covariation. This procedure allowed us to analyze segregated data, given that it is a more informative technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Pepe and Addimando, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Pearl et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fiorilli et al., 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Pepe et al., 2018)</ref> and a means of controlling for the Yule-Simpson effect (i.e., a statistical association that holds for the full sample but is reversed in all subpopulations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Simpson, 1951)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedures</head><p>Participants were in-service teachers from mandatory public schools in Canton Ticino, Switzerland. The number of teachers enrolled in the study was 1,370 (37.7% of the whole population). The respondents selected in this study were teachers in preprimary (18%), primary (43%), and lower secondary schools (39%). The sample was composed of 25% of men (n = 342) and 75% of women (n = 1,028), with an average age of 42.37 (ds = 10.59) years and a seniority (mean of teaching years) of 15.19 (ds = 10.72) years. The study conducted was a quantitative, cross-sectional study, meaning that data from the participants were collected at one specific point of time. All self-reported questionnaires were administered on-site during school hours. Two trained researchers distributed the self-reported measures to the participants in approximately 50 different school settings. The mean time for completing the research protocol was close to 45 min. Inclusion criteria for involvement in the study were: (1) being an in-service teacher, (2) having worked for at least 1 year, and (3) being in charge of a primary or lower secondary classroom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantitative Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inventory of Teaching Practices</head><p>Teaching practices were evaluated with different tools focused on traditional teaching practices (e.g., instructional teaching, oneway lessons, and traditional class), collaborative practices (e.g., co-teaching and team teaching, and projects), and innovative teaching (e.g., ICT in teaching, differentiation, and personalized learning). Due to the unavailability of quantitative tools to observe practices in Ticino, the study used the CWSEI Teaching Practices Inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Wieman and Gilbert, 2014)</ref>, a tool specifically designed to evaluate teaching practices used in undergraduate science and mathematics courses. Since practices refer to observable behaviors, and we did not have a set of practices defined beforehand, we preferred to integrate the CWSEI with other tools. In particular, teachers' strategies and activities were evaluated with items taken from a validated Italian questionnaire specifically intended to assess motivations, strategies, and actions in teaching/learning processes. The MESI (STRAT) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Moè et al. (2010)</ref> consists of items assessing classroom activities and personalized learning. The inventory provides a detailed inventory of practices used in all aspects of a "lecture" course (this means that it is not suitable for use in courses that are primarily laboratory, seminar, or project courses). Before administering the tools, focus and discussion groups were conducted with teachers and principals to adapt the survey to the target context. Finally, principal component analysis was conducted to reduce the number of practices to a set of more manageable size. The results of the analysis suggested that the items can be fruitfully grouped into three separate domains: co-teaching (examples of such items were "Participate in the didactic-subject group meetings, " "Teach together with another colleague, " "Observe the lessons of the other teachers, " and "Organize activities for students in collaboration with colleagues"), differentiation (e.g., "Use observation to identify students' needs, " "Define different skills to be achieved depending on the needs of the students, " "Prepare different materials to allow each student to work and learn at his/her personal pace, " and "Positively reinforce students' commitment"), and classroom management (i.e., "Before explaining a new topic, refer to and discuss topics previously discussed with students, " "Before starting a new topic, understand with the students what the objectives I want to achieve are, " "Organize group work in classroom, " "Provide summary or in-depth materials, such as summaries, work plans, etc.").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work Engagement, Job Satisfaction and Autonomy</head><p>To measure teachers' psychological working engagement, the present study adopted the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Simbula et al., 2011)</ref>. The nine items of the UWES are grouped into the following three subscales composed of three items in each dimension that reflect the underlying dimensions of engagement: vigor, dedication, and absorption. All items are scored on a 5-point frequency rating scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always). The reliability of the score was higher than standard recommendations (α = 0.84).</p><p>Job satisfaction was evaluated with the Teacher Job Satisfaction Scale (TJSS-9, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Pepe et al., 2017)</ref>. The TJSS is a questionnaire aimed at measuring job satisfaction that has been specially developed for use in educational contexts. The TJSS-9 is composed of nine items grouped in three dimensions and is already translated into the target language (e.g., Italian), with three items in each dimension: satisfaction with coworkers, satisfaction with parents, and satisfaction with students' behaviors. The reliability of the scale was over the recommended threshold (α = 0.75).</p><p>The perceptions about the levels of autonomy in teaching were investigated with the Teacher Autonomy Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Ulas and Aksu, 2015)</ref>, which identifies three areas of autonomy in teaching: autonomy in instructional planning and implementation (two items), autonomy in professional development (one item), and autonomy in determining the framework of the curriculum (two items). All items are scored on a 5-point rating scale ranging from 1 (I totally disagree) to 5 (I totally agree). The reliability of the scale was appropriate (α = 0.84).</p><p>Finally, the perceptions about social support were investigated by five ad hoc items of social support in three different domains: support from colleagues (one item), support from school management (three items), and support from parents (one item). All items were scored on a 5-point rating scale ranging from 1 (I totally disagree) to 5 (I totally agree). The reliability of the scale was in line with recommendations (α = 0.81).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Equation Modeling</head><p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate statistical technique that allows the simultaneous modeling of the relationship between multiple latent and empirical constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Byrne, 2016)</ref>. Thus, SEM is usually selected for simultaneously estimating patterns of relationships between variables under study. SEM is a particular type of path analysis that produces measurement estimation with a better validity and reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>. In addition, it can also be used to decompose total effects in both direct and indirect effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kline, 2015)</ref>. SEM is fundamentally a hypothesis testing method (i.e., a confirmatory approach) rather than an exploratory approach (e.g., regression analyses). In addition, the SEM technique can explicitly estimate measurement error rather than ignore this issue, as is done with other traditional techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Byrne, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hair et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The statistical significance of the model (i.e., the degree of fit between the conceptual and the empirical model) was evaluated using the following goodness-of-fit indices: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA, RMSEA &lt; 0.05; <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hu and Bentler, 1999)</ref>; standardized root mean square residual (SRMR, SRMR &lt; 0.05) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Marsh et al., 2004)</ref>; normed fit index (NFI, NFI &gt; 0.95) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Morin et al., 2013)</ref>; Tucker-Lewis index (TLI, TLI &gt; 0.95) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Morin et al., 2013)</ref>; and the comparative fit index (CFI, CFI &gt; 0.95) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Morin et al., 2013</ref>). Mahalanobis's distance (p &lt; 0.001) was computed to identify multivariate outliers. No extreme values were removed from the dataset. Next, the distribution of the scores was assessed to evaluate whether they were normally distributed. Given that none of the variables under study displayed kurtosis or skewness values exceeding the recommended limits [-1,+1], the maximum-likelihood method <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gath and Hayes, 2006</ref>) was adopted to estimate the parameters for the SEM analysis. In line with indications from the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">MacKinnon et al., 2004)</ref>, 95% confidence limit intervals were computed using both Monte Carlo simulation and bootstrapping methods with a set of random samples (k = 500), meaning that the indirect effects for each of the k samples and the mean value for the selected pool of samples were analyzed. The software used for all analyses was Amos 23.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arbuckle, 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Descriptive statistics and zero-order correlations are described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>From the correlational point of view, zero-order correlations were robust and in line with the expected theoretical directions. The analysis revealed interesting and high associations among work engagement subscales, autonomy, job satisfaction, and perceived social support. Specifically, higher correlations were found between job satisfaction and vigor (r = 0.370) and job satisfaction and dedication (r = 0.377). We also observed an expected positive correlation between teachers' autonomy  and job satisfaction (r = 0.176), as well as between teachers' autonomy and social support (r = 0.195). Finally, the high correlations among the subscales of teaching practices (i.e., between differentiation and classroom management practices, r = 0.621) seem to indicate the intrinsic consistency of the teaching practices dimension.</p><p>The tested structural equation model is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</p><p>From the statistical point of view, regarding the evaluation of the goodness-of-fit indices (relative and absolute), the model was fully supported. The model shows an excellent overlap with all the indicators (relative and absolute): χ 2 (29) = 24.8978.2, p &lt; 0.05; NC = 2.7; RMSEA = 0.051, 95% CI = 0.037-0.044, NFI = 0.951, NNFI = 0.950, CFI = 0.968.</p><p>Starting from left to right, the total effect of the covariate variable (e.g., teaching years) revealed a small negative total effect on work engagement [β = -0.13, p = 0.010; 95% CI (-0.31 to -0.008)] and a positive small total effect on teaching practices [β = 0.11, p = 0.014; 95% CI (0.009-0.011)]. This means that the more experienced teachers tend to be less engaged in their work and to use more teaching practices. In contrast, a not statistically significant total effect was found in relation to the appraisal of psychological resources linked to the working environment [β = -0.02, p = 0.830; 95% CI (-0.008-0.006)].</p><p>With regard to the first hypothesis (H1), the model supported the idea that the appraisal of psychological resources linked to the working environment was directly associated with work engagement. In fact, the total direct effect was positive, large in size, and statistically significant [β = 0.73, p = 0.009; 95% CI (1.01-3.25)]. In particular, the analysis suggests that the higher the teachers' satisfaction, support, and autonomy are, the higher their scores on work engagement. With regard to the second hypothesis (H2), the direct effect of work engagement on teachers' practices was positive and small but not statistically significant [β = 0.10, p = 0.580; 95% CI (-0.444-0.375)], thus not providing support for H2. Finally, the analysis of the total effect of the appraisal of "psychological resources linked to the working environment" on teacher practice was positive, medium in size, and statistically significant [β = 0.45, p = 0.005; 95% ]. The decomposition of the total effect revealed that the working conditions were both directly [β = 0.37, p = 0.005; 95% CI (0.418-4.39)] and indirectly [β = 0.08, p = 0.032; 95% CI (0.575-0.925)] associated with the repertoire of practices. From this point of view, the analysis suggests that when teachers perceive their work environment as being supportive and satisfying (in the sense of the fulfillment of basic intrinsic psychological needs), they tend to be more engaged and use a larger array of teacher practices, in particular, differentiation [indirect effect, β = 0.39, p = 0.014; 95% ] and classroom management [indirect effect, β = 0.31, p = 0.011; 95% ]. The results provided full support for H3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The present cross-sectional research investigated the relationships among psychological resources linked to the working environment, work engagement, and classroom practices in a large sample of in-service teachers. In particular, a conceptual model was empirically tested to understand whether and to what extent the way in which teachers perceive psychological resources in their work environment (in terms of job satisfaction, social support, and autonomy) were associated with their work engagement and in turn with the variety of their teaching practices adopted in classrooms. Within the framework of self-determination theories, the rationale for the study was to understand which factors represent promoting conditions for the adoption of heterogeneous repertories in teaching, since the use of different teaching practices and techniques favors the academic outcomes of children <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Rowley et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fix et al., 2019)</ref>. All in all, our findings demonstrate that the presence of psychological resource favors the adoption of heterogeneous and rich repertories of teaching practices, meaning that when teachers perceive their work environment as supportive, satisfying and having a high degree of autonomy (i.e., from another perspective, when their basic psychological needs were fulfilled), they tend to use a larger array of teaching practices.</p><p>Concerning the relationship between the psychological resources and work engagement (H1), our results support the idea that a good appraisal of "psychological resources linked to the working environment" was a promoting factor in work engagement in terms of dedication, absorption, and vigor. These results are in line with current literature demonstrating that job resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bakker et al., 2007)</ref>, social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Saks and Gruman, 2018)</ref>, and autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Heyns and Rothmann, 2018)</ref>, might positively affect levels of engagement. Contrary to our expectation (H2), the direct effect of work engagement on teaching practices was small and not statistically significant. Finally, our results support H3, demonstrating that in our sample, intrinsic basic psychological resources (e.g., satisfaction, autonomy, and social support) were more associated to the promotion of teacher practices than were more other psychological aspects (e.g., work engagement). In particular, the analysis suggested that when teachers perceive their work environment as being supportive and satisfying, they tend to be more engaged and in turn use a larger array of teacher practices with students, in particular, differentiation techniques and classroom management. These results are in line with current self-determination theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Ryan and Deci, 2000)</ref> and highlight the role of intrinsic factors in promoting innovative teacher practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Klaeijsen et al., 2018)</ref>. Even if the aims of our study were not focused on the role of demographic variables, the structural model also suggests that the length of teaching experience years is associated with work engagement and teacher practices, with more experienced teachers showing less engagement and more use of teaching practices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>The results of the study show how the evaluation of the psychological working conditions environment (in terms of satisfaction, social support, and professional autonomy) is crucial in promoting teachers' decision to adopt different or innovative practices. From the point of view of ecological validity, the importance of the study is twofold: one theoretical and one practical. First, from a conceptual point of view, the data from the present study support the indications posited by the SDT that low-ordered basic intrinsic psychological needs are powerful drivers of human behaviors rather than high-ordered needs (e.g., work engagement). In fact, by linking the appraisal of "psychological working conditions" to directly observable tasks (i.e., frequency of teaching practices) of teachers' jobs, our analysis supports the direct association between the fulfillment of internal psychological states and teacher occupational behaviors in the educational context. Other attempts have been made (see, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Reeve, 2002)</ref> to apply SDT to educational settings; however, such studies have focused on students' behaviors rather than on teacher practices. From this point of view, the present study represents one of the first attempts to apply SDT to the comprehension of teaching behaviors in terms of teaching techniques. Second, and perhaps more germane, our results are an important indicator in terms of planning both preservice and in-service teacher training and promoting the use of innovative techniques. From this perspective, the study shows that to increase the adoption of innovative practices, it is first necessary to work on the perception of "psychological working conditions, " especially in terms of general satisfaction and perception of social support and autonomy. This means that intervention programs aimed at improving the adoption of large and flexible repertories of teaching practices should include work on teachers' satisfaction, autonomy, and social support. In organizational terms, this would imply a shift from a microsystemic level (e.g., a teacher in interaction with his/her student in a classroom setting) to a macrosystem level (e.g., a teacher in interaction with the organizational system that interacts with students in a classroom setting), putting emphasis on the need for the individual to be supported, satisfied, and more independent and self-directed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations, Suggestion, and Future Research</head><p>As in the case of other studies, the current research has some limitations that should be addressed. First, all the data were collected by self-reported measures; thus, the presented results may suffer from the common method bias (MacKenzie and Podsakoff, 2012), meaning that some of the statistical variance can be accounted for by the use of self-reported measures rather than by the structural model. Second, it should be noted that all the participants were from Canton Ticino (Switzerland), and generalization to other populations of teachers should be made with caution. In this regard, the finding of the present study should be read more in terms of transferability to similar contexts rather than generalizability to different educational systems or cultural settings. Third, the study was limited to compulsory schools, and higher level education was not taken into consideration. Further studies are welcome to expand current knowledge about teachers' practices by replicating the present research in other educational grades. Finally, the research design was cross-sectional; consequently, assumptions about cause-effect relationships should not be made. In this regard, the author agrees with the position of <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Pearl et al. (2016)</ref>, who state that in cross-sectional design, the relationships between variables should be considered probabilistic rather than deterministic. Beyond the limitations, the present study supported the idea that practice-oriented research and enquiry should be framed within local contexts. In fact, psychological resources linked to working environments represent a powerful "tool" for protecting teachers from the adverse effects of their profession, especially from social-related aspects of their work environments. Teachers should be trusted, supported, and empowered as professionals who can be agents of change contributing to school development. Teachers should be expected, enabled, and encouraged to collaborate; their competences and capacities, as well as their autonomy and accountability, should be considered not only individually but also collectively as part of professional teams. These aspects also affected the variety of practices used by the teachers in classrooms. Future research on teaching practices should consider exploring other psychological resources (e.g., quality of life, principal leadership, collaborative working) linked to the working environment as perceived by workers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1 | Hypothesized conceptual model of association among considered variables.</figDesc><graphic coords="5,56.61,69.02,480.00,264.48" type="bitmap" /></figure>
