<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The world is facing constant changes of the requirements for the competitive environment, customer needs, the business challenges that have led to the invasion of digital technology, and finally the new innovations to the business environment across its various sectors, which contribute to improving its operations, achieving customer satisfaction and business objectives, and gaining a greater market share.</p><p>Accordingly, the pharmaceutical manufacturing organizations have been moving towards the adoption of enterprises' resources planning systems, which allow organizations to optimally exploit available resources to allow for more efficiency and effectiveness in the implementation of business plans, reduce the response time due to the effective transfer of Information, and in turn, ease the decision making process in real-time through a set of integrated programs that contribute to the sharing of accurate information among all of business units. This is manifested through the improvement of communication and coordination between the internal processes and external partners such as: the relationships with suppliers, distributors, and customers through supply chain Integration, which supports coordination between supply chain members who manage inter and intra-organization activities starting from (receiving of customer order, provision of raw material, manufacturing, distribution, ending with delivery of the product to the end consumer) to achieve more efficiency in the flow of products, services, and information that provide customers with higher value at the right time, in the right place, suitable price, and high quality. On the other hand, the success of the supply chain integration reflects into the value added towards the customers, organizations' quality reputation, timely delivery, and ensuring the continuity and survival globally. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tseng, et. al. (2011)</ref> stated that customer satisfaction is a primary cause that leads organizations to use information technology tools to access information and relationships with customers, in order to make the core processes of business more flexible and efficient. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ince, et. al. (2013)</ref> believes that organizations need efficient and effective information systems like ERP system to obtain accurate data at the right time to compete at the global complex marketplace. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gollner, et. al. (2016)</ref> mentioned that organizations noticed that the competitiveness of business found into effective distribution of resources and improvement of business processes that are integrated and seek to accomplish the high quality of product, low cost, and delivery in the right time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Madanhire and Mbohwa (2016)</ref> explained that the use of ERP systems provides support for all of important activities such as (manufacturing and logistics, finance, sales, CRM, SCM, and HR) through the integration of data and shared knowledge among all business units. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ngai, et. al. (2011)</ref> said that supply chain integration is one of most important elements of SCI requirements to design a network in which the supply chain partners cooperate with internal business processes to reach to optimum practices. <ref type="bibr">Ram, et. al. (2013)</ref> discussed that SCI seeks to linkage internal processes with external processes (outside partners) such as: suppliers and customers through the ERP system to achieve rapid responds to customers' needs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Marinagi, et. al. (2015)</ref> mentioned that supply chain management integration works on the controlling of information, materials, services and money to enhance the quality of business operations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gollner, et. al. (2016)</ref> reported that ERP evaluation has to be considered through the stakeholders' involvement.</p><p>Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of ERP System Usage on Supply Chain Integration in Jordanian Pharmaceutical Manufacturing firms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Significant of the study</head><p>There are a few researches addressed the ERP System Usage in the Arab countries in general. In addition, there are a few studies are talking about the impact of ERP System Usage in Jordanian pharmaceutical manufacturing firms, and supply chain integration. Therefore, this study will have a small contribution to building further studies of this topic that can be used in other industries. The existing study might be considered as one of the studies that combined both variables (ERP and SCI) together to examine its impact on business processes and relationships with abroad partners, and level of alignment with ERP system. As well as, may provide managers with recommendations in some of pharmaceutical manufacturing firms in regard to re-discuss using of ERP system as an information system to develop their business, retain its market share to achieve the competitive advantage.</p><p>Therefore, this study would discuss the extent of ERP System Usage at pharmaceutical manufacturing firms to look into its benefits that return on businesses. At the same time, what are they losing when they never apply these technologies to accomplish their business processes? Moreover, this study can be used to give a recent recommendation for decision makers and other managers about the importance of ERP and the effect of using the technology on business partnerships with suppliers, and customers to help in the right decisions in the real time; In general clarify the benefits of ERP System usage for all processes. Finally, provides a theoretical and academic framework about the impact of ERP System usage on Supply Chain Integration that could support researches about the benefits of ERP systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) System</head><p>The term of Enterprise Resource Planning arose from the Material Requirements Planning and Industrial Computraization systems; it is introduced by Garnar firm for Research and Analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jagoda and Samaranayake, 2017)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mabert, et al. (2013)</ref> ERP systems currently seek to cover all the basic functions of any service or production organization, since service organizations, nonprofits and governments are all now able to use the ERP systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Garg and Khurana (2017)</ref> there are many examples of units in the ERP systems that have an individual application: manufacturing, supply chain, finance, customer relationship management, warehouse management, and decision support system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Njihia &amp; Mwirigi (2014)</ref> determined that information systems literature refers to the beginnings of events of What to know about "information systems integration", which is the basis in the work of ERP software to the sixties and seventies and specifically by developing what is known as inventory tracking systems through Material Requirements Planning and MRP II (Manufacturing Resource Planning) systems have also contributed to laying the foundation stone for ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software development. Indeed, many IT systems researchers' consideration Enterprise Resource Planning systems as a functional extension othe f manufacturing resource planning system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ullah, et. al. (2017)</ref> viewed the ERP systems as being system enhancing core business functions that can be supported through a comprehensive information system, that provconsistentently information for each part of business, which including HR, finance, marketing and sales, customer service, and intra-and extra operations on time.</p><p>Ociepa (2017) mentioned that ERP system as system to manage of resource planning, business commitments, data flows. <ref type="bibr">Finally, Syahid, et al., (2017)</ref> define ERP system as integrates data from each department under one centralized system contains a number of modules that designated based on department's needs.</p><p>The implementation of the ERP system requires prior systematic planning, especially with regard to the operations of the organization. Therefore, requires coordination with Individuals who specialize in these systems, in addition coordination between the various divisions and departments constituting the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abugabah, et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The implementation of the ERP system requires a major change in work practices and relationships from individuals to the management of the organization, because the process of change requires qualified individuals who are able to train workers and qualify them to adapt to the use of the ERP system <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fadlalla and Amani, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The sample size appropriate from study population were (183) employees working in the Jordanian Pharmaceutical Manufacturing firms (Human Resource Department, Financial Department, Production Department, Supply Chain Department as well as Operations &amp; Quality Department) who were chosen in a randomly sampling method.</p></div>
