<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Human needs for tourism today continue to increase throughout the world especially marine tourism which is widely developed in Indonesia. The potential tourism on Gili Ketapang Island is an attractive beach and coral reef for snorkeling. Marine tourism on Gili Ketapang Island is still recently developed and needs to be managed properly. This study aims to determine the quality of tour guide services, tourist satisfaction, revisiting intention and relationship between these three variables. Tour guide service variable is explained by four indicators: communication, attitude, skill and knowledge. Tourist satisfaction variable is explained by four indicators: tourist variation, service quality, activities quality, and object quality. The research conducted on January 2019 by interviewing to 100 snorkkling tourists then analyzed use Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) model to examine the relationships between variables and indicators. Tour guide service quality and tourist satisfaction are classified as good. Revisiting intention from tourist is also classified as good. Guide service has a real influence on the level of tourist satisfaction and tourist satisfaction also has a real influence on the revisiting intention of the tourists.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Tourism is now a necessity for almost everyone at various ages, education, or welfare levels. According to the UNWTO Tourism Higlights (2014), the number of tourist visits worlwide has increased up to 5% since 2013 and is predicted to rise. One of the popular type of tourism is marine tourism. Indonesia as an archipelago country offer more favorite destinations for tourists. Tourism sector also contributes significantly to the national economy through foreign exchange, since tourism is a complex activity involving many parties such as local communities who will provide lodging, food, transportation and other needs for tourists <ref type="bibr">(Syarani, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Gili Ketapang Island in East Java has great potential for marine tourism. The main attractive tourim objects include white sand beaches and variety of coral reefs that attract to do snorkeling. At least 11 different coral families were found in this island waters <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Puspitasari et al., 2013)</ref>. Gili Ketapang Island began to be inhabited by fisherman communities from Madura Island in 1991. The relatively natural conditions of the island encourage people to develop marine tourism in 2016 with community-based management. Research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Muthahharah and Adiwibowo (2017)</ref> mentioned that tourism development has impact such as can increase communities' incomes and encourage the construction of facilities and infrastructure in such tourist the areas. Tourism development is expected to increase the welfare of the surrounding community through the system formed.</p><p>Tourist development on this area has not yet been supported well hinder by lack of good human resources and funding. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Southgate (2006)</ref>, the lack of ability and knowledge in the management of tourist areas can be a major obstacle in the success of the region. Good tourism management will support the satisfaction of visiting tourists.</p><p>Tjiptono's (2012) stated that tourist satisfaction is a response of what perceived by tourists between expectations before and after the activity. <ref type="bibr">Cahyadi and Gunawijaya (2009)</ref> further explained that tourists will be interested to come back to the location if they get good knowledge and nice experience from services provided by a tour companion or guide. The satisfaction and desire of tourists to come can be the key of sustainable tourism management. Therefore the purpose of this study was to find out the relationship between the quality of service guides and tourist satisfaction and the desire of tourists to return to Gili Ketapang Island.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS OF RESEARCH</head><p>This research was conducted at the Gili Ketapang Island, Probolinggo Regency, East Java (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) in January 2019. The island was chosen because it has a newly developed marine tourism destination and has considerable potential based on its environmental conditions.</p><p>Gili Ketapang Island is in the administrative area of Probolinggo Regency in the East Java Province. It has an area of around 61 hectares and is inhabited by around 8061 people (BPS Probolinggo Regency, 2018). Geographically, this island is located between 7 ° 40'36.87 "to 7 ° 40'51.82" LS and 113 ° 14'35.68 "to 113 ° 15'42.05" BT. The boundary of the area around this island is the Madura Strait waters.</p><p>Data collecting method used structured interviews to the tourists choosing by random sampling. Data collected examine by Likert scale and then analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). This method examines the relationship between exogenous and endogenous variables, which have a direct or indirect influence in complex ways. Tour guide service variables are included in exogenous variables, while tourism satisfaction and return visit intentions are included in endogenous variables. The SEM model can be formed using Analysis of Moment Structure (AMOS) software version 23. The variables and indicators used in SEM modeling can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS AND DICUSSION</head><p>The tourist's profile of Gili Ketapang Island are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> found that the majority of respondents were male, age 20-25, types of work were student and came from East Java region. Gender and age of a person can influence behavior in tourism. Since snorkeling activities in Gili Ketapang attracted more male tourists in productive age because requires a supportive physical conditions. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Sarkawi (2015)</ref> gender differences between men and women can influence the behavior of an individual. Behavior will be influenced by the self-concept of a particular individual. This behavior can develop based on environment and knowledge.</p><p>Distance between the area of origin and location of tourism also influence tourism activities. Almost all tourists come from around of the Gili Ketapang Island, such as Probolinggo, Pasuruan, Situbondo, Surabaya, Malang, and Kediri. Variations of their origin is nearby the island and also influenced by easy distribution of tourism information. The tour guide service has been done with good and mostly of answers on 4 and 5 score. Hence, the indicators that should be improved are attitude and guides knowledge. The friendly cultural background of the community becomes the backbone of the communications and the good performances. Limited knowledge on tourism since they are fisherman who has not enough experience and not certificated also tourism activities that is only recently been developed. Although the tourist satisfaction has been achieved with good and mostly of answers on 4 and 5 score, still need to be increased. Indicators such as variations in activities and qualities of existing objects, can be increased by create more tourism activities. Historic location and cultural activities can be an attractive tourism option for new objects. The revisiting intention variable has the majority of answers on 4 and 5 score. This shows that respondents have high desire to revisit the tourist sites. Good experience, availability of information, and good promotion strategy give the highest value compared to those of the other indicators in supporting this variable. Motivation indicator has lowest value because tourism development in this area still has to improve on some aspect such as guide knowledge, tourist variation and object quality.</p><p>The equation model is considered as a good model if it has an acceptable measure or Goodness of Fit (GOF). Model match requirements and analysis results can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. Based on the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>, the model formed is quite good because it fulfills almost all the matching conditions between Cut off value and Analysis. This model can be used to test the hypotheses prepared in the study. The results of the hypothesis test are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>. Based on the analysis, tour guide services have real influence on tourist satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Purwaningsih (2013)</ref> showed that tourists basically have expectation before they come. This expectation is in the form of a desire to get new experiences that are different from the usual activities and get new knowledge related to tourism sites. The tour guide service quality will greatly determine the level of tourist satisfaction because if the service can exceeded tourist's expectations, the response of tourists will be good and has revisiting intention. Furthermore, Swarbrooke and Horner's research (2007) state that the benefits of fulfilling tourist satisfaction are recommendations between tourists.</p><p>H1: Tour guide services have a real influence on tourist revisiting intention.</p><p>Based on the analysis, tour guide services have a real influence on tourist revisiting intention. Nuraeni (2014) explained that service quality of tourism will affect tourists' satisfaction. The tour guide will provide the best service in order to influence tourists to visit again. Furthermore, Fen and Lian's research (2006) states that there is a significant positive influence between the qualities of service on the tourist interest to revisiting a location.</p><p>H1: Tourist satisfaction has a real influence on tourists revisiting intention.</p><p>Based on the analysis, tourist satisfaction has a real influence on tourists revisiting intention. Intention of tourists to return or revisiting the sites will provide a guarantee to continuity of tourism in the future. There is a strong relationship between satisfaction and desire to return as explained <ref type="bibr">Basiya and Razak (2012)</ref> about the positive relationship between customer satisfaction, behavior after activities and activity performance. Customers who have fulfilled their expectations before doing their activities will increase their desire or commitment to do it again. The analysis show that all indicators that forming the variables have a significant value on the model. C.R (Critical Ratio) and P (Probability) values have qualified the requirements. This result shows that each indicator can have a real influence on the variables formed, in which more positive the indicator value then be more positive the variable's value.</p><p>Some examples of indicators that have influence are communication on the guide service. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Purwaningsih (2013)</ref> explained that the verbal language skills of tour guides have a large influence on tourist satisfaction. Tourism activities can run poorly if communication between tour guide and tourists is not well established. The next indicator that has a big influence is the tour guide's attitude. Good behavior will also create a good impression for tourists. Generally the people of Gili Ketapang Island are friendly and open to tourists. This condition must be maintained so as to make the environment comfortable for tourists.</p><p>Indicators that have low value of loading factor are tourist variation. This can be due to limited tourist activities at this location. Tourism is only focused on snorkeling and only few part of the island can be used for snorkeling. The Kalebos study (2016), shown that the quality of products or tourism activities had a significant and positive influence on the satisfaction of tourists. The better quality of products or tourism activities, the more tourist satisfied.</p><p>Tourism development on the Gili Ketapang Island for the future needs to increase the knowledge of tour guide on tourism objects, especially coral reefs. This increase can be through training or additional insights related to coral reef ecosystems. Evaluation and development for marine tourism activities must be continue. This is because there are many positive impacts that arise from this development. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ghoddousi et al., (2018)</ref> explained that the majority of community stated that there were benefits from tourism activities through various aspects. Most local people also say that tourists can still respect to traditional culture. Stem et al., (2010) explained that higher levels of tourism can be a powerful tool to have an impact on the economy, social, and empowerment of local communities to support environmental conservation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>The quality of tourist guide services has been done well so that the level of tourist satisfaction is good. Tour guide service and level of tourist satisfaction encourage revisiting intention of the tourists. Guide service has a real influence on the level of tourist satisfaction. Communication indicator has the highest relationship value. Tourist satisfaction also has a real influence on the revisiting intention of tourists. Quality of activities indicator has the highest relationship value on the model. Tour guide service also influences revisiting intention even though the value is not as high as other variables. Development can be in the form of adding new tourism objects based on the potential of the region which is expected to increase tourist satisfaction so as to increase the revisiting intention of the tourists in the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1-Research location</figDesc><graphic coords="2,143.90,437.70,307.50,237.75" type="bitmap" /></figure>
