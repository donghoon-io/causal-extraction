<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Environmental stress factors have a very complex effect on the growth and growth parameters of plants. Therefore, special analytical techniques such as SEM-PLS can better understand the between observational variables and abiotic stress factors. Therefore, the present study was aimed to evaluate the, directly and indirectly, effects of the growth and biochemical parameters of sweet corn seed on yield, which seed primed with different melatonin doses and grown under different soil salinity conditions using the SEM-PLS model. Seeds of sweet corn cultivar Vega F1 were soaked in 0, 50, 100, and 200 μM of melatonin solution for 24 h, and then primed seeds were cultivated under four (0.27, 5.45, 9.00, and 12.32 dSm -1 ) soil salinity conditions. The study results showed that melatonin directly and positively affected growth parameters (β = 0.502, p &lt;0.05). In contrast, salinity directly and negatively affected growth parameters (β = -0.689, p &lt;0.05). Also, melatonin had a mostly indirect effect (β = 0.623) on biochemical components compared to direct effect (β = -0.277). The indirect effect (β = -0.855) of salinity on biochemical components was more significant than its direct effect (β = 0.244). Finally, the SEM-PLS can be used as a significant tool for understanding the benefits of melatonin and salinity's positive or negative effects through direct and indirect relationships with the mediating variables of growth parameters and biochemical, which are essential to optimize sweet corn yield.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Salinity stress (SS) is a critical factor affecting plant growth and contributes significantly to global agricultural productivity losses. Because of its high starch and vitamin content, sweet corn is widely grown in Turkey and other countries. However, sweet corn is susceptible to SS during germination and early shoot formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Wang et al., 2020)</ref>. Many physiological and metabolic processes in plants are restricted by SS thermodynamically. It has been widely reported that SS has a detrimental effect on sweet corn crops because it induces oxidative stress and increases soil osmotic pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Huang et al., 2019)</ref>. SS reduces plants' ability to obtain water, referred to as osmotic salinity or water deficit, resulting in shorter plants and lower biomass <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Huang et al., 2019)</ref>. This situation is mainly caused by decreases in the photosynthetic capacity of plants due to the high salt stress. Salt accumulation in the root zone induces osmotic stress and disrupts cell ion homeostasis by increasing the uptake of essential elements such as K + , Ca 2+ , Na + , Cu 2+ , and Zn 2+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ali et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Seed priming with melatonin (MT) is improved abiotic stress tolerance in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bahcesular et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cao et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li et al., 2017)</ref>. Several studies have shown that MT 10-200 μM can stimulate the growth and germination of various plants under SS conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Simlat et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Xiao et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>. However, the results of studies examining the relationship between melatonin treatment and SS were analyzed statistically separately for each treatment's effect on crop yield, while the effects of the MT on the growth processes and physiology in sweet corn have not been fully understood.</p><p>The relationship between multifunctional ecology factors and plants was recently studied using multivariate statistical methods such as Standard Equation Modeling (SEM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Grace et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hill et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jahan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lam and Maguire, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lamb et al., 2011)</ref>. Compared to multiple regression analysis, SEM can visualize how variables interact in a network concurrently <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lamb et al., 2011)</ref>. Researchers can use SEM to propose structural relationship models that include direct and indirect relationships between the examined parameters.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to replicate a previously tested hypothesis regarding the effect of MT application on sweet corn yields under different soil salinity conditions. We focused on analyzing the effects of MT and SS on sweet corn growth parameters (GP), biochemical composition (BC), and yield (Yi). We hypothesized that the effect of MT application on Yi under SS conditions would be mediated either directly or indirectly by GP and BC. Understanding how these treatment functions interact is critical for elucidating the mechanisms involved in Yi's effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIAL AND METHOD</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Field Site and Experimental Design</head><p>The study was conducted in the plastic greenhouse of Ondokuz Mayis University Agricultural Faculty's Practical Research Field in Samsun, Turkey using Vega F1 variety hybrid sweet corn seeds during July-August 2020. The selected healthy seeds were washed with distilled water, then sterilized for 2 minutes in 1% sodium hypochlorite solution, and finally washed with distilled water to sterilize the entire seed surface. Furthermore, sweet corn seeds were soaked for 24 hours in 0 (distilled water) as a control, 50, 100, and 200 μM of MT solution (denoted as M0, M1, M2, and M3). The soil was collected from a 0-15 cm horizon from the around research center and had a clay-loam texture. The soil's clay, silt, sand, pH, field capacity, and wilting point values were 36%, 17%, 47%, 32.16%, and 19.85%, respectively.</p><p>After air-drying the soil, it is sieved using a 2 mm sieve. Thereafter, 2.5 kg of soil is placed in a 15 cm diameter polyethylene plastic pot with a soil density of 1.28 g/cm 3 . After soaking the seeds in MT, they were air-dried and then planted into the soil with soil salinity levels of 0.27, 5.45, 9.00, and 12.32 dSm -1 (denoted as S1, S2, S3, and S4).</p><p>Each pot was placed in a complete randomized block design with three replications of each treatment, totaling 48 experimental pots. Daily monitoring and irrigation with low saline water (ECw = 0.25 dSm -1 ) are used to replenish soil moisture to field capacity when 40% of available moisture is depleted. Before planting, all pots are fertilized with TSP (Triple Super Phosphate) for phosphorus and AS (Ammonium Sulfate) for nitrogen. During the growth phase of 4-6 sweet corn leaves, the same fertilizer is applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection and Measurement</head><p>The study was ended 50 days following the initial planting. The plant samples were then harvested and immediately measured plant height, stem diameter, stem length, number of leaves, root length, and fresh weight. Each plant is separated into leaves, stems, and roots, rinsed until clean with distilled water, and then dried at 70 0 C until it reached a constant weight, and then the weights of the dried leaves, stems, and roots were recorded. Leaf samples of oven-dry plants were ground and passed through a 0.25 mm sieve, then weighed 2 grams each to analyze leaf mineral content. The content of Na + , K + , and Ca 2+ in leaves was performed by the photometer method, and the content of Cu 2+ , Mn 2+ , and Zn 2+ was performed by the inductively coupled plasma method (Optima 2100 DV; Perkin-Elmer, Shelton, CT).</p><p>The chlorophyll content was determined using a SPAD handheld chlorophyll meter (SPAD-502, Minolta, Osaka, Japan). Data were collected at six points on perfectly developed leaves, from tip to base, and an average was calculated for each treatment. Similarly, stomata conductivity was determined using a porometer (AP4 Porometer Delta-T, Cambridge, UK).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suctural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS) Analysis</head><p>SEM-PLS is frequently used when the research objective is to predict the relationship between constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fan et al., 2016)</ref>. In this study, the SEM-PLS analysis technique was used to analyze the theoretical model of the effect of MT applications on sweet corn growth and yield under different soil salinity conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The effect of MT and SS application on GP, BC and Yi was initially assessed using a two-way ANOVA (p&lt;0.05). According to the ANOVA results (data not shown), it was found that the construct variables GP, BC, and Yi showed significant differences to be maintained for further analysis using SEM-PLS. For data analysis, Anderson and Gerbing's two-step modeling method was used according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson et al. (1988)</ref>. The first stage involves evaluating the outer (reflective) measurement model, while the second stage involves evaluating the outer (structural) measurement model, including hypothesis testing. Additionally, we included a model fit evaluation to validate our proposed model hypothesis further.</p><p>To evaluate the reflective model in the first stage; we have used measurement items such as outer loading, reliability composite (CR), and Cronbach's alpha with values greater than 0.70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hair et al., 2020)</ref>, Average Variance Extracted (AVE) with values greater than 0.50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hair et al., 2020)</ref>, and Heterotrait-Monotrait Ratio (HTMT) with a value less than 0.85 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Henseler et al., 2015)</ref>. The second stage involves the evaluation of the structural model used to test the hypothesis. The proposed model comprises the observed exogenous construct variable, MT, and endogenous construct variables, SS, GP, BC, and Yi. The evaluation of structural models is widely preferred for predicting and validating the relationship between variables. We examine the predictive relevance of the proposed model and the relationships between variables in this modeling. The main criteria for measuring the structural model are the determination path coefficient (R 2 ) with a value of 0.75 substantial, 0.50 moderate, and 0.25 weak <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>; the path coefficient (α value) and the T statistical value are considered significant if the comparison of the Tstatistic value is greater than (5%; 1.96) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Weir, 2005)</ref>. Another important method used to measure the structural model is the model's predictive relevance (Q 2 ) and effect size (f 2 ), with values of 0.35 substantial, 0.15, moderate, and 0.01 weak <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chin, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hair et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The Standardized Root Mean Square (SRMR) and Goodness of Fit (GoF) index values were used to evaluate the model's fit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hu &amp; Bentler (1999)</ref> determined that an SRMR value of 0.08 was an acceptable match. Meanwhile, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tenenhaus et al. (2005)</ref> proposed a GoF with a value (&gt; 0.9) to close to 1 for general validation of the PLS pathway model. The Chi-Square value was used to evaluate the suitability of the overall model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>. A good fit model will give results with a value (P&gt;0.05) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barrett, 2007)</ref>. Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Normed Fit Index (NFI) with a value (≥ 0.95) are currently recognized as an indication of the best fit model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>. Currently, this index is the most popular measure because it is one of the least affected by sample size. The predictive evaluation of the PLS pathway model and its predictive performance is performed to rule out the possibility of the model overfitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Shmueli et al., 2016)</ref>. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) indices were used to evaluate the PLS model predictions. RMSE and MAE can range from 0 to ∞, and negatively oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Shmueli et al., 2019)</ref>. All SEM-PLS analyses were conducted using the statistical program SmartPLS 3.2.9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of Reflective Measurement Model</head><p>The descriptive statistical results of the measured parameters are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Outer loading criteria are used to determine the correlation between the construct variables' indicators. For confirmatory and exploratory research, the expected outer loading value is &gt; 0.70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hair et al., 2011</ref>). An indicator with an outer loading value &lt; 0.70 indicates that the indicator does not significantly correlate with the formed construct variables. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows that all indicators have an outer load value of &gt; 0.70 and can be followed by evaluating the formed reflective construction model.</p><p>To evaluate a reflective model, we demonstrate the accuracy of measuring required variables in each factor. We evaluated this conceptual model using reliability tests like Cronbach's alpha (α) and composite reliability (CR). In our study, the SEM-PLS measurement model constructs result of Cronbach's alpha (α) and composite reliability (CR) were &gt; 0.70, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Additionally, convergent validity can be used to determine the extent of a measure's evaluation of the reflective model. Convergent validity in our study was measured using the AVE, which must have a value &gt; 0.50 to show that the model construction explains more than 50% of the item variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hair et al., 2020)</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, all model constructs get AVE values &gt; 0.50 for this conceptual model to accept convergent validity. The next step is to determine the ratio of the inter-trait correlation with the trait correlation to demonstrate the model construct's discriminant validity. HTMT is the basis for statistically discriminating validity tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Henseler et al., 2015)</ref>. The HTMT approach is used to estimate the true correlation of model constructs. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows that the HTMT value is significantly lower than the conservative threshold (HTMT &lt; 0.85), the HTMT value close to 1 is considered lower, indicating discriminating validity. As a result, we conclude that the theoretical model construction we propose is appropriate for verifying all adequate evaluation measurement models.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of Structural Measurement Model</head><p>To improve understanding of structural model evaluation, we examine the proposed model's predictive relevance and the relationships between constructs. The standard estimate of the path coefficient describes the effect in the model construct between variables. The path coefficient value was used to determine the significance level of the relationship hypothesis between model constructs in the SEM-PLS regression analysis. The path coefficient represents the expected variance in the endogenous constructs for the exogenous variant. The greater the path coefficient value is shown, the more significant the effect on the endogenous latent structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chin, 1988)</ref>. All of our hypothesized structural path coefficients demonstrated significantly different significance at the level (p &lt; 0.05). Our results show that all proposed hypotheses were validated and accepted. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, the application of MT has a significant positive effect on Yi (β = 0.002, p &lt;0.05), whereas the application of SS has a significant negative effect on Yi (β = -0.005, p &lt;0.05). MT has a negative effect on BC (β = -0.277, p &lt; 0.05), with SS having a negative effect on BC (β = 0.244, p &lt;0.05). In contrast, MT has a positive effect on GP (β = 0.502, p &lt;0.05), having a negative effect on GP (β = -0.689, p &lt;0.05). Analysis of the path coefficient provides a comprehensive interpretation and can be carried out in applying the conclusions. SEM-PLS analysis can be used to deduce causal relationships between variables in complex data sets. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>, the application of MT to sweet corn seeds planted under SS conditions could be identified using the SEM-PLS model of complete path coefficients to explicitly test the direct, indirect, and total effects on each variable. Standardized values on these coefficients can help compare paths better. MT application has a significant positive direct effect on GP, but SS has a significant direct negative effect on GP with their respective values (β = 0.502 and -0.689, p &lt;0.05). Meanwhile, MT and SS were more dominant, with their respective values affecting BC indirectly (β = 0.623 and -0.865, p &lt;0.05).</p><p>The total effect of MT on Yi of sweet corn plants was significantly positive (β = 0.465, p &lt;0.05) mediated by BC and GP. In contrast, the total effect of SS on sweet corn Yi has a negative significance (β = -0.674, p &lt;0.05) mediated by BC and GP. Direct and indirect effects support the total effect of MT and SS on Yi. These results are supported by the construct variables relationship, which has a very strong relative impact, as shown by measuring R 2 , Q 2 , and f 2 in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Fit of the Model and Predictive Evaluation</head><p>Although the SEM-PLS does not explicitly address model fit, some researchers propose several important indices for evaluating the model structure's suitability such as SRMR, GoF/GFI, Chi-Square, CFI, NFI, RMSE and MAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kline, 2015)</ref>. According to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>, our study's SRMR value of 0.072 indicates that the data measured by the proposed hypothetical model is competent <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>. The GoF/GFI model criteria are 0.903; the closer to 1, the proposed model hypothesis is more competent <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Tenenhaus et al., 2005)</ref>. The Chi-Square value was 1100.619 (P&gt;0.05), meanwhile the CFI and NFI values were 0.95 and 0.96, respectively, which showed that the conceptual model had a good fit. The RMSE and MAE values in our study indicate the predictive model of evaluation (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref>). The RMSE value ranges from 0.925 to 1.063, while the MAE value is between 0.844 and 0.925. This value is considered suitable for selecting the best prediction model among the alternative models <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sharma et al., 2018)</ref>. The predicted value will be closer to the path model hypothesis proposed if the indicated value is lower. Following a thorough evaluation of the outer (reflective) and inner (structural) models and the fit model and SEM-PLS path model prediction, it was determined that all of the hypotheses we proposed were statistically significant and verifiable.  Şekil 2. Yapısal eşitlik modelinin analiz sonuçları.</p><p>The results of the SEM-PLS analysis support the hypothesis of the conceptual model that we propose (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The model can understand the direct and indirect effects of applying MT to the soil under SS conditions on Yi. Besides, this study fills a gap in the literature by examining the effect of MT and SS on Yi, such as through GP and BC-mediated effects. The two treatments used in this study, MT and SS, affect GP, BC, and Yi through a complex series of relationships (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The optimal model for Yi demonstrates that the application of MT has a direct positive effect, whereas the application of SS has a direct negative effect. Soaking sweet corn seeds in MT or SS affected Yi construct variables such as above-ground biomass fresh weight and above-ground biomass dry weight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Each MT and SS treatment directly affected Yi and a negative indirect effect through the GP variable with the indicator characters PH, NL, RFW, RL, SFW, StD, and StL. Several previous studies have shown that the increase in SS directly inhibits seed germination, root elongation, plant growth and results in plant death <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Isayenkov and Maathuis, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Numan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Qin et al., 2019)</ref>, but growth inhibition is overcome by applying MT. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Liang et al. (2019)</ref> reported that when plants are subjected to abiotic stress, MT up to 200 μM can consistently increase plant height and biomass. Moreover, many</p><p>studies have shown that MT can increase root length and weight in corn <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Yoon et al., 2019)</ref>. Our analysis confirmed this finding. All indicators representing the GP variable decreased in SS conditions that increased to 12.32 dSm -1 . Nonetheless, the application of MT at a concentration of 100-200 μM m reduced damage caused by SS conditions. In a recent study, MT can be considered an IAA-like hormone regulating plant growth and development <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2016)</ref>. According to the results of the SEM-PLS analysis, the GP variable has a direct positive effect on the BC variable, which then has the same effect on Yi. The linear increase in plant growth increases BC activity by mediating biosynthetic and photosynthetic-related gene experimentation. Thus, MT directly affects the GP variable by encouraging sweet corn growth, similar to the BC variable.</p><p>Each MT and SS treatment had an indirect positive and negative effect on Yi, respectively, via the BC variable with the indicator characters Ca 2+ , Cu 2+ , K + , Na + , Zn 2+ , Ca 2+ /Na + , K + /Na + , CCI, and SC. Salt toxicity is one of the most common and severe types of stress damage to germinating seeds. In this study, SS treatment from 0.27 to 12.32 dSm -1 could increase Na + and Ca 2+ content and significantly decrease K + content. SS treatment has an indirect effect on plant physiological processes in response to SS. Therefore, MT plays an important role in regulating plant physiological processes. MT significantly decreased Na + accumulation and increased K + content in corn shoots grown in SS <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jiang et al., 2016)</ref>, which is consistent with our findings. However, we observed an indirect effect of MT on the BC indicator's characteristics in the form of Ca 2+ , Cu 2+ , K + , Na + , Zn 2+ , Ca 2+ /Na + , and K + /Na + . These results may be due to MT concentration, which functions as an antioxidant with the same concentration but under different environmental stresses.</p><p>Salinity conditions significantly affect the occurrence of photosynthesis in higher plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Mbarki et al., 2018)</ref>. However, it has been demonstrated that the application of MT increases the chlorophyll content and conductivity of stomata during the photosynthetic process under SS conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dai et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li et al., 2017)</ref>. These results confirm our findings that SS treatment of 12.32 dSm -1 can reduce chlorophyll content and stomatal conductivity (data not shown). However, the application of MT at a concentration of 200 μM M increased chlorophyll content and stomatal conductivity by 26% and 21%, respectively (data not shown). SS conditions in our study have an indirect negative effect on the photosynthesis process associated with toxic ions, which reduces the concentration of CO2 between cells and causes damage to photosynthetic electron transport affecting physiological processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acosta-Motos et al., 2017)</ref>. Meanwhile, MT application had a beneficial effect on stomata by increasing their chlorophyll content and leaf area. The efficiency of photosynthesis in stressed plants suggests that MT functions as a protective mechanism that compensates for the low demand for NADPH <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Liu et al., 2020)</ref>. Additionally, the increase in photosynthetic efficiency is because MT can boost the efficiency of phytochemicals and transcripts of photosynthesis-related genes and protect photosynthetic organs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Erland and Saxena, 2018)</ref>. As a result, the effect of MT protection on photosynthesis efficiency in plants is highly dependent on the concentration of MT.</p><p>Our proposed hypothetical model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) establishes a relationship between variables associated with complex constructs. Despite the small size of our dataset, it enables us to detect and confirm relationships between construct variables. However, some possibilities prevent us from detecting the relationship down to the construct variables' character indicators. We developed our SEM-PLS model for this study using hypotheses from previous research. Finally, it is critical to recognize the highly complex relationship between the effects of MT and SS applications on Yi. GP and BC are critical in mediating the effects of MT and SS on Yi. As a result, we argue that fully exploiting the beneficial effects of MT via direct and indirect relationships to the mediating variables GP and BC is critical for crop yield optimization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This study aims to set up a conceptual framework model for understanding the relationship mechanism of MT and SS applications to investigate the mediating role of GP and BC on Yi. This study shows that SS has a indirect (negative effect on Yi, but sweet corn seed priming with MT direct positive effect on Yi.</p><p>The consisting variables of PH, RL, CCI, Ca/Na, K/Na, and Zn had the most causal effect on aboveground biomass fresh and dry weight of sweet maize under seed priming with melatonin doses.</p><p>According to the path diagram, biochemical parameters were more important for the AGBDW and AGBFW of sweet maize than the growth parameters, which means that the seedling of the sweet maize was more sensitive to biochemical parameters than the growth parameters. Finally, due to the mediation of GP and BC, seed priming with MT under SS conditions can have positive results, although with a weak effect on Yi. As a result, we conclude that the SS constraint on sweet corn cultivation can be overcome by seed priming MT via GP and BC to boost sweet corn Yi's improvement.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
