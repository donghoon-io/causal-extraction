<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The increasing sophisticated learning technology and COVID-19 have pushed the teaching-learning process to use pedagogy, andragogy, and cybergogy approaches. The current research aims to investigate the relationship between the practices of these three approaches and student self-regulated learning. The structural equation model used indicates that pedagogy practices may affect the andragogy practices in teaching-learning process. Pedagogy approach shows no direct effect but has an indirect effect on students' self-regulated learning. The indirect effect comes from the pedagogy-andragogy continuum and the impact of pedagogy instruction on cybergogy practices. Andragogy practices also gives a significant impact on students' self-regulated learning and how the students use learning technology in cybergogy approach. Andragogy and the continuum of cybergogy promote students' selfregulated learning. These results indicate that pedagogy-andragogy continuum can have an interplay with cybergogy. The interplay of these approaches may encourage students' self-regulated learning. The current research can be a baseline to construct a new approach in teaching-learning process and its instructions in the classroom.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Online and distance learning has been applied in school closure situation in order to restrain the spread of COVID-19. Teachers have adapted to the pandemic condition of COVID-19 by changing the learning foundation in the COVID-19 quarantine situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Deineha et al., 2020)</ref>. This extreme situation has pushed teachers to develop their skill in using technology and meet the minimum technical requirements to use learning technologies such as Zoom, Webex, and Microsoft teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Collazos et al., 2021)</ref>. Teachers and students should also be prepared to shift the teaching-learning process from the conventional approach of pedagogy to andragogy.</p><p>Andragogy is adult education and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Jones et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Loeng, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Wozniak, 2020)</ref>. Even though andragogy is for adult learning, effective instructions for children can also be gained through andragogy <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Knowles, 1989)</ref>. Andragogy and pedagogy have a clear relationship and share common attributes and values that fit into each other practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bowling &amp; Henschke, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Jeanes, 2021)</ref>. Practically, mixing both approaches is possible. The interplay between pedagogy and andragogy in learning has been practiced in entrepreneurship education <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Jones et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Neck &amp; Corbett, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Santini-Hernández, 2022)</ref>, teacher education <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Diacopoulous &amp; Butler, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kasozi, 2009)</ref>, and school student learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adebisi &amp; Oyeleke, 2018)</ref>. The interplay between pedagogy and andragogy also meets the studentcentered learning especially for students at high school level.</p><p>Third-year students in Indonesian vocational high schools are generally 18 years old, who can be regarded as the early phase of emerging adulthood. The emerging adulthood phase is a phase when adolescents have an age range from 18 to 25 years old <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Arnett, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Arnett, , 2007;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Facio et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Reifman et al., 2007)</ref>. Students in this phase have special characteristics which may not fit with pedagogical and andragogical strategies in the classroom <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hägg &amp; Kurczewska, 2020)</ref>. Vocational high schools facilitate students to develop their skill, not only their knowledge; this is one of the andragogy principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Blaschke, 2019)</ref>. The effort to mix andragogy and pedagogy may have benefitted the learning outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bowling &amp; Henschke, 2020)</ref>. A mixed approach of andragogy and pedagogy meets the characteristics of students in their emerging adulthood phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adebisi &amp; Oyeleke, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hägg &amp; Kurczewska, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The interplay between the approaches in teaching-learning process has advanced from pedagogy-andragogy into pedagogy-andragogy-cybergogy. Sophisticated learning technologies have increasingly pushed the use of cybergogy in learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Iszatt-White et al., 2017)</ref>. COVID-19 pandemic is also responsible for the movement from pedagogy and andragogy approaches into cybergogy <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Stukalo &amp; Simakhova, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Self-regulated learning is the focus of student-centered learning. Self-regulated learning is the ability of learners to control what they want to learn based on their cognition, emotion, and motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Baumeister &amp; Vohs, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Panadero, 2017)</ref>. The use of technology and cybergogy approach in the learning process may require students' self-regulation of learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bizami et al., 2022)</ref>. Andragogy effect on self-regulated learning has been studied in some research. Implementing andragogy and cybergogy approaches can boost students' self-regulated learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Guo, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Muresan, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Savickas &amp; Porfeli, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Yang &amp; Wong, 2020)</ref>. These studies provide conceptual information of how the approaches may affect students' self-regulated learning. There has been no research with empirical data that focuses on pedagogy-andragogy-cybergogy continuum and the interplay on the classroom praxis and their effect on students' selfregulated learning, especially on grade 12 vocational high school students which may be considered as emerging adults. The current research investigated the practices of pedagogy-andragogy-cybergogy continuum in a vocational high school and their effect on promoting students' self-regulated learning.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pedagogy</head><p>Pedagogy is an act of teaching including planning and executing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alexander, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Alexander, , 2008))</ref>. Pedagogical approach supports the idea to educate children and youths <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Savicevic, 2008)</ref>. Industrial revolution has influenced the development of pedagogy in a way; combining existing knowledge with the newer one needs to be systematic <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Malek, 2017)</ref>. Pedagogy is a way of teach students about concepts stated in textbooks <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Schrum et al., 2007)</ref>. Pedagogy has some key principles.</p><p>Pedagogy has some extensions, but the current research used traditional pedagogy which is still widely use in Indonesia. Traditional pedagogy has been linked with behaviorism which states that students' behavior can be predicted, influenced, and modified through reward and punishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bowling &amp; Henschke, 2020)</ref>. Pedagogy has the following characteristics:</p><p>(1) teacher dependent and determined, (2) structured method, and (3) depending on exogenous factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bowling &amp; Henschke, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Malek, 2017)</ref>. These characteristics may be operationalized through some indicators. The indicators are presented on table 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Andragogy</head><p>The definitions of andragogy by experts are generally similar to Knowle's definition of Andragogy <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Henschke, 2015)</ref>. Knowle's definition of Andragogy is just one of several concepts of andragogy <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Loeng, 2018)</ref>. The term of andragogy comes from the Greek of "aner" which means "man" and agein which means "to lead". Andragogy can be defined as a man that leads. Since andragogy is a widely known term, it is defined as adults (of all genders) that lead <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Loeng, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Andragogical institutions were established hundreds of year before children education <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Savicevic, 2008)</ref>. In Europe, there were 5 different views on andragogy: (1) andragogy as pedagogy discipline, (2) andragogy as integrative science, (3) andragogy as both pragmatic and practical, (4) andragogy as a field of research, and (5) andragogy as an independent scientific discipline with its own scientific structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Savićević, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>As a discipline, andragogy can be regarded as the progression of pedagogy where students have more autonomy and teachers have less instructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Blaschke, 2019)</ref>. Andragogy has the principles of (1) dependent and independent, (2) single-loop, (3) teacher-guided with a linear design, (4) self and group learning, and (5) depending on endogenous factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Malek, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Wozniak, 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cybergogy</head><p>ICT in learning in the 21st century requires redesign or regeneration of the education system, especially vocational education. Teachers and students will benefit from using ICT tools in learning, such as e-learning, mobile learning, and online learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Basak et al., 2018)</ref>. This redesign is called cybergogy. Cybergogy is a strategy used by teachers to create engaging learning through online media <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Wang &amp; Kang, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>One implementation of the cybergogy approach is providing interactive learning contents to make active learning effective and increase learning effectiveness, transfer knowledge sharing, student confidence, and interest and ultimately foster independent learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Daud et al., 2019)</ref>. The cybergogy approach in learning can be used anywhere and anytime by accessing computers and the internet through e-learning, facilitating collaborative learning strategies and discussions <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Mustapha et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Regulated Learning</head><p>Self-regulated learning (SLR) is a process in which students personally used their cognitions, affects and behaviors to achieve the learning goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Schunk &amp; Zimmerman, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bandura (1986)</ref> defines SRL as students' situation in learning to actively take part in arranging their activities in studying, promote their motivation and academic purpose, regulate human and learning resources, and execute the decision and its implementation in the process of learning. Zimmerman states that SRL is students' ability to actively engage in the education process using their metacognitive, motivation, and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cleary &amp; Zimmerman, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Zimmerman, 1989)</ref>.</p><p>Self-Regulated Learning aims to facilitate the creation of effective independent learning for each individual by inspiring oneself in learning. The indicators of Self-Regulated Learning support teachers in creating a student-centered learning framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Nu'man et al., 2021)</ref>. Self-regulated learning ensures that students become the main agents in active learning. The curriculum currently applied in Vocational High Schools optimizes learner-centered learning so that students self-regulate and motivate themselves in setting goals and reflecting on learning outcomes by using various learning skills; students apply constructivism learning theory by thinking metacognitively <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Pintrich, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Zimmerman, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>SLR has several dimensions, namely goal setting, help seeking, self-learning, managing physical environment, and effort regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kocdar et al., 2018)</ref>. These SLR dimensions are used in the current research because SLR is developed based on distance learning which might fit with cybergogy on the distance learning in COVID-19 pandemic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research goal</head><p>The main objective of the present study is to investigate the relationship among pedagogy, andragogy, and cybergogy approaches as part of hybrid approach praxis used for Indonesian students. The impact of this relationship on students' self-regulation in learning is also investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Type</head><p>The research employs quantitative method. The relationship among students' perceptions about pedagogy, andragogy, cybergogy praxis and their self-regulated learning was modeled using structural equation model (SEM). One popular and powerful type of SEM is structural equation model using partial least square method to estimate the model parameter (PLS-SEM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Akter et al., 2017)</ref>. PLS-SEM has two separate assessments of the final results. The assessments evaluate the measurement and structural models <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>. The measurement model is called outer model whereas the structural model can also be defined as inner model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. The Framework of Pedagogy-Andragogy Continuum with Cybergogy</head><p>The framework above shows that there are mediated paths between the variables. Mediated paths are paths between two variables that are mediated by the third variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Sarstedt et al., 2020)</ref>. Mediator variable is a variable that transmits the effect of the independent variable to the dependent variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Demming et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hair et al., 2021)</ref>. The framework of the current research shows that andragogy and cybergogy mediate the pedagogy effect on self-regulated learning. Cybergogy also transmits the effect of andragogy to self-regulated learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>In the structural equation model, determining the sample size is still an object of discussions. The most popular method is the 10-fold method (J. F. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hair et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kock &amp; Hadaya, 2018)</ref>. Based on the method, the number of samples should be at least ten times the number of links in the outer and inner model <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Goodhue et al., 2012)</ref>. Since this 10-fold method is shown to give less power, it is not effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kock &amp; Hadaya, 2018)</ref>. The higher power in minimum sample determination is shown by the inverse square root method <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kock &amp; Hadaya, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Using WARPls and the structural model in the current research, the minimum sample determination with 𝛼 = 5% and 85% power (1 -𝛽 = 85%) using inverse square root method is equal to 432. The number of samples in the current research is 450 students which exceeds the minimum sample size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instrument</head><p>The instrument was a questionnaire with 5-point likert scale. Questionnaire is the most popular instrument used in research especially in educational research <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Radhakrishna, 2007)</ref>. Using a questionnaire in research may decrease the research cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Jack &amp; Clarke, 1998)</ref> and make the data gathering efficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Codó, 2008)</ref>. The instruments used in the current research were developed from the literature review done in the previous part (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). From the 4 variables of the model, three of them are newly developed instruments. The only instrument adapted from the existed instrument is the self-regulated learning instrument. The development of the instrument was done based on their indicators (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The instrument was given to the participants using a digital form. Since there were two or more variables, variable items in the digital form were separated in different part of the form. This is done to control common method bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. The validity and reliability of the items developed are discussed in measurement models of structural equational model in findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Models</head><p>In the model of the current research, students' perception on pedagogy approach in the classroom is the exogenous variable. The perceptions on andragogy and cybergogy praxis, and the students' self-regulated learning are the endogenous variables. The model was constructed to investigate the relationship between these variables and their impact on students' self-regulated learning.</p><p>The measurement models of variables were established using reflective model. The indicators were acquired from the literature on pedagogy, andragogy, and cybergogy praxis and also students' self-regulated learning. The indicators are reflection of the contracts in the model.</p><p>The evaluation of the measurement model is focused on the reliability and validity of the constructs (do <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Valle &amp; Assaker, 2016)</ref>. The first measurement to check in the measurement model is the item factor loadings. Factor loadings measure the internal consistency of the items. Factor loadings should be larger than .708 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hair et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hair et al., , 2017))</ref>. In a newly made instrument, the internal consistency larger than .6 is acceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hulland, 1999)</ref>. All items in pedagogy, andragogy and cybergogy meet the internal consistency criteria. Some problematic items in self-regulated learning which have not met the .6 threshold are excluded from the model. .7332 Note. The value of loading items marked "out" are those that are eliminated because they do not meet the criteria &gt;0.6.</p><p>Measuring internal reliability consistency through composite reliability, Cronbach alpha, and rho is a way to assess the construct reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cepeda-Carrion et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hair et al., 2020)</ref>. Cronbach alpha is shown to be less precise than composite reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hair et al., 2019)</ref>. Compared to the other two measurements, Rho A is a usable reliability measurement, and its value is shown to have more precise results than Cronbach Alpha but less precise result than composite reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Dijkstra &amp; Henseler, 2015)</ref>. A reliable item should have a minimum of .708 of its Rho A and composite reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Franke &amp; Sarstedt, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Sarstedt et al., 2022)</ref>. Items of the constructs have Rho A and composite reliability larger than .708 which makes them reliable.</p><p>Another key psychometric in measurement model is average variance extracted <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Chin, 2010)</ref>. AVE measures the convergent validity of the construct in the measurement model <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hair et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hair et al., , 2021))</ref>. AVE of the construct has to be at least .5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Akter et al., 2017)</ref>. All constructs in the model meet the AVE criteria. At first running of the model, AVE of Self-Regulated Learning does not exceed the .5 criteria. AVE of Self-Regulated Learning can meet the criteria by excluding the unsatisfactory factor loadings. The construct with items exceeding the rule of thumb of the factor loadings makes AVE of the construct produce satisfactory reliabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 1988)</ref>. The last criteria checked is discriminant validity. Discriminant validity is one of key measurements in model evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bagozzi &amp; Phillips, 1982)</ref>. As the most widely used ratio, Heterotrait Monotrait Ratio (HTMT) has the largest sensitivity.</p><p>HTMT can identify the construct with lack of discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Henseler et al., 2015)</ref>. Since HTMT ratio calculates the average correlation of the items with other constructs, it should be limited with maximum threshold. HTMT ratio must be lower than .85 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hair et al., 2020)</ref>. HTMT of the constructs in the model indicates that the constructs have a good discriminant validity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model</head><p>Since the measurement model indicates that the constructs give a valid dan reliable data, the structural model may be discussed. The structural model shows the relationship between latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. Structural Model of Pedagogy-Andragogy Continuum with Cybergogy</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the relationship between constructs by bootstrapping the data and producing t statistics. Bootstrap result shows that all paths in the structural model have a significant value except the path connecting pedagogy and selfregulated learning. Pedagogy does not directly affect the self-regulated learning, but its indirect paths through andragogy and cybergogy has a significant value. Since there are direct and indirect effect on some constructs, the appropriate statistics to investigate the effect on each construct in the structural model is its total effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1: Andragogy (AND) has positive significant total effect on Cybergogy</head><p>The result of the structural model on total effect indicates that andragogy has positive significant total effect on Cybergogy (𝛽 = 0.553, 𝑝 &lt; .001).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The result of the current research indicates that classroom instructions in COVID-19 pandemic have interplayed pedagogy, andragogy and cybergogy approaches. School closure in COVID-19 pandemic has transformed learning process in classroom into online and distance learning (ODE). ODE may convert the pedagogy approach into androgogy approach because andragogy approach is relevant with ODE context <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Blaschke, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Andragogy praxis is affected by pedagogy approach. Andragogy approach emphasizes the single loop learning in pedagogy and changes the learning process from instructor-directed to instructor-learner directed <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Blaschke, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Blaschke, , 2019;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kanwar et al., 2013)</ref>. Due to this change, the pedagogy praxis in the classroom may affect the andragogy praxis, especially in emerging adults.</p><p>On interplaying these three approaches, cybergogy praxis is also related to pedagogy and andragogy praxis. There is a relationship between pedagogy, andragogy, and cybergogy. Cybergogy has a central principle from the combination of pedagogy and andragogy to get a novel approach in virtual distance learning environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Cronin et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Scopes, 2009)</ref>. A good practice of cybergogy includes positioning students as the focus and center of the learning process, promoting learning environment which engages the students, and giving students a space for reflection <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Cronin et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Goody &amp; Malone, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Laurillard, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Wang, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Pedagogy praxis in the classroom indicates an unsignificant effect on self-regulated learning. Pedagogy has characteristics that may contradict self-regulation of students on their learning process. Pedagogy approach in learning is connected to behaviorism <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bowling &amp; Henschke, 2020)</ref>. Behaviorism in learning process is also called as the stimulusresponse theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Clark, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mowrer &amp; Klein, 2000)</ref>. Classroom with stimulus-response theory is dominated by teachers with their stimulus. The classroom is teacher dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kaplan, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Tümen Akyıldız, 2019)</ref>, which gives a little space to students to regulate their learning.</p><p>The other two approaches on the continuum indicate different results. Andragogy praxis in the classroom is proven to promote the self-regulated learning of the students. Andragogy is the progression of pedagogy on the continuum which gives more space for student autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Blaschke &amp; Hase, 2019)</ref>. Student autonomy allows students to determine what to learn and when they learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abeni, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Aziz et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Putarek &amp; Pavlin-Bernardić, 2020)</ref>. The student autonomy is also shown in cybergogy approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bizami et al., 2022)</ref>. Student autonomy has a direct effect on student-self regulated learning. Students with acceptable level of autonomy will regulate their learning by themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Oates, 2019)</ref>. However, cybergogy has least effect on self-regulated learning.</p><p>The minimum effect of cybergogy on self-regulated learning can be caused by some factors related to the use of the internet and technology. Indonesian students are not used to using various technologies in the learning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hasudungan et al., 2021)</ref>. There are also some obstacle in using the technology related to the insufficient internet infrastructure to improve the quality of student learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Sardjuningsih &amp; Huda MF, 2022)</ref>, such as the connection quality of the internet and the amount of internet quota available to access online learning sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Qhoimah et al., 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The result has reflected the interplay of pedagogy, andragogy, and cybergogy praxis in the classroom and its effect on promoting student self-regulated learning. The current research shows an empirical relationship of the approaches on pedagogy-andragogy-cybergogy continuum. The result strengthens the conceptual framework of the continuum and demonstrates how it may affect student self-regulated learning. Pedagogy praxis has been proven to have a limited effect on SRL since traditional pedagogy provides less space for student autonomy in the learning process. On the other hand, andragogy and cybergogy approaches give a strong effect on how the students may regulate their learning. The ability of these two approaches to promote self-regulated learning of the students is the autonomy characteristic of the approaches.</p><p>The results also reflect that interplaying pedagogy, andragogy and cybergogy in the classroom can improve students' self-regulation in learning process. Pedagogy approaches may have no direct effect on promoting students' selfregulation in learning process, but it provides basic principles for andragogy and cybergogy development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>The present research has proven the relationship of pedagogy-andragogy-cybergogy continuum and its relationship to students' self-regulated learning. The result also supports the pedagogy-andragogy-cybergogy continuum as a conceptual framework. Further research can include other learning approaches that may also have an interplay in the classroom praxis. The classroom praxis may also include heutagogy and peeragogy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The current research has some limitations, especially related to sample and population of the study. The sample of the current research includes vocational high school students from two provinces in Indonesia, South and West Sulawesi. Since andragogy and other innovative pedagogies should be applied in adult learners, the model can also be tested on adult learning in higher education. I gain knowledge, attitudes and skills from the teacher through direct learning, reading test books, conducting experiments in the classroom/lab/workshop, audio-visual media, doing questions, quizzes and tests. (PED2) I am required to prioritize and instill discipline in the learning process, assignment and assessment. (PED3) I am taught knowledge of facts/problems, then theories that match the facts/problems and procedures to solve a given problem. (PED4) I was also taught how to analyze, evaluate and create a problem by providing alternative solutions. (PED5) I was taught directly to learn and practice to acquire technical competence (work) and career according to the field of expertise. (PED6) Andragogy I develop the competencies (knowledge, attitudes and skills) acquired at school on my own initiative for self-study (AND1) I gain a lot of competence by seeking and learning from my own experience by interacting with the learning environment both at school and outside of school (AND2) I cultivate self-study awareness (AND3) I determine the time, place and try myself to study and do learning tasks (AND4) I learn from various learning sources by interacting with the learning environment to provide maturity in knowledge and skills (AND5) I identify and take the initiative to study on my own to acquire vocational competence in order to meet the demands of the world of work (AND6) Cybergogy I actively access the cyber world such as accessing the internet, google classroom/whatsapp group class, youtube to receive and share learning materials (CYB1) I can also acquire hard skills (Knowledge and skills) and soft skills (attitudes and character) competencies through online learning both at school and in industry (CYB2) I take the initiative to learn on my own, receive and share learning materials by utilizing the internet (online) system available now such as google classroom/whatsapp group class, youtube etc (CYB3) I am actively getting used to learning and getting references online (cyber) both knowledge and skill competencies (CYB4) I document learning and related materials obtained offline/online on google drive, email, blog etc (CYB5) I access the virtual world (internet/cyber) to get the latest learning materials and support (CYB6) I usually use digital technology to learn skills/competencies such as zoom, Vlogs, Video podcasts, Smartphones, Google Drive, websites and other technologies (CYB7) Self-Regulated Learning I set my study goal each day (SRL1) I learned the way I had previously planned (SRL2) I usually contact a friend who I think understands the subject I am studying (SRL3) I enjoy discussing lessons with other friends (SRL4) When it is difficult to understand the lesson, I always ask my friends until I can understand the lesson (SRL5) Drawing diagrams, tables or schematics makes it easier for me to learn (SRL6) To be able to understand the subject matter, I read it over and over again (SRL7) I review lessons and notes to get the gist of the subject matter (SRL8) I study in a place where I focus on studying (SRL9) In order to study well, I choose a place where no one bothers me (SRL10) I study the subject matter until the end even though the lesson is boring (SRL11) I always try hard to understand the subject matter (SRL12)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><graphic coords="3,166.27,466.52,262.23,210.15" type="bitmap" /></figure>
