<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and alcohol use disorders are among the leading causes of disability worldwide. Among university students, alcohol use and poor mental health are associated with risky sexual behavior. Given the syndemic occurrence of these disorders most especially in young adults, we describe the relationship between them so as to guide and intensify current interventions on reducing their burden in this population.</p><p>Methods: This was an online cross-sectional study among healthcare professional university students that captured sociodemographic characteristics, risky sexual behavior, alcohol use disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression. Structural equation modelling was used to describe the relationship between these variables using RStudio.</p><p>Results: We enrolled a total of 531 participants of which 11% (37/351) had Alcohol Use Disorder, 33% (117/351) had depressive symptoms and 32% (111/351) had symptoms of anxiety. A model describing the relationship between these variables was found to t well both descriptively and statistically [χ 2 = 44.437, df = 21, p-value = 0.01, CFI = 0.989, TFI = 0.980, RMSEA = 0.056]. All observed variables were found to t signi cantly and positively onto their respective latent factors (AUD, anxiety, depression and risky sexual behavior). AUD was found to be a signi cant predictor of risky sexual behavior (β = 0.381, P &lt; 0.001), depression (β = 0.152, P = 0.004), and anxiety (β = 0.137, P = 0.001).</p><p>Conclusion: AUD, depression and anxiety are a signi cant burden in this health professional student population and there's need to consider screening for anxiety and depression in students reporting with AUD so as to ensure appropriate interventions. A lot of attention and efforts should be focused on the effect of AUD on risky sexual behavior and continued health education is still required even among health professional students.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders worldwide and is associated with signi cant morbidity, mortality and socio-economic burden <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. In Uganda, 59% of the general population are current drinkers and the prevalence of alcohol use disorders currently stands at approximately 10% <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> which is signi cantly higher than the African prevalence of 3.7%. Among young adults, alcohol use is an already established burden with the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking being highest among those aged 20-24 years <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Globally, university students are known to be heavy drinkers <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> and are reported to consume higher levels of alcohol than their non-university peers <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. Changes in social contexts, having drinking peers and fewer restrictions due to living away from parents may explain the increase in prevalence, amount and frequency of alcohol use in this age group <ref type="bibr">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Evidence of this problem in Uganda, is drawn from previous studies among students at Makerere University and Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) that found high prevalence rates of maladaptive alcohol use patterns <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Studying AUD is very important given its impact on population health and the global burden caused by the harmful use of alcohol is very enormous. Currently, Africa bears the largest burden of disease and injury attributed to alcohol <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Studies have shown that relative to their non substance using peers, young adults who regularly abuse substances are more likely to be more sexually active at an earlier age <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, have more sexual partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and are more likely to have unprotected sex <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. A study in Kenya highlighted that 1 in 5 university students engaged in sex after drinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Harmful use of alcohol has been shown to have a negative impact on HIV infection and transmission by increasing the risk of HIV transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, negatively affecting HIV treatment through alcohol-drug interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and compromising immune responses thereby leading to increased susceptibility to infection <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>.</p><p>AUD has also been causally linked to depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Up to 50% of individuals receiving treatment for problematic alcohol use also met diagnostic criteria for one or more anxiety disorders <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. Studies have previously found that abstainers and heavier drinkers were at higher risk for depression than moderate drinkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Amongst university students, two studies established that problem drinking is related to depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Both alcohol use and poor mental health have been identi ed to be associated with risky sexual behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This is because negative thoughts associated with depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> affect the way one thinks about themselves and their behavior which can lead to unhealthy decision-making in several situations including sexual situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. These unsafe sexual behaviours including early sexual debut and having a higher number of sexual partners have previously been established to be more common among the youth due to peer pressure, low self-esteem and perception of low risk associated with these behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>Given this previously established relationship between AUD, depression, anxiety and risky sexual behavior, we used structural equation modelling (SEM) to explore the association between these disorders for the rst time in this population. SEM is a statistical technique that provides a exible framework for developing and analyzing complex relationships among multiple variables allowing researchers to test the validity of theory using empirical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In this study, we explored the magnitude of the effect AUD has on risky sexual behavior, anxiety and depression among study participants. Given the syndemic occurrence of all these disorders and their negative impact most especially in young adults, it was important to study this relationship so as to determine at which point interventions can be implemented for effective reduction in the burden of these disorders in this population. . With a maximum variability of 50%, the calculated sample size was 337 participants. In order to re ect the diversity of the population and to prevent oversampling of students from a given university, a strati ed random sampling method was used. The number of respondents needed from each university was calculated by multiplying the proportion of health professional students from that university in the overall study population with the overall sample size. Subsequently, the faculty (or college) administrators at each of the universities were contacted for the class lists of each of the selected courses. Each student on the given list was assigned a number. These numbers were picked from each list and fed into a computer, which randomly selected numbers from each list. Students corresponding with the chosen numbers and met the selection criteria to participate in the study were then contacted by their class leader for their emails. The team collected data from 351 participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Data Collection procedures</head><p>Following ethical approval by the Mbarara University Research and ethics Committee (MUST-2021-166), student leaders in the different courses across the different universities were contacted by a member of the research team and informed about the study procedures, ethical issues and data collection. The nation-wide lockdown during the data collection period necessitated the use of an online tool to collect data and some studies done during the same period had also utilized the same method to collect data <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>The research team and class leaders then shared out a link to Kobo Toolbox, an online survey tool, that hosted the questionnaire to the randomly selected students <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref>. The rst page of the data collection tool explained the study procedures and objectives before asking a participant to consent. Participants that did not consent were taken to the end of the data collection tool. Participants that consented were linked to the rest of the data collection tool. The questionnaire consisted of demographic and socioeconomic factors of the participants; the AUDIT tool, a Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screen (GAD-7), a screen for depression (PHQ-9) and questions on one's lifetime sexual behavior.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.1">Alcohol Use Disorder Identi cation Tool</head><p>The AUDIT tool was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a method of screening for excessive alcohol consumption in the past 12 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. It detects both AUD (harmful and dependent drinking) and at-risk alcohol consumption (hazardous drinking) which is one of its advantages over other drinking screening tools that mainly focus on harmful and dependent drinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>. The AUDIT is a 10item questionnaire which covers the domains of hazardous alcohol use (questions 1, 2 and 3), dependence symptoms (questions 4, 5 and 6) and harmful alcohol use (questions 7, 8, 9 and 10). A score of 8 or more was indicative of a strong likelihood of hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. It has previously been validated as a useful tool for screening for alcohol-related problems in university students <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref> and was previously used to determine factors associated with alcohol use among students at one university in Uganda <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. In this study, the Cronbach-alpha for the AUDIT tool was 0.84, hazardous alcohol use was 0.75, dependence symptoms 0.72 and harmful alcohol use was 0.67 2.3.1.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7)</p><p>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire is a seven-item, self-report anxiety questionnaire designed to assess the patient's health status during the previous 2 weeks. It was designed by Spitzer and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. The items of the questionnaire inquire about the degree to which the patient has been bothered by feeling nervous, anxious or on edge, not being able to stop or control worrying, worrying too much about different things, having trouble relaxing, being so restless that it is hard to sit still, becoming easily annoyed or irritable and feeling afraid as if something might happen. The scores of this questionnaire are presented from 0 to 21. Scores of 5, 10 and 15 represent cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively. Previous studies have established the GAD-7 as a reliable and valid instrument for assessing generalized anxiety in university students <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>. In the current study, the Cronbach alpha for the GAD-7 was 0.89.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.3">Depression: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</head><p>To assess depression, a 9-item depression module from the full Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) was used. As a severity measure, the PHQ-9 score can range from 0 to 27, since each of the 9 items can be scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref>. In previous studies, this tool was showed to have good validity and reliability among university students [28, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40]</ref> and in resource-constrained settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>. In this study, the Cronbach alpha in this study was 0.89.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Data Analysis</head><p>All data was analyzed using R version 3.6.0 on R studio Version 1.2.1335. RStudio was used to build the structural equation model in order to test the structural relationship between depression, anxiety and alcohol use disorder as experienced by healthcare professional students in Uganda. The following steps were used to build the model.</p><p>Firstly, descriptive statistical analysis (means and standard deviation for normally distributed numerical variables, percentages and frequencies for categorical data) was done to understand the general demographic variables for the participants in the data collected. Secondly, a correlation analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between depression, anxiety and alcohol use disorder among the study participants.</p><p>A structural model with four latent variables; alcohol use disorder, depression, anxiety and risky sexual behavior was then de ned. AUD was de ned by three measurable variables; harmful use, hazardous alcohol use and dependence symptoms, all of which were maintained as continuous variables. Both depression and anxiety were de ned by somatic and cognitive-affective symptoms whereas risky sexual behavior was de ned by number of sexual partners and change in condom use in the last 12 months.</p><p>The goodness of t and validity of this model was studied by con rmatory factor analysis (CFA), and the path coe cient between potential variables was calculated. Each path coe cient of the model was calculated with its signi cance being con rmed. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered for statistical signi cance.</p><p>3. Results</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Participant characteristics</head><p>We enrolled 351 participants with a mean age of 25 ± 3.7 years. Of the participants, the majority, 61% (214/351) were male while 39% (137/351) were female. University health professional students from years 1 to 5 were recruited, however year 4 students made up the biggest proportion 171(49%) of the study participants. Twenty-one participants (6%) reported a history of clinically diagnosed mental illness whereas 106 (30%) reported a family history of mental illness. The median number of sexual partners in the last year was 1. Of the study population, 37 participants (11%) had AUD, 117 participants (33%) had depressive symptoms and 111 participants (32%) had symptoms of anxiety. (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Correlation analysis of the variables</head><p>Pearson correlation analysis was carried out between the four variables (AUD, depression and anxiety) in order to understand their correlation. The results of the analysis of the variables are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>.</p><p>The correlation between the depression and anxiety was found to be statistically signi cant (r 2 = 0.754). However, there was no signi cant or strong correlation found between AUD and depressive symptoms or anxiety symptoms. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">SEM Model Results</head><p>As represented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, the model was found to t well descriptively (CFI = 0.989, TFI = 0.980, RMSEA = 0.056) and relatively well statistically (χ 2 = 44.437, df = 21, p-value = 0.01).  As indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, AUD was found to be signi cantly associated with depression (β = 0.152, P = 0.004), anxiety (β = 0.137, P = 0.001) and risky sexual behavior (β = 0.381, P &lt; 0.001). There was also a statistically signi cant and strong positive inter-factor correlation between depression and anxiety (r = 0.876), such that individuals reporting greater anxiety also reported greater depressive symptoms. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>In this study, structural equation modelling was used to determine the relationship between Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), depression, anxiety, and sexual behavior among health professional students. The AUD factor comprised of self-reported quantitative scores on harmful alcohol use, dependence symptoms and hazardous use of alcohol, all of which are components of Alcohol Use Disorder Identi cation Tool (AUDIT) developed by the WHO. Each of the mentioned indicator variables loaded signi cantly onto the single factor, AUD. Subsequently, AUD was found to be a signi cant predictor of risky sexual behavior, anxiety and depression. Additionally, anxiety and depression in this population of health professional students were found to be highly correlated.</p><p>Depressive disorders have been identi ed as the most common psychiatric disorders among people with AUD <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref> and in this study population, AUD was found to be a signi cant predictor of depression. This is similar to ndings of a study done among Makerere university students that reported that students who used alcohol were more likely to report depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. However, it has also been reported that people with depressive symptoms are more likely to use alcohol to alleviate their symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref> but, in this paper, a structural model with a causal path from AUD to depression was found to t the data better than a causal path from depression to AUD. This direction of association is similar to ndings of Ferguson and colleagues that a causal model in which problems with alcohol use led to increased risk of depression as opposed to depression leading to problems with alcohol use <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies have reported that the presence of either AUD or depression doubles the likelihood of occurrence of the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>. To explain this relationship, it has previously been hypothesized that alcohol use disrupts one's social and economic life, and physical health, these di culties later predisposing one to depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>. Alcohol consumption has also been implicated in the alteration of the brain's neurotransmitters which may predispose one to depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr">46]</ref>. Another explanation suggested by McEachin and colleagues is that exposure to alcohol reduces the expression of a key enzyme in folate metabolism reducing the amount of folate <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>. There's some evidence linking reduced folate levels with increased susceptibility to depression <ref type="bibr">[48]</ref>. It has also been argued that both substance use disorders and depression may be caused by similar underlying genetic and environmental factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>.</p><p>The presence of depression in patients with AUD has been noted to affect treatment outcomes because it may affect one's resolve to quit alcohol <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>. Alternatively, concurrent depression may lead to selfmedication with alcohol <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Based on the fact that depression may be a direct result of AUD, there's a chance that depression may remit upon treatment of AUD. It has also been argued that a signi cant proportion of young adults that present with depressive symptoms may have underlying AUD <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50]</ref>. This emphasizes the need to screen for alcohol-induced depression in this population of students. A better understanding of this comorbidity may inform intervention and treatment outcomes in this population.</p><p>Aforementioned, AUD was also identi ed as a signi cant determinant of anxiety symptoms among this population of university students. It has been established that one disorder may be, directly or indirectly, induced by the other. For example, a subject may turn to substance consumption as a means to cope with anxiety. Due to its linkage with alleviation of anxiety symptoms, anxiety and AUD are found to be highly comorbid in the population <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">52]</ref>. This is a more plausible explanation in this population of health care students that are constantly stressed due to the academic pressures of school <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref>. However, a study done among university students in UK found con icting results attaching alcohol use among university students to pleasure rather than a way of dealing with stress or anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref>. Symptoms of anxiety can also be triggered by the stress associated with substance consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[55]</ref>. Owing to the cross-sectional nature of this study, the causal-effect relationship between anxiety symptoms and AUD could not be determined despite some literature emphasizing that anxiety symptoms may predate AUD for this theory to hold. Another theory is based on the biopsychosocial disturbances caused by heavy alcohol consumption which can predispose one to anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref>. Chronic alcohol use has been associated with a GABA de ciency that may induce anxiety <ref type="bibr">[56]</ref>. Hazardous drinking has been postulated to lead to anxiety through a noxious combination of greater levels of life stress coupled with relatively poor coping skills.</p><p>In this study's model, the factor risky sexual behavior comprised of number of sexual partners and change in condom use in the last 12 months. Not surprisingly, the relationship between AUD and risky sexual behavior was found to be statistically signi cant. These ndings are consistent with those in a previous study done among MUST students <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref> in which alcohol use was found to be associated with having multiple sexual partners. These ndings are consistent with those from other studies that report alcohol use and inconsistent condom use among university students [58] and among the youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59]</ref>.</p><p>Approximately 32% of the participants reported having had more than 1 sexual partner in the previous 12 months and only 15% of participants reported a decrease in their use of condoms in the last 12 months.</p><p>The relationship between AUD and risky sexual behavior has been postulated to be due to alcohol ability to limit one's capacity to attend to distal inhibitory cues, thereby biasing attention toward more proximal instigator situational cues such as engaging in unsafe sexual behaviours <ref type="bibr">[60]</ref>.</p><p>The signi cant relationship found between AUD and depression, anxiety and risk sexual behavior indicates that students need to be educated on the health risks of some of their behaviors. However, there's also need to evaluate the effect of health education on changing student lifestyles. One limitation of this study is that assessment of AUD was based on self-report and therefore some respondents may have minimized levels of their current drinking. However, a previous study comparing self-report and collateral reporting of one's use of alcohol indicated self-report of alcohol use had a high validity <ref type="bibr">[61]</ref> while another study demonstrated limited bene t of using multiple indicators of alcohol use <ref type="bibr">[62]</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, this was a cross-sectional study and therefore causal relationships between AUD and risky sexual behavior or anxiety and depressive symptoms could not be inferred. Longitudinal studies with a larger sample size are more suitable and recommended to study and understand the causal association between these disorders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This study identi ed alcohol use disorder as a predictor of risky sexual behavior, anxiety and depression among health professional students in Uganda. This highlights the need for intensifying current interventions aimed at controlling the levels of alcohol abuse in this population. Going forward, this study highlights the need to routinely do depression and anxiety screens in the young adult presenting with alcohol use problems. Furthermore, there's need build the capacity of university mental health and addiction recovery programs to respond to and ght against substance use in this risk-population.</p><p>Figures</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>In this model, the AUD indicator variables, harmful alcohol use (β = 0.959), dependence symptoms (β = 0.677) and hazardous alcohol use (β = 0.696), loaded signi cantly onto the AUD factor.
