<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Similar to other countries, reproductive-age women in Nepal frequently encounter diverse mental disorders, yet they receive inadequate screening and attention. This research seeks to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive examination of the prevalence and factors associated with mental disorders of reproductive-age women in Nepal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>This study used the nationally representative Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2022 dataset to examine the association between mental disorders and potential confounders. Screening tools for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were employed, and descriptive and inferential statistics, including linear regression and structural equation modeling, were utilized in the analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The study found that 22% of Nepalese women aged 15 to 49 reported anxiety symptoms, while 5% reported depressive symptoms. The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) reveals that anxiety had the most signi cant positive effect on depression (β = 0.683, p &lt; 0.001), followed by emotional violence (β = 0.139, p &lt; 0.001). Marital status (β = 0.072, p &lt; 0.001) and the presence of genital discharge (β = 0.084, p &lt; 0.001) or ulcer (β = 0.058, p &lt; 0.001) in the last 12 months were also associated with higher levels of depression.</p><p>Conversely, self-rated health status (β=-0.121, p &lt; 0.001) was negatively associated with depression, indicating that better-perceived health was linked to lower levels of depression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Although the prevalence of anxiety symptoms is higher than that of depression, there is a positive relationship between these two. Consequently, it is crucial to address the identi ed factors contributing to anxiety and depression in this population group through behavioral and policy interventions to enhance the mental well-being of reproductive-age women.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Nowadays, mental disorders have become an unavoidable crisis, seeping into every corner of our lives, from our workplaces to our sleep. It is often considered the "hidden epidemic" of the 21st century, while mental health is recognized as a universal human right for all individuals (1). In 2019, 970.1 million people worldwide were affected by mental health issues, and according to a comprehensive study, it is anticipated that half of the world's population may experience a mental disorder at some point in their lifetime (2, 3).</p></div>

See the published version at <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-024-06249-2">https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-024-06249-2</ref>.</p><p>Gender is a signi cant factor that in uences the prevalence of mental disorders, where women are more likely to develop those conditions compared to men <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>. Particularly, the impact of mental health on reproductive-age women is profound and multifaceted <ref type="bibr">(5)</ref>. However, in light of the growing signi cance of this matter, women's mental and reproductive health have been explicitly embraced as essential elements of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 (6).</p><p>Women are noticeably at least two times more vulnerable to depression and anxiety than men, both of which negatively impact their overall well-being and functioning <ref type="bibr">(5)</ref>. World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the global prevalence of depression and anxiety among women is approximately 5.1% and 4.6%, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Mental illness among women in the reproductive age group  is a severe public health concern since they have to perform multifactorial gender and social roles, from childbearing and child-rearing to managing the family (8). In addition, biological factors, speci cally reproductive life events such as menstruation, pregnancy, the postpartum period, and menopause-have an adverse impact on the mental well-being of women <ref type="bibr">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr">8)</ref>.</p><p>The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study estimated that mental disorders accounted for around 11.47% of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) among women of reproductive age worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. In parallel, a systematic review revealed that the rates of antenatal depression range from 15-65%, which often leads to serious health consequences for both the mother and child, including low birth weight and premature delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Another review involving 565 studies from 80 different countries reported that approximately 17.22% of women experience postpartum depression (PPD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Besides that, women undergoing infertility, menopausal transition, and Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) exhibit a substantially higher prevalence of depression and other mental disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>. Many social, economic, and cultural circumstances govern women's mental health. The factors associated with antenatal depression include poor social status, poverty, lack of control over sexual and reproductive lives, intimate partner violence, sexual or domestic violence, childhood abuse, forced marriage, weak family support systems, poor physical health including poor nutritional status, lack of access to education, lack of decision-making power including family planning to socioeconomic choices, lack of access to antenatal care (ANC), or living with sexually transmissible diseases including HIV often contribute to suicidal tendencies among women <ref type="bibr">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>.</p><p>Several studies have identi ed that the severity of mental disorders in women of reproductive age is more prominent in low-and middle-income countries <ref type="bibr">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Despite the fact, this burning issue often remains undiagnosed, unaddressed, and stigmatized in many countries, including Nepal <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. A crosssectional study conducted in the rural Saptari district in Nepal reported a high prevalence of maternal anxiety and depression (16). Furthermore, a hospital-based study found a substantial level of depressive symptoms among post-partum mothers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. According to another study, more than one out of four mothers has been diagnosed with depressive symptoms (18). Notably, the primary cause of death among women of reproductive age is suicide in Nepal <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. However, no study has been deep dive into the contributing factors associated with mental illness, speci cally anxiety and depression among women of reproductive age. Most studies relied on small sample sizes; hence, the ndings are insu cient for macrolevel decision-making. Since the mental health of women is often a neglected issue, it poses a tremendous threat to the physical and psychological health and well-being of women. Remarkably, there is a need for a well-designed investigation in order to better understand the signi cance of this problem. Thus, this study set out to determine the prevalence and factors associated with depression among women of reproductive age in Nepal. Therefore, this study is expected to contribute to the broader public health agenda by providing evidence-based analysis and synthesizing critical factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data source and sampling</head><p>The study used the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2022 (NDHS 2022) data, which is a periodical survey carried out across the country from Jan 05 to June 22, 2022, in order to evaluate health indicators and to offer a detailed overview of population, maternal, and child health issues along with mental health status <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. Covering 14,280 households from 476 Primary Sampling Units (PSU), this study utilized twostage strati ed sampling where all women from all the households were eligible for interviewed whereas half of the households were chosen for the males; as a result, males from every second household were quali ed to be interviewed. By the end, 4,913 men and 14,845 women (representing 97% and 95% of the overall response rates, respectively) had successfully completed interviews. In this study, a total of 7,442 women's data were analyzed who participated in the mental health questions. Details of the sampling strategy and other measurements have been found elsewhere (NDHS 2022) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. This de-identi ed dataset is publicly available for academic and speci c research purposes upon request. Before proceeding with the survey, all the DHS survey protocols obtained ethical approval from both the ICF Institutional Review Board and the country-speci c review board.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome variables</head><p>Two widely-used instruments for screening for mental disorders were included in the 2022 NDHS's mental health module. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were employed for assessing anxiety and depression, respectively, with both scales having been previously validated in the Nepalese context and demonstrating good reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. Both scales are used based on symptoms that people had in the two weeks preceding the survey. GAD-7 score of 0-5 is considered mild, while a score of 6-14 is considered moderate and 15-21 is considered severe <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> while a PHQ-9 score of 0-4 is considered minimal symptoms or no symptoms, while a score of 5-9 is considered mild, 10-14 is considered moderate, 15-19 is considered moderately severe, and 20-27 is considered severe <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Both tools used a Likert scale to show how bad the symptoms are. Answers of "not at all" (never), "several days" (rarely), "more than half the days" (often), and "nearly every day" (always) are given numbers 1, 2 and 3.</p><p>When you add up the scores of all the items, you get the total number. The sum of the scores for each individual item yields the nal score. In the 2022 NDHS, using the validated Water Glass Pictorial Scale was used to rate the intensity of the symptoms. An empty glass means "never," a glass that is only 1/4 full means "rarely," a glass that is half full means "often," and a glass that is three-fourths full means "always."</p><p>This picture chart helped us understand how respondents felt and put the severity of symptoms they described into context, added that, there was no diagnostic testing done. Cronbach alpha of the PHQ-9 was 0.8875, while GAD-7 was 0.8126 in this sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictor variables</head><p>To identify the frequently used common predictor factors that are linked to outcome variables, we conducted a review of the literature. A few biological and socioeconomic variables were selected based on what was available in the dataset and relevant research. Age, region, education, wealth status, residence and marital status, and self-rated health status (classi ed as 1 for bad or very bad and 0 for very good, good or moderate). While some biological and behavioral factors such as total lifetime number of sex partners, ever had a terminated pregnancy, genital discharge in the last 12 months, experienced emotional violence, smoked cigarettes, frequency of husband/partner being drunk, visited a health facility in last 12 months, had genital sore/ulcer in last 12 months were considered for this study purpose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used for this study. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the background characteristics of the respondents while inferential statistics were used to determine the predictors variables against outcome measurements. Since the outcome were scored/continuous data we used linear regression methods along with structural equation method (SEM).</p><p>Univariate and multiple linear regression was carried out to select the predictors for nal model. For the data analysis STATA MP.16 and AMOS.24 were used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessing the SEM algorithms model</head><p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) is designed with the two-phase model (i) measurement model and (ii) structural model. The measurement model depicts the inner relationships between latent variables and observed variables, and the latter, along with the structural model, is used to investigate loadings and estimate indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr">(26)</ref>. The conceptual framework model was run using AMOS.24, and the structural framework used in the hypothesis testing segment is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>. AMOS.24 consists of a series of standard metrics, such as loading indicators, composite reliability, average variance extracted (AVE), path coe cients, inner structural correlations, latent variable scores, t values, etc. A structural procedure has been introduced to investigate loading and eliminating indications (loadings &lt; 0.70) was adopted <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. In the context of the study, we utilized a re exive measurement framework. In line with the majority of other behavioral research (28, 29), a set of assessment criterion that can quantify the credibility and viability of the SEM model with recessive criterion was proposed. Which are as follows- </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background characteristics of study participants</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents that, majority of the respondents were in the age group of 14-24 years (36.38%), with a high percentage being married (75.84%) and residing in urban areas (54.02%). Over 90% reported having single sex partners and the ability to refuse sexual intimacy (91.14%). However, 69.30% noted that their husbands consumed alcohol. A signi cant portion (79.87%) never had a terminated pregnancy, and 47.33% fell into the lower quartile of wealth status. Most females (89.30%) considered their health as good, while 87.55% experienced genital discharge in the last 12 months. Emotional violence was rare (87.55% never experienced it), and a small percentage smoked cigarettes (4.60%) or had genital sores or ulcers in the last 12 months (4.01%). Despite this, a majority (69.22%) visited a health facility in the last 12 months.  Signi cant variables from the linear regression table were initially incorporated into the model. However, variables exhibiting insigni cant direct or indirect effects on the dependent variables were systematically removed. The resulting nine-factor model aimed to predict general depression among reproductive-aged women in Nepal. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref> shows that, among the factors, anxiety exhibited the most substantial direct positive effect on respondents' depression (β = 0.65; p = &lt; 0.001). Emotional violence (β = 0.09; p = &lt; 0.001) demonstrated a signi cant direct positive effect on depression, with a signi cant indirect positive effect through anxiety and genital ulcer, indicating that respondents who experienced emotional violence scored higher on the depression scale and it also signi cantly affected the relationship of anxiety and genital ulcer to depression. Smoking (β = 0.02; p = 0.149) did not exhibit a direct signi cant effect on depression but had a direct signi cant effect (β = 0.04; p = 0.003) on anxiety, with a signi cant positive indirect effect on depression, suggesting that while smoking may not directly affect depression, it passively increases it.</p><p>Similarly, pregnancy termination (β = 0.00; p = 0.241) did not show a signi cant direct effect on depression but had an indirect effect on depression and a signi cant positive effect (β = 0.05; p = 0.009) on anxiety, indicating it also passively increases depression among reproductive-aged women in Nepal.</p><p>Self-rated health status had a signi cant direct negative effect on depression (β= -0.08; p = &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (β= -0.20; p = &lt; 0.001). Moreover, it had an indirect negative effect on depression and anxiety, in uencing respondents' frequency of visiting health facilities and experiencing genital ulcer or discharge in the last 12 months, indicating that poor self-rated health status both directly and indirectly increases depression and anxiety. Genital ulcer and discharge both exhibited signi cant direct positive effects on both depression and anxiety, with an indirect effect on depression through anxiety, meaning that respondents who faced genital discharge or ulcer in the last 12 months are more likely to experience depression. Visiting a health facility in the last 12 months did not have any signi cant indirect effect but had a direct positive effect on both anxiety (β = 0.03; p = 0.005) and depression (β= -0.02; p = 0.026).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The objective of this study was to discern the factors associated with depression among reproductive-aged women in Nepal, constricting a comprehensive model to elucidate the pervasive contributors to depression. The analysis incorporates socioeconomic factors, anxiety, and habitual aspects to develop a holistic understanding. This research identi es a robust negative relationship between self-rated health status and depression. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) further supports the notion that those perceiving their health as poor are more likely to experience depression. This aligns with the conclusions of Millán-Calenti et al. ( <ref type="formula">2012</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rohrer et al. (2008)</ref>, who found that reproductive-aged women with poorer self-rated health were more prone to depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Mohit et al. (2011)</ref> highlight the interconnectedness of physical illness and depression, asserting that one in three individuals with physical ailments experiences depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. Furthermore, an individual's self-rated health status has an indirect in uence on depression and can impact their likelihood of seeking medical care for conditions such as genital discharge or ulcers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mulsant (1997)</ref> highlights the interconnectedness of physical health and mental well-being, suggesting that deteriorating physical health can contribute to various health complications, potentially exacerbating depression symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>. Factors such as the inability to self-care, prolonged treatment regimens, persistent pain, frustration, fatigue, and the associated uncertainties and anxieties about health conditions might contribute to heightened depressive symptoms among individuals grappling with physical illnesses. Moreover, living with a physical disease can exacerbate depression, citing feelings of hopelessness, sleep disturbances, and the overarching uncertainty associated with health issues as exacerbating factors.</p><p>Genital discharge or sores in the last 12 months are identi ed as having a positive effect on depression, as indicated in the structural equation model (SEM). Similar ndings have been reported in previous studies, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Patel (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Winter &amp; Stephenson (2013)</ref> noting that women may experience anxiety due to these conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref>. Genital sores, causing continuous pain, can contribute to greater depression.</p><p>Psychological factors play a signi cant role in this phenomenon, as these conditions can be uncomfortable, painful, and raise concerns about hygiene, infection, and sexual health.</p><p>Moreover, genital discharge or sores not only directly impact physical health but also have indirect effects on mental well-being, particularly depression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Seidman &amp; Roose (2001)</ref> posit that sexual dysfunction resulting from such conditions can induce severe anxiety, especially among reproductive-aged women, due to concerns about further health deterioration (36). This anxiety can exacerbate depressive symptoms.</p><p>Additionally, these conditions can strain relationships, causing fear of rejection, intimacy issues, and communication breakdowns, all of which contribute to heightened anxiety and subsequent depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, the possibility of underlying medical conditions, such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or chronic skin conditions, may contribute to increased depression among women.</p><p>The study further highlights the impact of emotional violence from partners on depression, revealing it as a strong relationship in the SEM. This aligns with existing literature that establishes a robust connection between emotional violence and depression among women, which is aligned with previous studies (38-42). <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Dutton et al. (2006)</ref> found that the prevalence of depression in victims of emotional violence is twice that of the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Bonomi et al. (2006)</ref> further demonstrated that women who faced emotional violence are 2.06 times more likely to experience minor depression and 1.75 times more likely to experience severe depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. Additionally, the study underscores the impact of emotional violence on increasing anxiety levels among respondents, leading to heightened depression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Collins (2013)</ref> asserts that emotional violence, characterized by unpredictable and manipulative behavior, fosters an environment of fear and uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>. This lack of stability and control can trigger anxiety as individuals constantly anticipate potential threats. Consequently, victims of emotional violence may experience elevated levels of depression due to the ongoing emotional distress and psychological strain. Moreover, the lingering effects of emotional violence may endure longer compared to other types of violence. Emotional abuse can manifest through verbal attacks, belittlement, gaslighting, and manipulation, eroding a woman's sense of self-worth and con dence. This traumatic experience may lead to symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and contribute to a higher prevalence of depression among affected women.</p><p>Similarly, the study aligns with existing research indicating that women who smoke cigarettes are more likely to experience depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45,</ref><ref type="bibr">46)</ref>. Flensborg-Madsen et al. (2011) highlighted the association between smoking and a quick relief of stress, but the subsequent withdrawal symptoms, such as irritability and anxiety, can mimic or worsen depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>. Chronic smoking leading to nicotine dependence can create a cycle of heightened depression (48). This study further asserts that smoking increases anxiety and also have a passive effect on depression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Roth et al. (2001)</ref> argue that women of reproductive age, being particularly aware of the health risks associated with smoking, such as fertility issues, pregnancy complications, and increased cancer risks, experience heightened anxiety about their own health and potential impacts on future pregnancies <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>. This awareness leads to anxiety, which actively and passively affects the depression levels of reproductive-aged women.</p><p>Analysis of this study, it suggests that while pregnancy termination may not directly affect depression, it does have a signi cant passive effect, aligning with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Policy Recommendations</head><p>The ndings of this study indicate the importance of prioritizing the integration of mental health services into existing reproductive health programs in Nepal. This can be achieved by ensure that healthcare providers receive training in recognizing and addressing mental health issues during routine reproductive health check-ups especially among the women have any history of having genital ulcer or discharge. This study also highlights the implication of strengthening legal frameworks against emotional violence within family and societal relationships in order to reduce the mental health symptoms in women. This may be attainable through implementing educational programs in communities to raise awareness about emotional abuse, its consequences, and available support services. Furthermore, training of healthcare professionals could be effective to identify signs of anxiety and provide timely interventions, including counseling and referral to specialized mental health services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths limitations:</head><p>The strengths and weaknesses of this study are accredited. The strength that lies in this study is the generalizability of the ndings for Nepal since this survey covered nationally representative data covering a wide geographic area. Along with appropriate statistical methods and casual modelling are the main strengths of this study. While the limitations are its cross-sectional nature limits the casual inference since outcomes and predictors variables have been collected same time frame. In addition, some biological and behavioural variables were not collected based on clinical diagnose so readers are need to aware of reading the results. Even, the outcome measurements were collected before two weeks preceding the survey based on their self-report so it might be a recall biased problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In terms of socioeconomic, behavioral, and biological characteristics, this study revealed a signi cant issue with women's mental health di culties in Nepal. Because mental disorders are highly frequent among women in their reproductive years in Nepal, immediate, targeted efforts are required to screen and diagnose these patients in order to give care. This study may provide evidence to key stakeholders in designing programs to improve the mental health status of women in Nepal and other comparable countries.</p></div>

Economic status also played a role, with poor respondents scoring signi cantly higher in both anxiety (m-GAD score = 3.562; p-value = &lt; 0.001) and depression (m-PHQ score = 2.901; p-value = &lt; 0.001) compared to the other two economic groups, while rich individuals scored the lowest (m-GAD score = 3.103; p-value = &lt; 0.001; m-PHQ score = 2.387; p-value = &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, respondents who reported an inability to refuse sex (m-GAD score = 4.134; p-value = &lt; 0.001; m-PHQ score = 3.327; p-value = &lt; 0.001) or those with multiple partners (m-GAD score = 4.812; p-value = &lt; 0.001; m-PHQ score = 3.921; p-value = &lt; 0.001) scored signi cantly higher in both depression and anxiety scales compared to their counterparts. Women who had terminated a pregnancy (m-GAD score = 4.317; pvalue = &lt; 0.001; m-PHQ score = 3.489; p-value = &lt; 0.001), smoked cigarettes (m-GAD score = 4.829; p-value = &lt; 0.001; m-PHQ score = 4.131; p-value = &lt; 0.001), experienced emotional violence (m-GAD score = 6.254; p-value = &lt; 0.001; m-PHQ score = 5.799; p-value = &lt; 0.001), visited a health facility (m-GAD score = 3.567; pvalue = &lt; 0.001; m-PHQ score = 2.889; p-value = &lt; 0.001), or had genital sores or ulcers in the last 12 months (m-GAD score = 5.310; p-value = &lt; 0.001; m-PHQ score = 4.741; p-value = &lt; 0.001) also scored signi cantly higher in both anxiety and depression scales. Additionally, females who perceived their health as bad (m-GAD score = 6.087; p-value = &lt; 0.001; m-PHQ score = 5.498; p-value = &lt; 0.001) or reported their husbands getting drunk (m-GAD score = 4.205; p-value = &lt; 0.001; m-PHQ score = 3.464; p-value = &lt; 0.001) scored higher in both scales. In our study utilizing a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to measure depression among reproductive-aged women in Nepal, we employed standardized beta coe cients (β) to elucidate both direct and indirect associations among observed variables.
