<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In many review articles or studies, the researchers have encouraged further exploration on the causal links between Information Technology (IT) investments and a fi rm's sustainable competitive advantage. The outcomes of empirical studies have been inconclusive, which is to a certain extent due to the omission of IT-business strategic alignment. Indeed, strategic alignment has emerged as one of the most important issues facing business and IT executives all over the world. This paper reports on the empirical investigation of the success factors, which consist of leadership, structure and process, service quality, and values and beliefs, which are representative of the culture gap between IT strategy and business strategy. A questionnaire survey among 200 IT managers was carried out and 172 data sets were collected. This represented a 86% response rate. After a rigorous data screening process including outliers, normality, reliability and validity, 172 data sets were ready for structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis. Confi rmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was performed to examine the composite reliability, convergent validity and goodness of fi t of the individual constructs and measurement models. The revised structural model demonstrates the relationships between all the four exogenous variables and IT-business strategic alignment, and all the four exogenous variables and sustainable competitive advantage. In addition, regarding the revised model there are two mediating eff ects of strategic alignment in the relationship between leadership, structure and process, service quality, values and beliefs, and sustainable competitive advantage.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In order to improve their performance, fi rms invest heavily in IT such as hardware, software, network, and data components <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Oana, 2010)</ref>. However, based on the mixed fi ndings of the linkage between IT spending and fi rm performance, some researchers in the MIS fi eld suggest that IT-business alignment is a construct that can help organizations improve the positive impact of IT on organizational success (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Henderson &amp; Venkatraman, 1993 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Luftman &amp; Brier, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Luftman, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kearns &amp; Lederer, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sabherwal &amp; Chan, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Croteau &amp; Bergeron, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chan, Sabherwal &amp; Thatcher 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chan &amp; Reich, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dong, Liu &amp; Yin, 2008)</ref>. For organizations to stay competitive in a dynamic business environment, they have to determine and understand how to manage IT strategically as a key success factor for a successful business in a dynamic business environment that supports business strategies and processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Henderson &amp; Venkatraman, 1993)</ref>. Further, the alignment between the business strategy and the strategic choices of IT deployment is a prominent area of concern that business and IT management struggle with <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Johnson &amp; Lederer, 2010)</ref>. Strategic alignment refers to "The degree to which the IT mission, objectives and plans support and are supported by the business mission, objectives and plans" <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Reich &amp; Benbasat, 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">&amp; 2000)</ref>. However, regardless of a growing body of research, recent reviewers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chan et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chan &amp; Reich, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Masa'deh &amp; Kuk, 2009)</ref> have continuously called for more research into the factors that aff ect IT-business alignment. Consequently, this study tries to make an original contribution to the existing body of knowledge in the area of MIS by exploring the association between ITbusiness strategic alignment and sustainable competitive advantage. Moreover, the current study will contribute to IT-business strategic alignment literature by investigating a new theoretical approach to strategic alignment that has not been explored in the fi eld of IS. This is done by exploring the relationships between several factors (i.e. leadership, structure and process, service quality, and values and beliefs) on IT-business strategic alignment to achieve sustainable competitive advantage and how strategic alignment can mediate the relationship between these factors and sustainable competitive advantage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Review</head><p>Despite the criticality of the relationship between business and IT, there have only been a few att empts to investigate the relationship further. Although much has been writt en about business-IT strategic IJMS 18 (1), <ref type="bibr">155-172 (2011)</ref> 157 alignment, it concerns the issues of control of resources rather than managing relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ward &amp; Peppard, 1999)</ref>. Although the alignment gap represents an important concept in business-IT strategic alignment, it has not been presented or discussed explicitly in the business-IT strategy context. Moreover, none of the earlier studies conducted by researchers indicate who referred to the concept of the alignment gap between business strategy and IT strategy in particular. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to identify and prove this concept and to focus att ention on determining the reasons why the alignment gap exists between business strategy and IT strategy. This will provide great benefi t to the management in business and industrial organizations to address unmanageable issues resulting from the alignment gap, with diff erent management practices for bridging the alignment gap between business strategy and IT strategy. Although many scholars and authors in past studies have mentioned and discussed the term 'gap' or 'culture gap' in diff erent articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ward &amp; Peppard, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grindly, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Luftman, 2003)</ref>, none of these scholars or the authors att empted to provide a critical review of the concept of the "alignment gap" between business strategy and IT strategy in a conceptual manner. Some scholars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chan &amp; Reich, 2007)</ref> called for further adjustments to the concept of alignment by applying new theoretical approaches that have not been explored in the fi eld of IT. Therefore, this study aims to conceptualize IT-business strategic alignment into the alignment gap. The concept of the alignment gap between business strategy and IT strategy has emerged due to the fact that there are two separate organizational units in any organization -normally the IT department, which is responsible for IT activities and the business department. Understandably, this has led to the appearance of the gap between the IT functions and the business activities. Generally, IT function refers to the individuals who provide IT services to the organization. These individuals are usually highlyskilled IT professionals who have a certain amount of knowledge and experience in software engineering and technical aspects of computer hardware and software systems, and who carry out a variety of tasks to deal with the requirements of the fi rm for IT services. Certain functions of the IT professionals may include design, implementation, and maintenance of the software programmes, including data processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Ward &amp; Peppard, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sage, 2002)</ref>.The concept of 'gap', as used here, is based on the literature and refers to what is called the 'culture gap', which is a variable that explains the challenges that can exist between the IT function and the business activities. The culture gap concept consists of four dimensions, i.e. leadership, structure and process, service quality, and values and beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ward &amp; Peppard, 1999)</ref>. The culture gap has been identifi ed as a key factor in limiting the successful utilization of IT in organizations <ref type="bibr">(Grindly, 1992)</ref>. Leadership is elaborated upon by refl ecting both the leadership of the CIO and the leadership of the CEO. Service quality is considered to be vital in determining the customer-supplier relationship. Such relationships could be strengthened by the IT department by focusing on the development of IT outsourcing and the level of service that clients expect from the vendor. The last dimension, values and beliefs, shape how att itudes, behaviours and practices develop. Hence, the values and beliefs of a fi rm member have great eff ect on several dimensions of IT, including the way it is managed. Culture is an abstract concept that refers to the organizational culture in the organizational context. It is a shared set of values, behaviours and beliefs together with att itudes and experiences that represent unique characters that take the form of rules of behaviour in a work group or organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Galliers, Meriali &amp; Spearing, 1994)</ref>.The underlying reasons for the misalignment between business and IT include the lack of a common understanding of the concept of strategic alignment, and depend on the classical assumptions for the strategic planning process or ad-hoc IT investments in organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Oana, 2010)</ref>. She further indicated that the misalignment leads to missing competitive advantages and opportunities, increasing wasted time, increasing costs and creating a negative environment for IT investments. Indeed, probably the most common business concept today is competitive advantage. Despite its wide use, few researchers have att empted to defi ne the concept, and it is often confused with distinctive competence <ref type="bibr">(Day, 1994)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Porter's (1985)</ref> book, titled 'Competitive Advantage' propelled the concept of competitive advantage into the popular business vernacular. Porter did not articulate the defi nition of the concept but explained that competitive advantage refers to organizational factors that enable a fi rm to outperform its competitors. As such, Porter argued that sustaining competitive advantage should be the central purpose of an organization's competitive strategy and that creating value is the means for att aining it. As Collis and Montgomery (1995) explained, "competitive advantage, whatever its source, ultimately can be att ributed to the ownership of a valuable resource that enables the company to perform activities bett er or more cheaply than its competitors". Moreover, to be sustainable, a competitive advantage should be diffi cult to imitate or substitute <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Porter, 1985)</ref>.</p></div>

In addition, it will identify those factors that might lead to a bett er sustainable competitive advantage through strategic alignment. This conceptual model extends <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Henderson and Venkatraman's (1993)</ref>. Furthermore, the model acts as a guideline for organizations to lever their sustainable competitive advantage through strategic alignment.</p><p>For practitioners, this model will provide a detailed roadmap to guide the decision-making process and to focus their att ention on factors that aff ect sustainable competitive advantage.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>This study adopts a quantitative approach to the research. The unit of analysis is organizations sampled by IT managers of public shareholding fi rms in Jordan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaire Design and Measurement Scale</head><p>The questionnaire for this study consists of fi ve parts: Part one consists of a cover lett er explaining the title of the study and the purpose of the questionnaire; Part two consists of questions concerning the respondents demographic profi le; Part three contains the four latent constructs that are hypothesised to infl uence strategic alignment in Jordan; Part four contains the strategic alignment; and Part fi ve contains the sustainable competitive advantage. These constructs were adapted from previous strategic alignment and sustainable competitive advantage studies, thus, exploratory factor analysis is omitt ed. The measures are (a) Leadership measured by six items <ref type="bibr">(Ward &amp; Griffi ths, 1996)</ref>, (b) structure and process measured by six items <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ward &amp; Peppard ,1999)</ref>, service quality measured by fi ve items IJMS 18 (1), 155-172 (2011) 161 <ref type="bibr">Pitt , Watson &amp; Leavon (1995)</ref>, values and beliefs measured by six items <ref type="bibr">(Grindly,1992)</ref>, strategic alignment measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Pierce, 2002)</ref>, sustainable competitive advantage measured by six items consisting of three items that belong <ref type="bibr">(DeVilliers, 2006)</ref> and three items derived from operational defi nition. A seven-point Likert scale with anchors from (1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree, was used for all items. The sample frame was determined from the (ASE) Amman Stock Exchange (www.ase.com.jo), which includes 280 of the most powerful public shareholding fi rms from four sectors. The stratifi ed random sample used 200 respondents who were identifi ed from the South, North and Center of Jordan. The researcher distributed 200 questionnaires to the respondents of which 172 questionnaires were returned. Ten questionnaires were unreturned and another questionnaire was incomplete, leaving (172) questionnaires or 86% response rate for further analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Screening and Analysis</head><p>The 172 dataset was coded and saved into SPSS version 15.0 and analysed using AMOS version 6.0. The data was carefully examined for missing data. For the univariate normality test, Z-skewness scores greater than +3 or -3 were absent. Thus, each item was considered to be normal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Coakes &amp; Steed, 2003)</ref>. Thus, 172 questionnaires remained for fi nal analysis. Subsequently, several statistical validity tests were then conducted including the reliability test, composite reliability tests, confi rmatory factor analysis (CFA) for construct convergent validity, discriminate validity for multicollinearity treatment, descriptive analysis and correlation. Subsequently, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis using AMOS 6.0 was conducted. SEM was selected because it uses confi rmatory factor analysis to minimize measurement error through the multiple indicators pr-latent variable, able to estimate both direct and indirect eff ects, a testable model, and able to ensure consistency of the model with data, and to estimate the eff ects among the constructs. The SEM analysis produces two structural models, namely, hypothesised structural model and the revised model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Finding Demographic Profi le of the Respondents</head><p>The respondents consisted of female (48%) against males (52%). The majority of the sample was aged 41(7%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Statistics of Variables</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> indicates that the six constructs, four exogenous (leadership, structure and process, service quality, values and beliefs); and two endogenous (strategic alignment, and sustainable competitive advantage) have Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability of above 0.60. This implies that the measurement scales for all the variables are internally consistent and reliable <ref type="bibr">(Nunnally, 1970)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confi rmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) Results</head><p>Survey measures were assessed by one academic staff in Malaysia, and two academic staff in Jordan, who participated in the pilot study and all of them, have professional qualifi cations in management and IT. The survey was reviewed in Jordan by three IT managers as a sample of the respondents. The managers were professional people working in diff erent industrial sectors of the Jordanian public listed companies, with signifi cant experience in management and IT fi elds. The feedback from the participants revealed several points about the question rating, wording, and length.</p><p>From the confi rmatory factor analysis result in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, some scholars (e.g. Gerbing Anderson, 1988) argued that CFA can supply a stricter explanation of unidimensionality than other techniques like EFA (exploratory factor analysis). We observed that the factor loadings of all observed variables or items were adequate, at least 0.30, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pallant, (2007)</ref>. In order to validate the measurement model through CFA (confi rmatory factor analysis), it is important to assess each construct for reliability and validity in terms of convergent validity and discriminate validity. Indeed, the standardized regression weights for the research's indicators were examined, and it was found that some indicators had a low loading towards the latent variables, in particular </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discriminant Validity of Constructs</head><p>Discriminant validity refers to observed constructs that should not be highly correlated to each other (multicollinearity). In other words, observed variables should be discriminating or distinct <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>. To support discriminant validity, the average variance extracted (AVE) should be more than the correlation squared <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the result of the calculated variance extracted (VE) to support the discriminant validity of the constructs.</p><p>The average variance extracted (AVE) is the average VE values of two constructs (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). The VE is derived from the calculation of variance extracted using the following equation:</p><p>Variance Extracted = Consequently, each AVE value (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) is found to be more than the correlation squared (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>), thus, the discriminant validity is supported, i.e. multicollinearity is absent. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goodness of Fit Indices</head><p>Confi rmatory factor analysis was conducted on each individual construct and measurement model. All CFAs of the constructs produced a relatively good fi t as indicated by the goodness of fi t indices such as CMIN/df ratio (&lt;2); p-value (&gt;0.05); Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) of &gt;.95; and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) values of less than .08 (&lt;.08) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson &amp; Tatham, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 1988)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> shows that the goodness of fi t of the generated or re-specifi ed structural model is bett er than the hypothesised model.  As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>, although chi-square per degree of freedom ratio (x²/df =1.12) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA=.027) did change for the fi nal model, the incremental fi t index (GFI = .92), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI = 0.98), Goodness-of-Fit Index (GF I= .85), Normed Fit Index (NFI=.91) and comparative fi t index (CFI = 0.98) indicated a bett er fi t to the data after deleting the low-factor loading items. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses Results</head><p>Since the hypothesised model did not achieve the fi t model (p &lt; .000), the explanation of the hypotheses result is based on the Revised Model (RM), which achieved a model fi t of p-value = .172 (&gt; 0.05) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). The revised model produces regression standardized estimates direct eff ect readings (Beta), as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediating Eff ect Analysis of Revised Model</head><p>A mediating eff ect is created when a third variable/construct intervenes between two other related constructs. Regarding the Revised Model there is one mediating eff ect of strategic alignment.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hair et al., (2006)</ref> if the total direct eff ect is more than the total indirect eff ect, there is no mediating eff ect; if the total direct eff ect is less than the total indirect eff ect, there is a full mediating eff ect; and if the total direct eff ect is equal to the total indirect eff ect.</p><p>Then for the partial mediating eff ect as shown in Table <ref type="table">8</ref>, we tested the mediating eff ects of strategic alignment in the relationship between leadership, structure and process, service quality, values and beliefs and sustainable competitive advantage. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study is concerned with an empirical investigation of the success factors that could aff ect strategic alignment and consequently achieve sustainable competitive advantage. The Revised Model indicates that it has accomplished model fi t and while supporting seven hypotheses, it does not support six further hypotheses. As hypothesised (H1), leadership was found to have a signifi cant positive eff ect on strategic alignment (β = .114; CR = 2.312; p = .041). This result means that higher levels of communication through faceto-face, electronic mail and memos or through regular meetings lead to bett er strategic alignment in Jordanian public shareholding fi rms. Therefore,H1 is supported. The positive relationship between business-IT interaction and strategic alignment is consistent with the fi ndings of <ref type="bibr">Lind and Zmud (1991)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Earl and Feeny (1994)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Reich and Benbasat (2000)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Johnson and Lederer (2005)</ref>, that the interaction between IT and business managers was highly correlated with the degree of convergence between the two parties concerning the strategic role of IT in the fi rm. Structure and process (β = .011; CR = .144; p = .885) was found to have an insignifi cant eff ect on strategic alignment. This fi nding implies that Jordanian fi rms need to make sure of the association between the IT plan and the business plan. Most of the literature in previous studies indicated that it is necessary to involve IT strategy with business strategy <ref type="bibr">(Ward &amp; Peppared, 1999)</ref>; therefore, H2 is not supported. The third hypothesis suggests a positive relationship between service quality and strategic alignment (β = .100; CR = 1.420; p = .156). The fi nding shows that service quality has an insignifi cant eff ect on strategic alignment. This could mean that there is disagreement on the servicelevel agreement between IT strategy and business strategy causing an insignifi cant eff ect on the alignment between them. Therefore, H3 is not supported. This result is consistent with the fi nding of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pitt et al., (1995)</ref>. In addition, this study found that (values and beliefs) have a positive eff ect on strategic alignment (β = .206; CR = 2.705; p = .007). This fi nding suggests that a positive and successful strategic alignment can be formed if there is acceptance of the new technology from the employees. This requires the need of rapid technology from IT managers to update themselves to redesign work which make association between the objectives for IT strategy and business strategy. This result is consistent with Al Admour and Shunak (2009). Therefore,H4 is supported. Strategic alignment was found to have a signifi cant positive eff ect on sustainable competitive advantage (β = .316; CR = 4779; p = ***). This fi nding shows that the alignment in Jordanian fi rms has an eff ect on the fi rms' sustainable competitive advantage. Therefore, H9 is supported, This is to say the fi rms that pursue strategic alignment have greater ability to enhance their sustainable competitive advantage. Furthermore, the result of this study shows a direct positive eff ect of leadership on sustainable competitive advantage. However, (values and beliefs), structure and process, and service quality do not have any direct eff ect on sustainable competitive advantage. Therefore, H5 is supported but H6, H7, H8 are not supported as Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> above shows. Finally, the results show that strategic alignment mediates the relationship between service quality and values and beliefs. Therefore, H12, H13 are supported but there is no mediating eff ect on the relationship between leadership, (structure and process) and strategic alignment on sustainable competitive advantage. Therefore, H10, H11 are not supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In the business world, where fl exibility and adaptability are critical, failure to leverage IT may seriously hamper the fi rm's sustainable competitive advantage, especially in today's global, informationintensive world. Therefore, the need to obtain strategic alignment between business and IT strategies is paramount. The motivation for this study was to propose a theoretical model that determines the impact of several contextual variables (leadership, structure and processe service quality, and values and beliefs) on IT-business strategic alignment, and how such alignment impacts a fi rm's sustainable competitive advantage. The results of some hypotheses indicated an eff ect on strategic alignment while others had an insignifi cant eff ect on strategic alignment. In addition, strategic alignment has a mediating eff ect on the relationship between service quality, values and beliefs and sustainable competitive advantage. Therefore, fi rms in Jordan should have concern for strategic alignment to enhance their competitive position and sustain this advantage. This study will be useful for both academicians and practitioners.</p><p>From the academic perspective, this study aspires to fi ll the gap of the incomplete causal chains between IT investments and sustainable competitive advantage. In addition, this study utilizes <ref type="bibr">Chan et al.,'s (2006)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chan and Reich's (2007)</ref> recommendations, by further developing and validating a comprehensive model to assess strategic alignment mechanisms within an organization.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>displays the research model.</figDesc></figure>
