<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Self-medication is a prevalent practice among university students globally and is a signi cant public health concern.</p><p>However, previous research has been limited in scope, focusing primarily on speci c student groups or the general public, leaving a gap in understanding the causal relationships associated with self-medication; this study aims to investigate the factors in uencing self-medication practices among university students in Bangladesh by developing a comprehensive causal model. Data from 417 students across ve public universities were collected using the random walk technique by a team of 10 members. The study utilized constructs of knowledge, attitude, and convenience related to self-medication as independent variables, with self-medication practice as the dependent variable. One-way ANOVA and structural equation modeling were employed to develop a causal model of selfmedication practice among university students in Bangladesh. The ndings revealed that students with better medication knowledge and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were more likely to practice self-medication. A positive attitude towards self-medication and ADRs was also signi cantly associated with higher self-medication practice scores. Additionally, those who perceived self-medication as convenient and prescribed medication as inconvenient had higher self-medication practice scores. The attitude towards self-medication had the most substantial negative effect on self-medication practice, followed by the inconvenience of prescribed medication and the convenience of self-medication. The model explained 87% of the variance in self-medication practice, indicating a good t for the data. University students in Bangladesh possess intermediate knowledge of medication and primary knowledge of ADRs. They exhibit a positive attitude towards self-medication and ADRs. Physical convenience favors selfmedication, while the inconvenience of prescribed medication contributes to its lower preference. Policymakers should focus on evidence-based guidelines for self-medication and enhance the quantity and accessibility of prescribed medications to address the issue effectively.</p><p>Bangladesh aimed to address this problem by seeking legal action against the immoral selling of drugs(12). It was highlighted that as much as 80% of deaths caused by infections were linked to antimicrobial resistance(13).</p><p>Although recently the healthcare system of Bangladesh has expanded its coverage and infrastructure has also improved substantially still it is considered suffering a budget shortage as only 5.4% of the GDP is allocated for its national healthcare system. ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>). Consequently, there is a lack of accessible health insurance, both at the national and private levels (15). In addition, the prevalence of self-medication in the country is exacerbated by the presence of unethical drug sellers, inadequate regulatory measures, and the widespread availability of prescription drugs without the requirement of a prescription ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>). These factors collectively contribute to the high prevalence of selfmedication practices in Bangladesh.</p><p>University students, particularly in developing countries, are highly susceptible to self-medication due to in uential factors such as media and internet exposure promoting this behavior. Additionally, factors such as low perception of associated risks, easy access to the internet, increased pharmaceutical advertising without regulation, availability of drugs, level of education, and social status contribute to this trend <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref> 18). Previous studies have reported high prevalence rates of self-medication among university students, including rates of approximately 76% in Karachi, Pakistan (17), 87% in India ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>), 98% in Palestine ( <ref type="formula">20</ref>), and 43.2% in Ethiopia ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>).</p><p>Among university students, the prevalence of self-medication is notably high ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>). However, irresponsible selfmedication can lead to various negative consequences. It is crucial to identify the in uences on self-medication practices among university students, considering that they are generally knowledgeable about medication yet still susceptible to engaging in high levels of self-medication. Factors such as knowledge and literacy (23, 24), attitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref> 26), and the convenience of self-medication (27, 28) have a signi cant impact on self-medication practices. However, how these variables speci cally affect university students nationwide remains uncertain. Additionally, the inconvenience of prescribed medication (e.g., high cost, unavailability) in Bangladesh may also play a distinct role in self-medication practices among university students <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref> 16). Previous studies in Bangladesh have primarily focused on self-medication among medical or medical-related students <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref> or the general public (13, 31), lacking a comprehensive understanding of the causal relationships among self-medication practices and other factors.</p><p>Addressing this research gap, this study aims to investigate the factors (knowledge, attitudes, and convenience) in uencing self-medication practices among university students in Bangladesh by developing a causal model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Self-medication, de ned as the practice of diagnosing and treating one's own illnesses without seeking professional medical advice, is a common practice among university students worldwide and is considered a signi cant public health concern <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>. While self-medication is considered a convenient way to address common health issues, it poses signi cant health risks, such as adverse drug reactions, drug interactions, and treatment failure (4-6). Selfmedication can also lead to antibiotic resistance, a global health challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><p>The misuse and ineffective utilization of medications are signi cant issues worldwide, with approximately 68% of European countries and 42% of American nations reporting such problems <ref type="bibr">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr">8)</ref>. Both developed, and developing countries commonly engage in self-medication, although the prevalence is higher in developing nations <ref type="bibr">(5)</ref>. The occurrence of self-medication in developing countries exhibits a wide range, spanning from 12.7-95% <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. South Asian countries, in particular, demonstrate higher rates of self-medication. For instance, Nepal has a rate of 59%, Pakistan has 51%, and Bangladesh shows rates of 81.3% among the younger population and 78.5% among the elderly <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</p><p>If self-mediation is used responsibly, it can help conserve limited medical resources by addressing minor ailments, the burden on healthcare facilities, and reduce costs and time associated with seeking professional care for minor illnesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Due to that, WHO has pointed out that appropriate self-medication can be bene cial in treating acute ailments that do not require medical consultation. But it also has a ip side which can cause serious problems such as adverse drug reactions, treatment failure, antimicrobial resistance, etc. In Bangladesh, antimicrobial resistance is a signi cant issue, primarily attributed to unethical drug sales practices. A recent petition led in the High Court of This study includes both undergraduate and graduate students. The inclusion criteria are that the person needs to be 1: an enrolled student from one of the selected universities, 2: currently continuing their study, 3: Is willing to participate in the data collection process. Any student who is physically incapable of providing the required information is disregarded from this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaire development</head><p>Researchers used a structured ve-part questionnaire where each question was considered vital for the research. Questionnaires were rst translated into Bangla and then again transformed into English to maintain meaning and consistency. Researchers translated the questionnaire to ask the questions to the participants. As suggested by previous studies, the questionnaires were pre-tested within Khulna University with 30 students before nalizing them for data acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dependent variable</head><p>This study's dependent variable comprises three parts, each indicating critical aspects of self-medication practice. The rst part (Code: PR-1) includes a question about the problem for which the respondent takes self-medication. The problems are divided into three body sections: head, main body, and leg area, with 12 problems for each section which are more prevalent in developing nations <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. Respondents choose the problems for which they take selfmedication, and the researcher sums up all the reasons, giving a range of 0 to 36, with a higher number indicating a greater self-medication practice (supplementary table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</p><p>The second part (Code: PR-2) includes a self-medication practice scale comprising 8 questions with a 5-point Likert scale (supplementary table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). The questions are structured positively with no reverse questions. Researchers sum up the end result within a range of 8 to 40, with a higher score indicating a higher level of self-medication practice.</p><p>The third part (Code: PR-3) includes questions about the drugs used for self-medication, with 10 different medicine groups most frequently used worldwide (supplementary table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>). The researcher incorporated a 5-point Likert scale to measure the practice of consuming those medicines without a prescription. The nal score of this scale is also counted by summing up all the individual questions ranging from 10 to 50, with a higher score indicating a greater level of self-medication practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent variables</head><p>The study examines the holistic model of self-medication among varsity students by considering four independent variables: knowledge, attitude, convenience of self-medication, and inconvenience of prescribed medication. Each independent variable is assessed using multiple questions presented with a 5-point Likert scale. The internal consistency and reliability of each construct were measured and found to be within the recommended level.</p><p>Respondents' knowledge is divided into two dimensions: knowledge of medication and medicine groups and knowledge about adverse drug reactions (ADR). Similarly, attitude is divided into two parts: attitude towards selfmedication and attitude towards ADR. In Bangladesh, the convenience of self-medication is considered in two phases: convenience of self-medication and inconvenience of prescribed medication.</p><p>For the Analysis of Variance, the researcher categorizes each construct into three ordinal categories based on the total score of that construct. To obtain a holistic view, the structured equation model includes all elements of each dimension that have a factor loading score of &gt; 0.5. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> demonstrates the constructs of the independent variables. The study disregards demographic characteristics from the primary model due to their inconsistency with the research objectives.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection procedure</head><p>The data collection technique employed in this study was a random walk, which was the most suitable technique for clusters based on previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr">36)</ref>. A team of ten trained members carried out the survey. Before data collection, the group underwent a full-day training session covering the data collection procedure, ethics, and obtaining consent.</p><p>The nal sample consisted of 436 participants, and it was divided proportionately among ve selected universities based on their student populations. Upon approaching each university, the data collection team divided the campus into blocks and initiated data collection from the main entrance. They proceeded clockwise for one minute and approached the nearest respondent, who ful lled all the inclusion criteria. This process was repeated until the predetermined quota was achieved. In cases where a selected respondent declined to cooperate, the team labeled it a non-response and continued with the data collection process. The same technique was applied consistently throughout the entire data collection phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>During the data curation process, the interviewer reported a non-response rate of approximately 3%. Additionally, 8 respondents were disregarded due to missing or improper data, resulting in 417 data sets being considered for analysis. The data were stored, coded with appropriate weights, and categorized based on knowledge, attitude, convenience, and practice segments. Descriptive analysis was performed to present the data, followed by one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Least Signi cant Difference (LSD) to identify any mean differences among groups, showing which group used more self-medication.</p><p>Finally, a Structural Equation Model (SEM) was developed to assess the causal relationship between self-medication practice with knowledge, attitude, and convenience. This model was used to identify the holistic causal relationship to get a better and more decisive view of the factors behind self-medication. The internal consistency of the questions for each section was assessed using Composite reliability and Average variance extracted (AVE). The results for every scale used were within the recommended levels (Composite reliability &gt; 0.8 and AVE &gt; 0.50).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses</head><p>According to previous research, there is a signi cant association between knowledge, attitudes, and self-medication practices (6, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>. Some studies suggest that individuals with higher knowledge and positive attitudes towards self-medication are more likely to practice it <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr">38)</ref>, while others argue that these factors may act alternatively <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>. Nonetheless, there is a strong interconnection among these factors. Moreover, the convenience of self-medication and the inconvenience of using prescribed medication are among the main reasons for its widespread practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr">16</ref>). However, the relationship between these factors may vary among individuals, and their nature cannot be predicted with certainty.</p><p>Therefore, this study proposes six different hypotheses:</p><p>H1: Students with higher knowledge of self-medication are more likely to practice it compared to those with less knowledge.</p><p>H2: Students with higher knowledge of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) are more likely to practice selfmedication compared to those with less knowledge.</p><p>H3: Students with a positive attitude towards self-medication are more likely to practice it than their counterparts.</p><p>H4: Students with a positive attitude towards Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) are more likely to practice it than their counterparts.</p><p>H5: Students who nd self-medication more convenient are more likely to practice self-medication than others.</p><p>H6: Students who nd prescribed medication more inconvenient are more likely to practice self-medication than others</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> presents the demographic characteristics of the respondents. Most participants are male, accounting for 64% of the sample. No signi cant differences were observed between males and females regarding self-medication in any dimension.</p><p>The CGPA of the respondents exhibited a signi cant difference in the real-life practice of self-medication. Individuals with a low CGPA had a higher mean score for self-medication (mean RP: 23.45; P = 0.003). However, there were no differences in drug usage or disease treatment associated with self-medication among different CGPA groups. The year of study did not have any effect on the self-medication practices of the students. Regardless of their academic year, all students demonstrated similar patterns of self-medication.</p><p>The study area was found to have a signi cant effect on self-medication practices. Surprisingly, students studying pure science or applied science reported signi cantly higher self-medication levels than other groups. They treated more diseases with self-medication, used a greater variety of drugs, and had higher overall self-medication scores. Science students are assumed to have more knowledge about medication and its potential adverse effects, yet they still engage in self-medication. The convenience of self-medication over prescribed medication may play a signi cant role in this regard. Economic dependence did not signi cantly affect self-medication practices among the respondents. Knowledge about different medicine groups: Individuals with higher knowledge about other medicine groups (mean DT: 19.71) treat more diseases with self-medication. Their mean score is signi cantly higher than the secondhighest group, indicating the impact of knowledge on self-medication effectiveness.</p><p>Individuals with a positive attitude towards self-medication practice it more frequently (mean RP: 26.39), diagnose more diseases (mean DT: 18.39), and take different medicine (mean DU: 32.51). Those with a negative attitude or uncertainty about self-medication show no signi cant differences in practice scales. Individuals with a negative attitude towards adverse drug reactions have lower scores in all practice scales (mean DT: 13.01, mean DU: 24.86, mean RP: 16.69). Those with a positive attitude practice more self-medication and take a greater variety of medicines.</p><p>Respondents who nd self-medication highly convenient or prescribed medication highly inconvenient practice selfmedication more frequently. Physical convenience or inconvenience plays a signi cant role in shaping the practice of self-medication. Those who nd prescribed medication slightly inconvenient (mean DT: 13.61, mean RP: 18.26, mean DU: 22.28) score signi cantly lower in all self-medication practice scales. The physical inconvenience of prescribed medication plays a more signi cant role in pushing people towards self-medication than the convenience of self-medication. Challenges associated with obtaining prescribed medication contribute to the prevalence of selfmedication in Bangladesh.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement model (Model t indices)</head><p>Con rmatory factor analysis (CFA) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Composite reliability (CR) and Average Variance (AVE) test</head><p>In this case, the composite reliability scores ranged from 0.838 to 0.932, which is well above the benchmark of 0.70, indicating that the items used to measure the constructs have high reliability. In this study, the AVE values for all the constructs were above 0.50, indicating that the items used to measure each construct are strongly related to that construct (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural equation model (SEM)</head><p>The researcher initially developed a hypothesized structural model to investigate self-medication practice. However, upon evaluating the modi cation indices and parameter estimates, some paths in the model were identi ed as nonsigni cant. As a result, the researcher removed those non-signi cant paths and added several covariance paths, as suggested by the modi cation indices. The nal model showed a better t compared to the hypothesized model.</p><p>In the paper, six hypotheses were presented regarding self-medication practice, all supported by the presented Structural Equation Model (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). To assess the model's t, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> is presented, which displays the model's t and estimates for the constructs. The table shows that the model is acceptable and is a good t for the data, as indicated by the following t indices: CMIN/df = 4.728, CFI = 0.923, GFI = 0.916, RMSEA = 0.070, and SRMR = 0.0511. These ndings suggest that the model is reliable and valid for investigating self-medication practices. The nal measurement model found that attitude towards self-medication had the highest signi cant effect (β= -0.340; t= -6.066) on self-medication practice, indicating a negative correlation. Those with a negative attitude towards self-medication were found to practice self-medication less. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref> further demonstrated that attitude towards self-medication had the highest standardized direct (β = -0.340; p = &lt; 0.001) and indirect effect (β = -0.140; p = 0.005) on self-medication practice, suggesting that individuals who view self-medication as unacceptable tend to practice it less compared to others. Similarly, a negative attitude towards adverse drug reactions (β= -0.235; t= -5.041) was found to have a signi cant negative effect on self-medication practice. The physical inconvenience of prescribed medication had the second highest effect (β = 0.252; t = 6.529) on self-medication practice, indicating that those who nd the prescribed medication process inconvenient in Bangladesh tend to practice self-medication more. Physical convenience of self-medication had the third largest effect (β = 0. .235; t = 6.529) on self-medication, indicating that the convenience of self-medication is one of the main factors behind the high prevalence of selfmedication in Bangladesh. Furthermore, knowledge about medication (β = 0.160; t = 3.610) and adverse drug reactions (β = 0.176; t = 4.773) had signi cant positive effects on self-medication practice, which was surprising as it was expected that individuals with greater knowledge about medication and its adverse effects would be less likely to self-medicate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The study's ndings indicate a moderate to a high level of self-medication practice among university students in Bangladesh, consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41)</ref>. Several factors contribute to this practice, including limited access to healthcare services, cost-effectiveness, cultural beliefs, and the convenience of purchasing medications without a prescription from pharmacies and drug stores <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>.</p><p>The researcher focused on two types of knowledge among university students in Bangladesh: knowledge about medication and knowledge about adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Knowledge about medication was assessed based on medication doses, content, and related aspects, as well as knowledge of different medicine groups. The ndings revealed that most students possessed intermediate knowledge about medication, with a relatively higher level of knowledge about medicine groups, consistent with previous studies conducted in different cities <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. This observation could be attributed to the country's heavy marketing efforts of pharmaceutical companies. Surprisingly, most students exhibited only basic knowledge of ADRs. Previous research indicated that students often hold misconceptions, believing that non-severe illnesses cannot lead to serious consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>. This knowledge gap regarding the risks associated with self-medication might be one of the reasons for the high prevalence of selfmedication among university students in Bangladesh. The limited awareness about ADRs among students could be attributed to the insu cient emphasis on pharmacovigilance in the country.</p><p>The structural equation model (SEM) presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> reveals a positive causal relationship between knowledge about self-medication and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and the practice of self-medication. Previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref><ref type="bibr">(46)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref> supports this by indicating that individuals who engage in self-medication within the last 12 months tend to have a higher level of knowledge about self-medication. Furthermore, the SEM suggests that knowledge about medication indirectly affects self-medication by in uencing knowledge about ADRs. Thus, those with greater knowledge about self-medication are likely to possess more knowledge about ADRs and higher self-medication practice. The belief that self-medication is an effective and convenient way to manage minor health problems, coupled with university students' con dence in their medication knowledge (48), may play a role. Additionally, in Bangladesh, the easy availability of over-the-counter medicine and the convenience of storing it (48, 49) make selfmedication a preferred choice. Conversely, obtaining prescribed medication is more di cult and inconvenient (48), as observed in this study. Consequently, knowledgeable individuals may opt for the convenient, easily accessible, and quick relief self-medication provides.</p><p>Contrasting ndings were presented by a study conducted in Portugal <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref> found no positive connection between knowledge and the practice of self-medication. Similarly, a study in Nepal (51) revealed that individuals with higher knowledge about medication safety were less likely to engage in self-medication. Additionally, a study in Nigeria <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref> showed a negative correlation between knowledge about ADRs and self-medication practices among university students. These ndings highlight the complex nature of the relationship between knowledge and self-medication, suggesting that various factors in uence it. While university students in Bangladesh continue to engage in selfmedication despite understanding the associated risks, others may avoid it due to their awareness of potential consequences. The results of this study indicate that most university students in the country have a positive attitude towards self-medication and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Previous studies on general university and medical students have also shown that most of them hold a positive attitude toward self-medication <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52)</ref>. However, some studies suggest that students generally have a negative attitude toward self-medication <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53)</ref> and are cautious about recommending self-medication to friends and family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>. These studies further suggest that students may develop this mindset due to increased awareness about medications and ADRs during their time in university <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref>.</p><p>Moonajilin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> found that, on average, only 26.3% of Bangladeshi people seek healthcare facilities for treatment, indicating a signi cant shortage in healthcare infrastructure. This shortage could be a prominent reason for the positive attitude towards self-medication and ADRs. Additionally, cultural and traditional beliefs have been identi ed as in uential factors in shaping attitudes towards self-medication <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55)</ref>, and the cultural and traditional beliefs in Bangladesh may have played a signi cant role in this context. Moreover, the present study has shown that students have limited knowledge about ADRs and their potential risks, which could contribute to these unique ndings. This study reinforces the consistent nding from previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50)</ref> that individuals with a positive attitude towards self-medication and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) tend to engage in self-medication more frequently. In contrast, those with a negative attitude are less inclined to do so. Among university students, except for some instances presented by James <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, a positive attitude towards self-medication is a common factor (48, 56). The SEM (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) used in this study also con rms that a positive attitude towards self-medication has the strongest in uence on the actual practice (β= -0.34; p-value &lt; 0.001) encouraging the use of various medicine groups, treating different diseases through self-medication, and increasing the frequency of self-medication.</p><p>Furthermore, the study reveals that the attitude toward self-medication indirectly impacts the practice by in uencing the attitude toward adverse drug reactions (ADRs). This suggests that individuals who perceive self-medication as acceptable also subconsciously acknowledge the potential negative consequences, despite recognizing its effectiveness. It can be attributed to self-medication as a convenient and cost-effective option to get quick relief from minor health issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50)</ref>. Additionally, from a psychological perspective, one can argue that university students, being mature and knowledgeable individuals, possess optimism while accepting the reality of selfmedication. This acknowledgment demonstrates their understanding that their choices can have both positive and negative outcomes, and they are willing to accept the responsibility that comes with it. This study highlights the widespread perception among students that self-medication is highly convenient. They report that buying and storing medicine in Bangladesh is easy, consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr">58)</ref> conducted in Bangladesh and other countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr">60)</ref>. Those over-the-counter (OTC) medications are commonly used for self-medication.</p><p>Students also emphasize that self-medication saves time and offers quick relief, which has consistently emerged as primary motivation for self-medication in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr">61,</ref><ref type="bibr">62)</ref>. Additionally, the convenience of selfmedication in Bangladesh is attributed to the knowledge gained from previous prescriptions and the online availability of medical information. These factors have also been reported as key drivers of self-medication (48, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57)</ref>.</p><p>The structural equation model (SEM) shows a signi cant positive causal relationship between the convenience of self-medication (β = 0.23; p-value &lt; .001) and its practice. As the convenience of self-medication increases, so does its prevalence. This nding is consistent with earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> highlighting the positive in uence of easy access to self-medication on its practice.</p><p>One possible explanation for the convenience of self-medication is the proliferation of health-related resources on the internet. This enables individuals to independently research symptoms, diagnoses, and potential treatments, leading to a sense of autonomy and con dence in making health decisions without consulting a healthcare professional. Additionally, easy access to medical information allows students to become more knowledgeable about common ailments, symptoms, and treatments, thereby reinforcing the practice of self-medication <ref type="bibr">(48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57)</ref>.</p><p>This study highlights the signi cant inconvenience half of the students face when accessing prescribed medicine in Bangladesh, shedding light on the challenges associated with healthcare services in the country. The reasons identi ed by the study, including distance to government healthcare centers, unavailability of pharmacies, high cost of private medical care, and inadequate health call centers, are all signi cant barriers to accessing healthcare services. Previous studies conducted in Bangladesh (57, 58) have also reported di culties obtaining advice from healthcare professionals, further exacerbating the problem. This situation can be directly attributed to the low healthcare budget in Bangladesh, which is one of the lowest in South Asia, accounting for only 5.4% of the total GDP <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. The study reveals a positive causal relationship between the physical inconvenience of obtaining prescribed medication and the practice of self-medication, as indicated by the structural equation model (SEM) analysis (β = 0.25; p-value &lt; .001). Consequently, the practice of self-medication among university students increases with the growing inconvenience of accessing prescribed medication. These ndings align with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55)</ref> that has identi ed di culties in obtaining proper treatment as a signi cant contributing factor to the practice of self-medication. Earlier, this study stated that students with a higher level of medication knowledge resort to selfmedication may be due to the signi cant inconvenience associated with obtaining prescribed medication. This inconvenience can also be attributed to the accepting attitude of students towards the potential negative consequences that may arise due to self-medication. Students in Bangladesh may prefer to avoid the hassle of seeking health professionals' suggestions, which contributes to this phenomenon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Policy Recommendations</head><p>Despite existing regulations and healthcare facilities, effective and evidence-based guidelines are needed to improve self-medication practices. While self-medication can be bene cial if appropriately directed, but speci c actions are needed.</p><p>To strengthen prescribed medication practices, standardized guidelines should be developed, covering dosage recommendations, regimen instructions, and considerations for potential adverse effects. Healthcare providers should undergo continuous education on evidence-based medicine and patient safety, with mechanisms in place to monitor and evaluate adherence to guidelines.</p><p>Enhancing the quantity and accessibility of prescribed medication requires collaboration between governments, healthcare providers, and pharmaceutical companies. Measures include ensuring an adequate supply of medications, reducing costs through bulk purchasing agreements and promoting generics, and improving accessibility through pharmacy networks, home delivery, and telemedicine.</p><p>Improving government medical services entails increased funding for infrastructure, equipment, and staff capacity. Reducing waiting times and implementing electronic health record systems can enhance patient satisfaction and care coordination.</p><p>Educating the public is vital. Public awareness campaigns should highlight self-medication risks, while collaboration with educational institutions and healthcare providers can deliver targeted programs on proper medication usage. Leveraging communication channels is essential to disseminate accurate information and discourage self-medication.</p><p>Strengthening regulation and enforcement involves monitoring and controlling the availability and sales of overthe-counter medications, deterring unauthorized prescription sales, and raising awareness of legal and health consequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, university students in Bangladesh possess intermediate medication knowledge and primary knowledge of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). They exhibit a positive attitude towards both self-medication and ADRs. Physical convenience favors self-medication, while the inconvenience of prescribed medication contributes to its lower preference. Students with advanced medication knowledge and positive attitudes toward self-medication are more likely to engage in it. This research is crucial for self-medicating students and policymakers seeking to improve control measures. Further research should explore age-speci c factors such as individual beliefs, cultural in uences, and socio-economic factors that drive self-medication preferences.</p></div>
