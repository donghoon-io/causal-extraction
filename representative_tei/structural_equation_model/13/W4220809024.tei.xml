<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Communication as one of the most commonly used activities of humans in the era of technology 4.0, either directly or indirectly. The era of technology 4.0 is widely used by companies as a market to develop business models whose competition is increasingly complex. One of them is in the form of an application. The main thing that is favored from an application to attract the attention of users (users) is contained in the display (user interface). User interface as a page of information that can represent a particular agency to offer a product or feature that can be used by users precisely and quickly. Not only intended to meet the needs of users, this user interface is also needed to meet the user's wishes in terms of comfortable appearance and informative content. If the user's wishes can be conveyed properly, then the user will be more interested in the user interface than the user interface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. LITERATURE REVIEW</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. User Interface</head><p>User Interface or user interface uses a form of graphical display that relates directly to the user. An interface is a place where an interaction occurs between the system and the user as its optimizer and effective operating control and feedback from the system that helps the operator make operational decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. User Experience</head><p>User experience or commonly called user experience is a process of increasing user satisfaction in improving the usability of applications and the interaction provided between users and products. The User Experience itself is a design display that collaborates with various functional flows, finding the sweet spot between user needs, business goals, and technological advances, then generating magical experiences through meaningful, useful, and fun product design. UX aims to make a website or application easier to use and less confusing when used by users (Allend &amp;chudley, 2012). As for the 5 elements that follow usre experience Surface, Skeleton, Structure, Scope and Strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Satisfaction Customer</head><p>The company needs to measure customer satisfaction in order to see the feedback and input that can be taken by the company for the purposes of developing and implementing Kotler's customer satisfaction improvement strategy (1999: 54) Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).</p><p>According to Bollen (2011) as quoted by Latan (2013: 5), "Sem are sets of equations that encapsulate the relationships among the latent variables, observed variables,and error variables". SEM can be used to answer various research problems (research questions) in a set of systematic and comprehensive analysis. According to Bollen (2011) as quoted by Latan (2013: 5), "Sem are sets of equations that encapsulate the relationships among the latent variables, observed variables and error variables". SEM can be used to answer various research problems (research questions) in a setof systematic and comprehensive analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. SmartPls</head><p>SmartPLS uses the Bootstrapping method or random doubling. Therefore, the assumption of normality will not be a problem. In addition, by doing bootstrapping, SmartPLS does not require a minimum number of samples, so it can be applied to research with a small sample number.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. METHODS RESEARH</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Reserch Stage</head><p>The stages in this study consist of several stages, such as the stages of determining problems, stages of determining variables, determining the sample, stages of determining samples, stages of making questionnaires, stages of spreading questionnaires, stages of validity tests and rehabilitation tests, stages of processing data, stages of results and recommendation stages. Research stagebelow image:</p><p>The image above is a research stage to test customer satisfaction on the Shoppe app based on how it looks. At the time of determining variables to determine the variables used to test customer satisfaction against the appearance of the mobile-based Shopee application with the dimensions used namely Skeleton, Surface, Scope and Structure. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Model Study</head><p>The research model features some customer satisfaction that can be affected by the appearance of the app. Some that affect the appearance of a product consists of several dimensions, namely surface, skeleton, structure, and scope. (Gareth,2015). Gambar 2 Model User Experince. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>: Dimension Model Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> On the surface dimension is related to the design of sensory design which includes the human five senses in terms of color, typeface and image on a display. The details of the surface dimension model in this study are described in the image below.</p><p>In this skeleton dimension consists of interface design, navigation design and information design. In this dimension it is necessary to design an interface design that includes the components of the interface design on the display. The details of this surface dimension model are described in the image below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 4: Dimension Surface</head><p>In the structure dimensions are explained as product components in order to understand the user in accordance with the product to be developed. The details of this dimensional model are described in the image below. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Analysist Technique</head><p>The data collection technique carried out in this study is to use questionnaires. Questionnaire is a data collection technique that is done by providing a set of questions or written statements to respondents to answer. Questionnaires are distributed through an online platform and spread manually. In the study using respondents taken randomly (randomly) as many as 48,964 users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Populationand Sample</head><p>In this research, all users of the mobile-based Shopee application located in kranji village amounted to 48,964 people with the number of women 25,007 and the number of men 23,957 people, out of a total of 12,330 family cards.. The result of this population is the population size (N) in the slovin formula. The specified tolerance degree of 0.1% is obtained based on accuracy of 90% reduced by 100%. The results of the calculation of the formula above amounted to 99.79 and then rounded to a minimum of 99 people who will be used as samples for research, so that in this study the sample will be used as many as 99 people in kranji. To serve his sample with a known population of 48,964 with a precision of 0.01%.</p><p>The number of samples needed amounted to 99 respondents from Kranji Village, West Bekasi District of Bekasi City.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RESULTANDIMPLEMENTATION</head><p>The samples used in the study were randomized from various segments. Questionnaires that have been filled out as many as 99 respondents. Questionnaires are distributed online. This questionnaire uses Google Form. In this section, the description of the respondent is explained..</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Uji Validitas and Reabilitas</head><p>The results of the questionnaire are entered into the validity and reliability test using Smart PLs3. Indicators on the group questionnaire into variable diagrams based on the output of variables A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3, D1, D2, E1, E2, E3, F1, F2, F3, G1, G2, G3, H1, I1, I2, J1, J2, K1, K2, K3, and L1 that have relationships with other variables. Like a picture give met: Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>: Result Smart Pls 3.0 . At this stage tested the reliability of each variable and the validity of each indicator against variables, with a significant level of 7% and a total data of 99 respondents, then obtained a limit of R moment of 0.78. If the validity value is below 0.78 then the indicator is declared invalid. The value of rehabilitation is obtained by looking at the value. If getting a value of less than 0.700 means that the value is bad, about 0.700 is accepted and more than 0.800 is good.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Cronbach's Alpha</head><p>Cronbach's alpha stage, it is to measure the reality value of a questionnaire that will be declared reliable or consistent from Smartpls.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>The result of the connection between the Skeleton dimensions to there are 12 relationships. The Skelton dimension consists of variable layouts, categoryal and functions, while structure dimensions consist of navigation variables, error handling and hierarchy. From the results of the analysis it is known that all of them are interconnected and unidirectional. Where if one dimension increases then the other dimension will increase as well.</p><p>Based on the value obtained from the questionnaire, after being calculated using SmartPls software there has been no negativ result against variable action at the layer to variable layout, also on the ratio of letters to function variables. From these results get added value to build other variables to increase customer satisfaction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1</figDesc><graphic coords="2,50.50,190.20,211.80,105.30" type="bitmap" /></figure>
