<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>With the rapid development of China's economy and the acceleration of urbanization, the barriers of population ow between urban and rural areas are broken, and more and more rural people are moving to cities <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> . According to the latest data released by China's National Bureau of Statistics in 2019, the total number of migrant workers in China has reached nearly 300 million, of which 170-million people are from other places, accounting for more than half of the total <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> . However, due to the establishment of the Dual Hukou System in China, some migrant workers are restricted by many factors such as household registration, economy and urban school entrance requirements, and have to leave their minor children in rural homes, thus forming a special group of children: left-behind children <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> .</p><p>Left-behind children refer to children aged 6 to 16 who are in the stage of compulsory education and are left to be cared for or live alone in the place of their domicile after their parents go out to work <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> .</p><p>According to the latest data released by the Ministry of Education in 2018, the number of left-behind children in rural China has exceeded 15 million <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> . 91.3% have suffered different levels of mental, physical, sexual or neglect violence from their families or schools <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> . As a result, left-behind children have higher levels of anxiety, depression, suicidal tendencies and aggressive behavior in terms of mental health compared with children from normal families <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> , and they are more prone to violent crimes and aggressive behavior in terms of problem behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> . Meanwhile, adolescence is an important stage in the development of individual personality, sociality and values, during which rebellious and aggressive behaviors are particularly prominent <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> . Under the same frustration situation, the probability of aggressive behaviors among left-behind junior high school students is signi cantly higher than that of non-left-behind ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> .</p><p>In addition to the social harmfulness, aggressive behavior may also have a negative impact on the physical and mental development of individuals. Research shows that teens with high aggressiveness are more likely to have psychological problems, self-harm, suicide and commit violent crimes as adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> . However, the systematic research and intervention measures concerning the aggressive behavior of the left-behind junior high school students are quite de cient at present. Most studies only analyzed the effect of a single factor, and could not judge the direct and indirect effects among the factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> .</p><p>Therefore, this study adopts the structural equation model to analyze the interrelationship and action modes of various factors affecting the aggressive behavior of the left-behind junior high school students to provide scienti c basis for the mitigation and prevention of the aggressive behavior of left-behind junior high school students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stress-coping Model Of Left-behind Junior High School Students</head><p>Left-behind junior high school students are more vulnerable to psychological stress, negative coping and aggressive behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> . The most widely used theoretical model to guide these studies is the cognitive-phenomenological-transactional theoretical (CPT) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> . This model is derived from Lazarus and Folkman's stress and coping theory and emphasizes the absolute role of cognitive evaluation in the process of stress and coping <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> , which is consistent with the "frustration-aggression" theory proposed by Miller, and regarded as the rst classical theory to study human aggressive behavior. Based on "frustration-aggression" theory, aggressive behavior is one kind of behavioral response to human frustration under a certain situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> . This process is consistent with the three continuous variables in the implementation of the CPT theoretical model: stressors, environmental information, and individual-environmental effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> .</p><p>The initial stressors are various life events faced by children <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> , among which have a signi cant impact on left-behind junior high school students, like interpersonal relationship, learning pressure, punishment, loss and health adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> . Intermediate stage, namely environmental information, refers to the evaluation method of the relationship between the individual and the environment, including the primary evaluation, secondary evaluation and reevaluation of individuals on the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> . This stage determines the occurrence and form of stress, which re ects the role of individual cognition and its in uencing factors in the process of stress coping. The nal effect may be negative or positive <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> . However, due to the lack of family support including timely care and help from their parents, left-behind children are more inclined to adopt negative coping methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> , such as aggressive behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> .</p><p>Therefore, in the stress response model, it is essential to investigate the major life events confronted by the left-behind junior high school students and to explore the key factors that may have an impact on the cognition and evaluation of the left-behind junior high school students, which is very important to reduce and prevent the aggressive behavior of the left-behind junior high school students.</p><p>Self-esteem, resilience and coping style as mediators in the stress-coping model Although many scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> have analyzed and studied the aggressive behavior of left-behind junior high school students under the guidance of the "frustration-aggression" theory and the stress process models, most studies did not consider the impact of life events or only used factor analysis and correlation analysis to determine the direct or indirect effects of the factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> . Studies have found that adolescent's aggressive behavior is signi cantly correlated to academic, interpersonal, environmental, self-conscious and other life events <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> .</p><p>Apart from life events, a large number of theories and studies have concluded that cognition and evaluation of frustration are more important in frustration responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> , and are mainly re ected in the three aspects of mood, self-esteem and personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> . Berkowitz mentioned that frustration can awaken the individual emotions in his revision of "frustration-aggression theory" <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> , and different individuals may have positive or negative emotional reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> . Speci cally speaking, positive emotions are more likely to produce positive responses such as humor and sublimation, while negative emotions are more likely to lead to negative responses such as indifference and avoidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> . Furthermore, the positive response of middle school students was signi cantly negatively correlated with aggressive behavior, while the negative response was signi cantly positively correlated with aggressive behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> . In the same setbacks, high-esteem teens were more likely to experience proactive aggression and low-esteem teens were more likely to produce reactive aggression <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> . Resilience refers to the dynamic process in which an individual can still adapt well in a dangerous environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> , which is signi cantly positively correlated with the individual's positive personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> . Junior high school students with high levels of resilience are more likely to control and stabilize their emotions after a setback, thus reducing the possibility of the occurrence of aggressive behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> . Therefore, although it has not been studied in the comprehensive model, self-esteem, resilience and coping style probably important intermediary factors for the life events and aggressive behavior choices of left-behind junior high school students.</p><p>Relationship among self-esteem, resilience and coping style and their different effects Some retrospective studies on self-esteem, resilience and coping style of left-behind junior high school students can be found that there is some correlation among them. Studies have shown that individuals with high levels of resilience and self-esteem are more likely to perceive positive external stimuli and choose to respond positively <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> , while there is also a signi cant positive correlation between selfesteem and resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> . Therefore, we can assume the relationship among self-esteem, resilience and coping style in the same frustration situation, that is: self-esteem and resilience are positively correlated with positive coping, and are negatively correlated with negative coping, self-esteem have positive associations with resilience, and negative coping negatively the positive coping.</p><p>Besides, whether self-esteem, resilience, coping styles and aggressive behavior have different associations with adaptation outcomes also warrants attention, as this may be helpful to formulate more targeted intervention strategies. Only one study <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> has examined both resilience and coping styles in analyzing adolescent aggressive behavior, in which it found that both resilience and coping style can negatively predict the adolescent's aggressive behavior, and the coping style can also in uence the adolescent's aggressive behavior through the mediating effect of resilience. What's more, Wang's study <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> has examined both self-esteem and coping styles in analyzing adolescent aggressive behavior, it found that self-esteem and coping styles could predict adolescent aggressive behavior, and that coping styles did not as mediators between self-esteem and aggressive behavior. However, there is no research to con rm whether self-esteem has an intermediary effect between coping styles and aggressive behaviors, and whether self-esteem, resilience, negative coping and positive coping have mediating effects in the process of life events stimulating aggressive behaviors. Therefore, although self-esteem, resilience and coping style can predict the aggressive behavior of adolescents, their speci c effects and modes of action need to be further explored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Aim Of The Present Study</head><p>Based on our literature review, there is a lack of comprehensive comparison and analysis on the direct and indirect in uencing factors of left-behind junior high school students' aggressive behavior at present.</p><p>The comprehensive analysis of the interaction of the in uencing factors is very important for the development and formulation of targeted or corresponding programs to reduce the aggressive behavior of left-behind junior high school students and promote their physical and mental health. Therefore, taking important background variables into account within the stress-coping model, we selected left-behind junior high school student's life events as stressors, self-esteem, resilience and coping style as intermediary variables, aggressive behavior as outcome to formulate a hypothetical model A(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), to facilitate testing and clari cation of the following hypotheses: H1: General information, life events, self-esteem, psychological exibility and coping style may have different effects on the aggressive behavior of left-behind junior high school students. H2: self-esteem, resilience and coping style may be mediators between left-behind junior high school student's life events and aggressive behavior.</p><p>H3: resilience may be mediators between positive coping and aggressive behavior(3a), resilience, positive coping may be mediators between negative coping and aggressive behavior(3b), positive coping, negative coping may be mediators between self-esteem and resilience (3c), positive coping may be mediators between negative coping and resilience(3d).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and sample</head><p>This was a multi-stage strati ed cluster sampling study. Firstly, according to the geographical location, economic conditions and left-behind students, in Hunan Province to select a representative of 4 townships as a survey township, and then in each township to choose a secondary school, in each secondary school of the rst to the third grade were randomly selected two classes in the investigation. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) aged between 6 and 16 years and (2) the parents of participant have been away for more than half a year and (3) willing to participate in the study. Exclude the adolescents with cognitive impairment. Data were collected between April 13 and 17, 2020.</p><p>Typically, a median sample size of 200 is recommended for SEM analysis. An a priori sample size calculator for SEM was applied which is popular and publicly designed for calculating SEM sample sizes (<ref type="url" target="https://www.danielsoper.com/statcalc/calculator.aspx?id=89">https://www.danielsoper.com/statcalc/calculator.aspx?id=89</ref>). The minimum sample size with a moderate effect (0.3), at a power value of 0.95, including three latent and 24 observed variables (all observed indicators and socio-demographic variables), and with an α of .05 was calculated as 700. Hence, we chose a minimum sample size of700.</p><p>Questionnaires were distributed (n = 789), and 751 usable responses were obtained, corresponding to a return rate of 95.18%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Socio-demographic characteristics</head><p>Several socio-demographic characteristics such as gender, age, grade, whether the only child, household income, parents go out, the attitude of parents to go out to work and other general conditions of leftbehind junior high school students were included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adolescent Self-rating Life Events Checklist (ASLEC)</head><p>The Adolescent Self-rating Life Events Checklist(ASLEC) developed by Liu <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> which was applied to measure the frequency and intensity of negative life-events in left-behind junior high school student's life. This scale includes 27 items, including 5 factors: punishment, loss, interpersonal pressure, learning pressure and adaptation. The scale adopted the 6-point Likert scale from 1 (not at all)to 6 (very much).</p><p>The higher the score, the more negative events they faced. The scale reportedly has good reliability and validity with Cronbach's α was 0.95, Split-Half Reliability was 0.88, and Test-Retest Reliability was 0.69. In this study, the Cronbach's α of the scale was 0.91.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (RSES)</head><p>The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) was designed by Rosenberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and translated by Ji and Yu <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> , which is a more extensive assessment of self-esteem, with high authority. This scale includes 10 items, which are set on a 4-point Likert scale from 1(strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Overall self-esteem factor can be calculated with the sum score ranging from 10 to 40. A higher score indicates higher selfesteem. Cronbach's α was0.78 for the Chinese version and 0.80 for this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resilience Scale For Chinese Adolescents</head><p>The Resilience Scale for Chinese Adolescents was developed by Hu and Gan <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> was applied to measure the resilience of left-behind junior high school students. This scale includes 27 items, including 5 factors: target focus, emotional control, positive cognition, family support and interpersonal assistance. It is a 5point scale (1-5, representing from 'never' to 'always'), higher scores re ecting greater resilience.</p><p>Cronbach's α was 0.85 for the Chinese version and 0.82 for this study.</p><p>Coping Style Questionnaire (CSQ)</p><p>The coping style <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> was measured by the 20-item Simpli ed Coping Style Questionnaire (CSQ) which was developed by Xie. Responses for each question range from 0 to 3 (0 = never do, 1 = seldom do, 2 = often do, 3 = always do). This scale includes two sub-scales to assess positive coping (item 1 to 12) and negative coping (item 13 to 20). The higher score of each dimension indicated frequent usage of this type of coping. The internal consistency measured by Cronbach's α was found to be 0.90, 0.89 and 0.78 for subscale and the whole scale respectively. In this study, the Cronbach's α of the scale was 0.80.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Buss-warren Aggression Questionnaire (BWAQ)</head><p>The Buss-Warren Aggression Questionnaire (BWAQ) was designed by Buss <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and translated by Huang [46]   . The scale is a self-assessment questionnaire with 34 items, including subscales that measure aggression in ve areas: Physical aggression, Anger, Verbal aggression, Indirect aggression, Hostility. The scale adopted the 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree)to 5 (strongly agree). The higher the score, the more aggressive they were. The Cronbach's α of the total scale was 0.86, and the Cronbach's α of each subscale ranged from 0.51 to 0.75. In this study, the Cronbach's α was 0.920.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical Considerations</head><p>The study was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board in the researchers' university (Ethical Grant Number: E201946). Prior to the survey, the researchers informed subjects of the purpose, method, and considerations of the study and they could quit at any time during the lling process. Researchers issued the anonymous questionnaire to all eligible left-behind junior high school students after acquiring written informed consent. A quiet and private meeting room was provided for participants to complete the questionnaire. Questionnaires were retrieved immediately, and only the researchers had access to the data. The cover page of the questionnaire contained contact information of psychological consultation, should they need to.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Statistical analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics version20.0 and AMOS 20.0(IBM, Chicago, Illinois). Descriptive data were presented as means and standard deviations. Pearson's correlation analyses were used for correlations between two variables. Analyses of variance and independent sample t-tests were used to analyze the signi cance of socio-demographic differences among variable scores in the model. This helped to identify socio-demographic characteristics for inclusion as covariates in the model. The hypothesized model comprised 3 latent variables and 24 observed variables( gure 2).</p><p>To verify the SEM, the incremental t index (IFI), comparative t index (CFI), gamma goodness-of-t index (GFI), normed t index (NFI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) were used as model t indicators. Values of CFI, IFI, NFI, and GFI &gt; 0.90 are considered to re ect a good model t. RMSEA values &lt; 0.05 suggest good t, while values up to 0.08 indicate reasonable errors of approximation, indicating an acceptable t. The parsimony of the hypothetical model was improved by dismissal of standardized path coe cients with small effects (absolute values &lt; 0.10).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis about general data of left-behind junior high school students</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows there was a signi cant difference among aggressive behavior of junior high school students with different ages. Regarding to aggressive behavior, they have signi cantly differenced on gender. The different household income has tremendous in uences on the left-behind junior high school students. The difference of life events of left-behind junior high school students whose fathers go out to work is signi cant. And the attitude of left-behind junior high school students to their parents migrant work is different, their resilience and aggressive behavior also have signi cant differences. The relationship between aggressive behavior and its in uencing factors of left-behind junior high school students</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> shows the relationship among resilience, life events, self-esteem, coping styles and aggressive behaviors of left-behind junior high school students. Resilience of left-behind junior high school students is negatively correlated with life events, negative coping, aggressive behaviors, but positively correlated with self-esteem, positive coping. Life events have negative associations with self-esteem, have positive associations with negative coping and aggressive behaviors, have no associations with positive coping. Self-esteem can positively predict the positive coping, negatively predict the negative coping and aggressive behavior. Positive coping positively affects the negative coping, but cannot affect the aggressive behavior. Negative coping is positively correlated with aggressive behavior. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Equation Modeling</head><p>The structural equation model was initially tested, and after removing pathways with vary small effects (absolute values &lt; 0.10), a modi ed model with good model t was obtained (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The parameters of the model were as follows: χ2 = 687.50, DF = 150, χ2/DF = 4.583 &lt; 5, GFI = 0.910 &gt; 0.9,NFI = 0.903 &gt; 0.9, IFI = 0.923 &gt; 0.9, CFI = 0.922 &gt; 0.9, RMSEA = 0.069 &lt; 0.8(Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>). Although P &lt; 0.05, all other measurement models were determined to have good t indices, and the sample size was relatively large. Therefore, this model was acceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> . The standardized parameters of the nal model are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref> and Table <ref type="table">6</ref> show the direct effect, indirect effect and total effect among the relevant factors. Positive coping has direct (0.256) and indirect (-0.275) effects on aggressive behavior (-0.019), in which the indirect effect is generated by resilience (-0.275). Therefore, H3a was supported and clari ed.</p><p>Negative coping has direct (0.148) and indirect (0.165) effects on aggressive behavior (0.313), among which the indirect effects are generated by resilience (0.171) and positive coping (-0.006). Therefore, H3b was supported and clari ed. Self-esteem has direct (0.391) and indirect (0.208) effects on mental resilience (0.599), among which the indirect effects are generated by positive coping (0.208). Therefore, H3c was partially supported and clari ed. Negative coping has direct (-0.273) and indirect (0.135) effects on mental resilience (-0.138), in which the indirect effect is generated by positive coping (0.135). Therefore, H3d was supported and clari ed.</p><p>In general, Life events, self-esteem, resilience, positive coping, negative coping and household income have different direct or indirect effects on the aggressive behavior of left-behind junior high school students.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study detected and clari ed that socio-demographic characteristics, life events, self-esteem, resilience and coping style have a direct or indirect in uence on the aggressive behavior of left-behind junior high school students, and further analyzes the speci c effect path of the in uencing factors on the aggressive behavior of the left-behind junior high school students through the structural equation model, which provides the evidence for helping parents, teachers and temporary guardians to implement targeted interventions to effectively prevent and mitigate the aggressive behavior of left-behind junior high school students.</p><p>Analysis on the status and in uencing factors of left-behind junior high school students' aggressive behavior</p><p>The results of this show that the aggressive behavior score of left-behind junior high school students is (81.28 ± 22.91), which is at a medium level. It indicates that left-behind junior high school students have aggressive behaviors, which are mainly affected by their age and their attitude towards their parents' migrant work. This may be related to the rapid development of individual personality and their different attachment degrees to their parents in adolescence. Romero <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> found that the negative emotions and aggressive behaviors of individuals in the adolescence increase by age. Yao's study <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> of aggressive behavior among left-behind children found that the higher the parent-child attachment of children in the same age group, the less the aggressive behavior. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the emotional changes of children with high possibility of aggressive behaviors, conduct timely psychological counseling, and avoid the occurrence of aggressive behaviors.</p><p>Correlation analysis found that left-behind junior high school students' aggressive behavior was signi cantly positively correlated with negative events and negative coping, which was consistent with the previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> . This may be related to the adverse effects of negative events on adolescent mood and behavior as well as negative cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> . Left-behind junior high school students whose fathers left home for work are signi cantly more affected by negative events than other groups, which may be related to the in uence of absent fathers on the character of left-behind children. Feng <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> found that the absence of a father would reduce the social adaptability and anti-frustration ability of left-behind children, making them more vulnerable to negative events. In relation to the choice of response methods, the difference of the negative and positive response score of the left-behind junior high school students with different genders and household income was statistically signi cant. This may be related to the difference in psychological maturity between adolescent men and women <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and the difference in living environment with different household incomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> .</p><p>In addition, the aggressive behavior of left-behind junior high school students was negatively correlated with resilience and self-esteem, consistent with the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> . It has been proved that left-behind junior high school students with higher resilience and self-esteem will produce fewer hostile emotions and aggressive behaviors when face the stress or negative events. The resilience level of left-behind junior high school students is related to their attitude towards their parents' migrant work, which is consistent with the research results of Zhang <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> . Therefore, parents, teachers and temporary guardians can increase left-behind junior high school student's understanding of parents' migrant work by communicating and explaining with them, so as to enhance their resilience and reduce their hostile emotions and aggressive behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The structural equation model of aggressive behavior of left-behind junior high school students</head><p>According to the equation model, negative life events, have great in uence on the aggressive behavior of left-behind junior high school students (0.508). With the increase of negative life events, the aggressive behavior of left-behind junior high school students also increases, consistent with the research results of Yang <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> . Middle school is a critical period for the physical and mental development of teenagers. Research found that <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> the absence of parents at this stage will cause left-behind children to suffer more negative events in interpersonal communication, study, living environment and other aspects.</p><p>Due to the immaturity of thought and coping style, as well as the lack of proper guidance from parents, compared with non-left-behind junior high school students, left-behind junior high school students are more likely to have violent behaviors stimulated by negative life events <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> . Therefore, reducing the impact of negative life events on its appearance should come to the rst place before downgrading or preventing the occurrence of left-behind junior high school student's aggressive behavior.</p><p>Our results showed that the impact of life events on the left-behind junior high school student's aggressive behavior mainly comes from the indirect effects (0.361) of resilience (0.165), self-esteem (0.104) and negative coping (0.092), apart from the direct impact (0.147). Moreover, resilience (-0.626), self-esteem (-0.253), negative coping (0.313), and positive coping (-0.019) can also exert a certain in uence on the aggressive behaviors of left-behind junior high school students through direct or indirect paths. Thereinto, mental resilience has the greatest impact on the aggressive behavior of left-behind junior high school students, and only has a direct negative effect, which is consistent with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> . This may be related to high resilience that can effectively mediate an individual's perception of negative information, making it easier to perceive the positive side of things and thus adapt well to a frustrating environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> . Under the same setback event, left-behind junior high school students with high self-esteem, psychological resilience and positive coping tendency are less likely to have aggressive behaviors, while left-behind junior high school students with high negative coping tendency are more likely to have aggressive behaviors, which is consistent with the research results of Qi <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> . In addition, relevant studies found that <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> the left-behind children's self-esteem, mental resilience and coping tendency were mainly related to their self-cognition level and psychological support from family, school and society. Therefore, implementing effective psychological intervention measures, strengthening the positive psychological support for left-behind children, and establishing a correct cognitive view of frustration can effectively improve the left-behind junior high school student's self-esteem, mental resilience and positive coping tendency, reduce the impact of negative life events on them, and prevent the occurrence of aggressive behaviors. In addition, our study found that household income can also have weak indirect positive effect on the aggressive behavior of left-behind high school students (0.002). Hence, parents, teachers or temporary guardians should pay more attention to the emotional changes of such left-behind junior high school students, and implement effective psychological interventions in a timely manner to minimize or prevent the occurrence of their aggressive behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>First, participants in the study were left-behind junior high school students, hence, the applicability of this the nding is uncertain for the rest of the left behind school children. Second, because of the crosssectional design, causal relationships among the variables were constructed based on theoretical analysis and literature review, and should be interpreted with caution. Third, we only investigated the impact of life events and internal psychological traits on the left-behind junior high school student's aggressive behavior, and did not investigate or analyze the external social support of left-behind junior high school students. Future research could apply a longitudinal design to test more variables of in uencing the aggressive behavior of left-behind children at different time points, so as to help caregivers effectively reduce the occurrence of left-behind children's aggressive behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>This study detected and clari ed that the left-behind junior high school student's aggressive behavior was in uenced by general information, life events, self-esteem, mental resilience, positive coping and negative coping. Among them, resilience, self-esteem, positive coping and negative coping play an important mediating role in the life events and aggressive behaviors of left-behind junior high school students. The left-behind junior high school students with high resilience, self-esteem and positive coping tendency are less likely to have aggressive behaviors, while left-behind junior high school students with high negative </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figures Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figures</figDesc><graphic coords="26,28.00,128.33,557.00,309.28" type="bitmap" /></figure>
