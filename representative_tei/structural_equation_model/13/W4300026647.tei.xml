<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between reading attitudes and academic success of elementary students in Turkish course with structural equation modelling. The correlative investigation model was adopted in the research. The sample of the research consisted of 196 students from five public elementary schools, chosen according to random sampling method. In order to answer the research question, "The reading attitude scale" was used in the study. Also, the data in relation with students' academic success in Turkish course were gathered from their school report cards regarding the first semester. In this research, LISREL 8.51 structural equation programme was used in model establishing by using the observed variables predicted. According to the findings obtained in the research, it was found out that the compatibility index results of the constructed equation model, the model-data compatibility was found out to be high enough in the research [χ2/df=1.28; GFI=0.94; CFI=0.98; AGFI=0.91; RMSEA=0.038; RMR and SRMR=0.058; NFI=0.93; NNFI=0.97]. In the regression equation, it was found out that the variable best predicting students' academic success in Turkish course is the variable of "academic reading" (γ=0.88) in relation to reading. On the other hand, it was understood that all four predictor variables that were included in the regression equation account for 59% of the overall variance of the academic success in Turkish course in the research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Reading plays a very important role in our lives. It is so much a part of everyday living that one can hardly imagine a life without it. In the age of the Internet and information technologies, reading retains its importance as an essential skill for learners of any language <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alderson, 1984)</ref>. Reading is amongst the most crucial determinants in developing an individual's vision that shapes his or her personality and that makes him or her become closer to other individuals. Reading makes individuals truly free and protects them from ignorance and false beliefs <ref type="bibr">(Ünal, 2010)</ref>. Also, skills in reading enable individuals to benefit from educational activities, and to participate fully in the social and economic activities in which they take part <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(N'Nambi, 2005)</ref>. According to Allen and Bruton (1998), reading is complex process of making meaning from a text, for variety of purposes and in a wide range of contexts. Reading is a psycholinguistic process in that it starts with a linguistic surface representation encoded by a writer and ends with meaning which the reader constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Goodman, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Reading has been described in a variety of ways to explain the process of what happens when one reads and how one comprehends a text. However, a widely accepted explanation of reading does not exist in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dubin, Eskey &amp; Grabe, 1986)</ref>. According to Allen and Bruton (1998), reading as a complex process of making meaning from a text, for variety of purposes and in a wide range of contexts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Grabe and Stoller (2002)</ref> define reading as the ability to draw meaning from the printed page and interpret the information appropriately. Reading is a psycholinguistic process in that it starts with a linguistic surface representation encoded by a writer and ends with meaning which the reader constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Goodman, 1995)</ref>. The common characteristics of definitions relating to reading are that it is an activity that is realised through comprehension. Reading is not an activity that takes place individually but one that encompasses many events and situations <ref type="bibr">(Ünal, 2010)</ref>. A large number of reading specialists view reading as an interactive process <ref type="bibr">(Barnett, 1988)</ref>. This means that the reader's mental processes occur at different levels and he or she engages themselves in an interaction with the print to create meaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Carrell, Devine &amp; Eskey, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Because reading is a complex and multifaceted activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Demiröz, 2010)</ref> and a complicated skill since it requires the combination of attention, memory, perceptual processes, and comprehension processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kern, 1989)</ref>. Thus, reading involves both comprehension and interpretation of a text by using questions formulated by the reader <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Grabe, 1991)</ref> and various levels of cognitive processes are required for efficient reading process. Reading can not be regarded as a set of mechanical skills to be learned once and for all, but rather as a complex process of making meaning from a text, for variety of purposes and in a wide range of contexts <ref type="bibr">(Allen &amp; Bruton, 1998)</ref>. In the reading process, readers use their background knowledge about the text's topic and structure along with their linguistic knowledge and reading strategies to achieve their purpose for reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Peregoy &amp; Boyle, 2001)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Goodman (1995)</ref> states reading is a psycholinguistic process in that it starts with a linguistic surface representation encoded by a writer and ends with meaning which the reader constructs; there is thus an essential interaction between language and thought in reading. In this sense, reading not only includes encoding the language or the written word, it also goes beyond the information in relation with the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Freide &amp; Macedo, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>There is a direct correlation between reading habits of students and applications in the education system. It seems not possible to improve students' reading habits in an education system that leads students to memorise things that are taught to them. Students can improve their reading habits in a student-centred education system <ref type="bibr">(Gömleksiz, 2004)</ref>. In order to raise the production of information and follow up the innovations in a society, it is seen necessary to make students gain continuing reading habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Özbay, Bağcı &amp; Uyar, 2008)</ref>. For this purpose, students should have positive attitudes towards reading in a society. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Allport (1967)</ref> defines attitude as emotional and mental readiness or a preliminary tendency based on experience, knowledge, emotion or motivation on any subject, social topic or event. An attitude is attributed to an individual and it is a tendency that arranges in an orderly manner that individual's thoughts, feelings, and behaviours in relation with a psychological object <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Smith, 1968)</ref>. Most of the researches show that the success in reading skills is closely correlated to the attitude towards reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Guthrie &amp; Wigfield, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Wigfield &amp; Asher, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Morgan &amp; Fuchs, 2007)</ref>. In this regard, it has been concluded that students' attitudes towards reading are the leading factor that directly affects their reading performances <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(McKenna &amp; Kear, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kush, Marley &amp; Brookhart, 2005)</ref>. While some researchers state that the positive attitudes towards reading make academic success increase, the others state that success in reading comprehension makes students develop positive attitudes towards reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kush &amp; Watkins, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kush, Matley &amp; Brookhart, 2005)</ref>. However, it is known that the longer the time spent on reading the greater the probability that students' reading comprehension success is affected positively <ref type="bibr">(Mazzoni, Gambrell &amp; Korkeamaki, 1999)</ref>. According to some researches <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Altunay, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kılıç, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Balcı, 2009)</ref> carried out in the literature, as the level in students' attitudes towards reading rises the marks they obtain from examinations on reading comprehension also increase and the time devoted to reading increases as well.</p><p>When the related literature is viewed in Turkey, it can be seen that there are some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Çakıcı, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Yücel, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Keleş, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kovacıoğlu, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Ünal 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Topçu, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sallabaş, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Balcı, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Özbay &amp; Uyar, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bağcı, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">İşeri, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Ünal, 2010)</ref> for students' reading attitudes in elementary level of education, but it is seen that there are no studies on the correlation between attitudes towards reading and academic success of students. However, it is observed that there are some studies which focused on the correlation between reading comprehension and reading attitudes of students <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Şahiner, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Tazebay, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kovacıoğlu, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Temizkan, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Balcı, 2009)</ref>. Apart from these studies carried out in the related literature, the current research focuses on the academic success, not the reading comprehension of elementary students in Turkey. In this sense, previous literature does not reveal any study which focuses on the correlation between reading attitudes and academic success. This research also tries to investigate the correlation between reading attitudes and academic success with structural equation modelling. The research reported here aimed to determine whether there were direct or indirect correlations between reading attitudes and academic success of elementary students in Turkish course. Hence, it can possibly be stated that this research is an original one in the related literature. On the other hand, the investigation of the correlation between reading attitudes and academic success of elementary students is believed to contribute to policymakers, curriculum developers and teachers in order to design better high school curriculum that will enable students to read more and get higher marks from examinations as such the high school entrance examination (the Level Determination Examination), known as SBS in Turkey. The purpose of this research was to investigate the correlation between reading attitudes and academic success of elementary students in Turkish course with structural equation modelling. Hence, the problem statement of the research can be posed as, "What is the correlation between the reading attitudes and academic success of elementary students in Turkish course?"</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODOLOGY</head><p>The correlative investigation model was used in the research <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(McMillan &amp; Schumacher, 2006)</ref>. This model is one of the most commonly applied models in the related literature <ref type="bibr">(Cohen, Manion &amp; Morrison, 2003)</ref>. The correlative investigation model is used to determine the correlation between different variables in educational and social research <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fraenkel &amp; Wallen, 2000)</ref> and aims to identify the existence or level of coordinated change between two or more variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(McMillan &amp; Schumacher, 2006)</ref>. A structural equation model was formed in order to better illustrate the correlation between variables in the research <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brown, 2006)</ref>. Structural equation model connects the predictive structural correlations holding between the variables in the regression model to the covered factor structures in the factor analysis through a comprehensive analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Sümer, 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The population of this study consisted of students in elementary schools during the 2011-2012 academic year within the borders of Nigde province. In order to detect the sampling of the study, from elementary schools in cosmos, 196 students from five public elementary schools were chosen according to random sampling method <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Karasar, 2005)</ref>. In order to detect the sampling of the study, elementary schools in cosmos were chosen according to three-layer group sampling method according to socio-economic structure (highmiddle-low) of their region <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(McMillan &amp; Schumacher, 2006)</ref>. The participants were assured for the anonymity and confidentiality for their responses in the study. The necessary permission was obtained from students' parents and the parents of the students participated in the research were informed about the purpose of the research. Of the total, 95 (48.47%) of the students were females and 101 (51.53%) of the students were males. Also, 60 students (30.61%) were in the 6 th grade, 71 of the students (36.22%) were in the 7 th grade and 65 students (33.2%) were in the 8 th grade in the research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments</head><p>In order to answer the research question in the study, "the Reading Attitude Scale" <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Özbay &amp; Uyar, 2009)</ref> was used in the research. The information for this scale is given below in the research. Also, the data in relation with students' academic success in Turkish course were gathered from their school report cards regarding the first semester of 2011-2012 academic year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Reading Attitude Scale</head><p>In this study, "the Reading Attitude Scale", developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Özbay and Uyar (2009)</ref> was used in order to collect data to answer the research questions in the research. In order to determine the structure validity of the scale, the scale, developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Özbay and Uyar (2009)</ref> was applied factor analysis. According to the factor analysis of the scale, KMO result of the scale was found as .844 and Bartlett test result was found as 1510.752 (p&lt;.000). According to the factor analysis findings, the scale was understood to have four sub-dimensions and 15 items and the total variance of the scale was found as 67%. The factorial loadings of the items in the scale were found between .943 and .547. Therefore 10 items, which were under .32 factor loading, were removed from the scale so that the scale consisted of 15 items with a five-likert type. The scale also consisted of four sub-dimensions. The sub-dimensions of the scale were; (i) free reading, (ii) book reading, (iii) general reading, and (iv) academic reading. The Cronbach's Alpha coefficient of the total scale was calculated as .87. The higher the total score on the scale, the higher the level of attitudes towards reading of students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>In this research, LISREL 8.51 structural equation programme was used in model establishing by using the observed variables predicted. In determining to what extent the suggested correlation patterns in the research are compatible with the real data, chi-square (χ2) suitability test, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Root Mean Square Residual (RMR), Standardised Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR), Goodness of Fit Index 66 (GFI), Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Normed Fit Index (NFI), and Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI) values were used in the current research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS</head><p>In this part of the research, the correlation between students' reading attitudes and their academic success was presented. In this regard, the problem statement of the research was "What is the correlation between the reading attitudes and academic success of elementary students in Turkish course?" In order to answer the problem statement, reading attitude was accepted as exogenous variable and academic success in Turkish course was perceived as endogenous variable in the research. For this purpose, the linear correlations between students' reading attitudes and their academic success in Turkish course were analysed with path analysis in the study. The path analysis in relation to the correlation between reading attitudes and academic success in Turkish course is presented in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Path Analysis in Relation to Reading Attitudes and Academic Success</head><p>As looked at Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> above, it can be seen that there are four latent variables in relation to reading attitudes. On examining the compatibility index results of the constructed equation model, the model-data compatibility was found out to be high enough. As a result of path analysis, χ2/df ratio was 1.28 (χ2/df=92.83/72). In the study, GFI value was 0.94 and AGFI value was found out as 0.91 so that they can be perceived as sufficient. In this research, RMSEA value was found as 0.038 so that it is considered as an excellent goodness of fit. Besides, RMR and SRMR values were found as 0.058 in the study. In this study, CFI value was found out as 0.98. Lastly, NFI value was 0.93 and NNFI value was found as 0.97 in this study.</p><p>On examining the structural equation modelling, it was seen that the variable best predicting elementary students' academic success in relation to reading attitudes was academic reading sub-dimension. It was found a linear positive significant high correlation between academic reading sub-dimension to academic success in Turkish course, where the correlation connection coefficient value was found as γ=0.88 in the research. It became evident that the second most crucial factor determining academic success in Turkish course was book reading sub-dimension in relation to reading attitude. The connection coefficient value was γ=0.83 in regard of book reading sub-dimension of reading attitude. Besides, a linear positive correlation was found out between free reading sub-dimension in relation to reading attitude and academic success in Turkish course, where the connection coefficient value was found as γ=0.80 in the research. However, a positive moderate linear correlation which was determined between academic success and general reading sub-dimension in relation to reading attitude in the model. The connection coefficient value was found out to be γ=0.54 in the model created. On the other hand, to determine the direct effect of reading attitudes on academic success in Turkish course at the level of sub-dimensions, a regression analysis was used. On examining the regression equation of the covered variables predicted by variables that were included in the structural equation model, the statement coefficient value of the model was found as 0.59 and the model [Academic Success= 0.77*Academic Reading+0.68*Book Reading+0.63*Free Reading+0.29*General Reading, Error var.= 0.40, R²= 0.59] was found out to be statistically significant at p&lt;.01 level in the research. In this regard, it can be well understood that all four predictor variables that were included in the regression equation accounted for 59% of the overall variance of the academic success in Turkish course in the research. As can also be seen in the regression equation, the variable best predicting students' academic success in Turkish course was the variable of "academic reading" in relation to reading. In addition, it can also be possibly said that "book reading", and "free reading" variables in relation to reading attitudes predicted students' academic success in Turkish course in a greater extend in the research. Although the third factor, general reading, predicted students' academic success significantly at moderate level, the prediction level of this factor was fairly lower in comparison with other factors such as academic reading, book reading, and free reading in the research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>The purpose of this research was to investigate the correlation between reading attitudes and academic success of elementary students in Turkish course. This research also aimed at constructing a structural equation model between attitudes towards reading and academic success in Turkish course. In this regard, on examining the compatibility index results of the constructed structural equation model, the model-data compatibility was found out to be high enough in the research. According to the findings obtained in the research, it was found that χ2/df ratio was 1.28 (χ2/df=92.83/72) in the research. It is stated that a ratio equal to or lower than 2.5 in small samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kline, 2005)</ref>, and a ratio equal to greater than 3 in large samples correspond to "excellent" goodness of fit in the related literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Sümer, 2000)</ref>. Besides this, it is stated that GFI and AGFI indexes equal to 1 means excellent goodness of fit in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Schumacher &amp; Lomax, 1996)</ref>. In the study, GFI value was 0.94 and AGFI value was found out as 0.91 so that they can be perceived as sufficient. RMSEA value equal to or lower than 0.05 means excellent goodness of fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brown, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Schumacher &amp; Lomax, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Çokluk, Şekercioğlu &amp; Büyüköztürk, 2010)</ref>. In this research, RMSEA value was found as 0.038 so that it is considered as an excellent goodness of fit. RMR and SRMR values are lower than 0.05 displays perfect model-data compatibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brown, 2006)</ref>. In the study, RMR and SRMR values were found as 0.058 and they were the indicators of sufficient goodness of fit. CFI value equal to or greater than 0.95 means excellent goodness of fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Thompson, 2004)</ref>. In this study, CFI value was found out as 0.98 so that it can be considered as excellent goodness of fit. NFI and NNFI values equal to or greater than 0.95 mean excellent goodness of fit in the related literature <ref type="bibr">(Tabashnick &amp; Fidell, 2001)</ref>. Besides, NFI value was found as 0.93 and NNFI value was found as 0.97 in the research.</p><p>On the other hand, on examining the structural equation modelling, it was seen that the variable best predicting elementary students' academic success in relation to reading attitudes was academic reading sub-dimension. It was found a linear positive significant correlation between academic reading sub-dimension to academic success in Turkish course, where the correlation connection value was found as γ=0.88 in the research. It became evident that the second most crucial factor determining academic success in Turkish course was book reading sub-dimension in relation to reading attitude. The connection coefficient value was γ=0.83 in regard of book reading sub-dimension of reading attitude. Besides, a linear positive correlation was found out between free reading sub-dimension in relation to reading attitude and academic success in Turkish course, where the connection coefficient value was found as γ=0.80 in the research. However, a positive moderate linear correlation which was determined between academic success and general reading sub-dimension in relation to reading attitude in the model. The connection coefficient value was found out to be γ=0.54 in the model created. On examining the regression equation of the covered variables predicted by variables that were included in the structural equation model, the statement coefficient value of the model was found as 0.59. It can be well understood that the four predictor variables that were included in the regression equation accounted for 59% of the overall variance of the academic success in Turkish course in the research. As can also be seen in the regression equation, the variable best predicting students' academic success in Turkish course was the variable of "academic reading" in relation to reading. In addition, it can also possibly be said that "book reading", and "free reading" variables in relation to reading attitudes predicted students' academic success in Turkish course in a greater extend in the research. Although the third factor, general reading, predicted students' academic success significantly at moderate level, the prediction level of this factor was fairly lower in comparison with other factors such as academic reading, book reading, and free reading in the research. Therefore, in light of the results obtained in the research, it is thought that students tend to read academically (academic reading) in order to get information from books and other sources because of the examinations such as the Level Determination Exam (LDE) in the Turkish Education System. Also, students have examinations at school so that they have to read academic books so as to study their target course(s) and/or subject(s) better. Hence, it can be perceived quite normal that students tend to academic reading. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ivey and Broaddus (2000)</ref>, students, studying in secondary schools (6-8th grades), have a decline in their free reading attitude and general reading so that they tend to academic reading more because of the examinations and heavy work load of their courses at school. On the other hand, other variables such as "book reading", "free reading", and "general reading" sub-dimensions in relation reading attitudes can be considered crucial so that they were seen to be significant predictors of students' academic success in Turkish course. Therefore, it might be suggested that the more students have positive attitudes towards reading in all sub-dimensions of reading attitude, the higher marks they get from examinations of Turkish course in elementary schools.</p><p>When the related literature is viewed, it can be seen that there are some studies which support the conclusions of the current research <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Roettger, Szymczuk &amp; Millard, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Swanson, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Eliot, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Norman, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mustachio, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dökmen, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hayes, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Pretorius, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ghaith &amp; Bouzeineddine, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Şahiner, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Tazebay, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kovacıoğlu, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Suna, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Temizkan, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sallabaş, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Balcı, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bağcı, 2010)</ref>. It was found out in these researches that a positive increase in the level of students' attitudes towards reading made positive contributions to students' reading comprehension. In this context, the results obtained in the literature can be said to be paralleled to the findings obtained in the current research. Therefore, it might be suggested that activities should be done to raise students' attitudes towards reading at school. As a result of the current research carried out, it can be said that a positive linear correlation was determined between academic success and reading attitudes in the model. In other words, it was found that academic success in Turkish course increased in parallel to the increase in positive attitudes towards reading. Hence, it might be recommended that teachers should motivate their students to read more and have more positive attitudes towards reading. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Sever (2004)</ref>, one of the most important factors in reading education is the motivation of students. In this sense, it is seen very important that teachers should motivate students towards reading wherever and whenever possible at school. Thus, students should, firstly, have positive attitudes towards reading. When students have positive attitudes towards reading, they are considered to have a positive tendency to reading. At the end of this process, it is believed that reading contributes to academic success at school. In a study carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Norman (1986)</ref>, it was seen that there was a strong correlation between reading attitudes and academic success at school. In similar studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Eliot (1983)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hayes (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Pretorius (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sallabaş (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bağcı (2010)</ref> found out that there was a significant positive correlation between attitudes towards reading and reading comprehension. However, it is seen that the correlation between reading attitudes and academic success in researched from different perspectives. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">LePage and Mills (1990)</ref> state, the correlation between academic success and reading attitudes is still perceived as a problem in the related literature. Although there are researches which support the correlation between reading attitudes and academic success <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Roettger, Szymczuk &amp; Millard, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Eliot, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hayes, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ghaith &amp; Bouzeineddine, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Tazebay, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sallabaş, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Balcı, 2009)</ref>, some other researches support that the success in reading comprehension, not the attitude towards reading affects academic success at school <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kush &amp; Watkins, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kush, Matley &amp; Brookhart, 2005)</ref>. But the truth here is that the time spent on reading and interests in reading also affect success in comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mazzoni et al., 1999)</ref>. According to Guthtrie and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wigfield (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Wigfield and Asher (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Morgan and Fuchs (2007)</ref>, good readers tend to have positive attitudes towards reading and they also have a good reading comprehension level. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chall and Feldmann (1966)</ref> found out that significant positive correlation amongst reading success and attitudes towards reading and reading materials. According to the results obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chall and Feldmann (1966)</ref>, it can be stated that if a student have positive attitudes both towards reading and reading materials, they tend to be more successful in courses at school.</p><p>Developing positive attitudes towards reading in the initial years of school is very important to have successful students and/or individuals in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Smith, 1990)</ref>. In this context, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Schatz and Krashen (2006)</ref> state, although children have positive attitudes towards reading in the initial years of school, their positive attitudes towards reading decreases as their ages go up <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bircan &amp; Tekin, 1989)</ref>. Many researches in the literature indicated that as the grade level and/or age of students increase, their attitudes towards reading decrease <ref type="bibr">(Hyes, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arıcı, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Keleş, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">İşeri, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baş, 2012)</ref>. Thus, a continuing motivation and interest amongst students should be sustained beginning from the early years of their education at school <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Guthrie, 2001)</ref>. On the other hand, in order to have a critical thinking society, people should read more and more. So, to make people read more, they should have positive attitudes towards reading firstly <ref type="bibr">(Ünal, 2006)</ref>. In conclusion, the findings obtained in the literature indicate that attitude, like other perceptual variables, is an important factor in gaining and developing reading skills and academic success at school.</p><p>As there are only a few studies on the correlation of reading attitudes and academic success, there is a need to conduct more studies on this very issue. This current research may give insights for teachers, educational administrators and policymakers about creating strategies for developing students' reading attitudes. It is suggested that researchers should study on the possible effects of parental education and income levels, classroom sizes and school types of students with their reading attitudes both in Turkish course and/or other courses with a comparison to high school and/or university level of education.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><graphic coords="5,81.41,285.41,432.60,271.69" type="bitmap" /></figure>
