<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>It is noted in the light of several studies associated with the readingcomprehension skills that fluent word reading, connectives knowledge and fluent text reading are closely related to the comprehension skill. Hence it seems possible to create a model over these concepts and their interrelationships. Within the scope of this research two different models are proposed considering theoretical information. The study group of the research was composed of 263 secondary school students at a state school in Burdur province. Three different confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed to see whether factor structures were confirmed on the sample by using the maximum estimate method of the AMOS 18 software. Analysis of Covariance and Multivariate Analysis of Covariance were performed to determine whether the demographic variables grade level and gender had a significant effect on the scale scores. These analyzes were also performed in the SPSS 18 program. It has been found that as the grade level of the students increases, connective usage konowledge increases, the fluent silent word reading, the fluent silent text reading, the reading comprehension and the academic achievements increase as the grade level increases. This research concluded that reading comprehension strongly and significantly predicted academic achievement. But however, fluent silent text reading did not predict reading comprehension significantly. According to the results of the research, the model formed by the sub-dimensions of binding usage information shows better fit.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>According to "the simple view of reading theory", reading is composed of two main categories: word reading and language comprehension. Word reading category includes the subcategories of letter knowledge-phonics, reading accuracy and automatic reading whereas language comprehension is constituted by the subcategories of word comprehension, sentence comprehension and text comprehension. Hence, activation of word meaning, understanding the sentences, inference, control of comprehension and understanding the text structure are covered by this subcategory. When either of these categories does not work, reading performance is not achieved in the desired quality (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Oakhill, Cain, &amp; Elbro, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In this sense, fluent processing particularly on the word level during the process of reading-comprehending a text is regarded as being of top priority for cognitive processing required for the text comprehension. Because it would be possible to focus mental sources on text comprehension with the automatization of word recognition <ref type="bibr">(NRP, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Perfetti, 1998)</ref>, relating the word reading skill to comprehension seems probable in the theoretical framework.</p><p>It is remarkable in the literature that there is a high-level relationship between fluent word reading and comprehension in the first periods of reading particularly <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kim, Wagner, &amp; Lopez, 2012)</ref>. In the research conducted with 2143 students, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Verhoeven and Leeuwe (2008)</ref> achieved comparable results. According to their research, word reading has an important effect of comprehension in early stages. In the study, it is concluded that there is a high-level relationship between fluent word reading and comprehension; the relationship is shown .50 at the lowest and .87 at the highest (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Castillo, Torgesen, Powell-Smith, &amp; Al-Otaiba, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, according to the Lexical Quality theory, lexical quality refers to how important formats and meaning elements of the word seen by a reader and the lexical knowledge are. Accordingly, a reader should be able to know both textual, phonological and morphological-syntactic attributes and semantic attributes of a word and include the words in the textual context in the text processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Perfetti, 2007)</ref>. Then, the reader should be able to read simple words fluently and process these words in accordance with the meaning required by the context and fluently. The consequent type of reading is not the act of reading from a list of simple words but reading of a text is the exact opposite.</p><p>In such reading, two main concepts are focused on in silent reading for fluency: reading accuracy and reading rate. Hence, it is possible to define this reading as fluent silent text reading.</p><p>A reader who gets into the fluent text reading process should perform inter-sentence cognitive transactions such as understanding small structures (word and phrase recognition, etc.) as well as integrating the meanings (inter-sentence grammatical and semantic relations), inferring the semantic information from text by focusing on inter-proposition relation networks, making the connections of references and filling the gaps in regard to cohesion through bridging so that he/she can comprehend a text, that is, create the mental representation of the text content <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(McNamara, Kintsch, Songer and Kintsch, 1996)</ref>. In other words, he/she should make consistent semantic relations on the sentence level other than the word level. To that end, readers need to understand the directions for the pronouns and the referred expressions in the text and comprehend how sentences are interrelated and how clauses, paragraphs, parts and groups of part are related to the general subject <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Caccamise, Snyder, &amp; Kintsch, 2008)</ref>. Again, as stated by van Silfhout, G., Evers-Vermeul, J. &amp; Sanders, T. ( <ref type="formula">2015</ref>), it is very important for reader to establish the proper relations both locally and wholly between the units of the text for structuring the mental representation of text. In this process, connectives come across as some of the most important guides in inter-sentence connection.</p><p>Linguists divide words into two groups as function words and content words. In addition to this classification, it is observed that functional and content words are also defined as open/closed class or grammatical and substantial words. Open class words are basic lexical groups such as nouns, verbs and adjectives. Closed class words are syntactic processors including grammatical groups such as determiners, prepositions and connectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(d'Arcadais, 1984)</ref>. Semantic contribution of functional words is more abstract and less referential than content words. They are the latest acquired constructs in language acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Littlefield, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Smith &amp; Witten, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, readers should have internalized content words like connectives for efficient reading. Because readers receive information required about the function of connectives from their long-term memory when reading. If a reader is not informed of what functions connectives have in his/her long-term memory, it will not matter when he/she reads connectives properly and fluently, that is, simply performs a decoding process. As in fluent word reading, the reader will read the word properly first, then access the information in its function/meaning in his/her mental glossary. In the next stage, this will enable the reader to use this function/meaning in accordance with the context properly and achieve fluent text reading. In this case, it is obvious that the reader needs to read connectives in the text automatically and fluently.</p><p>As stated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kurtul (2011)</ref>, connectives function to demonstrate the logical connection between propositions or between a sentence and a noun phrase in some cases. In this sense, the meaning conveyed by connectives is very important for coherent connections among discourse sections. It will be difficult to achieve desired coherence when there is an incoherent relation between connective and semantic content of connected elements <ref type="bibr">(Zufferey, Mak, Degand, &amp; Sanders, 2015: 390)</ref>. Process of comprehension will be affected negatively, too.</p><p>Several research results coincide with this theoretical information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sanders and Noordman (2000)</ref> state that presence of connectives in texts makes text processing easier, referring to numerous studies on online texts. On the other hand, Geva and Ryan (1985) state based on the related research that competent readers have good connectives knowledge and use this knowledge to establish logical relations among the parts of text. This is an outcome which is expected to increase the speed of processing during reading. <ref type="bibr">Noordman, Vonk and Kempf (1992)</ref> accordingly concluded that connectives accelerate readers' reading time. Likewise, van Silfhout, Evers-Vermeul and Sanders (2015) state that many young readers cannot construct the text in their minds properly because of their incompetence in making connections when reading. According to their research, connectives not only accelerate the processing of later information but also reduce the number of rereading the current information in the text. These findings indicate that connectives have a function of an initial "processing directive". Thus, the findings also refer to that having sufficient amount of connectives knowledge during reading will contribute to a reader's fluent reading and text comprehension.</p><p>As addressed above, it is noted in the light of several studies associated with the readingcomprehension skills that fluent word reading, connectives knowledge and fluent text reading are closely related to the comprehension skill. Two models can be accordingly suggested for these relations: The first model recognizes connectives knowledge as one dimension; the second model recognizes connectives knowledge along with its subdimensions. The following is the illustration of this model (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effect of connective usage knowledge, fluent silent word reading and fluent silent text reading on reading comprehension and direct effect of reading comprehension on academic achievement. For this purpose, the following hypotheses were developed: H1: Connective usage knowledge has a positive significant effect on fluent silent word reading, fluent silent text reading, and reading comprehension. H2: Fluent silent word reading and fluent silent text reading have a positive significant effect on reading comprehension. H3: Reading comprehension has a positive significant effect on academic achievement. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHOD 2.1. Participants</head><p>The study group of the research was composed of 263 secondary school students at a state school in Burdur province. This school was chosen because it is an easily accessible sample. 25.1% (f=66) of the students were fifth-graders, 24.7% (f=65) were sixth-graders, 24.3% (f=64) were seventh-graders, and 25.9% (f=68) were eighth-graders. 51.7% (f=136) of the students are girls and 48.3% (f=127) of them are boys. Ages of the students varied between 11 and 14. Accordingly, arithmetic means of the ages were 12.8 while the standard deviation was .26.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Instruments</head><p>Four assessment instruments and official achievement scores were used in this study:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Connective Knowledge Test</head><p>The items of the Connective Test developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Çetinkaya, Ülper and Bayat (2014)</ref> were produced from sentences using side-by-side, top-and-bottom and discourse-marker connectives. Items under these three groups are based on another semantic classification. This classification is temporal, causation, opposition and expansion. There are 28 four-choice items in the instrument. Kuder-Richardson 20 (KR-20) reliability coefficient of the whole scale was found to be .74. Due to low reliability coefficients of the subscales, it was ensured that each factor was composed of three items at least <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Comrey, 1988)</ref>, and KR-20 reliability coefficients were .66 for the temporal factor, .71 for the causation factor, .62 for the opposition factor, and .89 for the expansion factor. Item difficulty values ranged from .47 to .73 and item discriminations ranged from .28 to .43.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Fluent Silent Word Reading Test</head><p>Developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ülper and Yağmur (2016)</ref>, this test is composed of three reading cards. The first card includes 110 (+110), the second card 100 (+100), and the third card 90 (+90) actual words and fake words derived from those actual words in the same amount. In this test, students are expected to mark the actual words as many as possible in one minute. Cronbach's Alpha coefficient for the scores obtained from three cards is .96.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Fluent Silent Text Reading Test</head><p>Fluent Silent Text Reading Test measures the rate of silent and fluent reading of a given text. In this test, students are expected to read as many words as possible in one minute. The text in the test is narrative. The words used in the text can be known to that group of age. The text is on the independent reading level according to the formulation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Çetinkaya-Uzun (2014)</ref> in terms of readability. The experts were also consulted for opinion when choosing the text. It was seen in the preliminary practices that there was no significant difference between the scores obtained by two equivalent groups. This provides an important data of reliability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4.">Reading Comprehension Test</head><p>Developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ülper, Çetinkaya and Bayat (2017)</ref>, the test includes 28 questions in total (11 multiple-choice, 3 fill-in-the-blank, 6 true-false, and 8 open-ended questions). Students are expected to answer all questions in the test. KR-20 reliability coefficients were found .76 for the Inference factor and .61 for the superficial text factor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.5.">Academic Achievement</head><p>Official achievement scores obtained by the students in the courses of Turkish, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies were accepted as the academic achievement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Procedure</head><p>All instruments were applied to the students under the control of the researcher on the basis of voluntariness within one week. It was explained to the students how to complete the tests before the application of all tests The Connectives Knowledge Test was applied first. All students completed the test in one class hour. On the next day, the Silent Word Reading Test was applied to the students. Card 1, card 2, and card 3 were handed to the students in this test, respectively. The students were admitted to the test in two separate groups and sat down to their places individually so that they could not be affected by each other. Following the necessary explanations, the practitioner started the one-minute duration of the test, and the students were asked to put down their pencils when the time was up. The Fluent Silent Text Reading Test was applied to the students on the next day. The students were admitted to the test one by one. It was explained to the students that they could go back and read any word again if they were to read it incorrectly. The text was handed to the students during the test, and they were asked to read it silently for one minute. The students were also asked to follow up what they read with their pencils, and if they were to go back, they would do it with their pencils so that their reading could be observed. In this process, the students were carefully watched and asked to draw a circle around the last read word once the time was up. On the last day, the Reading Comprehension Test was handed to the students, and they were asked to answer all questions. All students completed the test within one class hour. All the tests were applied in March 2017.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Data Analysis</head><p>Three different confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were performed to see whether factor structures were confirmed on the sample by using the maximum estimate method of the AMOS 18 software. The first CFA examined whether the first-order factor structure (temporal, causation, opposition and expansion) was predicted by the second-order factor structure (Connectives Knowledge). The second CFA was carried out to find out whether the first-order factor structure (Card 1, Card, 2, and Card 3) was predicted by the second-order factor structure (Fluent Silent Word Reading). In the third CFA, it was examined whether the first-order factor structure (Superficial and Inference) was predicted by the second-order factor structure (Reading Comprehension).</p><p>Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) and Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) and analyses were performed to determine whether the demographic variables grade level and gender had a significant effect on the scale scores. These analyses were conducted in SPSS 18 software. Levene's Test of Equality of Error Variances of ANCOVA analysis was not found siginicantly (F(1-261)=.38, p&gt;.05). Levene's Test values for MANCOVA analyses were ranged from .87 to 3.52 (p&gt;.05). Box's Test of Equality of Covariance Matrices of MANCOVA was not significant (F(10)=1.71, p&gt;.05). Thus, ANCOVA and MANCOVA assumptions were meet. Two models were tested in the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), which is a strong method. In the first model, connectives knowledge was recognized as the independent variable while fluent silent word reading and fluent silent text reading were accepted to be the mediatory variables, and the reading comprehension was recognized as the dependent variable while academic achievement was accepted to be the output variable. Temporal, causation, opposition and expansion are the indicators of connectives knowledge were recognized as independent variables in the second model, and other measures were organized in the same way as in the first model. While connectives knowledge was included in the first model as the latent variable, subdimensions of connectives knowledge were examined as observed variables in the second model. Fluent Silent Text Reading was examined as the observed variable in both proposed models. Acceptability limits of CMIN/x 2 , RMR, RMSEA, NFI, CFI, GFI, and AGFI were considered in the evaluation of model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Byrne, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hair, Black, Babin, &amp; Anderson, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Schermelleh-Engel, Moosbrugger, &amp; Müller, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Schumacker &amp; Lomax, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>All scores were translated into standard scores for the analyses in the first place. No standard score lower than -3.0 and higher than +3.0 was observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bakeman &amp; Robinson, 2014)</ref>. It was additionally observed that linearity, singularity and multicollinearity assumptions of SEM analysis were met. Data of five students were excluded from the dataset due to high Mahalanobis d 2 . Then, Mahalanobis d 2 varied between 14.61 and 39.09 (p&gt;.001). These findings and data were included in the proposed model. Sobel's z test <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Sobel, 1982)</ref> was conducted to test the possible effect in case fluent silent word reading and fluent silent text reading had the mediatory effect between connectives knowledge and reading comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kim &amp; Bentler, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>

The goodnessof-fit indexes were found to be within the good fit limits (x 2 (61) =87.24, p&gt;.05; x 2 /df=1.43; RMR=.06; RMSEA=.04; NFI=.99; CFI=.99; GFI=.99; AGFI=.92). Factor loads varied between .53 and .97. It was also observed that all standardized parameter estimates were significant at .001.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Structural Model</head><p>Regarding the goodness-of-fit indexes of the two proposed model, the fit indexes of Model 2 (x 2 (54)=57.64, p&lt;.05; x 2 /df=1.06; RMR=1.04; RMSEA=.01; NFI=.99; CFI=.99; GFI=.97; AGFI=.94) were found better than the fit indexes of Model 1 (x 2 (65)=161.15, p&lt;.05; x 2 /df=2.47; RMR=2.19; RMSEA=.07; NFI=.96; CFI=.97; GFI=.92; AGFI=.87). Causations between connectives knowledge and reading comprehension and between silent text reading and reading comprehension were excluded from Model 1. After the proposed modifications had been done, the fit indexes achieved the good fit. According to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Table 2</ref>, connectives knowledge predicted fluent silent word reading (β=.57, t=6.12, p&lt;.001) and fluent silent text reading (β=.77, t=9.29, p&lt;.001); fluent silent word reading predicted reading comprehension <ref type="bibr">(β=.83, t=13.21, p&lt;.001)</ref>, fluent silent text reading predicted fluent silent word reading <ref type="bibr">(β=.48, t=6.80, p&lt;.001)</ref>, and reading comprehension predicted academic achievement (β=.84, t=12.68, p&lt;.001) significantly.  The results obtained in the analyses of Model 2 are shown on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Following the proposed modifications, the fit indexes of Model 2 was found to be better than the fit indexes of Model 1. The proposed modifications are shown on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Two of the standardized parameter estimates were not found statistically significant. One of these estimates, the temporal factor of connectives knowledge did not significantly predict fluent silent word reading (β=. <ref type="bibr">05, t=1.61, p&gt;.05)</ref>, and the other one, which is fluent silent text reading did not significantly predict reading comprehension (β=-.10, t=-.89, p&gt;.05). All other standardized parameter estimates were found statistically significant. Differently from Model 1, it was seen in Model 2 that all factors of connectives knowledge significantly predicted reading comprehension. Moreover, fluent silent text reading predicted fluent silent word reading (β=.72, t=22.38, p&lt;.001) more strongly. Sobel's z test was performed to test whether fluent silent word reading had a mediatory effect between connectives knowledge factors and reading comprehension. Fluent silent word reading was found to have a mediatory effect between causation and reading comprehension (z=2.41, p&lt;.01), opposition and reading comprehension (z=2.31, p&lt;.05), and expansion and reading comprehension (z=2.73, p&lt;.01).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</head><p>It was concluded that students' connectives knowledge increased as their grade levels increased. Higher grade levels also meant higher levels of fluent silent word reading, fluent silent text reading, reading comprehension and academic achievement. It was found that fluent silent text reading was in favor of the girls and their scores were higher.</p><p>The model established with the factors of connectives knowledge showed better fit. Only the temporal factor of connectives knowledge did not predict fluent silent word reading significantly. Factors of causation, opposition and expansion significantly predicted fluent silent word reading, fluent silent text reading and reading comprehension. These results highly coincide with the findings of few researches in the Turkish literature. In the study conducted by Gençer (2013) to examine the relationship between connectives in the text and reading comprehension, reading comprehension scores of the poor readers were found negative significantly correlated to the connectives that report "opposition" and "expansion". In other words, higher number of connectives in the text meant lower reading comprehension of the poor readers. The main reason for this is that poor readers cannot process connectives in the text.</p><p>It was found that fluent silent word reading was a partial mediator in the relationship between connectives knowledge factors of causation, opposition and expansion and reading comprehension. In the Turkish literature (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Yılmaz, 2008)</ref>, it was observed that the activity of having students read the words in a simple way which they misread in the text by writing down them on cards with the word repetition technique had a positive impact both on reading fluency and elimination of reading errors and comprehension. The study performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Çetinkaya, Ülper and Yağmur (2015)</ref> concluded that fluent silent word reading was correlated to comprehension. It is also known that studies in foreign languages have similar results (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Yılmaz, 2008)</ref>. How the students who began to read the words automatically through the word repetition technique improved their reading skills refers to a similar situation that fluent word reading skill is closely related to comprehension. The presence of such relationship is remarkable in the foreign literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kim, Wagner, &amp; Lopez, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Verhoeven &amp; Leeuwe, 2008)</ref>. In a study, which concluded that there is a high-level relationship between fluent word reading and comprehension, the relationship is shown .50 at the lowest and .87 at the highest (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Castillo et al., 2009)</ref>. Coincidence of these findings with the findings of our research is important in that it refers to similar situations in foreign languages. Another study that can be associated with the prediction of comprehension by word reading skill was the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Yıldırım, Yıldız and Ateş (2011)</ref>. In their study, participants' lexical knowledge was found moderately correlated to narrative text comprehension and highly correlated to informative text comprehension. Since high levels of lexical knowledge are important for student to recognize words and read more fluently, it is obvious that this relationship indirectly refers to the fluent word reading-comprehension relationship. Hence, both oral and silent reading fluency is regarded as being associated with comprehension in the literature.</p><p>Considering the studies on fluent oral word reading both in Turkish and foreign literature, fluent word reading positively affects comprehension, individuals who can read a text fluently or become a fluent reader through the education have higher comprehension levels or there is an interaction in between (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baştuğ &amp; Keskin;</ref><ref type="bibr">2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Başaran, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fuchs, Fuchs, Hosp, &amp; Jenkins, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pikulski &amp; Chard, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">)</ref>. According to the finding of this research, fluent silent text reading did not predict reading comprehension significantly. There can be two explanations to the case: The first is about the subject being discussed in the literature. Accordingly, do reading fluency predicts comprehension, or can individuals read fluently because they can comprehend well? Some researchers argue that this is a two-way relationship (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dowhower, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Yıldız, 2013)</ref>. Yıldız (2013) explored a two-way relationship for the Turkish language. The second is that the studies in the literature generally conducted through oral reading. The general opinion is that oral reading predicts comprehension. However, fluent reading is not performed only orally but also in a silent manner. It is, on the other hand, apparent that prosodic qualities cannot be observed in silent reading fluency. In the study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jenkins and Jewell (1993)</ref> on the relationship between fluent silent reading and comprehension, fourth-grade students' fluent silent reading levels were found weakly correlated to their comprehension levels (r=.38), and second-grade students' fluent silent reading levels were strongly correlated to their comprehension levels (r=.76). This finding does not coincide with the finding of our research. Yet, it is remarkable that there is no study on this subject in the Turkish literature. As many studies on the fluent silent text reading-comprehension relationship as in oral reading are required to achieve a literal knowledge on the subject. Only then it will be possible to provide more concrete explanations of the relationship between fluent silent text reading and comprehension.</p><p>This research concluded that reading comprehension strongly and significantly predicted academic achievement. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Yıldız (2013)</ref> confirmed the hypothesis that reading comprehension has a significant effect on academic achievement. Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ural and Ülper (2013)</ref> drew attention to the relationship between reading comprehension skill and mathematical modeling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Akay (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Özdemir and Sertsöz (2006)</ref> remarkably explored a similar relationship in terms of mathematical problem solving. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bayat, Şekercioğlu and Bakır (2014)</ref> found that reading comprehension achievement significantly predicted the science course achievement.</p><p>Another related study compared students' score averages of reading comprehension with their achievements in the courses of Turkish, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Science and Technology. The study in question observed that students' reading comprehension achievements were statistically correlated to their achievements in the courses of Turkish, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Science and Technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Yılmaz, 2011)</ref>. Again, it was explored in another research that grade averages of the students who like reading books were higher than the students who do not <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Yılmaz, 2012)</ref>. The common reference point of these studies is that academic achievement requires sufficient level of comprehension. Coincidence between all these findings and the findings achieved in our research indicates the dominant role of comprehension in academic achievement.</p><p>It is possible that this research could be taken up in a wider frame and also be a source for other studies. In this context, similar studies can be done with different sample groups, and another model proposal can be made based on some other variables that explain the reading. The limitation of the present study is that the data were obtained from secondary school's students at a state school in Burdur province. Future studies should be carried out based on a larger number of students obtained from different schools and different provinces and in order to provide more comprehensive results.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
