<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Technology has continuously transformed the way employees perform their jobs throughout history. In this digital era, organizations that take advantage of technology advancements that give workers flexible working options like telework and pay close attention to the administration of these arrangements are seen to reap the most benefits. Work has become much more flexible because of technological advancements, with both employee and employer benefit from flexible work arrangements. This newly arrangement design in the workplace shifted the dynamic of work-life balance and job satisfaction among employee that needs to be investigated more thoroughly.</p><p>Work-life balance is a condition of balance in which a person emphasizes both in his or her professional and personal responsibilities equally. The balance between work and living activities, as well as how it is achieved, differs from person to person, depending on when one is satisfied with both work and personal life. This has been debate by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kossek et al. (2014)</ref>, employment approaches that link employee work-life balance and wellbeing to employment experiences across the length of employees' working lives help establish and maintain a sustainable workforce. Most psychologists believe that a person's ability to have a fulfilling personal life outside of work should not be affected by the requirements of their job. During the global Covid 19 pandemic, interest in the work-life balance has significantly increased, in particular in regard to the work-from-home initiatives that have become the global adoption in the working place <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Palumbo, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Irawanto et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Putri and Amran, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kotini-Shah et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Job satisfaction is a term that has been around for a while. It is a pleasant emotional state emerges from a worker's enjoyment of their employment. According to Meier and Spector earners, single parent households, or women/men with senior care responsibilities are encouraged to offer these flexibilities. By adopting to this new arrangement, flexible working arrangement helps in easing transportation congestion, lowering pollution, and encouraging a better balance between work and family life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Flexible Hours</head><p>Flexible hours, also known as flextime or a flexible work schedule, refers to when the workday starts and ends at times other than the traditional ones. The version with the most individual flexibility is some variation of "trust hours," in which the employee has complete control over working hours if performance goals are achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Costa et al., 2004)</ref>. Follow the convention, when other factors are controlled, involvement in flexible hours is associated with decreased levels of work pressure, but it has no significant influence on work-life conflict. Meantime, if the employee spends more time at home with his or her children, he or she will be more driven <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahmad et al., 2013)</ref>. The flexible hours are a useful tool offered to employees as it would improve job satisfaction since they enable them to offer their best service during working hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work Shifts</head><p>Work shift consists of the first shift, second shift, and third shift, respectively. These job shifts could all be referred to as morning, afternoon, or night shifts. Workers in occupations that require services at all hours, such as protective service and food service, as well as operators, fabricators, and laborer, were more likely to work alternate shifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Pulce, 2004)</ref>. Working in shifts allows individuals to get more hours in a day by combining multiple shifts; for example, 3 blocks of 8 hours, 2 blocks of 8 hours, 2 blocks of 12 hours, or some other variation. Another advantage of shiftwork is that it can give 24-hour coverage. Moreover, the employees tend to work harder to reach their aims for the organization's success when they are less burdened and stressed because of work shift flexibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Telecommuting/Working from Home</head><p>Telecommuting/ remote work is growing in popularity, especially in developing nations.</p><p>Policymakers have long stressed the potential benefits of telecommuting for reducing the number of commuters who drive alone, enhancing rush-hour driving conditions, giving employees flexibility, and cutting operating expenses for businesses. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tredup (2016)</ref>, telecommuting can help employees attain a better work-life balance, boost productivity, and create a positive work environment at work. Most of the organization was forced to adopt the telecommuting culture due to the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition to the obvious advantages of this type of work, telecommuting now has the additional advantage of preventing the COVID-19 epidemic while maintaining a reasonable level of economic activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Magnavita et al., 2021)</ref>. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Onyeukwu et al. (2020)</ref> also agrees that remote working is important to prevent the COVID-19 infection widespread in Nigerian universities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work-life balance</head><p>Work-life balance became a research topic when workstation dynamics began to shift because of economic insecurity, resulting in a fight for survival within the business. A person cannot appreciate the life they have worked so hard to establish if they do not strike a work-life balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Meenakshi, 2013)</ref>. Work-life balance refers to how much control one has over the amount of time they dedicate to their jobs compared to their spare time. Most definitions of work-life balance are situational, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Reiter (2007)</ref>, and the concept of work-life balance is subjective. Today, there is a large and expanding amount of study on work-life balance, and more flexible ways of managing work (e.g., agile working, smart working, activity-based working, and flexible working) are causing even more concern than in the past. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Gragnano et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection and Sampling Method</head><p>A total of 142 employees from different corporation in Malaysia had participated the survey from 25 th June to 13th July 2022. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Boomsma (1985)</ref>, an absolute minimum sample size should be 100. Since 142 sample subjects were used in this investigation, the data acquired from them is somewhat larger than the minimum sample size predicted. This study will use convenience sampling method which is one of the non-probability sampling methods because the targeting samples are the employees in Malaysia regardless of their job scope. Convenience sampling has been used because the target group consists of those who meet certain practical criteria, such as ease of accessible, geographic location, availability at a specific time, or willingness to participate.</p><p>In this study, we are keen to investigate potential factors for job satisfaction through the landscape of flexible working arrangement and work-life balance, thus we present the two hypotheses that may affect the job satisfaction of Malaysian employee in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, with the accompanied hypothesized model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In term of flexible working arrangement, flexible hours, work shifts and telecommuting/working from home has a significant effect on employee's job satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 2</head><p>The work-life balance has a significant effect on employee's job satisfaction. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factor Analysis</head><p>The factor analysis is the prior to assess the structural model which will be employed to examine the convergent and discriminant validity of the factors that include in the model.</p><p>Besides, factor analysis is also used to evaluate the fitness of measurement in the model with using several indices, such as Chi-Square, Goodness-of-Fit Index (GFI), Adjusted Goodness-of-Fit Index (AGFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) and many more <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lee and Choi, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Equation Modeling Analysis</head><p>On the other hand, the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis was used to test the hypothesized structural model. The flexible work arrangements and job satisfaction are significantly moderated by work-life balance. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> presents the selective code for all variables involved in this study. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Result and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internal Reliability Test</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> showed 34 items that included in the questionnaire of the study was accepted because the Cronbach's Alpha value was 0.964 that greater than 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ghazali, 2016)</ref>. Exploratory Factor Analysis KMO = 0.927 and the p-value of Bartlett's test was very small at 0.000, which represented the data was accepted for factor analysis because this matrix was not identity. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Krishnan (2010)</ref>, the KMO which is 0.8 and above was meritorious and marvellous, also the p-value should less than 0.05, therefore the factor analysis was appropriate to conduct for this study. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal varimax rotation being applied in this factor analysis, since it was the most common method used by researchers. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> showed five factors were retained because the eigenvalue was greater than one and the cumulative variance was 74.01% <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Izquierdo et al., 2014)</ref>. The scree plot was shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, with the eigenvalue on the vertical axis and the components on the horizontal axis. The first five components displayed the values from the table above. While the eigenvalues of the other factors were nearly flat until the last component, the eigenvalue of the last factor was decreasing, this indicated the subsequent factors were considered for a fewer amount of total variance explained. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>, five factors that were obtained from the factor rotation based on the factor loading. The factor loading in convention should be greater 0.6 to ensure the factor will be reliable for the next analysis. As a result, the cut point of 0.6 is used to choose the factor item.</p><p>In Factor 1 there were 7 items that comprised the factor loading range between 0.759 to 0.853. Furthermore, for Factor 2, the factor loadings were between 0.623 to 0.805 with 7 items. In addition, Factor 3 comprised 6 items and the factor loading range between 0. 600 and 0. 844. Factor 4 is made up of 5 elements with factor loadings ranging from 0.653 to 0.738. In addition, Factor 5 comprised 4 items and the factor loading range between 0.608 and 0.649. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref> showed the value of Cronbach's Alpha for each factor was reliable. The Cronbach's Alpha for flexible hours is 0. 894, work shift is 0. 946, for telecommuting/work from home is 0.911, work-life balance is 0.901 and job satisfaction is 0.935. Since all values of Cronbach's Alpha were greater than 0.7 which indicated the items, and the factors were accepted and reliable <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ghazali, 2016)</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>The study found that both objective of the study had been achieved where two hypotheses of the study were supported and all factors were positively correlated with the job satisfaction, also all factors had a significant impact on the satisfaction towards job. This study composed 2 set of hypotheses. Our hypothesis was supported by all of the findings and discussions of the results. Therefore, to improve the job satisfaction of employees, the employer was suggested to improve on flexible working arrangement and on employees' work life balance. But the limitations of the study suggested the future study to increase the sample size as well as other influential factors and to apply other methods to make a comparison between different methods. Last but not least, the findings of the study contributed to the employers in Malaysia as a guide for the requirement to increase job satisfaction among the employees.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Hypothesized model</figDesc><graphic coords="4,113.18,516.93,368.90,138.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
