<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study intended to establish the best-fit structural model of job engagement of police personnel in Region 11. The exogenous variables are political skills, resilience at work, and public service motivation, while the endogenous variable is job engagement. Through quota sampling,400 police personnel from Region XI responded to the survey. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), Mean, Pearson r, and Multiple Regression were used to analyze the data. Results showed that besides respondents' very high political skills, resilience at work, public service motivation, and job performance, a significant relationship exists among between these variables. The multiple regression analysis revealed that the influence of political skills, resilience at work, and public service motivation on job engagement was 67.8%. Only Model 5 met all goodness of fit indices among the five generated models. Further analysis of the model bared that all indicators of the exogenous variables included at the beginning of the study are predictors of job performance. These manifest variables for political skills are networking ability, social astuteness, interpersonal influence, and apparent sincerity. For resilience at work, the manifest variables include living authentically, finding a calling, maintaining perspective, managing stress, building social connections, and staying healthy. For public service motivation, themanifest variables are self-sacrifice, attraction to policymaking, and compassion. On the other hand, the manifest variables for job engagement are cognitive, emotional, and physical. The results have implications for policing in the Philippines.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Rationale</head><p>Scenarios depicting the low job engagement of police personnel in the country have been frequent news. The Philippine Daily Inquirer made headlines for firing two ranking police officials for their poor output in solving crime and battling illegal drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cabalza, 2018)</ref>. The worst scenes were the town police chiefs' relief in the Mimaropa region for low performance in anti-illegal drugs operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cabato, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Job engagement is essential for its impact on productivity, involving apositive state of mind and a readiness to apply to work (Sun&amp; Bunchapattanasakda, 2019). In addition, engaged employees have high public service motivation, producing positive work-related outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Antony, 2018)</ref>.Besides these, job engagement positively affects performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Ismail, Iqbal, &amp; Nasr, 2019</ref>).</p><p>In the same vein, studies have shown a significant relationship between political skill and job engagement andthat political skill can ease job stress and promote job engagement and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bostanci, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Kim, Karatepe, &amp; Chung, 2019)</ref>. Moreover, as a political skill, networking ability can increase employee promotability <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Huang, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Further, on one hand, research has found a significant correlation between resilience at work and job engagement, whether at an individual or group level, even predicting job engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Cao &amp; Chen, 2020</ref>; Cooke Cooper, Bartram, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wang, &amp; Mei, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">McEwen &amp; Boyd, 2018)</ref>. However, on the other hand, a positive and significant relationship exists between public service motivation and job performance, suggesting a selection of applicants with high levels of public service motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Borst, Kruyen, &amp; Lako, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>There may be extensivestudieson political skills, work resilience, public service motivation, and job performance. Unfortunately, the researcher had difficulty finding a survey of the relationship of these variables in a single research article; more so, a model on job engagement using these three independent variables in this study. Thus, there is a research gap concerning the best-fit model of job engagement, especially with the police personnel as the sample population. Therefore, finding a model for job engagement for police personnel is vital for job crafting by the Philippine National Police.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Research Objectives</head><p>This study intendedto identify the best fit model for job engagement of police personnel in Region XI. Towards this end, the research set the following specific objectives: 1. To describe the political skill of the police personnel in Region XI in terms of:</p><p>1 Networking abilityis the capacity to converse and exchange ideas and information with individuals and groups, especially those with similar interests. Individuals with this ability are experts at identifying and developing diverse contacts and people networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Forret, 2018)</ref>. People in these networks tend to hold valuable assets necessary for successful personal and organizational gains. Also, their typically subtle stylequickly establishes friendships and builds solid and beneficial alliances and coalitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bhattarai, 2022</ref>; Shah, Yasir, Majid, &amp; Javed, 2019). Furthermore, individuals with high networking abilities positioned themselves and created opportunities to their advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abushinov, 2021</ref>; Adomako, Danso, Boso, &amp; Narteh, 2018; Lee, Yun, &amp; <ref type="bibr">Kim, 2019)</ref>.These individuals are highly skilled negotiators and deal makers proficient in conflict management who become a network of contacts that can help augment shared interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Englund, &amp; Bucero, 2019</ref>; Schermerhorn Jr, Bachrach, &amp; Wright, 2020). In policing, networks happen within a class. For example, police personnelforma network with barangay officials. This move is vital in sharing ideas about dealing with people and other essential ideas that would help them to discharge duties effectively. Without networking ability, police personnel may encounter difficulties in their job and eventually face failure. Hassan, Prussia, Mahsud, and Yukl (2018) clarified that networking ability depends on other factors, such as external monitoring and representation, to become influential and succeed in their career. Significantly, networking ability will help police officers and members thrive in their workplaces, even in challenges (Cullen, Gerbasi, &amp; Chrobot-Mason, 2018; Saunders, Kotzias, &amp; Ramchand, 2019).</p><p>Incidentally, belonging to a networking group is necessary. Networking of police officers has advantages like improved leadership techniques and communication structures, strengthened connectedness and mutual support, owing to the innovations shared by networks (Castillo De Mesa, Gómez Jacinto, López Peláez, &amp; Palma García, 2019; Lewis, Ricard, &amp; Klijn, 2018; <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Marenin, 2018)</ref>. Moreover, in this era of social media reign, police personnel, government leaders, people in business, teachers, and students belong to a network where they share information about their subjects of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Chanana, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Habibi, Mukminin, Riyanto, et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Interpersonal influence. Politically skilled individuals are unassuming and convincing and exert a powerful impacton people around them <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Schütte, Blickle, Frieder, et al., 2018)</ref>. Politically experienced people tend to influence others by adapting and attuning their behavior to different situations and eliciting their desired outcomes. They exhibit great flexibility in adjusting their behavior to varying targets of influence in different contextual settings to achieve one's goals (Deng, Guan, Wu, Erdogan, Bauer, &amp; Yao, 2018; <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">Veilleux, Pollert, Skinner, et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Interpersonal influence can build a good rapport between the police and community members. People look up to the police as persons they can trust for their safety. So, they want to be near the police all the time so that they can have better engagements <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bostanci, 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Wang and Hall (2019)</ref> claimed that people with solid interpersonal influence enjoy a better social life because society accepts them. Expressed differently, police personnel who establish excellent interpersonal power with the people in the community are socially accepted and enjoy a good social standing in their community. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Deng et al. (2018)</ref> echoed that individuals with solid interpersonal influence gain social acceptance. Moreover, persons with good interpersonal influence have better performance outcomes that satisfy stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Schütte, Blickle, Frieder, et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Social astuteness. People with this political skill are smart in observing other people. They can accurately interpret others' behaviors and understand social interactions well. They have high self-awareness andconcurwith diverse social settings, evaluating impressions and value enhancement <ref type="bibr">(Bhattarai,</ref>  Similarly, police personnel should have social astuteness because this provides an excellent link between leadership and public value that fosters powerful coalitions and alliances even around diverse and competing interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alramdhan, &amp; Sattar, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Hartley, Sancino, Bennister, &amp; Resodihardjo, 2019)</ref>. Charismatic people exemplify this political skill <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Brouer, Chiu, &amp; Wang, 2016)</ref>. Moreover, policing would be difficult without social astuteness because they could not effectively carry out their policing jobs. On the contrary, social astuteness mitigates destructive behavior and facilitates positive and very high satisfaction ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Kwon, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Xu, Chiu, &amp; Treadway, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Police officers that are socially astute always look after people and keep them safe. This behavior can work to their advantage because people will learn to trust them, resulting in a peaceful environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Seitz &amp; Misra, 2020</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Wang &amp; Hall, 2019)</ref>.In addition, socially astute individuals can discern people's behavior and social exchanges, which is essential in police work as it develops trust among the people (Hartley &amp; Manzie, 2020; Uppal, 2021).</p><p>Apparent sincerity. Politically skilled individualspossess high levels of integrity and appear authentic, sincere, and genuine. They seem honest and forthright. Apparent sincerity is crucial in influencing others and winning their side (Guo, Liu, &amp; Yain, 2020; Ma, Wu, Jiang, &amp; Wei, 2019).The perception of other people about the other's sincerity can modify the behavior of others towards the person <ref type="bibr">(Wihler, Frieder, &amp; Blickle, 2018)</ref>. It was noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Guo et al. (2020)</ref> noted that influencing attempts would be successful when people perceive actors as having no ulterior motives. Individuals high in apparent sincerity can inspire trust and confidence in people because their actions are not manipulative or coercive(Wang, Luo, Zhang, &amp; Guo, 2019; <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Wihler et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, others misunderstood apparent sincerity as fake sincerity because of the word "apparent." However, people will notice sincerity in words and actions. People hear sincerity even in voices <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barkacs, 2021)</ref>.Furthermore, research proved that apparent sincerity could enhance interpersonal relationships between people (Maher, Ejaz, Nguyen, &amp; Ferris, 2021). In addition, apparent sincerity can give the impression of genuine care and support, releasing any forms of pressure that the rule of man has generated, thus promoting understanding, respect, and trust <ref type="bibr">(</ref> To rephrase, leaders should convey their apparent sincerity through genuine service to influence others to trust them, mainly because people are good at differentiating authentic actions from pretenses (Barkacs, 2021; Kranefeld, Blickle, &amp; Meurs, 2020; Wee, Ahmad, Sadik, Abd Razak, &amp; Marmaya, 2019).Therefore, police personnel must be careful in interacting with the community to earn their trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Ma et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The literature on political skills taught the researcher that its four dimensions are related yet remain distinct constructs.In addition,the literature pointed to the fact that political skill is a set of long-established social competencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Blickle, Frieder, &amp; Ferris, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ferris, Berkson, Kaplan, et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Mintzberg, 1983)</ref>. Significantly, the readings taught that political skill is crucial for police personnelbecause it can give them the ability to understand their coworkers effectively,given the nature of their job. With such understanding, they could encourage others to act towards achieving personal and organizational objectives. In addition, the literature on political skills gives ample information about work-related competencies. Finally, it conveys that people can attain political skills through experience, training, and practice. The insinuation is that individuals benefit from experiences that cultivate political skills, regardless of inherent political capabilities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Resilience at Work</head><p>Resilience refers to an individual's emotional endurance, characterized by a person's courage, adaptability, persistence, and perseverance in the wake of crisis and life's misfortunes <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Taormina, 2015)</ref>. With determination and stability, the individual can adapt to calamity, strain, suffering, and significant life stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Malik &amp; Garg, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Platania, Castellano, Petralia, et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Incidentally, resilience can shield a person from mental illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Etilé, Frijters, Johnston, &amp; Shields, 2021)</ref>.A resilient individual has self-esteem, believes in his self-efficacy, and possesses problem-solving skills. Resilience is adapting well in times of crisis, hardships, trauma, tragedy, and even significant sources of threat. These researchers abstracted resilience as the individual's relative susceptibility to the maladaptive effects of their environment <ref type="bibr">(Etilé et</ref>  Consequently, in today's world, transformations escalate and continuously occur due to global competition, technological revolutions, organizational restructuring, and contemporary organizations. Nevertheless, these transformations opened employees' vulnerabilities to stressful work environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Malik &amp; Garg, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Malik &amp; Garg, 2020)</ref>. Thus, the development of resilience becomes essential to support employees working in an arduous environment. This resilience would help them to adapt to challenging situations effectively. Scholars and organizational practitioners view resilience as the new criterion for professional advancement, given its characteristics of adaptability, flexibility, and strength of purpose (Cooper, Brown, Rees, &amp; Leslie, 2020; Linnenluecke, 2017; Malik &amp; Garg, 2020).</p><p>Therefore, in the present era of economic uncertainty and intense competitiveness, organizations that instill resilience among their employees will have a strong advantage. However, resilience in the workplace context is still a relatively unexplored phenomenon.Nevertheless, researchers have affirmed the significance of resilience and reported its vital role in fostering employees' well-being and performance (Kim, 2020; Lee, Yahiaoui, Lee, &amp; Cooke, 2022; Ukhova, 2020). Also, over time, resilience studies resulted in many operational definitions, but mostly, resilience is bouncing back from adversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Malik et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Platania et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Taormina, 2015)</ref>. Significantly, researchers have observed a shift from the dispositional view of resilience,suggesting that individuals can develop the dynamic process of resiliencethrough thoughtful interaction with the external environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Sharma &amp; Sharma, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Srivastava, 2020)</ref>.Furthermore, developing resilience is significant since it submits that rather than being a genetic trait, resilience is an adaptable epiphenomenon that employees can develop through appropriate training <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Hollis, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Lee, Choi, &amp; Kwon, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In other words, once an individual develops resilience, he can have the capability of bouncing back from adversity, conflict, and failure. In sustaining resilience, the individual has to maintain a discourse and interaction. Resilience is seen as dynamic, integrated, unfolding over time and through events, evolving patterns, and dependent on contingency. In this study, resilience at work denotes living authentically, finding a calling, maintaining perspective, managing stress, building social connections, and staying healthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Malik &amp; Garg, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Living authentically pertains to employees' work attitudes and behaviors consistent with their values rather than other peoples' expectations (Chen &amp; Murphy, 2019;Gino, Sezer, &amp; Huang, 2020; Song, Wang, &amp; Zhao, 2021).In addition, authentic living significantly predicts hedonic and eudaimonic well-being (Yu, Li, &amp; Xiao, 2020). The implication is that only by authentic living can a person live the good life, expressing himself and experiencing vitality, self-actualization, and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bernecker &amp; Becker, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Niemiec, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sutton2020)</ref>. Authentic living leads to happiness. However, research shows that to attain a happy life, a person has to exercise self-control because living at the extremes may overturn the tables (Bernecker &amp;Bernecker, 2021; Van den Bosch, Taris, Schaufeli, Peeters, &amp; Reijseger, 2019). As employees of the Philippine National Police (PNP), police personnel must always exercise self-control, primarily because their job requires them to do so. Policing is not an easy job. The police personnel is often in situations that test their patience and resilience. Without self-control, their lot may end in catastrophe leading to an unhappy life as others had before them. Therefore, self-control is fundamental to self-regulation (Converse, Juarez, &amp; Hennecke, 2019; Sosik, Chun, Ete, Arenas, &amp; Scherer, 2019).</p><p>Finding a calling means pursuing a passion or a vocation, which brings more profound organizational commitment, thus reducing aberrant behaviors and the intention to leave (Afsar, Umrani, &amp; Khan, 2019). When individuals find their calling, persistence drives them to such, and they are unstoppable <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cavanaugh, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">Yeung, 2021)</ref>. Those still looking for their "calling" ventured fearlessly into the unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Jaiswal, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Research shows that living a calling would not happen unless an individual experiences a personenvironment fit, career commitment, and has a sense of the meaning of their work (Duffy, Douglass, Gensmer, England, &amp; <ref type="bibr">Kim, 2019)</ref>. This statement is true with police personnel. For example, a study on a law enforcement agency in the Midwest United States found the importance of calling as an antecedent to policing. Police personnel with a higher sense of calling displayed more job satisfaction and contentment with their career (Chen, May, Schwoerer, &amp; Augelli, 2018).</p><p>Maintaining perspective is the third indicator of resilience at work. Incidentally, different workspaces offer varied perspectives. For instance, employees may have different views about work stress even though it is a daily experience. For example, in police work, the stress level is very high. However, police personnel saw it as a standard expectation because of the nature of their work: maintaining peace and order and fighting criminals. Police stress is extreme in some parts of the world (Humayon, Raza, Amir, et a.l, 2018), which leads to suicide and other negative results (Gomes, de Araújo, &amp; Gomes, 2018; Queirós, Passos, Bártolo, et al., 2020).</p><p>Nevertheless, maintaining a proper perspective about the job can help with its negative aspects. For example, understanding police interaction processes and applying other scientific methods to reduce workrelated stress and improve policing are good perspectives for better job appreciation <ref type="bibr">(Rantatalo &amp; Karp,2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Willis &amp; Mastrofski, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Wolter, Santa Maria, Georg, et al., 2021)</ref> Managing stress is an essential indicator of resilience at work. Research shows a very high-stress level among law enforcement personnel considering the nature of their work <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Humayon et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Gomes et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Queiros et al., 2020)</ref>, especially in complex sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Marois, Cloutier, Saunier, et al., 2019)</ref>. There have been several studies on stress so that individuals and organizations may find ways to manage stress effectively. For example, police officers in Poland have some methods of managing their stress, like communicating with their families, surfing the internet, and watching TV. They find these methods effective in combating workplace stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Cieślak, Kielan, Olejniczak, et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In Southeast Nigeria, staff of the Nigeria Police Force resorted to Rational Emotive Occupational Health Coaching (REOHC) to manage work-related stress and found the REOHC program a practical approach for managing this phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Onyishi, Ede, Ossai, et al., 2021)</ref>. Moreover, some police officers are experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. Some stressors reported include culture, organizational change, leadership, working hours, and workloads. To manage these stressors, they promote counseling, training, and changes in the workplace to address and mitigate mental health issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Demou, Hale, &amp; Hunt, 2020)</ref>. In others, they resort to spirituality-introspection, meditation, and meaningful work in shielding against stress and other stress-related illnesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">(Subhashini, 2018)</ref>, while the Philippine National Police opt for relaxation techniques and social support to manage stress at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Gutierrez, Ilagan, Curtis, et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Building social connections is vital for cultivating resilience at work. Social relationships nowadays are quickly happening because of technology and social media exposure. Whether technology brings people closer or apart, the truth is that technology is fundamental to the coming together of society, whether resulting in positive or negative impacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Brey, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Karintseva, Melnyk, Kubatko, et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>However, research also shows that building social connections is crucial because they nurture personal relationships and establish rapport and social engagements. Individuals belonging to the same group become highly connected social partners (Kulahci &amp; Quinn, 2019; Waycott, Vetere, &amp; Ozanne, 2019).</p><p>Staying healthy is a fundamental requirement for life's enjoyment. Health is a person's most incredible wealth <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Fletcher, Parker, Smith, &amp; Robinson, 2020)</ref>. Moreover, a healthy lifestyle can prevent health deterioration even in old age (le May &amp; Elbourne, 2019). For police personnel to stay healthy, it is not only an individual decision but requires health-oriented leadership (HoL). Research shows that HoL directly impacts the physical and mental health of police personnel, promoting their well-being (Santa Maria, Wolter, Gusy, et al., 2019).</p><p>Incidentally, police officers' job characteristics are unique, jeopardizing their health and well-being. Thus, proactive planning is necessary to promote police well-being and satisfaction with the system (Van Thielen, Bauwens, Audenaert, et al., 2018). In addition, job characteristics, demands, and resources often pose emotional pressure and mental strain in police work. So, providing enough resources for police work can improve police stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">(Wolter, Santa Maria, Wörfel, et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The literature on resilience at work offered the research ample knowledge on the strategies for staying resilient at work. Employees face different challenging situations and stressors in the workplace, and the spirit of resilience is an effective mechanism for remaining intense and focused. The literature on resilience at work points to living authentically, finding a calling, maintaining perspective, managing stress, building social connections, and staying healthy are practical tools to carry in the workplace.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Public Service Motivation</head><p>Scholars and practitioners in public administration have widely studied public service motivation (PSM). PSM is the desire to contribute to society's well-being. Research findings revealed that police officers with a higher level of public service motivation have higher levels of job satisfaction, mediated by person-job and person-organization fits <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Prysmakova &amp; Vandenabeele, 2020)</ref>.Besides this, PSM intervenes in the relationship between leadership behaviors and taking-charge behavior among police officers <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Homberg, Vogel, &amp; Weiherl, 2019)</ref>. Moreover, researchers investigate public service motivation to decipher the intents and motivations of people joining the public sector and improve public servants' expected performance in delivering public services <ref type="bibr">(Breaugh,</ref>  While delving into public service motivation, it is important to discuss its indicators: self-sacrifice, attraction to policymaking, and compassion <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Gan &amp; Wang, 2013)</ref>. These three indicators came from the original work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Perry (1996)</ref> that <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Gan and Wang (2013)</ref> have shortened from 24 items to 14 items to investigate the Chinese civil servants in Kunming City.</p><p>Self-sacrifice is giving up something for the welfare of others. Consequently, all living things embody a virtue of self-sacrifice <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bélanger, Schumpe, Menon, et al., 2018)</ref>. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has seen the self-sacrifice of health care professionals, the military, and the police. Moreover, policing is a vocation that entails self-sacrifice for the good of the entire community. Police officers are ready to lay down their lives for others to live peacefully, as they are watchdogs for peace and order in the community <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Javdani, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Van Ackeren &amp; Archer, 2018)</ref>. Nevertheless, even with the selfsacrificial nature of police work, the demands of their work may lead to exhaustion, stress, and burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Humayon, Raza, Amir, et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Murad, Jiatong, Shahzad, et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Nevels, Burch, Wirth, et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Attraction to policymaking. It is the forceful motive of individuals to join the police force. However, studies show that appeal to policymaking restrains the correlation between fairness and outcomes. Therefore, it significantly impacts those with little attraction to policymaking (Jensen, Kjeldsen, &amp; Vestergaard, 2020; Quratulain, Khan, &amp; Sabharwal, 2019). Policy changes can also affect the motivation of government employees toward public service. For example, the personality, gender, educational background, and previous jobof police officers can influence attraction to policymaking (Piatak, Douglas, &amp; Raudla, 2020; Van Witteloostuijn, Esteve, &amp; Boyne, 2017). In other words, employees could have different takes on policy changes. For example, those with a person-organization fit may welcome policy changes, but others may not. In another study, job attributes, such as the nature of work and the institution's type, whether government or non-profit organization, influence employees' dimensions of public service motivation.</p><p>Compassion means to suffer together. Compassionate people go out to help others in need and find satisfaction.There are studies about police compassion coupled witheither burnout, compassion fatigue,or compassion satisfaction(Grant, Lavery, &amp; Decarlo, 2019; Papazoglou, Koskelainen, &amp; Stuewe, 2018; Stancel, Russo, Koskelainen, et al., 2019). Burnout and compassion fatigue have a positive correlation, while compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction have a negative relationship. Interestingly, one study in North America reported police officers' compassion satisfaction rate at 38% and compassion fatigue at 23% <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Andersen, Papazoglou, &amp; Collins, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>People expect police officers to be solid and sharp due to their work's nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Courpasson &amp; Monties, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Todak, 2017)</ref>.However, frequent exposure to stress results in compassion fatigue that weakens their physical, mental, and emotional well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Burnett, Sheard, &amp; St Clair-Thompson, 2020)</ref>. Policing has very demanding roles, causing adverse effects over time. Hence, police agencies must introduce effective coping measures for their personnel's welfare <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Papazoglou, Marans, Keesee, et al., 2020)</ref>. This literature review on PSM exposed the realities and challenges of police work. Police personnel are human beings that join law enforcement with personal motives.Some joined the force because of job security, better pay, and career advancement opportunities, to mention a few. Regrettably, there is no more stable employer than the government. Others join public service because of public service motivation, indicating self-sacrifice, compassion, attraction to policymaking, and commitment to the public interest. The listcan be lengthy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H. Job Engagement</head><p>Job engagement is a person's enthusiasm for doing the job. It is a catalyst for growth both by the employee and the company <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Jaharuddin &amp; Zainol, 2019)</ref>.Brunetto, Farr-Wharton, B., Farr-Wharton, R., Shacklock, Azzopardi, Saccon, and Shriberg (2020) found the influence of job engagement on police productivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Yin (2018)</ref> observed that employees who are enthusiastic about their job perform better and find it fulfilling. However, job engagement does not happen without some dimensions to it. For instance, dimensions are organization-based self-esteem and satisfaction with life (Toth, Heinänen, &amp; Nisula, 2020), task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Basit, 2019)</ref>, and employee profile and job characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Eldor &amp; Harpaz, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Gillet, Morin, Jeoffrion, et al., 2020)</ref>. This study's job engagement dimensions are cognitive engagement, emotional engagement, and physical engagement dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Kuok &amp; Taormina, 2017)</ref>. Consequently, supervisors' negative emotions can result in negative and positive employee behaviors. Although supervisors' negative emotions can lead to high cognitive work engagement levels, the downside is a family decline (Chan, Kalliath, &amp; Cheng, 2020), which may lead to turnover intention. Thus managers must take measures to improve relationships in the workplace through teamwork or empower them to work independently <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Gupta &amp; Shaheen, 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive Work</head><p>Research shows that justice and support of supervisors positively affect the work engagement of police officers (Piotrowski, Rawat, &amp; Boe, 2021), implying the need to maintain harmonious employer-employee and supervisor-employee relationships in general.</p><p>Emotional Work Engagement involves workers' positive emotional attachment to tasks and activities, such as pride, enthusiasm, and excitement toward task completion <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Kuok &amp; Taormina, 2017)</ref>.Emotional work engagement reduces counterproductive behavior for conscientious and emotionally stable employees, although it can negatively influence emotionally unstable employees (Chen, Richard, Boncoeur, &amp; Ford Jr, 2020). Indeed, emotional work engagement does not always produce a positive vibe, as emotional labor may result in stress and burnout, police personnel or not <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Jeung, Kim, &amp; Chang, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, understanding the negative aspect of emotional engagement and identifying its antecedents is essential to prevent counterproductive behaviors. Precursors includea lack of administrative support and justice <ref type="bibr">(</ref> Physical Work Engagement is bodily participation in any kind of occupation. Although people exert varying physical efforts to complete their tasks, they spend enormous energy. Physical work engagement accounts for the energy consumed at work and the intensity and frequency of its use <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Kuok &amp; Taormina, 2017)</ref>. Physical engagement at work does not confine to activities directly affecting the tasks. There are other tasks indirectly associated with it. For example, workplace exercise at least once or twice a week could help employees achieve vigor that can bolster their physical work engagement (Jindo, Kai, Kitano, Tsunoda, Nagamatsu, &amp; Arao, 2020).</p><p>Similarly, physical work engagement is vital for task completion in any workplace setup. However, physical activities are crucial to improving mental well-being and productivity. Productivity does not only materialize with physical work engagement per se. It involves other physical activities to improve brainwork. For example, the research found that sitting most of the time lessens mental well-being. However, physical activities can improve employees' mental well-being and productivity (Grimani, Aboagye, &amp; Kwak, 2019; Puig-Ribera, Martínez-Lemos, <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Giné-Garriga, et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The literature on job engagement provided the research with much-needed arguments for this study. The literature cited the importance of cognitive work engagement (e.g.,prudent judgment), emotional work engagement (e.g., enthusiasm and emotional work attachments), and physical work engagement (e.g., physical efforts, like exercise) to achieve work productivity and optimum job performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Correlation between Measures</head><p>Studies have shown a significant relationship between political skills and work engagement. Recently, Bostanci (2020) found a moderate, positive, and meaningful relationship between the dimensions of political skill: social astuteness, interpersonal influence skill, networking ability, apparent sincerity, and the level of work engagement. Philip (2021) also found that political skill strengthened the relationship between proactive personality and work engagement. Moreover, Basit (2020) found a good impact of political skills on job performance. Another study found the influence of political skills in mitigating job dissatisfaction, encouraging employees to engage more in their jobs to achieve better work outcomes (De Clercq, Haq, Azeem, &amp; Ahmad, 2019).</p><p>On the other hand, Cooke, Cooper, Bartram, Wang, and Mei (2019) found a significant relationship between resilience at work and work engagement. Cao and Chen (2020) stressed a direct, positive, and meaningful relationship between resilience and work engagement. Moreover, they found that resilience is a predictor of work engagement. Malik and Grag (2020) also claimed that employee resilience could build a highly engaged workforce, which suggests the influencing factor of resilience at work on work engagement.</p><p>Additionally, there is a positive correlation between resilience at work and job performance (Kašpárková, Vaculík, Procházka, &amp; Schaufeli, 2018). Both individual and team resilience at work influence job performance to an optimum level <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(McEwen &amp; Boyd, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Likewise, Borst, Kruyen, &amp; Lako's (2019) study discovered a positive and significant correlation between public service motivation and work engagement. They also suggested selecting employees with high levels of public service motivation, implying that public service motivation is a predictor of work engagement. In addition,Mussagulova (2020) found that higher PSM strengthens the positive impact of some job resources on work engagement, highlighting the importance of PSM in work engagement as both an enhancer and a coping mechanism. In synthesis, the correlation between measures provided ample knowledge and background of the topics in this study. The literature also elucidated the connection between political skills, resilience at work, public service motivation, and job performance. Moreover, the literature proved that these variables significantly improve job performance. Overall, the writings of renowned scholars contributed to understanding the topics at hand, helped formulate the theoretical framework, and developed the questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>J. Theoretical Framework</head><p>Three theories became the foundation of this study because it discusses three topics that relate to each other. These are necessary ideas that serve as foundational anchors of this investigation. In this paper, the anchor theories are Signaling Theory <ref type="bibr">(Spence, 1978)</ref>, Resilience Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Garmezy, 1991)</ref>, and Moral Foundations Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Haidt, 2013)</ref>. These essential theories explain the ideas purported in this study. Additionally, these theories helped the researcher observe and analyze the data and describe the effects of the exogenous variables on the endogenous variable in the study.</p><p>The signaling theory (ST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Spence, 1974</ref>) is a centralconceptthat explains the relationship between political skills and job engagement. It assumes that an individual sends signals to others to transmit information about their abilities, intentions, and actions to influence observers' beliefs and reduce ambiguity. For example, consider how politically-skilled police personnel may signal their effective work performance and personal character by developing solid relationships with their peers and the community. The resilience theory (RT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Garmezy, 1991)</ref> argues that people face adversities, and how they deal with hardships, dangers, or misfortunes matters most. With this argument, resilience theory supports the signaling hypothesis. For instance, police work has many risks. So, police personnel receives signals about work hazards in their operations. These signals help police to recognize the problem signs and help them realize the problems and think of ways to deal with them effectively. In this stage comes resilience. Adversities test human resilience. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Ledesma (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Luthans (2002)</ref> stressed that resilience is the ability to bounce back from adversity, frustration, and misfortune. It is a stable trajectory of healthy functioning after a highly adverse event <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bonanno, 2021)</ref>. With the signals received by police personnel, their resilience becomes more intense because either they have bounced back from experience or learned from their colleagues' experiences in the field.</p><p>Finally, the Moral Foundation Theory (MFT)(Graham, Haidt, Koleva, Motyl, Iyer, Wojcik, &amp; Ditto, 2013; Haidt, 2013) supports the signaling and resilience theories as itidentifies the triggers for moral intuitions, especially for public service motivation. These triggers come from the six moral foundations: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, sanctity/degradation, and liberty/oppression. MFT postulates that moral judgment comes from automatic processes and intuitions than conscious reasoning. In other words, the person responds to something based on his moral footing, and the response becomes intuitive. The moral or ethical foundation theory locates the source of attention and beliefelicitation, which is the representation of a person's emotional state(such as the logic of appropriateness), and specific types of motivated behaviors(Fehr, Yam, &amp; Dang, 2015; Weaver, Reynolds, &amp; Brown, 2014). Thus, determining the location of motivation to serve the public. In context, the moral foundation theory identifies the location or roots of police personnel's public service motivation. Ethics sifts the signals they receive, whether positive or negative (care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, sanctity/degradation, and liberty/oppression), and appropriates the response. The response becomes automatic as they develop resilience from their experiences weld by time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>K. Conceptual Framework</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1</ref> is the conceptual model of the study illustrating the interrelationships of the exogenous variables and their direct causal relationship with job engagement. The exogenous variables in this study include political skills, resilience at work, and public service motivation. The endogenous variable is job engagement. </p></div>

For resilience at work, the indicators are authentic living, finding a calling, maintaining perspective, managing stress, building social connections, and staying healthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Malik &amp; Garg, 2018)</ref>. Finally, public service motivation involves self-sacrifice, attraction to policymaking, and compassion <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Perry, 1996)</ref>, while job engagement is cognitive, emotional, and physical <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Kuok &amp; Taormina, 2017)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1</ref> illustrates the interplay of these variables.</p><p>To understand these concepts, here is a brief definition for each.Networking ability means the skill of building relationships with influential people at work and using these connections to make things happen at work. Interpersonal experience refers to developinga good rapport and communicating effectively with others. Social astuteness refers to the skill of instinctively knowing the right things to say or do to influence others. Finally, apparent authority refers to the abilityto pay close attention to people's facial expressions and show genuine interest in others.</p><p>On the other hand, living authentically means that a person holds fast to his work values. Finding a calling refers to work that helps fulfill life's purpose. Maintaining perspective means that negativity and intimidation at work do not affect the person. Managing stress means that the person has developed reliable ways to relax under pressure at work. Building social connection refers to a person's robust and reliable network of supportive colleagues at work. Finally, staying healthy denotes having a good level of physical fitness and healthy eating habits.</p><p>Further, self-sacrifice signifies putting duty before self and making enormous sacrifices for the good of society. Attraction to policymaking denotes sharing views on public policies with others and involving oneself in public programs that benefit the community. Finally, compassion means feeling sympathetic for the plight of the underprivileged and making a difference in society.</p><p>Furthermore, cognitive work engagement suggests the mind's full engagement at work. Emotional work engagement denotes work enthusiasm and a sense of gratification with work performance. Finally, physical work engagement signifies a high level of energy and stamina for work while finding work physically stimulating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>L. Significance of the Study</head><p>The findings of this study may become a guiding principle and a model for human resource management in the public and private sectors. In general, employers may gain from this study as this can be a good source of information and data on factors inclined towards job engagement. In addition, the findings of this study may give employers and employees a mutual benefit that can redound to the organization's growth and employees' careers.</p><p>Remarkably, the Philippine National Police may benefit from this study because the findings may prompt the officials on the traits acceptable to the employees, which can result in an optimized job engagement. Also, this study may benefit the rest of the police personnel occupying the lower level position, and the non-commissioned officers can benefit from the findings of this study by challenging them to become good police officers motivated to serve and firmly committed. In the same vein, social researchers may find this study helpful as this may give new knowledge in the world of public administration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M. Definition of Terms</head><p>The operational definitions of terms are provided here to have a common understanding of these concepts.  Political Skills. In this study, political skills refer to the networking ability, interpersonal influence, social astuteness, and apparent sincerity of police personnel.  Resilience at Workrefers to the following indicatorsauthentic living, finding a calling, maintaining perspective, managing stress, building social connections, and staying healthy.  Public Service Motivation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHAPTER 2 METHOD</head><p>In this chapter is discussed the method used in this study, including the description of the research design, research locale, population and sample, research instrument, the process of collecting the data, statistical tools, and the ethical considerations observed in conducting this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Research Design</head><p>This study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze structural relationships between the observed and latent variables. SEM represents an analytical approach for evaluating a priori theory-driven data about causal relations among exogenous (measured) and endogenous (latent) variables. However, SEM is not a simple statistical technique because it conceptualizes models, identifies parameters and estimations, assesses model fits, and re-specifies models between correlation data (Gana &amp; Broc, 2019; Keith, 2019; <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Mueller &amp; Hancock, 2018)</ref>. Nevertheless, SEM is increasingly popular in Social Sciences, especially among academic researchers and those undergoing doctoral dissertations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Civelek, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Tarka, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a prevailing, multivariate method used in testing multivariate causal relationships, including the indirect and direct effects on pre-assumed causal relationships (Fan, Chen, Shirkey, John, Wu, Park, &amp; Shao, 2016; Grace, Scheiner, &amp; Schoolmaster Jr, 2015). For example, in this study, the use of SEM explained what determines the job engagement of the police personnel in Region XI. These entail causal models, a set of mathematical equations (also called structural equations), and a graph depicting the hypothesized causal structure. Usually, a causal analysis complements structural equation modeling, providing an evaluation of proposed hypotheses against available data. Also, regression analysis provides a foundation for the causal analysis of data <ref type="bibr">(</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Research Locale</head><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">2</ref>   On the other hand, Davao Oriental has two legislative districts, one city, ten municipalities, and 183 barangays. Moreover, Davao del Sur's capital city is Digos. As a result, Davao del Sur has only one congressional district, one city, nine municipalities, and 232 barangays. Davao City is within Davao del Sur but is independent of the province. Therefore, its inclusion in Davao del Sur is for geographic and statistical purposes only. There are three congressional districts in Davao City with 182 barangays. Davao Occidental, whose capital is the municipality of Malita, is the newest province in the Philippines. Republic Act 10360, signed by President Benigno Aquino III on January 14, 2013, created the province of Davao Occidental. It comprises one congressional district, five municipalities, and 105 barangays (PhilAtlas, 2022).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Population and Sample</head><p>Four hundred personnel comprised the sample of this study, chosen through quota sampling. Quota sampling has an advantage because, besides its easy process, it ensures that groups are not over-represented. Still, it achieves the best representation of respondents in the final sample because the survey reflects the whole population with the same characteristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Iliyasu &amp; Etikan, 2021)</ref>. For this study, the breakdown of respondents was as follows: Police Regional Office XI (PROXI) had 100 samples because it had the most police personnel. Davao City Police Office (DCPO) had 50, Davao del Sur ( <ref type="formula">50</ref> The researcher asked for the help of the provincial director in recruiting the respondents since the researcher could not directly approach the target respondent without getting permission form or passing through the top officials. Importantly, since the respondents' participation was voluntary, the respondents could withdraw their participation in the survey if they felt some discomfort for any reason while answering the questionnaire. Their withdrawal would not constitute any fine, penalty, or accountability, and this decision would be respected by the researcher. The researcher understood the importance of the respondents' free and informed decision; therefore, the participants could withdraw their participation anytime without fear of coercion or any charge in judicial or quasi-judicial bodies. The welfare of the respondents was always the primordial concern of the researcher.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Research Instrument</head><p>This study used four survey questionnaires: The political skills inventory, resilience at work scale, public service motivation, and work engagement scales. These instruments were adapted from standard questionnaires but modified to fit the study's goals. Moreover, the pilot testing of the independent variables yielded an alpha of .969 for political skills, .957 for resilience at work, and .952 for public service motivation. The dependent variable, job performance, yielded an alpha of .977.All Cronbach Alpha values were above .90, indicating an excellent internal consistency of the items.Below are the rating scales used to interpret the data derived from each questionnaire. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Data Collection</head><p>These were the steps followed in collecting the data for this study. First, the researcher secured an endorsement from the graduate school dean as an attachment to the letter to the police regional director. Second, the researcher sent a communication to the police provincial offices in the region (PROXI), Compostela Valley, Davao del Norte, Davao Oriental, Davao del Sur, Davao Occidental, Davao City, and the Regional Mobile Force Battalion informing them of the approval by the Police Regional Director to conduct the study. After receiving the communication, the researcher distributed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) to the respondents for their signature. Once the respondents signed the ICF, they received the questionnaires, which they accomplished for one week. Finally, the researcher arranged the retrieval of the questionnaires with the police provincial office. Encoding of responses and analysis of data followed immediately, then the interpretation of data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Statistical Tools</head><p>The analysis of data used these statistical tools:</p><p>Mean described the levels of political skills, resilience at work, public service motivation, and job engagement of the respondents.</p><p>Pearson r revealed the significance of the relationship between political skills, resilience at work, public service motivation, and job engagement.</p><p>Regression Analysis determined the functional relationships between two or more variables in this study so that a causal analysis (how one or more variables affect changes in another variable) could be possible.</p><p>The Structural Equation Model characterized a causal system with a set of variables in this study and a bunch of equations describing how each variable depends upon its immediate causal predecessors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical Considerations</head><p>This study applied several ethical safeguards based on the assessment points required by the university's ethics research committee.  Voluntary Participation. The researcher enlightened the respondents on the purpose and objectives of the study, including the nature of their participation. In this way, the target samples could give an informed decision regarding their involvement in the research. Although fortunately, no respondents dropped their participation in the middle of the survey. Through they were free to voluntary withdraw from the study at any time. Even if they had dropped, no penalties, threats, or intimidation would have been conveyed or applied to them.  Privacy and Confidentiality. Ethics dictates keeping the respondents' details private and confidential. In abiding by this rule, the researcher did not collect any information traceable to the respondents. Furthermore, the survey instrument had no names or identifiers of the respondents, and the data encoding involved codes in keeping the identity of the respondents. Besides, the data presented were aggregate and not individual, strengthening this research's claim of privacy and confidentiality.  Informed Consent. The researcher informed the respondents about the nature of their involvement and the purpose of the study. Then, they were required to sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF). Before signing, the researcher allowed the respondents to read the ICF's content and ask questions. The researcher also explained the ICF to the respondents to clarify the items. The signing of the ICF happened before accomplishing the survey forms.  Recruitment. The researcher wrote a letter to the Provincial Director. Then, he sent other letters to the provincial commanders conveying his intention of making their police precinct the study's locales. Fortunately, the regional commanders helped the researcher distribute and retrieve the survey questionnaires, as it was challenging to gather the police personnel due to their hectic schedules.  Risks.Nothing was incriminating in the study and never involved any dangers for the researcher and the police personnel. Aside from the observance of privacy and confidentiality, no item in the survey instrument was self-incriminating. Therefore, the respondents felt relaxed in accomplishing the questionnaire.  Benefits. The study would not yield a particular advantage for each police personnel but a generalized benefit for the entire organization, and the police personnel would enjoy indirect benefits. In other words, once the result of this study pinpoints the determinants of job engagement, the agency may use it in designing a doable framework for the job engagement of their personnel. In effect, the personnel may manifest a better job performance, yielding economic (financial) and social (status, work promotion) benefits.  Plagiarism. The researcher knows that plagiarism is a criminal offense. It is punishable by the Intellectual Property Code and the Cybercrime Prevention Act. The latter carries a penalty that is a degree higher than the former. To avoid plagiarism, the researcher ensured that authors whose works he cited in this study got credited through proper attribution in in-text citations and the list of references. Also, the Turnitin software helped avert the incidence of plagiarism by detecting the similarity index of his work with other sources of information.  Fabrication. Like plagiarism, the manufacture of research data is also severe misconduct. In this study, the researcher used only the data collected using the prescribed instrument of the study. Also, the researcher made conclusions and recommendations based on the study's findings.  Falsification. The researcher knows that falsifying research data is an offense comparable to data fabrication and plagiarism. These offenses are dealt with by law. Therefore, to prevent such crimes, the researcher upheld the integrity of the data by accurately collecting and presenting them. No manipulation of research materials, processes, changing or omitting data or results happened in this research. Also, to reiterate, this study used the APA format in attributing works in the list of references.  Conflict of Interest.The researcher has no conflict of interest with the study or the PNP agency.</p><p>Additionally, the researcher did not receive outside funding for this research-this paper intendedto satisfy a requirement for a post-graduate degree. Therefore, no external force can influence the researcher's judgment but based his conclusions solely on the analysis of the collected data.  Deceit. Honesty is the foremost requirement in research. Almost all of the assessment points in the ethical considerations point to honesty. This study is free from any forms of deceit, from the recruitment of respondents to the data collection and analysis. The researcher was honest in disclosing to the respondents the purpose of the study. Revealing the purpose of the study is the first step in upholding the integrity of research, which the researcher did before the actual conduct of the study to get the respondents' voluntary participation.</p><p> Permission from Organization/Location. Before starting the study, the researcher wrote a permission letter to the provincial director and each provincial police office. Then, the researcher waited for the approval of the letter before proceeding with data gathering.  Authorship. Regarding authorship, the researcher is the first author in this study, and the adviser is the second author. The same is true in the paper's publication; the adviser would also share the credit. Moreover, the researcher has appended his CV to the final manuscript.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Political Skills, Resilience at Work,Public Service Motivation, and Job Engagement of Police Personnel in Region 11</head><p>Shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">1</ref> is the data on political skills. The overall high mean score was 4.90, with a standard deviation of .36. The very high mean score suggests that the respondents always exhibited political skills. Subsequently, the 0.36 standard deviation signified the homogeneity of responses in each survey item, resulting in a small standard score of 0.36. This standard score conveys that the data falls within the normal curve, the expected data. In other words, the responses in the survey were the expected answers. When responses are varied, the standard score is more prominent, indicating the data dispersal away from the mean, meaning the answers given in the survey were not the expected (norm) responses. A standard score (Z-score) of 1.0 and above indicates one or two standard deviations away from the mean, revealing the variances in the answers. The bigger the Z-score, the farther it is away from the norm.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">1</ref> is shown that all mean scores were very high, and the standard scores are below 1.0, denoting uniformity of responses in the statements in the survey. For example, networking ability had a mean score of 4.89, with a 0.52 standard deviation. Interpersonal influence had 4.91, social astuteness had 4.87, and apparent sincerity had 4.92. They have standard scores of 0.70, 0.33, and 0.69, respectively. The appendices section of this paper displays all the specific data per table, with questions also.</p><p>The survey statements on networking ability are the following: spending a lot of time and effort at work networking with others, being good at building relationships with influential people at work, developing an extensive network of colleagues and associates at work for support, knowing many people at work, spending much time at work developing connections, and being good at using links and network to make things happen at work. Respondents gave very high ratings to all these statements. Moreover, the statements on interpersonal influence include: being able to make most people feel comfortable and at ease, being able to communicate efficiently and effectively with others, being easy to develop a good rapport with most people, and being good at getting people to like them. Likewise, all statements got very high ratings.</p><p>For social astuteness, these are the statements: understanding people very well, being particularly good at sensing the motivations and hidden agendas of others, having good intuition or savvy about how to present self to others, instinctively knowing the right things to say or do to influence others and pays close attention to people's facial expressions. As a result, the respondents rated these statements very highly. Finally, the statements on apparent sincerity that respondents gave very high ratings are the following:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indicator</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>trying to be genuine in what to say and do, getting people to believe in the honesty of what they say and do, trying to show a genuine interest in other people, and paying close attention to people's facial expressions.</head><p>The very high rating respondents gave to these statements indicates that they always do all these things, assuring the PNP in Region 11 of their excellent networking ability, interpersonal skills, social astuteness, and apparent sincerity.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">2</ref>  Observing the individual results, the standard scores ranged from 0.25 to 0.33 indicating that almost all respondents gave the same answers in the survey because of the small standard scores. Therefore, these are the gist of the statements in the survey.</p><p>For example, under authentic living are the following: having core values for work-life, knowing personal strengths and using them regularly at work, and changing moods when needed. Under finding a calling, these are the statements: work helps them find a life's sense of purpose, and a workplace is where they feel they belong and appreciate their work environment. Maintaining perspective, they are not frightened by anything at work and are not affected by negative people at work. Additionally, they managed stress by taking breaks, finding ways to relax, and dealing with the challenges at work. They were careful that their work did not dominate their personal life. In building social connections, they often ask for feedback to improve performance. They have friends at work who support them and a solid and reliable network of supportive colleagues. Most importantly, they stayed healthy by having a good level of physical fitness and being careful about their diet and eating habits.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">3</ref> is presented the respondents' data on public service motivation. Again, all indicators got very high mean scores, resulting in a very high mean score of 4.88, with a standard deviation of 0.27. As explained earlier, the small standard scores mean that the data are close to the mean. Self-sacrifice has a very high level, as evidenced by a mean score of 4.88, which means that the respondents are ready to make enormous sacrifices for the good of society. They believe in putting duty before themselves. They think serving other citizens would give them a good feeling.</p><p>Additionally, attraction to policymaking obtained a 4.90 mean score, with a standard deviation of 0.27. The result conveys that the respondents always believe that sharing their views with the public appeals to them. Moreover, seeing people benefiting from the programs gives them great satisfaction. Also, they are interested in making and participating in public programs that are beneficial to the community, as they consider these programs meaningful public service and civic duties. Finally, they perform public service withcompassion (M=4.87; SD=0.36). For instance, they always thought of dependence on one another, feeling sympathetic to the plight of the underprivileged, and making a difference in society means more than personal achievements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indicator</head><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">4</ref> is conveyed the data on the job engagement of the police personnel in Region 11. Again, all three indicators got very high scores: Cognitive engagement (M=4.90; SD 0.29), emotional engagement (M=4.91; SD=0.27), and physical engagement (M=4.91; SD=0.29). The data illustrate that the respondents have always manifested the behaviors and actions stipulated under job engagement. That, under the cognitive dimension, their minds are always full of ideas about their work. Wherever they are, things often happen that remind them of their work, making their minds engaged fully and focused on their work. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Relationship between the Exogenous and Endogenous Latent Variables</head><p>In Table <ref type="table">6is</ref> displayed the result of the correlation test between the exogenous variables: political skills, resilience, public service motivation, and job engagement. The value p&lt;0.05 is the basis of the significance level. It is shown in the table that all tests are significant:thus successfully rejecting the null hypothesis. The result means that all exogenous variables have substantial relationships with job engagement. Moreover, the 2-tailed test showed a significant relationship, denoting that the mean scores are significant in the distribution's upper and lower tails. The function of a 2-tailed test is to establish whether the mean is significantly greater than X and lower than X, which would result in a p-value of less than 0.05. Therefore, significant. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">5</ref> shows that all tests are significant. Political skills, resilience, and public service motivation significantly correlate with job engagement.</p><p>The inference is that job engagement would increase when these three exogenous variables increase.The coefficient of correlation revealed a significant relationship for all exogenous variables: between political skills and job engagement (r=.517, p&lt;.000), resilience and job engagement (r=.737, p&lt;.000), and public service motivation and job engagement (r=.768, p&lt;.000).The relationship is also positive. The strong and positive correlation signifies that the change in the exogenous variable can significantly positively impact the endogenous variable. For example, the increase in political skills can moderately increase job engagement. .663 ** .000</p></div>

Influence of the Exogenous Latent Variables on Job Engagement</head><p>Table <ref type="table">7presents</ref> the regression analysis that tested the influence of the exogenous variables onjob engagement. As revealed in the data, all three exogenous variables significantly influence job engagement, namely; political skills, resilience, and public service motivation. The combined influence of political skills, resilience at work, and public service motivation on job engagement is 67.8% (∆R=.678), implying that 32.2% of the job engagement of the police personnel in Region 11 is because of other factors beyond the scope of this study. However, taking the influence of each exogenous variable on job engagement into consideration, the coefficient of determination shows that political skills, resilience, and public service motivation can each influence job .</p></div>

As stated earlier, the combined influence of the three exogenous variables on job engagement is 67.8%. This change in the value of R2 is due to adding other variables to the equation. R2 changes for each added variable; the more variables added, the lesser the coefficient of determination (R2). The individual result per beta coefficient showed that the topmost exogenous variable influencing job engagement is resilience (B=.474, p=.000). Next is public service motivation, with a beta coefficient of .436 at the p-value. 000. Last is political skills (B=.086, p=.000).</p><p>Finally, the F-value of 282.643 with p=.000 indicates the regression model's statistically significant predictive capability. To reiterate, resilience best influences job engagement. Therefore, for every change in the strength of the police personnel in Region XI, the same degree of transformation happens in their job engagement.</p></div>

The model shows the exogenous latent variables and manifest variables. The exogenous latent variable means are not directly observable and measured only through their manifest variables (or indicators). For example, in the model below, all three exogenous variables predict job engagement.</p><p>In the model, political skills can influence public service motivation and job engagement through manifest variables such as networking ability (NA), social astuteness (SA), interpersonal influence (II), and apparent sincerity (AS). On the other hand, public service motivation can also influence job engagement through its manifest variables: self-sacrifice (SS), attraction to policymaking (AP), and compassion (CO). Finally, resilience can influence public service motivation and job engagement through manifest variables: living authentically (LA), finding a calling (FC), maintaining perspective (MP), managing stress (MS), building social connections (BC), and studying healthy (SH).</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">9</ref> are contained the best-fit model values (see Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>, Model 5) that match all the goodness of fit measures. Further, in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">10are</ref> displayed the independent variables' direct, indirect, and total effects on job engagement in the best-fit model (Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>). Political skill has an 86.3% full effect on job engagement. Resilience has a 79.4% effect on job engagement, while public service motivation has a 52.7% direct effect on job engagement. In this data, public service motivation most impacts job engagement. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INDEX</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>In this chapter are contained the analyses of the results presented in Chapter 3 of this paper. The order of discussion follows the same sequence made in the presentation of the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Political Skills, Resilience at Work, Public Service Motivation, and Job Engagement of Police Personnel in Region 11</head><p>Overall, the results showed very high political skills, resilience at work, public service motivation, and job engagement, suggesting that police personnel have outstanding networking ability, interpersonal influence, social astuteness, and apparent sincerity. Likewise, the result indicates that they also have excellent work resilience, as evidenced by very high ratings in authentic living, finding a calling, maintaining perspective, managing stress, building social connections, and staying healthy. Furthermore, the results showed that police personnel have high public service motivation concerning self-sacrifice, attraction to policymaking, and compassion. They also have very high cognitive, emotional, and physical job engagements.</p><p>The varying socio-political environment gives the police contemporary stress that requires political skills to combat effectively (Saunders, Kotzias, &amp; Ramchand, 2019). More often, police are victims of mob violence, caught in the crossfire between political leaders and the people, putting the lives of police and other people in danger <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Marenin, 2018)</ref>. Moreover, political skills are necessary for advancing a career at an individual level. Without it, the individual cannot leverage career development <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Lee, Yun, &amp; Kim, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Because of the contemporary stress that the police face, they have to have resilience at work to withstand whatever challenges, their high-level strength at work could help them surmount every difficulty in the job. Still, to have stability, police personnel should have proper training because various factors combined may cause police resilience to weaken <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Chitra &amp; Karunanidhi, 2021)</ref>. Nevertheless, on the other hand, with solid strength at work, police can face various challenges and difficulties, like trauma, threats, and tragedies <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Krause &amp; Halkitis, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Studies have shown that high-level public service motivation encourages accountability among employees. This claim may also be valid among police personnel, thus, resulting in better job performance (Schwarz, Eva, &amp; Newman, 2020). In addition, Breaugh, Ritz, and Alfes (2018) observed that employees with high-level motivation to serve the public showed more job satisfaction, and their satisfaction was more stable than those with lower PSM. As government employees, these findings strengthen public service motivation among police personnel to find inspiration, happiness, and accountability in doing their job. If police personnel demonstrate these behaviors in their work, people will see their confidence and cooperate with the police, just as they did in other professions (Zhang, Wang, Shi, Liu, Huang, Wang, &amp; Sun, 2021). Hence, it becomes vital that police personnel identify their values and make them meaningful towards better job engagement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Relationship of Political Skills, Resilience at Work, Public Service Motivation and Job Performance</head><p>This study found a significant, positive, and solid relationship between political skills, resilience at work, public service motivation, and job engagement. Therefore, this study affirms Basit's (2020) finding that political skills impact job performance. Furthermore, a study even found that political skills can mitigate job dissatisfaction, thus, encouraging employeesto be more engaged in their jobs and to perform better (De Clercq, Haq, Azeem, &amp; Ahmad, 2019).</p><p>Additionally, the result affirms the research finding on the positive correlation between resilience at work and job performance (Kašpárková, Vaculík, Procházka, &amp; Schaufeli, 2018). If individual strength positively impacts job performance, it does more so withteam resilience (McEwen &amp; Boyd, 2018), suggesting cohesiveness among police personnel to attain beyond expectations of job performance.</p><p>Moreover, public service motivation (PSM) and job engagement are significantly correlated. Also, higher PSM congruently impacts public service engagements (Schwarz, Eva, &amp; Newman, 2020). In other words, the more police personnel are motivated to serve, the more they engage in their job, making PSM a driver for job performance. Another study found a substantial impact of PSM on job performance in the government sector, especially if job resources are available <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Boyd, Nowell, Yang, &amp; Hano, 2018)</ref>. That study revealed that as job resources increased, public service motivation increased, and employees became emotionally committed to the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Rajagukguk &amp; Desiana, 2021)</ref>. Bringing that finding into this study would mean that the police would be highly motivated to work when resources are available. The result is a more substantial commitment to their work and the organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Influence of Political Skills, Resilience at Work and Public Service Motivation on Job Performance</head><p>The regression results showed a remarkable influence of the exogenous variables (political skills, resilience at work, and public service motivation) on the endogenous variable (job performance). This finding can reinforce previous results. For example, research shows that political skills influence the mitigation of employees' role ambiguity, although not role overload, which helps employees thrive in the organization (Cullen, Gerbasi, &amp; Chrobot-Mason, 2018). Also, political skills influence both partial mediation and moderation between leadership and innovative behavior (Zhou &amp; Wu, 2018) in that employees' affective and attributional tendencies become stimuli of leaders in their leadership style <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Russell, Steffensen, Ellen III, et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Research also shows that resilience at work can influence team performance and develop adaptability <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(McEwen &amp; Boyd, 2018)</ref>. This situation happens in almost all working arenas, even in the health care profession (Walpita &amp; Arambepola, 2020). Interestingly, resilient workers have better job performance, primarily when satisfied and engaged (Kašpárková, Vaculík, Procházka, &amp; Schaufeli, 2018).</p><p>Additionally, public service motivation influences public sector employees' perception, resulting in higher job performance levels and organizational identification <ref type="bibr">(</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSION</head><p>Based on the results, the study concludes that: the levels of political skills, resilience at work, public service motivation, and job engagement of police personnel in Region 11 are very high. In addition, there is a significant, positive, and solid relationship between political skills (PS), resilience at work (RaW), public service motivation (PSM), and job engagement (JE). There is a significant influence of PS, RaW, and PSM on JE. The combined effect of PS, RaW, and PSM on job engagement is 67.8%. Individually, they can influence JE at 68.1 percent. Political skills, resilience at work, and public service motivation are predictors of job engagement with their respective manifest variables. Essentially, the findings of this study signify that there is a model for job performance. This model affirms the Signaling Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Spence, 1974)</ref>, Resilience Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Garmezy, 1991)</ref>, and the Moral Foundations Theory (Graham, Haidt, Koleva, Motyl, Iyer, Wojcik, &amp; Ditto, 2013) used as foundations of this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Recommendations</head><p>These are the following recommendations based on the findings and conclusion of the study. First, there may be a need to sustain the political skills, resilience at work, public service motivation, and job engagement practices of the police personnel since they have very high levels of these variables. Second, it may be essential to give each police personnel recognition and commendation for a job well done to motivate them to engage faithfully in their work. Third, the agency may encourage officers and other researchers to conduct action research within their police stations to have research-based findings to improve their work and the relationship with the community.</p><p>Please express how you feel about each statement by putting a check mark in the box describing your level of agreement or disagreement. For example, you may tick (✓) 5 for Strongly Agree, 4 for Agree, 3 for Neutral, 2 for Disagree, and 1 for Strongly Disagree.</p><p>Please refer to the Rating Scale below with its description and interpretation.  </p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Engagement. The concept of focus to improve effectiveness is what the mental aspect of job engagement is all about. People must work with judgment and mindfulness to become effective(Kuok &amp; Taormina, 2017). Notionally, individuals who are cognitively engaged in their jobs have positive thoughts. Because of this, they pay more attention to their work, with high effectiveness and productivity (Basinska &amp; Dåderman, 2019; Osborne &amp; Hammoud, 2017).</figDesc></figure>

Opportunely, research shows that emotional intelligence (EI) has a positive association with positive employee attitudes. Thus, reinforcing EI through interventions could help the problem of emotional exhaustion that leads to counterproductive behaviors at work (Extremera, Mérida-López, Sánchez-Álvarez, &amp; Quintana-Orts, 2018; Jung &amp; Yoon, 2012; Susanti, &amp; Alwansyah, 2021).</figDesc></figure>

Davao Region is in the southeastern location of Mindanao. It has six cities: Davao, Digos, Mati, Panabo, Samal, and Tagum. Davao Region has a land area of 20,357 sq. km. encompassing 43 municipalities, 11 congressional districts, and 1,162 barangays. Its primer city, the City of Davao, has a land area of 2,443.6 sq. km. Davao de Oro, whose capital is Nabunturan, was formerly named Compostela Valley province. It was part of Davao del Norte before, but the ratification of Republic Act 8470 on March 8, 1998, formally separated it. Compostela Valley was renamed Davao de Oro on April 17, 2019, through Republic Act 11297. Davao de Oro has two legislative districts, 11 municipalities, and 237 barangays. Its capital is Nabunturan. Davao de Oro occupies 14.73 percent of the total land area of the Davao region.</figDesc></figure>

(2020), job engagement affects the work of the police. Because of this, management support becomes necessary. Therefore, the authors proposed how management could support the police: by training police managers to promote widespread police engagement and by modifying the performance indicators of police managers in line with better police engagement. Nevertheless, research shows that the intrinsic values of the police personnel can drive them to engage harder for better work outcomes (Basinska &amp; Dåderman, 2019).</figDesc></figure>

People assume that police personnel are resilient, having survived the contemporary stress they face daily. Police must be resilient at work to withstand challenges and surmount job difficulties. To achieve resilience of mind and body, police personnel undergo proper training because various factors like trauma, threats, tragedies, and other challenges combined may cause police resilience to weaken (Chitra &amp; Karunanidhi, 2021; Krause &amp; Halkitis, 2020; Manerin, 2018).</figDesc><table /></figure>
