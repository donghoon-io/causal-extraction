<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) play a central role in the construction and maintenance of a tree's vascular system, but feedbacks between the NSC status of trees and wood formation are not fully understood. We aimed to evaluate multiple dependencies among wood anatomy, winter NSC, and phenology for coexisting temperate (Quercus robur) and sub-Mediterranean (Q. pyrenaica) oaks along a water-availability gradient in the NW Iberian Peninsula. Sapwood NSC concentrations were quantified at three sites in December 2012 (N = 240). Leaf phenology and wood anatomy were surveyed in 2013. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the interplay among hydraulic diameter (D h ), winter NSC, budburst date, and earlywood vessel production (EVP), while the effect of D h and EVP on latewood width was assessed by using a mixed-effects model. NSC and wood production increased under drier conditions for both species. Q. robur showed a narrower D h and lower soluble sugar (SS) concentration (3.88-5.08 % dry matter) than Q. pyrenaica (4.06-5.57 % dry matter), but Q. robur exhibited larger EVP and wider latewood (1403 µm) than Q. pyrenaica (667 µm). Stem diameter and D h had a positive effect on SS concentrations, which were related to an earlier leaf flushing in both species. Sapwood sugar content appeared to limit EVP exclusively in Q. pyrenaica. In turn, D h and EVP were found to be key predictors of latewood growth. Our results confirm that sapwood SS concentrations are involved in modulating growth resumption and xylem production in spring. Q. pyrenaica exhibited a tighter control of carbohydrate allocation to wood formation than Q. robur, which would play a role in protecting against environmental stress in the sub-Mediterranean area.</p></div>

A large part of the NSC budget of the tree is invested in construction and maintenance of the vascular system, as well as in turnover of fine roots and crown development <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Wang and Ruan, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">DeSoto et al., 2016)</ref>. The hydraulic network in ring-porous oaks is highly vulnerable to dysfunction due to cavitation of their large vessels, which operate at a narrow safety margin <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Delzon and Cochard, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Urli et al., 2015)</ref>. The refilling of embolized vessels needs restoration of osmotic gradients by releasing SS into the conduits <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Salleo et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brodersen and McElrone, 2013)</ref>. Alternatively, the hydraulic function can be recovered through the formation of new conduits in the following spring <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brodribb et al., 2010)</ref>. In ring-porous species, earlywood vessels are generally functional during only 1 year <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Urli et al., 2015)</ref>, and cambial resumption precedes leaf formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Pérez-de-Lis et al., 2016)</ref>. Stored NSC Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.</p><p>are therefore needed to provide energy and materials for leaf expansion and cambial activity at the onset of the growing season <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(El Zein et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Large vessels are presumed to boost carbon gain because stomatal conductance increases with the hydraulic capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fichot et al., 2009)</ref>. Concurrently, more carbohydrates may be allotted to hydraulic purposes in trees with wider but more vulnerable vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Salleo et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brodersen and McElrone, 2013)</ref>. However, little is known about feedbacks between wood anatomy and short-distance NSC mobilization, which are probably influenced by tree vigour. Large, dominant trees commonly exhibit higher NSC levels and a faster NSC turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Sala and Hoch, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carbone et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">DeSoto et al., 2016)</ref>, as well as wider vessels at the tree base to compensate for height-related hydraulic resistance in the stem <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Petit et al., 2008)</ref>. In turn, entangled relationships between tree vigour and growth are influenced by the timing of tree phenology, given that dominant trees show larger growing periods and more intense cambial activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rathgeber et al., 2011)</ref>. Although the break in dormancy is mostly controlled by temperature and photoperiod <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Basler and Körner, 2014)</ref>, some studies suggest that high NSC concentrations in developing buds speed up leaf-out dates <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Maurel et al., 2004)</ref>. In winter, phloem of deciduous trees is probably nonfunctional, whereby sapwood might be involved in carbon translocation through the plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lacointe et al., 2004)</ref>. The influx of sucrose from xylem conduits in branches into the buds was reported to be tightly correlated to bud swelling rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bonhomme et al., 2010)</ref>, whilst high sucrose concentrations in the stem of mutant poplars have been associated with an advanced budburst <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Park et al., 2009)</ref>. Cascade effects of leaf phenology on secondary growth would consequently be expected, given that leaf and cambial phenology are coordinated at the whole-tree level <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Pérez-de-Lis et al., 2016)</ref>. In ring-porous oaks, winter temperature has been reported to affect earlywood formation, which has been attributed to thermally induced changes in respiratory demands and NSC levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gea-Izquierdo et al., 2012)</ref>. However, the interplay between NSC, phenology, and tree growth is poorly understood.</p><p>Ecological requirements modulating phenology are linked to functional species-specific strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Basler and Körner, 2014)</ref>. This is the case of the ring-porous oaks Quercus robur L. and Q. pyrenaica Willd., which coexist in the NW Iberian Peninsula. The former is widespread in Europe, being abundant in areas with mild-oceanic climate. By contrast, Q. pyrenaica is dominant in various mountain ranges of the sub-Mediterranean area, hence exhibiting multiple adaptations to cope with summer drought and winter frost, such as late flushing <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Pérez-de-Lis et al., 2016)</ref>. These differences could impact carbon metabolism and allocation to growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Valladares et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Piper, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Guillemot et al., 2015)</ref>, as well as the rate of developmental processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Deslauriers et al., 2009)</ref>, affecting the adaptive capacity to track rapid climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jump and Peñuelas, 2005)</ref>. Water shortage is deemed to influence carbon metabolism in a complex manner by constraining the activity of both source and sink organs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sala et al., 2012)</ref>, and by changing sugar fractions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Deslauriers et al., 2014)</ref>. While some studies have suggested that declining growth demand under drought causes NSC to be accumulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Sala and Hoch, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lempereur et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">DeSoto et al., 2016)</ref>, other authors have found a reduction in starch concentration under long-term drought <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Rosas et al., 2013)</ref>. Therefore, we need to understand how phenology and growth are coordinated with NSC in order to better predict plant responses to climate in the context of global warming. In this research, data from stem sapwood NSC concentration in winter 2012, xylem anatomical traits, and leaf phenology in spring 2013 (as a proxy for cambial phenology) are used to disentangle the influence of their mutual interactions on the radial growth of ring-porous oaks growing along a water-availability gradient in the NW Iberian Peninsula. We focus on the possible differences in xylem anatomy and NSC levels between Q. robur and Q. pyrenaica along the gradient. In this regard, wood production and stem sapwood NSC concentration are expected to vary along the gradient, with reduced growth but increasing NSC storage under drier conditions. We also hypothesize that the more drought-tolerant Q. pyrenaica will have xylem growth that is more reduced than Q. robur but larger stem sapwood NSC concentrations. At the species level, we aim to test the following hypotheses: (i) stem diameter influences earlywood vessel size, which in turn affects NSC content in the stem; (ii) higher sapwood SS content in winter predisposes trees to advance growth resumption in spring, as well as to produce more earlywood vessels; and (iii) earlywood vessel number and size are key predictors of latewood growth in oaks. 2 Materials and methods</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Study sites</head><p>The study area is located in the NW Iberian Peninsula, at the transition between the Atlantic and Mediterranean biogeographical regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). The experiment was conducted at three mixed stands of Q. robur (hereafter Qrob) and Q. pyrenaica (hereafter Qpyr) located along a north-tosouth transect of 120 km, following a gradient of decreasing water supply (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). Annual rainfall declines from 1461 mm at the northernmost site Bermui (hyperhumid), to 996 mm at Labio (humid), and to 832 mm at the southernmost site Moreiras (subhumid). Mean annual temperature is lower at the hyperhumid (11.3 • C) and humid (11.6 • C) sites than at the subhumid site (14.4 • C). Sampled stands are dominated by Qrob at the hyperhumid and humid sites, whereas Qpyr is more frequent at the subhumid location. Forests at the hyperhumid and humid sites include temperate trees and understorey shrubs, such as Betula alba L., Castanea sativa Mill., Pyrus cordata Desy., Ilex aquifolium L., Daboecia cantabrica (Huds.) K. Koch, and Vaccinium myrtillus L. By contrast, thermophilic Mediterranean flora, such as Q. suber L., Laurus nobilis L., Arbutus unedo L., Osyris alba L., and Daphne gnidium L., dominates the subhumid location. Stand tree densities are 1178, 1082, and 530 ha -1 at the hyperhumid, humid, and subhumid sites, respectively. Drought episodes can occur at the study region in summer, particularly at the subhumid site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). Incident rainfall in 2012 was 8, 14, and 33 % lower than the 1981-2010 average, at the hyperhumid, humid, and subhumid locations respectively, whereas it was 35, 36, and 3 % higher than the average in 2013 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). However, in summer 2013, there were only 34 (45 mm), 11 (20 mm), and 8 (35 mm) days of precipitation at the hyperhumid, humid and subhumid locations, respectively. Furthermore, mean maximum temperature was 22.0 • C for the same period at the hyperhumid and humid sites but 25.3 • C at the subhumid location.</p><p>G. Pérez-de-Lis et al.: Non-structural carbohydrates and wood production in ring-porous oaks</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Phenology and NSC concentration</head><p>At each study site, 40 trees per species were randomly selected from those belonging to the dominant and intermediate crown classes (overall N = 240), while highly suppressed and juvenile individuals were disregarded. In October 2012, we measured stem diameter from all selected individuals with a diameter tape, while tree height was estimated with a Blume-Leiss hypsometer. Leaf phenology was weekly monitored during 2013 using binoculars (10 ×) at ca. 10 m distance from the stem. For each tree, budburst was identified as the day of year (DOY) in which the apical buds on the uppermost part of the crown were green and expanding, but no leaves were distinguishable yet. We considered budburst to be an indicator for cambial resumption in the stem, according to the high correlations observed between these two events in our study sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Pérez-de-Lis et al., 2016)</ref>. In late autumn, leaf shedding was identified as the date in which at least 50 % of the leaves were shed from the crown. In addition, foliage density was visually estimated in July 2013 by counting the proportion of gaps in the crown and was expressed as a percentage of the theoretical maximum foliage density.</p><p>In order to analyse feedbacks between NSC and xylem anatomy, we quantified the content of NSC in sapwood by sampling one 5 mm diameter wood core per tree with an increment borer at breast height. Cores were taken in mid-December 2012, soon after the completion of leaf abscission, which occurred between mid-and late November for both species. After extraction, cores were immediately placed into a cool box, and subsequently stored at -20 • C to prevent carbohydrate degradation. Before NSC extraction, we identified the boundary between sapwood (pale-coloured) and heartwood (brown-coloured). Bark and traces of heartwood were removed, and the cores were oven-dried at 60 • C for 72 h. Sapwood was then finely grounded with a mixer mill (Retsch MM 400, Düsseldorf, Germany). We quantified NSC concentration for the whole sapwood by using the anthrone method <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Olano et al., 2006)</ref>. SS were extracted from 20 mg of dry mass in 1 mL of ethanol (80 %) at 80 • C for 30 min. The extract was centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm, and the supernatant was collected for the spectrophotometrical determination of SS concentrations, for which we used the anthrone reagent. Starch contained in the residue was hydrolysed with 1 mL of perchloric acid (35 %) for 1 h, and determination was conducted by using the anthrone reagent, as previously described for SS. Total NSC, SS, and starch concentrations were expressed as a percentage of dry matter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Wood anatomical measurements</head><p>In October 2013, one additional core was collected from all the selected trees to perform wood anatomical measurements. Cores were air-dried and mounted on wooden supports to be cut using a microtome (WSL Core Micro- tome, Zurich, CH) and polished. Cross-sectional surfaces were photographed with a digital camera (Canon EOS 600D, Tokyo, Japan) attached to a transmitted light microscope (Olympus BX40, Tokyo, Japan). Image analysis was applied on the rings formed in 2012 and 2013 using ImageJ 1.48v <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Schneider et al., 2012)</ref> in order to quantify the lumen area of earlywood vessels, latewood width, and the number of earlywood vessels, which is a proxy of earlywood vessel production (EVP). For each vessel, we estimated the diameter of the equivalent circle, obtaining the hydraulic diameter (D h ) at the tree level according to the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D h = N n=1 d 5 n N n=1 d 4 n ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where d n is the diameter of the n vessel <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Sperry et al., 1994)</ref>.</p><p>According to the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, D h is proportional to the hydraulic capacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Comparisons along the gradient</head><p>Variation among sites and between species for NSC, dates of budburst and leaf shedding, wood anatomical traits, and foliage density were evaluated by applying generalized linear models (GLMs) for gamma-distributed data. Multiple pairwise comparisons were also assessed to test differences among site factor levels. This analysis was performed by using the packages "lme4" and "multcomp" for R 3.1.1 (R Core Team, 2014). Moreover, we calculated Pearson's correlation between stem diameter and tree height (one-tailed test of significance and 95 % confidence interval).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Connections among earlywood anatomy, sapwood NSC content, and spring phenology</head><p>We performed structural equation models (SEMs) to disentangle the role of winter NSC content as a possible regulator of budburst and EVP in 2013 at the species level. Thereby, data from all sites were pooled, and a unique model was fitted for each species. An SEM approach provides an adequate representation for interacting systems, in which simultaneous influences and responses, including direct and indirect effects, are explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grace, 2006)</ref>. The structure of a hypothetical SEM, and its calculation, requires incorporating available a priori knowledge. According to the lines of evidence showed in the introduction, we hypothesized that larger trees show higher SS and starch concentrations due to their larger D h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). In turn, high SS and starch concentrations in winter are expected to speed up tree phenology (budburst date) and boost EVP during the following year. Standardized coefficients were estimated by the maximum likelihood method, and model evaluation was performed using a χ 2 test. A P value below 0.05 indicates that discrepancy between observed and expected covariance matrices is acceptable. The adjusted goodness of model fit index (AGFI) and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) were complementarily performed in order to consider the effect of sample size on the model fit evaluation. Values of AGFI above 0.90 and RMSEA below 0.05 indicate an acceptable fit of the model in relation to the degrees of freedom. A χ 2 test for multi-group invariance was applied to evaluate differences between the models fitted for each species. SEM analyses were carried out with AMOS 18.0 software (AMOS Development Corp., Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, USA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Predictors of latewood formation</head><p>We performed generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) to identify how earlywood anatomy, foliage density, phenology, and winter NSC levels affected latewood production in 2013. The effect of site was included as a random component, while winter NSC, earlywood anatomy (D h and EVP in 2013), growing season length, and foliage density were the explanatory variables of the model. Collinearity was surveyed by calculating the generalized varianceinflation factors for each species. GLMMs were fitted by a log-link function with a gamma distribution, being ranked according to the corrected Akaike's information criterion (AICc; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bolker et al., 2009)</ref>. We averaged the 95 % confidence set of models according to the Akaike's weights, and the relative importance of a given variable was calculated as the sum of the weights across all models in which it was contained <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burnham and Anderson, 2002)</ref>. Marginal (fixed effects only) and conditional R 2 (both fixed and random effects) were calculated by using the variance components of fixed and random factors and the residuals. The proportion change in variance (PCV) was quantified to provide the vari- ability in latewood width explained by the full model (containing fixed and random effects), as compared to the null model (only containing the random component). Complementarily, we estimated the percentage of the variance explained by each fixed factor, and both full and null models were ranked according to the minimum AICc and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) scores. Variance partitioning, R 2 and PCV calculations were performed by following the methods reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2013)</ref>. We used the packages "lme4" and "MuMIn" for R 3.1.1 (R Core Team, 2014) to assess GLMM estimates, variance partitioning, and statistics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Variation in NSC, wood anatomy, and leaf phenology along the gradient</head><p>Mean SS concentrations along the gradient ranged from 3.88 to 5.08 % dry matter in Qrob and from 4.06 to 5.57 % dry matter in Qpyr, being similar to those of starch, which ranged from 4.28 to 5.11 % dry matter in Qrob and from 3.47 to 5.11 % in Qpyr (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). As a result, Qpyr exhibited greater SS concentrations than Qrob (F [1,238] = 18.27, P &lt; 0.001), while both starch and NSC levels did not differ between species (starch F [1, 238] = 2.14, NSC F [1,238] = 0.62, P &gt; 0.050). Such a pattern resulted in a higher SS-to-starch ratio for Qpyr than for Qrob (F = 18.07, P &lt; 0.001), espe- cially at the humid location (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), although there was no variation along the gradient (F = 0.21, P = 0.814). In contrast, SS content decreased in both species from the subhumid to the hyperhumid site (Qrob F [2,117] = 17.72, Qpyr F [2, 117] = 21.89, P &lt; 0.001). The subhumid site exhibited a higher starch content than the hyperhumid location for Qpyr (F [2, 117] = 8.59, P &lt; 0.001), whereas no clear pattern was found for Qrob (F [2, 117] = 2.52, P = 0.085). Overall, Qpyr exhibited a higher D h than Qrob (2012 F [1, 236] = 7.76, 2013 F [1, 236] = 8.31, P &lt; 0.010; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>). The highest D h values were found for Qpyr at the humid (both years) and subhumid sites (2012), while Qrob had a more reduced variation along the gradient (2012 F [2, 117] = 2.89, 2013 F [2, 117] = 0.18, P &gt; 0.050; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>). EVP and latewood width were higher in Qrob than in Qpyr at the hyperhumid and subhumid sites, whereas differences were non-significant at the humid location (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>). Trees at the subhumid site exhibited wider latewood (both species) and higher EVP (Qrob) than those at the hyperhumid location (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</p><p>Qrob had a larger stem diameter than Qpyr at the hyperhumid site, whereas similar values were found at the humid and subhumid locations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>). Stem diameter was positively correlated with tree height in Qrob (r [118] = 0.60, P &lt; 0.001) and Qpyr (r [118] = 0.58, P &lt; 0.001). Trees of both species were taller at the hyperhumid and subhumid sites than at the humid location (Qrob F [2, 117] = 22.85, Qpyr F [2, 117] = 29.46, P &lt; 0.001). Qrob exhibited an earlier budburst than Qpyr (F [1, 236] = 527.83, P &lt; 0.001), occurring from early March to late April for the former and from mid-April to late May for the latter. In both species, budburst occurred earlier at the subhumid site than at humid and hyper- humid locations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>). By contrast, leaf shedding was first recorded at the hyperhumid and humid sites for Qpyr (DOY 312 on average; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>), whereas some green leaves could be perceived until late December at the subhumid site (Qrob DOY 357, Qpyr DOY 354). The leaf period was on average 42 days longer for Qrob than for Qpyr (F [1, 236] = 450.90, P &lt; 0.001) in 2013. Foliage density was similar along the gradient for Qrob, but significantly lower at the hyperhumid site for Qpyr (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>). It is also relevant that numerous Qpyr trees at the hyperhumid site had their leaves infected with powdery mildew in spring 2013.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Species-specific models on functional relationships affecting wood production</head><p>SEMs showed a good fit for both species (Qrob, χ 2 [1,N=120] = 0.202, P = 0.653; Qpyr, χ 2 [1,N=120] = 0.118, P = 0.732), with AGFI &gt; 0.90 and RMSEA &lt; 0.1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). Stem diameter had a positive indirect effect on SS levels that was mediated by D h in 2012. Large trees exhibited an earlier budburst date, partially related to their higher SS concentrations in winter. In Qrob, SS content affected EVP by mediating budburst date, although our model explained a low amount of the observed variability in EVP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>). In Qpyr, SS concentrations had a positive direct effect on EVP, with an acceptable R 2 value for EVP (R 2 = 0.20; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>).

In fact, EVP and D h were the most relevant predictors, attaining a relative influence above 85 % (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">NSC allocation to xylem growth reflects contrasting stress-tolerance strategies in oaks</head><p>According to our expectations, sapwood SS content decreased from the subhumid to the hyperhumid site for both species, and starch content followed a similar pattern for Qpyr. More immediate effects of water shortage on stem growth than on photosynthesis likely favoured carbohydrate accumulation in the previous summer <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sala et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lempereur et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">DeSoto et al., 2016)</ref>. Such a response should be adaptive in dry environments because sugars contribute to prevent desiccation through osmotic regulation and cavitation repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Salleo et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brodersen and McElrone, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pantin et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Deslauriers et al., 2014)</ref>. The fact that Qpyr showed larger vessels at the humid and subhumid locations cannot be explained by corresponding differences in tree height, whereby long-distance water transport was probably prompted under drier conditions, which concurrently increased the risk of vessel dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Urli et al., 2015)</ref>. Although the prevalence of vessel refilling is still under discussion <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Delzon and Cochard, 2014)</ref>, we hypothesize that SS concentration might be involved in compensating hydraulic vulnerability in this species. Wood formation declined along with NSC content from the subhumid toward the hyperhumid site, which contradicts our expectations, and also a possible trade-off between NSC accumulation and growth. A shorter growing season at the hyperhumid and humid locations could restrict photosynthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Morecroft et al., 2003)</ref>, as well as xylem formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rathgeber et al., 2011)</ref>. A lower tree density at the subhumid site might be associated with a reduced intertree competition, which is assumed to favour both carbon uptake and xylem growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fernández-de-Uña et al., 2016)</ref>. Strong differences between the two Atlantic sites for Qpyr, however, contrasted with their similar tree density. Soil water excess in winter at the hyperhumid site could exacerbate carbon consumption associated with fermentation processes and root anaerobic stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ferner et al., 2012)</ref>. Moreover, Qpyr trees exhibited sparser foliage and more severe powdery mildew infestation at the hyperhumid site, which may reduce NSC levels and growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Améglio et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Martínez-Vilalta, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Camarero et al., 2016)</ref>. Growth decline and tree dieback were indeed recently reported for oaks suffering from both high competition levels and water excess after extremely rainy periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Rozas and García-González, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The sub-Mediterranean Qpyr exhibited a higher SS-tostarch ratio at the onset of dormancy than the temperate Qrob, although NSC content was similar for both species. Sugars play a key role in the osmotic protection against freezing damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Améglio et al., 2004)</ref>, whereby higher symplastic SS concentrations would reflect stronger cold tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Morin et al., 2007)</ref>, as is the case for Qpyr. On the other hand, EVP and latewood width were generally lower for Qpyr than for Qrob, particularly under more Mediterranean climatic conditions. This contradictory outcome suggests that Qpyr is more conservative than Qrob in allocating NSC to wood production, hence reflecting a stronger drought tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Valladares et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Piper, 2011)</ref>. Saving NSC may allow long-lived trees to mitigate detrimental effects of eventual wildfire and drought episodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sala et al., 2012)</ref>, which are frequent at the Mediterranean area <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Rosas et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Camarero et al., 2016)</ref>. However, such a strategy could entail a high opportunity cost under favourable conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chapin et al., 1990)</ref>. Therefore, Qrob probably out-competed Qpyr in our study sites, demonstrating that temperate oaks are more competitive than sub-Mediterranean ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Rodríguez-Calcerrada et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Grossiord et al., 2014)</ref>. However, validation of these hypotheses requires further research quantifying the whole-tree NSC pool size and the activity of complementary carbon sinks. In this regard, a recent study suggested that neighbouring Qpyr trees were able to share NSC through the root system, which is an important carbon reservoir within the tree <ref type="bibr">(Salomon et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Dependencies among NSC content, phenology, and earlywood vessels</head><p>Our SEMs confirmed the hypothesized functional relationships among earlywood anatomy, spring phenology, and NSC content. The growing season started earlier in large trees, which is in line with previous studies analysing cambial activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rathgeber et al., 2011)</ref>. Stem diameter also had a positive effect on SS content at dormancy, which was mediated by the hydraulic capacity (i.e. vessel size). Enhanced water transport capacity in trees with large vessels may boost carbohydrate uptake under a high evaporative demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Meinzer et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fichot et al., 2009)</ref>. Alternatively, since large vessels are thought to be more vulnerable to cavitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Sperry et al., 1994)</ref>, higher SS concentrations may be required in the sapwood of trees bearing wider vessels to maintain long-distance water transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brodersen and McElrone, 2013)</ref>. Trees with a higher SS concentration in the stem showed earlier budburst in the following spring, as reported in poplar <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Park et al., 2009)</ref>. Bud swelling depends on sugar influx from sapwood vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Maurel et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bonhomme et al., 2010)</ref>, which have been suggested to be responsible for carbohydrate transport during the dormant period <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lacointe et al., 2004)</ref>. In addition, xylem sap osmolarity plays a role in the generation of the stem pressure needed to reverse winter embolisms in early spring <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Améglio et al., 2001)</ref>. A reduced ability to repair embolism in trees with low xylem sap SS concentration could thus negatively affect the supply of water to swelling buds <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Améglio et al., 2001)</ref>. EVP was in tune with SS concentration for Qpyr, whereas this effect was irrelevant for Qrob. Such a discrepancy in the effect of stored carbohydrates on growth is consistent with the aforesaid carbon use strategies, and could reflect the contrasting stress tolerance of the study species <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Guillemot et al., 2015)</ref>. Our results consequently suggest that Qpyr was able to limit construction costs in spring according to SS levels. Presumably, high overwintering SS levels in sapwood somehow increased energy and materials as well as water supplied to growing tissues in spring, even though starch mobilization may be initiated at that time <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Améglio et al., 2001)</ref>. Furthermore, sugars are elicitors of auxin biosynthesis and distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lilley et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sairanen et al., 2012)</ref>, as well as growth promoters <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Stewart et al., 2011)</ref>. Although relations between carbon accumulation and growth are com-plex, and mainly related to the activity of carbon sinks <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lempereur et al., 2015)</ref>, a growing body of literature suggests that NSC availability is involved in growth regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Pantin et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dietze et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Guillemot et al., 2015)</ref>. This can be particularly true for earlywood given its reliance on stored carbohydrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Skomarkova et al., 2006)</ref>. This idea agrees with the direct association between tree vigour, NSC pool, and growth found in multiple species <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Deslauriers et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carbone et al., 2013)</ref>, as well as with the observed positive effect of CO 2 fertilization on tree growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Nissinen et al., 2016)</ref>. EVP did not respond to sapwood starch content, which suggests that thermal-induced changes in starch breakdown during cold hardening could be more decisive than the total amount of reserves. This is consistent with the connection between earlywood anatomy and autumn-winter temperature reported by dendrochronological studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gea-Izquierdo et al., 2012)</ref>. However, the actual starch availability could be overestimated if starch contained in sapwood is partially inaccessible <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sala et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Earlywood anatomy is a predictor of latewood growth</head><p>The most influential predictors driving latewood growth did not differ between Qrob and Qpyr, suggesting common underlying mechanisms for both species. Latewood width was considerably influenced by earlywood properties within the same tree ring, whereas the effects of foliage density, length of the growing season, and winter NSC content were secondary. This result confirms the positive impact of enhanced water transport capacity on xylem formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fichot et al., 2009)</ref>, which is largely related to both conduit size <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Sperry et al., 1994)</ref> and total conductive area <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Meinzer et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>A more efficient water supply to growing tissues probably allows trees to protect cambial activity against water shortage in summer <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Wang and Ruan, 2013)</ref>. Despite the higher construction costs, abundant earlywood vessels of distinct size could be useful to avoid hydraulic failure because functioning small conduits would serve as local water reservoirs to recover neighbouring collapsed ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brodersen and McElrone, 2013)</ref>. Moreover, an efficient hydraulic network may enhance carbon gain under favourable conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fichot et al., 2009)</ref>, hence ensuring key processes in which sugars are involved, such as osmotic regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sala et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Deslauriers et al., 2014)</ref> and embolism repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Salleo et al., 2009)</ref>. Our results suggested that changes in cell division and differentiation rates are more relevant for wood production than the duration of the growing period, as has been previously reported for conifers <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Rathgeber et al., 2011)</ref>. Although defoliation is assumed to impair carbon gain and radial growth in evergreen <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Rosas et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Camarero et al., 2016)</ref> and deciduous species <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Améglio et al., 2001)</ref>, we found that foliage density had a minor effect on latewood growth, which may reflect the high overall foliage density levels at the study sites.</p><p>In this study, non-structural carbohydrates in sapwood, wood anatomy, and leaf phenology were comprehensively addressed for two ring-porous species during a 1 year period, along a broad geographical range in the NW Iberian Peninsula. Our results reveal that feedbacks between earlywood vessels and soluble sugars involve changes in wood production. Earlywood vessel formation showed a tighter control by soluble sugar content in Q. pyrenaica than in Q. robur, suggesting a more conservative carbon use strategy for the former species. These lines of evidence support the idea that non-structural carbohydrates play a role in the acquisition of resistance to cope with harsh environmental conditions in the sub-Mediterranean area. We acknowledge the need for further research comprising a longer time span, soluble sugar fractioning, additional tree compartments such as branches and roots, and a comprehensive data set on cambial phenology instead of isolated leaf phenophases. However, this study suggests the existence of stable functional interactions between sapwood carbohydrate levels, xylem anatomy, and phenology in ring-porous oaks. In the light of our results, we suggest that Q. pyrenaica, and to a lesser extent Q. robur, could mitigate increasing hydraulic vulnerability under climate warming by prioritizing carbon accumulation over growth. Nevertheless, such a mechanism would impose additional limitations for secondary growth if adverse climate episodes become more frequent in future decades.</p><p>6 Data availability</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
