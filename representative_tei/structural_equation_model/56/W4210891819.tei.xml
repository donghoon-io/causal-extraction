<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The global low-cost carriers (LCC) market has grown at an impressive rate in the last decade. This growth is partially explained by the deregulation of aviation markets that opened several opportunities to greater competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Graham, 2013)</ref> and the increased information available and willingness to travel. The emergence of this new sector led many airports to experience an impressive increase in passenger rates. Compared with the end of 2009, the LCC fleet doubled <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(CAPA, 2019)</ref>. This naturally also affected the seating capacity of LCC, which has also doubled since 2009, amounting to 1.7 billion in 2018. Geographically, 35% of the global LCC seats in 2018 pertain to the Asia Pacific, making this region the largest market in the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(CAPA, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, in Europe, LCC have the highest market share in the airline industry, perhaps because of the Schengen agreement. In 2009 the LCC penetration rate stood at 34%, whereas in 2019, it was 41%. Seating capacity rose 78% in the last decade.</p><p>In the tourism literature, LCC have been gaining attention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Escobar-Rodríguez and Carvajal-Trujillo (2014)</ref>, for example, studied the determinants of purchasing flights from LCC's website among Spanish consumers of LCC, concluding that online purchase intentions, habit, and ease of use were the most important variables. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chang and Hung (2013)</ref> assessed the drivers of LCC adoption and loyalty of passengers in Southeast Asia, finding that reduced tariffs and convenient booking channels can lower the length of time until adopting LCC and that airline image and safety consideration have the opposite effect. Topics such as adoption, loyalty, and satisfaction are often studied in the LCC context, leaving the continuance intention open to study. Based on that, and motivated by this research gap, we posit our research question <ref type="bibr">(RQ)</ref>: what are the drivers of continuance intention for LCA?</p><p>In answering this RQ, we develop a research model based on the expectation-confirmation model (ECM), which is an empirically validated theoretical model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bhattacherjee (2001)</ref>, and four constructs from previous studiesbrand awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Suki and Sasmita, 2015)</ref>, brand image <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Lien et al., 2015)</ref>, website quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(O'Cass &amp; Carlson, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wells, Valacich, &amp; Hess, 2011)</ref>, and visual appeal <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Loureiro, 2014)</ref>. By adding these four constructs to the ECM, which is the core theory related to satisfaction with continuance intention, we seek to explain the main drivers of LCC's continuance use intention. We expect this work to help researchers and practitioners understand the critical factors of the drivers to keep consumers booking LCC online. Thus, this work's contributions are twofold: first, by incorporating brand awareness and brand image to show how relevant it is to investigate the relationship with confirmation and continuance intention, this study helps us to understand the influence of the LCC brand on the confirmation and long-term viability; second, by combining website quality and visual appeal with the confirmation and continuance intention, we provide further insights on the drivers of effective use and continuance intention of LCC.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Low-cost airlines (LCA)</head><p>Air transport markets' liberalization was the turning point, especially for LCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adler et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Donzelli, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Tsui, 2017)</ref>. With globalization becoming a reality, deregulation and liberalization of air transportation were unavoidable for eradicating or relaxing some restrictions, including price, capacity, and entry. Several studies show that the spread of the airline industry and travel yield positive effects on countries' tourism and, as a result, their economies. In the Azores, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Vieira, Câmara, Silva, and Santos (2019)</ref> concluded that "tourism numbers increased sharply as more alternative choices emerged to visitors after the entrance of LCC due to airline liberalization". <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Donzelli (2010)</ref> studied the impact of LCC between 2000 and 2006 on the peripheral areas of Southern Italy, estimating an economic welfare growth of approximately €14.6 million per year, driven by low-cost routes, and additionally an increase in the international tourism and traffic deseasonality.</p><p>Identified and differentiated by operational characteristics and the service offered, the airline market is split into three business modelsfull-service airlines, LCC, and chartered flights <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Lordan, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Vieira et al., 2019)</ref>. By cutting on service costs (e.g., complimentary meals), charging luggage fees, and using secondary airports, LCC can offer lower ticket prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chang and Hung, 2013)</ref>. Some authors, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dobruszkes (2006)</ref>, argue that "several airlines will probably disappear" since it is not a healthy market. In fact, in the last few years, some important LCC worldwide have ceased operations (e.g., Wow Air, Primera Air, or Air Berlin). On the other hand, the widespread use of selfservice applications by the consumer has allowed lower distribution costs by selling airline tickets directly to consumers through their websites (bypassing travel agents), point-to-point service (rather than hub-to-hub), and non-refundable tickets <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kim &amp; Lee, 2011)</ref>. In the current study, we focus on continuance intention derived from LCC websites, applying the ECM model combined with brand awareness, brand image, website quality, and visual appeal to explain users' beliefs and behaviors to the continuance use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Expectation confirmation model (ECM) and hypotheses</head><p>In recent years, employing adoption models to shed light on the determinants of consumers' LCC travel decisions has dominated LCC research. Most studies related to LCC have focused on adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chang &amp; Hung, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Escobar-Rodríguez &amp; Carvajal-Trujillo, 2014)</ref>, stating that online purchase intention, habit, and ease of use are the most important determinants of LCC online purchasing. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no studies are focusing on the continuance intention of LCC travel. Seeking to fill this gap and expand the literature on this topic, we focus on actual continuance behavior rather than adoption intention, as there is evidence that the latter does not necessarily produce the first <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Guinea and Markus, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Our proposed model is grounded on ECM, i.e., the relationship between confirmation, satisfaction, and continuance intention. To better understand it, we applied the ECM model, which theorizes information systems (IS) continuance, adapted from expectation confirmation theory (ECT), but which is focused on post-acceptance variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bhattacherjee, 2001)</ref>. ECM states that "while postacceptance usefulness perception continues to influence users' continuance intention, user satisfaction with prior use has a relatively stronger effect on <ref type="bibr">[IS continuance, and satisfaction]</ref> is determined primarily by users' confirmation of expectation from prior use and secondarily by perceived usefulness" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bhattacherjee, 2001)</ref>. The following list outlines the meaning of the ECM model dimensions:</p><p>• Perceived usefulness: is identified as a cognitive belief and broadly defined as a stage at which an individual considers that using a specific system or service will fulfill and reinforce his/her performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bhattacherjee, 2001)</ref>. The perceived usefulness is based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and is the strongest predictor of the usage continuance intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Davis et al., 1989)</ref>. In the IS literature, the positive relationship between perceived usefulness and satisfaction and continuance intention is well established. • Confirmation: is determined by the extent to which an individual confirms or not his/her expectation. Having lower expectations linked with higher performance leads to greater confirmation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bhattacherjee, 2001)</ref>. Hence, greater confirmation relates lower expectations with higher perceived usefulness. Confirmation or disconfirmation can be related to satisfaction and dissatisfaction, respectively, in that lower expectations and higher perceived usefulness lead to a positive feeling of confirmation, which is the meaning of satisfaction. • Satisfaction: is determined as an effect converted to a positive feeling (satisfaction), indifference, or a negative feeling (dissatisfaction). Satisfaction is positively related to repurchase intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bhattacherjee, 2001)</ref>. Satisfaction is determined by users' expectations confirmation from previous experiences and perceived usefulness. It is considered a strong predictor to build and retain a loyal base of long-term consumers, reinforcing a user's intention to continue using the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Nascimento et al., 2018)</ref>. • Continuance intention: is determined by consumers' satisfaction with previous use and is defined as an individual's intention to continually use or reuse a system <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bhattacherjee, 2001)</ref>. Once an individual considers that using a determined system will achieve the expected outcome or performance, he/she will intend to use it repeatedly.</p><p>A broad spectrum of topics involving information systems can be investigated concerning ECM applications. These include matters such as continuance intention of video-on-demand services <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Pereira and Tam, 2021)</ref> or e-health/m-health adoption and its improvements <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Leung and Chen, 2019)</ref>. Several investigations report consistent relationships of ECM with other models in different contexts, such as the UTAUT2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Tam et al., 2020)</ref>, theory of planned behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kim, 2010)</ref>, or innovation diffusion theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Rahardja et al., 2019)</ref>. Hence, we hypothesize:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Brand awareness and brand image</head><p>Our research model expands ECM by considering brand awareness and image, website quality, and visual appeal. Brand awareness refers to how consumers link the product to the brand and viceversa. When consumers want to purchase a product or service, and a brand name comes to their minds immediately, it means that the product or service has higher brand awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Suki and Sasmita, 2015)</ref>. This, in turn, means that all of the marketing channels play an essential role by assuring the quality and credibility of the products/services. Brand awareness has a considerable impact on individuals' decision-making processes. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dabbous and Barakat (2020)</ref>, brand awareness is a fundamental aspect that affects users' purchase intention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bae et al. (2020)</ref> establish the relationship of brand awareness with brand association and brand loyalty, leading to customer satisfaction. The brand image also has an essential role in the consumer's decision about which brand to choose. It helps consumers discern a brand from others by identifying if his/her needs/wants are fulfilled by the brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anwar et al., 2011)</ref>. Brand image is defined "as perceptions about a brand as reflected by the brand associations held in consumer memory" <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Keller, 1993)</ref>, meaning that the more positive the brand image is, the more willing the consumer is to use and continue to use the brand product/service and its attributes. As with brand awareness, brand image plays an essential role while the consumer makes her/his choice by associating his/her needs with a brand's purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Nam et al., 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barreda et al. (2020)</ref> indicate that brand image in the social media context helps develop a favorable evaluation and generate a stronger emotional attachment with the brand. Prior studies have also shown that brand image predicts customer satisfaction and loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dam and Dam, 2021)</ref>. Therefore, we posit:</p><p>H6a: Brand awareness has a positive impact on confirmation. H6b: Brand awareness has a positive impact on continuance intention. H7a: Brand image has a positive impact on confirmation. H7b: Brand image has a positive impact on continuance intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Website Quality</head><p>According to some management information system researchers, there is no clear, uniform definition of website quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Semerádová and Weinlich, 2020)</ref>. This is so mainly because that definition can vary according to the perspective of a user or developer, for example. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Rocha (2012)</ref>, website quality can be considered in three domains: content, functionality, and technical aspects.</p><p>Websites are a means of communication between the brands and the consumers whereby intrinsic and extrinsic product characteristics are exposed by pictures, virtual experiences, or even the price and website quality <ref type="bibr">(Wells, Valacich, &amp; Hess, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Everard and Galletta (2005)</ref> suggested that website quality impacts consumers' impressions about a brand and the product. Customers seek fast and precise information to decide quickly. Well organized information, icons, bullet points, and pictures are the easiest way to quickly understand if the product/service meets the user's needs or not. A website that allows the consumer to arrive at conclusions easily will encourage the consumer to search for more information and obtain more than what he/she was looking for at the outset. Website quality plays an essential role in attaining website effectiveness and customer loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Candiwan and Wibisono, 2021)</ref>. Customers are more likely to visit and purchase at websites that exhibit highly desirable qualities <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ali et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Qalati et al., 2021)</ref>. Thus, website quality may affect a user's usage and continuance intention. Therefore, we hypothesize:</p><p>H8a: Website quality has a positive impact on confirmation. H8b: Website quality has a positive impact on continuance intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Visual Appeal</head><p>"Eyes are the first to buy" is a simple expression that says a great deal about visual appeal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bilro et al. (2018)</ref> identified visual appeal (website creativity, multimedia, color graphics, images, and animation) as one of the dimensions of website quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wells, Valacich, and Hess (2011)</ref> also found that visual appeal is the strongest determinant of website quality. The more the website or the information is well written and well organized, the more the consumers are willing to visit the website.</p><p>As a dimension of website quality, visual appeal plays an essential role in a website's success by making the information enjoyable rather than presenting it as dull or unappealing <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Guo et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The journey through the website must be an experience that the consumers want to live again and again. Visual features are powerful in dictating consumer satisfaction and intent to purchase when they are elicited and experienced by the consumer <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Jeon et al., 2021)</ref>. Thus, the visual appeal may affect user continuance intention. For these reasons, we posit:</p><p>H9a: Visual Appeal has a positive impact on confirmation.</p><p>H9b: Visual Appeal has a positive impact on continuance intention. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>The data were collected through a questionnaire on a well-known survey website between March and April of 2019. The questionnaire was first written in English and then translated to Portuguese, which was made available to respondents. The questionnaire was translated back to English to ensure translation consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brislin, 1970)</ref>. As shown in Appendix A, the items were adapted from the literature. The items were measured using a numerical scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7). Data collection occurred in two phases: in phase one, the questionnaire was applied to 30 persons (pilot) to test and analyze if the questionnaire had issues or problems. Based on the result of the pilot test, we concluded that the survey was valid, and we were able to move forward. Naturally, the pilot sample was not included in the final data. In phase two, we conducted the final survey. Due to the difficulty of fixing the sampling frame, there was no systematic sampling.</p><p>The participants of this study are Portuguese persons who use Facebook. A total of 306 responses were collected, of which 272 were valid and considered for the analysis. To test for common method bias, Harman's one-factor test was applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. The first factor only accounts for 41% of the variance, well below the threshold of 50%. Hence, no significant common method bias was found. A marker variable technique was used in an additional test for common method bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lindell and Whitney, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Malhotra et al., 2006)</ref>. We added a theoretically irrelevant marker variable in the research model, obtaining 0.0241 (2.41%) as the maximum shared variance with other variables; a value that can be considered as low <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Johnson et al., 2011)</ref>. No significant bias was found in the data set. Concerning the demographic indicators (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), 59% of respondents are women, 55% are between 18 and 29 years old, 83% are working professionals, and 73% had traveled with an airline company at least once. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data analysis and results</head><p>A partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was performed supported on the software SmartPLS 3.2.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Ringle, C., Wende, S., and Becker, 2015)</ref>. The analysis of the PLS-SEM was assessed in two parts: the measurement and structural models.</p><p>To assure the suitability of the measurement model, we assessed the construct reliability, indicator reliability, convergence validity, and discriminant validity, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hair, Hult, Ringle, and Sarstedt (2016)</ref>. The composite reliability (CR) and Cronbach's alpha (CA) values are greater than 0.7, meaning that the model has a satisfactory internal consistency. To evaluate indicator reliability, loading should be above 0.7, and loading less than 0.4 should be excluded <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Henseler et al., 2009)</ref>. As all loadings are above 0.4, no item had to be excluded. Since all items were higher than 0.7, it suggests that the constructs are reliable (please see Appendix A). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows a CR greater than 0.8 for all constructs, which is a suitable CR. The average variance extracted (AVE) was used to test convergent validity for each construct. While the AVE is greater than 0.5, the latent variables explain more than half of the variance of their indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hair et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Henseler et al., 2009)</ref>. Because the AVE is above 0.5 in our study, convergence is guaranteed. To ensure discriminant validity, the square root of AVE (diagonal values in bold) should be greater than the correlation between each pair of constructs (off-diagonal values) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref>, which is reinforced if the loadings are greater than cross loadings <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chin, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. Thus, all eight of the constructs of our research model are statistically different and can be used to test the proposed model. Finally, the Heterotrait-Monotrait ratio (HTMT) criterion for discriminant validity assessment showed the presence of discriminant validity between the pair of constructs, as the HTMT ratios for each pair of constructs have a value lower than 0.9 and are significant, as shown in Table 3 <ref type="bibr">(Henseler, Ringle, and Sarstedt, 2015)</ref>.    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussions and conclusions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Conclusion</head><p>We sought to explain the main determinants of LCC use and continuance intention websites to purchase flights. To this end, we considered four determinants in our research modelbrand awareness, brand image, website quality, and visual appeal. As far as we can ascertain, this is the first study investigating ECM considering these four dimensions' effect on the continuance intention. Ten of the 13 hypotheses were confirmed, demonstrating our model's theoretical suitability and consistency.</p><p>As shown by the analysis of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, our research model accounts for 42.4% of the variation in confirmation, supporting hypotheses H6a, H7a, H8a, and H9a. These results show that all four independent dimensions are significantly and positively associated with confirmation. The model also explains 32.9% of the variation in perceived usefulness, thus supporting H1. We were also able to explain 55.6% of the variation in satisfaction. Perceived usefulness and confirmation were significantly and positively associated with satisfaction, thus supporting H3 and H4. Finally, the research model explains 53% of the variation in continuance intention, supporting H5, H6b, and H7b. Hence, hypotheses H2, H8b, and H9b are not supported by our model. If we compare the results of our research model to those of ECM alone (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>), we see that our model clearly outperforms the former, as the explained variation in continuance intentionthe primary dependent variableincreases by nine percentage points(p.p.). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hair, Hult, Ringle, and Sarstedt (2016)</ref>, a value of R-squared at .75, .50, or .25 are considered as substantial, moderate, or weak, respectively. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the R-squared values for the satisfaction (55.6%) and continuance intention (53%) are considered moderate. Perceived usefulness (32.9%) and confirmation (42.4%) are considered weak.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Theoretical implications</head><p>The theoretical implications of this research can be summarized in four main points. First, the theoretical contribution of this study is the combination of ECM with the four independent variables brand awareness, brand image, website quality, and visual appealwhich we found and empirically demonstrated to be critical drivers of LCC. The inclusion of these four constructs is demonstrated to outperform ECM alone, which is the basis of our research model. Our research model increased by nine p.p. the variation explained in continuance intentionthe primary (dependent) variable of interest. This fact highlights the importance of researchers combining different theories to develop tailor-made models for the technology under study, thereby improving their findings. Perhaps a paradigmatic example of the importance of this approach is the study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Liang and Shiau, 2018)</ref>, who have also grounded on the ECM to explore the drivers of online repurchase intention in the context of airline tickets. However, in their study, the authors found perceived usefulness to be a significant driver of repurchase intention, whereas we did not. We believe that this difference has precisely to do with the fact that we have included other determinants that these authors did not, thus highlighting the importance of developing comprehensive models in the context of consumer behavior.</p><p>Second, our research model was applied in the context of LCC websites, assessing the consumers' continuance intention, a far more important feature than the intention to adopt, in the author's opinion. Besides continuance intention, confirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction were also considered. Although a few studies have approached this concept, our research can be adapted to different types of online purchases, such as fashion, technology, or food.</p><p>Third, with the association of the four constructs with the ECM, this study shows that there are other important constructs to pay attention to beyond satisfaction and perceived usefulness in explaining continuance intention, specifically brand awareness and image, that play a significant role in the decision context on confirmation and continuance intention. Some studies have examined the role of brand awareness over purchase intention (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dabbous and Barakat, 2020)</ref>, and brand image over customer loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dam and Dam, 2021)</ref>. This study explores the impact of brand awareness and brand image on the confirmation and continuance intention, demonstrating to future researchers how important it is to explore short and long-term viability. In this context, it is interesting that our study adds some novelty in respect to other studies conducted recently in LCC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bigne et al. (2018)</ref>, for example, studied the impact that external influences (i.e., media and experts' opinions about brands) have on LCC online repurchase intention. These authors conclude that these influences not associated with repurchase intention, where we find evidence at least partially that they do (H6b and H7b). We believe that this apparent, at least, at first sight, contradiction may be related to the fact that these authors only focused on travelers who had at least one active account in a social media networking travel site. It seems reasonable to assume that these individuals may have been more overexposed to external influences, or at least more than a typical (offline) consumer is. Therefore, in an environment full of external influence, it is only natural that these lose some strength gradually.</p><p>Fourth, the findings show that website quality and visual appeal tend to engage the initial expectations of the LCC users to interact with the website. Overall, website quality significantly impacts foreigners' decisions to visit a country, making the website an essential vehicle for tourism attraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alderighi and Gaggero, 2019)</ref>. Although our results show that website quality and visual appeal play no role in continuance intention, they reveal that these features influence the usage decision. Although in the long-term perspective (continuance intention), these two constructs have no significance, when looking for the short-term perspective (adoption or intention), several studies identify website quality as an influencing factor on intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ali, 2016)</ref>. A website's quality and appeal keep the consumers on the website and induce interest in the information or communication.</p><p>After that, if the consumer is satisfied, the website no longer plays a decisive role. After that, brand awareness and brand image come into play to keep (or not) the consumer and let him/her continue with the brand, product, or service. This term-perspective difference plays an important role when determining a company's strategy depending on whether the target is short-term or long-term, adoption or continuance. Our results reveal that perceived usefulness shows no statistical significance in explaining continuance intention, which contradicts the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Foroughi et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Nascimento et al., 2018)</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first to test the impact of brand awareness, brand image, website quality, and visual appeal on confirmation and continuance intention. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Practical implications</head><p>The results of this work bring new insights about individuals' continuance intention to buy LCC tickets online. First, we demonstrate that every ECM construct except perceived usefulness, brand awareness, and image are essential in explaining continuance intention. This fact offers some insights to LCC managers to promote users' online purchase continuance intention. For example, given the significance of brand awareness and brand image, companies should develop and boost all the perspectives around the brand to effectively communicate and spread brand recognition.</p><p>According to Branding (2019), the brand positioning strategy is essential to create a positive bond to the product or service. Brands become embedded in the consumer´s mind and help them make sense of and apply positioning to various products and services.</p><p>Second, visual appeal and website quality are not significant in explaining continuance intention must also be considered. LCC may gain popularity and competitive advantage by continuously improving the overall quality of their websites <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Foroudi et al., 2019)</ref>. The website communicates with the customers and lets them know brands' values and missions, which will come to the customers' minds when facing a brand stimulus. Some of the most important LCC worldwide have recently increased their marketing and communication budget (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">EasyJet, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Qantas, 2019)</ref>. It reveals that companies are aware that it is essential to develop all the perspectives around a brand, such as awareness and image, which is one of the demonstrations of the present research.</p><p>Third, companies should also be watchful about satisfaction, as it significantly affects continuance intention by developing customers' positive feelings (satisfaction) toward contacting the brand and the service/product.</p><p>Finally, the present study presents empirical evidence of the contribution of brand awareness, brand image, website quality, and visual appeal in confirmation of expectation. Therefore, focusing on these dimensions will result in a higher confirmation level. For instance, according to the Joy Ness Marketing portal (Joy Ness, 2021), focusing on the brand may help increase the value of products and services by differentiating them from the competition, creating positive mental associations, and forming relationships with customers. On the other hand, the website's quality can help foster a climate of consumers' trust, leading to the use of a website. The visual appeal of a website is the strongest determinant of website quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Wells et al., 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Limitations and future research</head><p>Our research has some limitations that need to be acknowledged. One is the use of only four independent variables adapted from other studies. In this sense, it is possible that our research model might not fully cover some important drivers behind LCC online purchase continuance and, therefore, should be included in future studies (e.g., incentives from frequent flyer programs or customer support). Including other variables related to well-being would be interesting in future studies and could offer more insights on LCC companies and their customers. Another limitation is the use of data from respondents of only one country. We suggest applying the same study or similar studies to different countries to investigate if the conclusions differ. Also, including some cultural variables would be interesting to understand if there are changes in the continuance intention.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -Research Model</figDesc><graphic coords="6,62.10,305.14,465.91,254.95" type="bitmap" /></figure>

The t values are computed to measure each indicator's weight's significance. The model explains 42.4% of the variation in confirmation. Brand awareness (β ̂=.118, p &lt;.05), brand image (β ̂=.252, p &lt;.01), website quality (β ̂=.262, p &lt;.05), and visual appeal (β ̂=.191, p &lt;.05) are statistically significant in explaining confirmation, concluding that H6a, H7a, H8a, and H9a are supported. Our model can explain 32.9% of the variation in perceived usefulness. The confirmation (β ̂=.574, p &lt;.01) is statistically significant in explaining perceived usefulness, supporting H1. The model explains 55.6% of the variation in satisfaction. The confirmation (β ̂=.671, p &lt;.01) and perceived usefulness (β ̂=.118, p &lt;.10) are statistically significant in explaining satisfaction, supporting hypotheses H3 and H4. As for continuance intention, our model can explain 53% of its variation. The satisfaction (β ̂=.287, p &lt;.01), brand awareness (β ̂=.229, p &lt;.01), and brand image (β ̂=.248, p &lt;.01), are statistically significant in explaining continuance intention, supporting hypotheses H5, H6b, and H7b. The perceived usefulness, website quality, and visual appeal are statistically insignificant to explain continuance intention, thus meaning that H2, H8b, and H9b are not supported.</figDesc><graphic coords="9,62.10,448.42,471.20,264.35" type="bitmap" /></figure>
