<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose -This study aims to explore the factors that can encourage Generation Z to continue using Zakat, Infaq and Sodaqoh (ZIS) digital payments. The factors used to determine the behavioral intention (BI) of Generation Z are adoption readiness (AR), perceived risk (PR), trust (TR) and personal innovativeness (PI).</p><p>Design/methodology/approach -AR (reflected by facilitating condition, social influence, ease of use and usefulness), PR (security risk and privacy risk), PI, TR and BI were tested using structural equation model (with smart PLS analysis tool).</p><p>Findings -AR and BI are influenced by PI. In addition, BI is also influenced by TR, where TR will increase if risk can be minimized. This study was not able to prove the role of risk on BI.</p><p>Research limitations/implications -This result focuses on Generation Z, so future research can compare results between generations. In addition, regulations between countries can affect the results of similar research, and factors that have not been used in this study can be used for future research.</p><p>Practical implications -The results show that several reflective models of AR and PR. By adding the TR factor, this study can be used to understand the attributes of the acceptance of the ZIS digital payment model. On the other hand, this research has practical implications for the success of cashless ZIS payment transactions.</p><p>Originality/value -The model in this study develops an existing acceptance model and uses this model in the ZIS digital payment for Generation Z.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The Amil Zakat Organization is an organization that is engaged in collecting and distributing Zakat, Infaq and Sodaqoh (ZIS) funds. Within the organization, the theme that became a big issue was the collection of ZIS funds. With the collection of ZIS funds, it can reduce the difference in people's wealth and create an even distribution of wealth. Therefore, the existence of the Amil Zakat Institution is an important key to solving the problems of unemployment and poverty. The Amil Zakat Institution must-have innovations that can increase the amount of ZIS funds collected.</p><p>In general, the method of collecting ZIS funds still uses advertising, opening a zakat receipt counter, door-to-door and collaboration with certain communities. The ZIS payment method still tends to be cash, whereas consumptive payments have started to become familiar with cashless payments (digital payments). Digital payment is one of the innovations to make transactions easier. With this method, the potential for increasing the collected ZIS funds can be realized. Indonesia is a country where the majority of the population is Muslim, but the realization of ZIS collection by the National Zakat Amil Agency (BAZNAS) is still not optimal. The use of digital payment technology is available on various platforms. The banking sector has launched mobile banking, and on the other hand, startup companies have created many digital wallets to make transactions easier. However, the impact is not so significant on ZIS fundraising in Indonesia.</p><p>The total potential for zakat in Indonesia in 2020 is recorded at Rp233.84tn, with the largest portion of income zakat, which is Rp139.07tn <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. If you look at BAZNAS 2020 Financial Report data, the receipt of Zakat Funds, Infaq/Shodaqah and Amil Funds are Rp 408.49bn. Based on these data, the achievement of ZIS fund collection is still not optimal. One of these innovations is by using digital payment technology. The use of digital payment technology is certainly not a difficult matter for users who have been accustomed to living with technology since childhood. Generation Z is a generation that is very thick with technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Oktavendi, 2020)</ref>, so they are even more technologically advanced than the other generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jaleniauskiene and Juceviciene, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Subawa et al., 2020)</ref>. For them, technology is everyday food.</p><p>Based on that explanation, the researcher tries to predict the factors that influence Z Generation to adopt ZIS digital payment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Shabrina et al. (2019)</ref> examine the Zakat mobile smartphone application using the single ease question. The results of his research came to the conclusion that zakat mobile smartphone applications have a low usage rating and need to be redesigned. The research is only from the point of view of the design of the Zakat mobile smartphone application. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Aristiana (2019)</ref> found that trust (TR) and education played an important role in increasing the level of interest in using the digital platform. The study took all respondents aged 21 years and over.</p><p>In contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Oktavendi and Mua'ammal (2021)</ref> research, which focuses on Generation Z, and uses several other factors that are not used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Aristiana (2019)</ref>. The results of his research show that risk, ease of use, usefulness and social influence (SI) have an important role in increasing the level of TR of Generation Z in using ZIS Online Payment. The TR then has an impact on interest in using ZIS online payment in a sustainable manner. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Thakur and Srivastava (2014)</ref> developed an adoption readiness (AR) model, which shows that AR is reflected by usefulness, ease of use, facilitating conditions (FC) and SI. This model is different from the model offered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Oktavendi and Mua'ammal (2021)</ref>. In the model used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Oktavendi and Mua'ammal (2021)</ref>, both risk and AR do not have a reflective construct. However, both <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Aristiana (2019)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Oktavendi and Mua'ammal (2021)</ref> have included the TR factor, which is not used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Thakur and Srivastava (2014)</ref>. Therefore, this study used the <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Thakur and Srivastava (2014)</ref> model and added the TR factor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Yusuf and Derus (2013)</ref> suggest using the technology acceptance model (TAM), innovation diffusion theory (IDT) and TR to explain technology acceptance in Malaysia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Karmanto et al. (2021)</ref> discover the TAM and TR theory on ZIS distribution using a crowdfunding platform. Previous research models did not use personal innovativeness (PI) and used perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, FC and SI variables as indicators of AR. Many previous studies have used TAM without changing the model, as we know that Generation Z has a unique behavior. So, the benefit of my research is the creation of a model of ZIS digital payment adoption that fits the behavior of Generation Z to assist in policymaking at the Amil Zakat Institution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Zakat, Infaq, and Sodaqoh</head><p>Generation gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lancaster and Stillman (2002)</ref> divide human characteristics into three groups of generations. These groups are Baby Boomers, Generation X and Generation Y. Today, there is one more group; namely, Generation Z. The attitude is shown by each group is certainly very different <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lancaster and Stillman, 2002)</ref>. Baby Boomers are a group born in 1946-1960 and are symbolized by Optimism. On the other hand, Generation Xers <ref type="bibr">(born 1960-1980)</ref> are a generation of sceptics and live during the development of personal computers (PCs), cable TV and even the internet. In contrast to Generation Y or millennials who were born during the internet boom. Millennials tend to have an open-minded attitude because they have become addicts to social media, such as Facebook and Twitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Putra, 2017)</ref>. In addition to being open-minded, the millennial generation is also labeled as motivated, innovative, ambitious, energetic and social <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ordun, 2015)</ref>. This shows that the millennial generation has become an open figure, especially in digital media, compared with the previous generation.</p><p>Generation Z has a character similar to the millennial generation. Generation Z was born in 1995 and above, which means living in the smartphone booming era. Generation Z coexists with smartphones as if the world is in their hands. Such circumstances make Generation Z a group that tends to be able to multitask <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Putra, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Putra (2017)</ref> gives an example, namely, Generation Z is able to browse with a computer play social media on a smartphone while listening to music. This makes Generation Z a group that has a tendency to easily adapt to new technologies compared with the previous generation. Psychologically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Al-Lawati (2019)</ref> said that the gap between the younger generation and the previous generation (their parents) occurred in terms of information technology, lifestyle, personality characteristics and work values. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Toronto (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Turner (2015)</ref>, Generation Z's motive for using technology frequently is to escape their struggle-prone offline world.</p><p>Technology acceptance model and innovation diffusion theory TAM is used in various studies that focus on the use of new technologies, intention to use and individuals' beliefs. Pioneered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Davis (1989)</ref>, TAM has key factors, namely, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, in influencing intention to use. Perceived usefulness has the meaning as a level where a person believes that the use of a particular system will be able to improve that person's work performance. On the other hand, perceived ease of use is defined as a level where a person believes that the use of a particular system can reduce a person's effort in doing something. Basically, TAM, which is a development of the theory of reasoned action (TRA), has the aim of studying why users accept or reject new technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Silva, 2015)</ref>. Not only that, but also how to improve the level of user acceptance of the new technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Silva, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In line with TAM, IDT focuses on the accepted model by adopting several variables, namely, relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability and observability <ref type="bibr">(Rodgers, 1995)</ref>. First, the relative advantage is defined as the extent to which the user's perception can accept the advantages offered by the new technology compared with the previous one. Second, compatibility is considered as the perception of the suitability of the new technology with experience, values, needs and beliefs. Third, complexity, in this case, is a risk that arises in the use of new technology. Fourth, the trialability is the ease with which new technology can be tested. Fifth, observability is the perception of the extent to which the innovation results are similar. The link between IDT and this research lies in the risks that arise from the adoption of ZIS mobile payment technology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT)</head><p>Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is a theory developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref>, which combines several theories. Technology acceptance model, JIABR 13,4 TRA, social cognitive theory, motivational model, theory of planned behavior, Combined TAM and TPB, IDT and model of PC utilization are part of UTAUT. UTAUT proved to be more successful than the other eight theories in explaining up to 70% of user variance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref> found constructs that are determinants of intention to use. These constructs were found when evaluating the models of the eight theories. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref> found the main constructs that play an important role as a direct determinant of behavioral intention (BI) and user behavior, namely, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, SI and FC. Several empirical results show the suitability of the UTAUT model in studying acceptance of course management <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Marchewka and Kostiwa, 2007)</ref>, mobile banking <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Yu, 2012</ref>), E-healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arfi et al., 2021)</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Venkatesh et al. (2012)</ref>, UTAUT developed into UTAUT 2. UTAUT 2 added the construct of hedonic motivation, price value and experience habits. However, UTAUT 2 still needs to be applied to various countries, ages and other technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses development Perceived risk and trust</head><p>The IDT proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Rogers (1995)</ref> shows that there are risks that arise in the use of new technology. Perceived risk (PR) as measured by indicator PV and SC, is one of the factors that can reduce the level of sustainable use of technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cheung and Lee, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Flavi an and Guinalíu, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Black et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kuisma et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Laukkanen and Lauronen, 2005)</ref>. This indicates that PV and SC have an impact on TR in using new technology. Risk factors have been shown to play an important role in the case of consumer behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dowling and Staelin, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mitchell, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Stone and Grønhaug, 1993)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bauer (1960)</ref> has found two important components of risk, namely, uncertainty and consequences. Risk is described by the uncertainty and logical consequences experienced by users in using new technology. On the other side, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Havlena and DeSarbo (1991)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jacoby and Kaplan (1972)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Murray and Schlacter (1990)</ref> have divided risks into several types, such as financial, performance, time, physical, psychological and social risks. Financial risk is the risk of losing some material value due to the use of new technology. Performance risk is described as a risk that hinders user performance when using new technology. Time risk is the amount of time wasted when using technology. Physical risk is the risk inherent in physical activity, whereas psychological is related to the user's psychological condition. Social risk is defined by the risk to the user's social relationships. The point is that the dimensions of risk are very product-specific and can be independent of each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Laroche et al., 2004)</ref>. In other words, each product has its own risk specification dimensions.</p><p>Based on financial adoption research, PR in this study consists of security risk and privacy risk. Security risk is defined as the risk of security or data loss when using new technology, whereas privacy risk is the risk of their privacy being published and the loss of privacy space. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shih (2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cheng et al. (2006)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Püschel et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Thakur and Srivastava (2014)</ref> have found that security risk is one of the key factors that have an impact on the use of new technology. More specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Oktavendi and Mua'ammal (2021)</ref> prove that security and privacy risk have a negative influence on the use of ZIS digital payments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Tlemsani and Matthews (2020)</ref> explained that TR is an expectation that arises as a result of cooperation and honesty. The PR perceived by the user will have an impact on the level of user TR (indicator by <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Zarmpou et al. (2012)</ref>) in using the new technology. Research that has been done, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Al-Sharafi et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Oktavendi and Mua'ammal (2021)</ref>, proves that PR has a direct impact on TR in the use of mobile payment:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Zakat, Infaq, and Sodaqoh</head><p>Personal innovativeness and adoption readiness According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Thakur and Srivastava (2014)</ref>, perceptions of SI, usefulness, FC and ease of use are able to explain AR. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Davis (1989)</ref> created an intensive (TAM) model for using new technology. In the TAM model, it is concluded that to use technology, of course, look at how useful (PU) and Ease to use (PEOU)indicator by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Davis (1989)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Thompson et al. (1991)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Moore and Benbasat (1991)</ref> the technology is. The development of TAM to become UTAUT has created a new construct that plays an important role in the adoption of new technologies, namely, SI and FC. SI [indicator by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ajzen (1991)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Thompson et al. (1991)</ref>] is defined as the extent to which an individual feels how important it is that others believe that he or she should use the new system <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Thakur and Srivastava, 2014)</ref>. That is, a person's belief will arise because of the beliefs held by those closest to him in the use of new technology. On the other hand, FCindicator by <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Taylor and Todd (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ajzen (1991)</ref> is defined as the degree to which an individual believes that technical resources and infrastructure exist to support the use of the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>, which influences the end-use behavior of users. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Thakur and Srivastava (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Thakur and Srivastava (2014)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Behl and Pal (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Elango et al.

(2005)</ref>, which focused on wireless internet via mobile technology, found that PI had an effect on PU and PEOU. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lu (2014)</ref> found that PI only affects PEOU in the case of mobile commerce use. This is different from research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Thakur and Srivastava (2014)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lwoga and Lwoga (2017)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Shankar and Datta (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Leong et al.

If the root value of AVE (can be seen in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> bold and italic values) is greater than the value below it, then the discriminant validity is declared feasible. In Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, all AVE root values are greater than the correlation value. Outer model: second-order analysis In the second-order analysis, it is used to test the validity for AR and PR with the indicators.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inner model</head><p>Evaluation of the inner model (structural model) is carried out through testing the measurement index, namely, Adjusted R 2 . Based on Table <ref type="table">5</ref> shows that the factors in the The magnitude of the influence can also be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The next evaluation of the inner model (structural) is by looking at the results of hypothesis testing. The evaluation used a t-test with a significant level of 0.05 (t-statistic &gt; t table). The t-test was used for hypothesis testing, which was carried out through the bootstrapping procedure in the smart PLS program. The significance level used is 95% (a = 0.05) with a t-table of 1.96. If the t-statistic value is less than 1.96, then the hypothesis is not supported.</p><p>Hypotheses testing results can be seen in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>. These results show that all t statistical values (except PR BI) are greater than 1.96 (t table ). Therefore, all hypotheses are supported, except for H5, which is the effect of PR to BI. All of the hypotheses that are supported show a positive effect, but the effect of PR on TR has a negative value, which means that the higher the risk, the lower the TR.</p><p>BI. In the case of ZIS digital payment, especially in Generation Z, AR, Risk, TR and PI have an important role in shaping BI. AR, as measured by usefulness, ease of use, facilitation condition and social influence, has a significant impact on the BI to use ZIS digital payment. These results are relevant to several findings from several studies on mobile payments <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ghalandari, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Islam et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thakur and</ref><ref type="bibr">Srivastava, 2013, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Yang et al., 2021)</ref>. Generation Z's readiness to adopt ZIS digital payments can be seen from the ease of use, usefulness, FC and SI factors. According to Generation Z, the ease and usability of a digital application reflect that the application is worth using. Generation Z's readiness to adopt digital applications is also reflected in the conditions of supporting facilities and the influence of their trusted people. This readiness then encourages Generation Z to continue using ZIS digital payments. Based on the results of the analysis, the risk does not affect BI, but has an impact on TR. In IDT theory, when viewed from the point of view of complexity, that risk will arise in line with the adoption of new technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Rogers, 1995)</ref>. This risk will have an impact on TR, which will then affect interest in adopting new technology.</p><p>BI of Generation Z is also influenced by PI and TR. Generation Z's response to an innovative technology to be adopted affects their BI <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lee, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Massoro and Adewale, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Oktavendi and Mua'ammal (2021)</ref>, the small risk in ZIS digital payments increases the sense of TR in Generation Z toward the technology. This risk consists of security and privacy risk. Generation Z takes care of their data security and privacy. Therefore, in the context of ZIS digital payment, Generation Z will see how safe the technology is to continue to be used in their activities.</p><p>AR. Generation Z, in terms of "adoption readiness" is influenced by PI. Generation Z's innovative sense of early-adopting ZIS digital payments not only plays a role in shaping their BIs but also their AR. The higher the sense of innovation in Generation Z, the stronger their readiness to adopt ZIS digital payment. These results were supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Thakur and Srivastava (2014)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lwoga and Lwoga (2017)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Shankar and Datta (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Leong et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Generation Z as a "gadget literate" generation, has an important role in the future era. In terms of ZIS digital payments, Generation Z has several motivating factors to continue using this technology. Starting from the innovative sense, security and privacy risks, as well as a reflection factor of AR (ease of use, usefulness, FC and SI) to use ZIS digital payments. It is important to focus on these factors to successfully implement digital payments in ZIS payments. In terms of digital payment methods, it must have very high ease and usability. In addition, the mitigation of security and privacy risks also needs to be carried out optimally. The specifications of the digital payment method must also be adjusted to the general conditions of Generation Z so that they feel that the surrounding facilities are suitable for using this payment method.</p><p>The theoretical implications of the results of this study are for the development of a new technology adoption model. The results show that several reflective models of AR and PR support the model offered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Thakur and Srivastava (2014)</ref>. The model in this study develops the model offered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Thakur and Srivastava (2014)</ref> by adding the TR factor. As a result, TR has a role in increasing BI. Therefore, this study can be used to understand the attributes of the acceptance of the ZIS digital payment model.</p><p>On the other hand, this research has practical implications for the success of cashless ZIS payment transactions. In the case of ZIS payments through digital payments, the Amil Zakat Institution must pay attention to the legality of the digital payment service provider. This aims to reduce the risk of hacking. In addition, the Amil Zakat Institution has to start introducing ZIS payment technology through digital payments by showing various conveniences and uses. If the adoption of ZIS payment technology through digital payments is successful, it will have an impact on many things, from transaction speed to the speed of financial information that is useful in making management decisions.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the respondents are only Generation Z, so there may be different results for other Generations. Second, respondents are not only users but also those who only know about ZIS payments through digital payments. This will lead to less than optimal research results because there may be different perceptions between those who have used it and those who only know about it but have never used it. Further research can use the mixed method to strengthen the results of the study. In addition, further researchers can consider the results of the analysis between users and nonusers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1.
