<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Dual-income families are challenged by several issues in terms of conciliation between the working environment, the family context and the management of children. This paper, consistently with spillover and crossover hypotheses, aimed at examining the intermediate role of work-family balance, linking on work-family organizational support, work-to-family enrichment and conflict as predictors, and on family-life satisfaction of dual-income families' both partners as final outcomes. It was expected that work-family organizational support would be related to lower work-to-family conflict and higher enrichment and, through them, with higher work-family balance; moreover, a positive association between work-family balance and family-life satisfaction of both partners was assumed. 390 double-income heterosexual couples participated in our study; 76.2% of the couples were parents. Structural equation modelling results showed that work-family balance was negatively predicted by work-to-family conflict and positively predicted by work-to-family enrichment. Furthermore, work-family organizational support positively predicted work-to-family enrichment, which also mediated its effect on work-family balance. Crossover and spillover effects were also confirmed, given that positive associations between work-family balance and family-life satisfaction of both partners were found. Implications for future research and organizational interventions aimed at both improving work-family balance and promoting greater satisfaction in family life are discussed.</p></div>

According to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics (2018), for example, from every 100 American families, 80.5% have at least one family member who is in employment and 48.3% of them are dual income households, where both partners work.</p><p>With this backdrop, employees and employers are interested in measures that may promote work-family balance: employees look for organizations that can facilitate their being a member of a family where both partners work and thus have a complex series of work-family needs. Employers are also aware of this social shift and the consequent needs, and respond by trying to offer better working conditions in terms of flexibility, parental and family leave, etc.</p><p>Typing "work-family best place to work" on the Google search engine returns 128 million results, with a series of rankings within the top results: Business Insider, Great Place to Work, Money -Time Magazine, Indeed.com, Forbes and so on. It can be argued that organizations are nowadays increasingly conscious that fostering employees' work-family balance may provide benefits. As a result, they publicize their change of attitude and practice, applying for rankings and legitimating themselves as work-family friendly organizations to employees, customers and suppliers. This involves offering formal work-family support and also promoting a shift in organizational culture and climate, which results also in informal work-family support.</p><p>We may usually consider a wide array of options and benefits designed to alleviate the burden of managing work and family (e.g., supportive leave policies, company kindergartens, flexitime, etc.) as sitting within the label of formal work-family support. It is well known, however, that a series of "organizational phenomena that are not mandated or proscribed by formal organizational policies or programs" <ref type="bibr">(Behson, 2005, p. 488</ref>) can also have a fundamental role in justifying and supporting the implementation and legitimization of these benefits, namely informal work-family support. In fact, it can often be the case that official policies do not have the intended effect as they do not bring with them an equal change in organizational culture and climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allen, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>To explain, employees may fear the negative repercussions associated with benefiting from these allowances (e.g., being highlighted as workers with low commitment or a lower desire for upward mobility) and, consequently, they decree their failure.</p><p>One of the most popular concepts in this area is work-family culture, defined as "the shared assumptions, beliefs, and values regarding the extent to which an organization supports and values the integration of employee's work and family lives" <ref type="bibr">(Thompson, Beauvais, &amp; Lyness, 1999, p. 394)</ref>. In this analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Thompson et al. (1999)</ref> outlined three main factors of work-family culture: work-family organizational support (henceforth WFOS), career consequences related to the use of work-family programs and working time expectations hindering the fulfilment of the family role. Among them, the most prominent is WFOS, which is the extent to which employees perceive their managers and the organization as being supportive in helping them find a balance between work and family domains. WFOS has been extensively linked with reducing work-family conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Mauno, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mauno, Kinnunen, &amp; Pyykkö, 2005)</ref> and increasing work-family enrichment <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lo Presti &amp; Mauno, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Peeters, Wattez, Demerouti, &amp; de Regt, 2009)</ref>, while its association with work-family balance has received less empirical attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carlson, Grzywacz, &amp; Zivnuska, 2009)</ref>. Work-family balance can be considered a novel variable in the work-family research field that is clearly distinct from conflict and enrichment. It is increasingly used in research on work-family interface and requires further attention and empirical investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Grzywacz &amp; Carlson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Orkibi &amp; Brandt, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Lo <ref type="bibr">Presti, Molino, Emanuel et al.</ref> Starting from these considerations and building on the Spillover-Crossover Model (SCM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2013)</ref>, the present paper aims at examining the intermediate role of work-family balance. It links WFOS, workto-family enrichment and conflict as predictors on one side, and the family-life satisfaction of dual-income families' partners as final outcomes on the other side. It is predicted that WFOS will be related to lower work-tofamily conflict and higher enrichment and, through them, to higher work-family balance; this latter will finally lead to higher family-life satisfaction for both partners. Thus, this paper addresses four main shortcomings in current literature: a) it examines the role of WFOS as a job resource that can impact on both work-family con- </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Foundation</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Grzywacz and Carlson's (2007)</ref> definition, work-family balance is the "accomplishment of role-related expectations that are negotiated and shared between an individual and his/her role-related partners in the work and family domains" (p. 458). Later, several scholars called for a differentiation between this construct and both work-family enrichment and conflict; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Grawitch, Maloney, Barber, and Mooshegian (2013)</ref> stated that workfamily balance is "distinct from conflict and facilitation [i.e., enrichment], as it is concerned with global perceptions of how one is allocating resources among domains rather than how domains are conflicting with or facilitating each other" (p. 277). Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Casper, Vaziri, Wayne, DeHauw, and Greenhaus (2018)</ref> argued that "our findings and other recent evidence <ref type="bibr">[…]</ref> suggest that balance is distinct from conflict and enrichment, but how these variables relate to each other is not well-understood" (p. 201). They also called for further research in order to differentiate these constructs.</p><p>Work-family conflict is considered "a form of inter-role conflict in which the demands of work and family roles are incompatible in some respect so that participation in either the work or family role is more difficult because of participation in the other role" <ref type="bibr">(Greenhaus &amp; Beutell, 1985, p. 77)</ref>, while work-family enrichment is considered "the extent to which experience in one role improves the quality of the life in the other role" <ref type="bibr">(Greenhaus &amp; Powell, 2006, p. 73)</ref>.</p><p>The present study builds on the SCM of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bakker and Demerouti (2013)</ref> to explain the complex interplay between WFOS (i.e., a job resource) and work-family conflict and enrichment in terms of the family-life satisfaction of both the focal person (i.e., the spillover effect) and his/her partner (i.e., the crossover effect). This is done through the mediation of work-family balance.</p><p>The spillover theory can be traced back to about 40 years ago, when <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kanter (1977)</ref> argued that "occupations contain an emotional climate as well that can be transferred to family life. A person's work and relative placement in an organization can arouse a set of feelings that are brought home and affect the tenor and dynamics of family life" (p. 47). As for crossover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Westman (2001)</ref> defined it as "the reaction of individuals to the job stress experienced by those with whom they interact regularly" (p. 717). It has been mainly studied with refer-Crossover and Spillover Effects in Dual-Income Couples 64 ence to work-family interference to understand how experiences lived in the work and family domains "cross over" from a person to his/her partner <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Parasuraman &amp; Greenhaus, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>More recently, the SCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2013)</ref> combined both the spillover and crossover theories, proposing that work-related experiences first spill over to the home domain, and then cross over to the partner through social interaction. The SCM is based upon the Job Demands-Resources model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2008)</ref> which proposed that every job may be described in terms of working conditions, namely job demands and job resources. According to the SCM's spillover mechanisms, while job demands are hypothesized to spill over into the home domain resulting in higher work-family conflict, job resources should enable higher workfamily enrichment. In terms of SCM's crossover mechanisms, it is expected that an individual's positive or negative experience will cross over to her/his spouse both directly (i.e., emotional contagion) and indirectly (i.e., by interpersonal exchange). We propose that work-family balance, as defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Grzywacz and Carlson (2007)</ref>, can be considered to be a proxy of interpersonal exchange. This was also theorized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bakker and Demerouti (2013)</ref>, as it emphasizes the accomplishment of role-related expectations between the couple's partners. This is consistent with authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Casper et al., 2018)</ref> who stressed the relational component of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Grzywacz and Carlson's (2007)</ref> work-family balance definition, in opposition to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Valcour, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Hypotheses</head><p>As for the interplay between work-family enrichment, conflict and balance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carlson et al. (2009)</ref>  H1a: Work-to-family conflict will be negatively associated with work-family balance.</p><p>H1b: Work-to-family enrichment will be positively associated with work-family balance.</p><p>As anticipated earlier, it is possible that other factors apart from work-to-family conflict and enrichment may affect work-family balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carlson et al., 2009)</ref>. Among job resources, a preeminent role can be attributed to WFOS. Consistently with hypotheses 1 and 2, we suppose that WFOS will have a positive relationship with work-family balance, mediated by work-to-family enrichment and conflict. In detail, in previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Carlson &amp; Perrewé, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cohen &amp; Wills, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Seiger &amp; Wiese, 2009)</ref>, social support from different sources, Lo Presti, Molino, Emanuel et al.</p><p>including from organizations and supervisors, showed a positive association with work-family conflict. However, a meta-analytic review <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Michel, Kortba, Mitchelson, Clark, &amp; Baltes, 2011)</ref> demonstrated that social support received in both work and family domains had a negative association with work-to-family conflict. Other researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Frone, Yardley, &amp; Markel, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Glass &amp; Estes, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Greenhaus &amp; Beutell, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Greenhaus &amp; Parasuraman, 1999)</ref> examined the association between social support and work-family conflict, considering it to be an important antecedent of both family-to-work and work-to-family conflict. It was also found that support from supervisors and co-workers could decrease work-family conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bellavia &amp; Frone, 2005)</ref>. In recent years, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kossek, Pichler, Bodner, and Hammer (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Selvarajan, Cloninger, and Singh (2013)</ref> found that workplace social support was significantly negatively associated with work-to-family conflict. Summing up, consistent with the SCM positive spillover hypothesis, it can be expected that WFOS will diminish work-family conflict.</p><p>This will occur because the availability of informal work-family support from co-workers, supervisors and the organization could be helpful in either removing or coping with potential job aspects that are detrimental to the individual's work-family interface. Accordingly, we expect the following:</p><p>H2a: WFOS will be negatively associated with work-to-family conflict.</p><p>Evidence about the association between WFOS and work-family enrichment is sparse compared to that pertaining to work-family conflict. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Peeters et al. (2009)</ref> found a positive relationship between work-to-family enrichment and work-family culture and a mediation of work-to-family enrichment in the relationship between work engagement and burnout. Later, Lo <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Presti and Mauno (2016)</ref> found that WFOS positively predicted work-tofamily enrichment, over and above work-family barriers (i.e., the negative side of work-family culture). From a theoretical point of view, WFOS can be considered as a specific form of organizational support <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Rhoades &amp; Eisenberger, 2002)</ref>. It is well-known that when people feel supported by their organizations, they tend to maximize resources at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Rhoades &amp; Eisenberger, 2002)</ref> which, in turn, may have positive effects on their private and family lives. Put differently, people who perceive a higher WFOS will be more likely to bring positive resources obtained in the work domain to their family life. A higher WFOS allows individuals to feel that their socio-emotional needs are satisfied in their job role resulting in a higher performance and better mutual behaviour (i.e., expansion hypothesis; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Marks, 1977)</ref>. This positive psychological experience may then be applied to family life (i.e., work-to-family enrichment). Thus, consistent with the SCM positive spillover hypothesis, it is expected that the availability of family-friendly informal support within an organization could provide the individual with a greater number of resources that, in turn, can be transferred from the work to the family domain:</p><p>H2b: WFOS will be positively associated with work-to-family enrichment. and 2, we can also hypothesize that:</p><p>H3a: WFOS will be positively associated with work-family balance.</p><p>H3b: The association between WFOS and work-family balance will be mediated by work-to-family conflict.</p><p>H3c: The association between WFOS and work-family balance will be mediated by work-to-family enrichment.</p><p>As stated above, the experience of WFOS will result in increased work-family balance through the joint processes of increased work-to-family enrichment and reduced work-to-family conflict. Therefore, individuals will encounter more positive experiences and feel more stimulated and inspired at work. Probably, reflecting the SCM, they will also continue to enjoy the resources and benefits acquired after returning home (i.e., the spillover hypothesis), displaying greater happiness, enthusiasm and confidence in interacting with their partner and children. This could in turn increase family satisfaction and consequently (according to the crossover hypothesis) partner's satisfaction.</p><p>Regarding available evidence about spillover effects, several scholars reported significant associations between work-family balance and improved marital and family satisfaction levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allen, Herst, Bruck, &amp; Sutton, 2000)</ref>. This in turn resulted in improved family performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Frone et al., 1997)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Milkie and Peltola (1999)</ref> found a positive association between work-family balance and conjugal happiness and even with a more balanced distribution of domestic work. Similar results have been found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Clarke, Koch, and Hill (2004)</ref> who reported that a greater balance between work and family resulted in improved marital satisfaction and time spent in domestic activities. Therefore, considering these results and this theory, we hypothesize that higher levels of balance between work and family domains could have an association with positive outcomes in family life. Therefore:</p><p>H4a: Work-family balance will be positively associated with the focal person's family-life satisfaction.</p><p>H4b: The association between WFOS and the focal person's family-life satisfaction will be mediated by work-family balance.</p><p>As for crossover effects, though previous cross-sectional studies examined the crossover of life satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Demerouti, Bakker, &amp; Schaufeli, 2005)</ref>   </p></div>

Participants were all healthy adult subjects who participated anonymously and the procedure did not involve medical treatment nor cause any kind of discomfort; therefore, further ethical consent was not required, according to the Institutions. The Helsinki Declaration <ref type="bibr">(World Medical Association, 2001)</ref> and the Italian laws of data protection <ref type="bibr">(Legislative Decree No. 196/2003)</ref> were adhered to in this research. Involvement in the research was anonymous, voluntary and not rewarded. Information about the study aims, anonymity, voluntary participation and the treatment of data was provided along with instructions for filling out the questionnaire.</p><p>When agreeing to fill out the questionnaire, all study participants provided their informed consent. Participants were contacted within participant organizations by trained researchers. Once availability to participate was obtained, participants received an envelope containing the questionnaire. It consisted of several sections where the final one was reserved for the focal person's spouse. s A letter of presentation and instructions for both partners were also included; they were asked to fill in those sections dedicated to them separately, without making any interpersonal comparisons. Once the questionnaire was filled in, participants were asked to seal and return the envelope to the trained researchers either directly or indirectly through sealed urns left within organizations.</p></div>

Descriptive statistics and correlations were calculated through IBM SPSS 24 in order to investigate associations between variables. Measurement and structural equation models were analyzed through Lisrel 9.3; the method of estimation was Maximum Likelihood.</p><p>We applied the item parceling technique to create parcels of items belonging to a same variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Little, Cunningham, Shahar, &amp; Widaman, 2002)</ref>. Item parceling was applied to all constructs (statistics are available under request from the first author): work-family organizational support (3 parcels for 9 items), work-to-family conflict (3 parcels for 5 items), work-to-family enrichment (3 parcels for 3 items), work-family balance (3 parcels for 6 items), satisfaction with family life (3 parcels for 5 items), and partner's satisfaction with family life (3 parcels for 5 items).</p><p>As for goodness-of-fit indices, we referred to chi square difference test to assess differences between nested models; moreover, according to literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cudeck &amp; Browne, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hooper, Coughlan, &amp; Mullen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hoyle, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref> we considered the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Goodness of Fit Index (GFI), the Standardized Root Mean square Residual (SRMR), and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA).</p><p>Since we used a self-report questionnaire, we addressed response and common method biases following suggestions by <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff (2003)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows results of descriptive and correlation analyses.  As for control variables, being a woman meant a lower likelihood of having a permanent employment contract (r = -.15, p &lt; .01) and a higher likelihood of having a partner with a permanent contract (r = .17, p &lt; .01). The number of children positively correlated with permanent employment contract (r = .24, p &lt; .001), thus implying that permanent employees have a higher likelihood of having more children. Being a permanent employee showed a weak negative correlation with work-family organizational support (r = -.13, p &lt; .05). Control variables did not show any other correlation with study variables, thus we did not consider them in further analysis.</p><p>After controlling for parcels' normality, checking whether Kurtosis and Skewness values were lower than ± 1.96 <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Schaufeli, Bakker, &amp; Salanova, 2006)</ref>, we used Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to test the construct validity of all measures. We compared different nested models, where the first one was the one-factor model and the final one was the model with one factor for each study measure (in our case six factors). Chi square/degrees of freedom values and other goodness of fit indices were used to compare the different solutions.</p><p>The three measurement models tested were: a one-factor model (M1), a three-factor model (M2: work-family organizational support, the three mediators as a whole factor, the two outcomes as a whole factor), and a six-Lo <ref type="bibr">Presti, Molino, Emanuel et al.</ref> factor model (M3: encompassing the six study variables as separate factors). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows fit indexes of each model. A remarkable improvement of all goodness of fit indexes can be observed between M1 and M2, and between M2 and M3. In particular, M3 showed satisfactory goodness of fit indexes (χ 2 = 364.96, df = 120, CFI = .96, GFI = .90, SRMR = .04, RMSEA = .07) providing support for construct validity of all six study variables.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carlson et al., 2009)</ref>, the association was stronger for work-to-family enrichment. Therefore, the study sustained evidence formerly presented in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carlson et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Casper et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Greenhaus &amp; Allen, 2011)</ref> about the difference between work-family balance and the other two variables. It also highlighted the role of work-to-family enrichment and conflict as being determinants of work-family balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Grawitch et al., 2013)</ref>. Consistent with <ref type="bibr">Carlson and colleagues (2009)</ref>, work-family balance is achievable despite experiences of work-to-family conflict. Our results suggested that conflict between demands from the two roles, i.e. work and family, may decrease an individual's ability to accomplish socially negotiated role-related responsibilities and expectations from the two sides. Yet this ability may be improved by the enrichment process, according to which positive experiences in one role, i.e., work, may increase the quality of life in the other, i.e., family. These findings highlighted how important promoting work-to-family enrichment is, as well as preventing and addressing work-to-family conflict, in supporting employees' positive chances of meeting the requirements of both roles.</p><p>Hypothesis 2 introduced the organizational factor WFOS as a job resource, in order to investigate its association with both a) work-to-family conflict and b) work-to-family enrichment. Despite evidence suggesting a negative association between workplace social support and work-to-family conflict (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bellavia &amp; Frone, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ghislieri, Gatti, Molino, &amp; Cortese, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Michel et al., 2011)</ref>, the present study did not confirm this association; thus, Hypothesis 2a was rejected. Thus, WFOS, which represents the perception that managers and the organ- crease work-family conflict. In that sense, the role of colleagues should also be considered, since concerns about their potential resentment, the so called 'work-family backlash' <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ghislieri et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Young, 1999)</ref>, could prevent a person from fully benefitting from organizational and supervisory support. On the other hand, according to the SCM, Hypothesis 2b was confirmed, since a strong positive association between WFOS and work-tofamily enrichment emerged. Support from the organization and supervisors can potentially improve the quality of work experience, in turn fostering work-to-family enrichment.</p><p>Hypothesis 3a suggested there would be a positive direct association between WFOS and work-family balance and the results supported this, confirming a positive relationship between social support and work-family balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ferguson et al., 2012)</ref>. Moreover, a mediational role, suggested by the SCM, of both 3b) work-to-family Hypothesis 4a stated that work-family balance would be positively associated with the focal person's family-life satisfaction and results confirmed that finding a balance between family and work roles may foster satisfaction with family-life. This supports previous studies that highlighted a similar pattern with different outcomes, such as conjugal happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Milkie &amp; Peltola, 1999)</ref>, marital satisfaction and time being invested in domestic chores and activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Clarke et al., 2004)</ref>. Hypothesis 4b, which investigated whether work-family balance could mediate the association between WFOS and family-life satisfaction, was also confirmed, supporting the spillover effect that was hypothesized in this study.</p><p>Finally, Hypothesis 5 considered the crossover effect, considering the partner's family-life satisfaction as an outcome. Particularly, Hypothesis 5a suggested there would be a positive association between work-family balance and the partner's family-life satisfaction and Hypothesis 5b introduced the intermediate role of work-family balance as a mediator between WFOS and the partner's family-life satisfaction. The results confirmed both hypotheses supporting spillover-crossover effects that were assumed in this study. These findings provided evidence that the improvement of interpersonal exchange, as confirmed by the ability to accomplish role-related expectations by the focal-person, may crossover to the partner. This may result in greater satisfaction with his/her family-life, mediating the association of organizational support, as suggested by the SCM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Studies</head><p>Among the limitations of this study, the first to be mentioned pertains to the cross-sectional design, which did not permit to infer cause-effect relationships between variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Podsakoff, MacKenzie, &amp; Podsakoff, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Given the nature of the study's hypotheses, future research should be carried out through longitudinal or diary approaches. Thus, relationships between considered constructs and influences over time could be further investigated, potentially providing stronger support for spillover and crossover effects. Regarding data, one strength of the study is that it involved both family partners; nevertheless, it used uniquely self-reporting data, Crossover and Spillover Effects in Dual-Income Couples raising the possibility that common method bias might have influenced results <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Conway, 2002)</ref>. Future studies might also include other-reported data, for instance supervisors or colleagues' reports or cross-evaluations from partners. Moreover, objective data should also be considered, such as information about work-family policies and strategies adopted within organizations.</p><p>Another main limitation pertains to the convenience sampling procedure, since it precludes the generalizability of the results. However, it must be noted that no differences have been found comparing studies in the workfamily field whose samples had been collected differently <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Frone, 2003)</ref>, and that convenience sampling is adequate when the aim is to obtain higher heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Landers &amp; Behrend, 2015)</ref>. Moreover, the study involved only inter-gender couples, excluding same-gender ones. Research within specific organizational contexts or sectors would also be helpful to better understand dynamics related to work-family organizational support. The procedure itself might also present some limitations; despite the fact we provided instructions that requested each partner to fill out the questionnaire separately, we were unable to control or monitor if, or to what extent these instructions were adhered to. Additionally, although our sample may appear unbalanced with respect to the employment contract distribution given the higher percentage of permanent employees, it must be noted that it is consistent with the more general Italian situation (82.98%; Instituto Nazionale die Statistica [ISTAT],</p><p>2019).</p><p>Regarding study hypotheses, in future research, the crossover effect of family to the work domain <ref type="bibr">(Lo Presti et al., 2016)</ref> could also be considered. Thus, it could be verified whether stressors experienced by one individual in the family domain may crossover to the work domain of his/her partner <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mauno &amp; Kinnunen, 1999)</ref>. Moreover, qualitative research in the field of crossover literature could support the understanding of the dynamics of transfer from one partner to the other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Practical Implications</head><p>Despite its limitations, this study contributed to work-family literature and may provide indications for organizational interventions. First, findings highlighted the role a supportive work-family culture plays in improving employees' abilities to balance family and work domains and in enhancing the quality of their, and their partners', family life. Informal and formal work-family balance strategies, interventions and policies should be developed within organizations, with constant monitoring of their impact, efficacy and effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carlson et al., 2009)</ref>. Among formal policies, organizations could consider flexible work designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hoeven &amp; Zoonen, 2015)</ref> and welfare initiatives to facilitate daily administration. Finally, knowledge on crossover between partners may be used to support both employees and organizations <ref type="bibr">(Bakker, Demerouti, &amp; Schaufeli, 2005)</ref>. In particular, employees could develop a better awareness about their Lo Presti, Molino, Emanuel et al.</p><p>own and their partners' feelings, attitudes and perceptions regarding the intertwining of work and family lives.</p><p>This knowledge could then be used to address the potential needs of the couples.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>flict and enrichment, b) it disentangles the differential effects of conflict, enrichment, and balance on family-life satisfaction, c) it examines the relationship between work-family balance and family-life satisfaction of both partners of dual-income families and d) it tests the SCM in the Italian context, also integrating the concept of work-family balance. From a practical standpoint, organizational interventions aimed at fostering WFOS (e.g., training supervisors to be sensitive to their subordinates' needs) and developing work-family balance (e.g., training employees to improve their ability to balance work and familial demands and responsibilities) could also improve satisfaction with family life.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Ferguson,</head><label></label><figDesc><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Carlson, Zivnuska, and Whitten (2012)</ref> argued that "very little is known about the role of social support in relation to work-family balance and the accomplishment of role-related expectations that it embodies" (p. 300). Later in their study, they observed a positive relationship between co-worker social support and work-family balance. Additionally,<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Greenhaus et al. (2012)</ref> hypothesized that work-family interference (i.e., a concept similar to work-family conflict) would mediate the relationship between family-supportive supervision and workfamily balance, finding a total mediation. Later,<ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Talukder, Vickers, and Khan (2018)</ref> found that among different types of support offered in a job, having empathic supervisors (i.e., accommodating, able to listen to employees and be sensitive to their personal and family needs) may play an important role in helping employees achieve a better work-life balance. Summing up, we can argue that work-family sensitive sources of social support are beneficial in integrating work and family roles. This is also consistent with the SCM which stated that the effects from job resources and demands on interpersonal exchange (i.e., work-family balance) would be mediated by Crossover and Spillover Effects in Dual-Income Couples work-family conflict and enrichment. Taking into consideration what was discussed in relation to hypotheses 1</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, most of them have focused on negative experiences, neglecting the positive side of work-family balance crossover. Some scholars have found that positive experiences such as life satisfaction or happiness can be exchanged between partners<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Demerouti et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rodríguez-Muñoz, Sanz-Vergel, Demerouti, &amp; Bakker, 2014)</ref> and emotional contagion literature has been used to explain the crossover of positive feelings (Sanz-Vergel &amp; Rodríguez-Muñoz, 2013). More recently,<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ferguson et al. (2012)</ref> discovered a positive association between work-family balance and the partners' family satisfaction levels. According to the SCM, the improvement of interpersonal exchange, proven by the ability to accomplish role-related expectations by the focal-person (i.e., work-family balance), could foster positive reactions and attitudes in his/her spouse, resulting in heightened family-life satisfaction. Based on extant literature, we hypothesize that: H5a: Work-family balance will be positively associated with partner's family-life satisfaction.H5b: The association between WFOS and partner's family-life satisfaction will be mediated by workfamily balance.LoPresti, Molino, Emanuel et al.  </figDesc></figure>

Consistent with indirect effects results and taking into consideration discussion of previous hypotheses, we can reject Hypothesis 3b and confirm 3c. In other words, WFOS has the potential to foster work-family balance directly as well as through work-to-family enrichment as a mediator. The positive association between work-family support received from the organization and the accomplishment of role-related responsibilities and expectations in the family and work domains can be considered an original contribution of this paper to work-family literature and, particularly, to the SCM. This contribution is worth addressing through interventions that will be discussed later.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_10"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Supervisors and colleagues may thrive through informal support. With this in mind, organizations could provide training opportunities to employees, particularly supervisors. These could improve knowledge of the positive implications of a family-supportive culture and highlight best practices to foster it. As the study showed, a good work-family balance may also positively relate to the family life satisfaction of both partners. As a result, managers and executives should create an environment that helps employees to achieve this balance, reducing conflict and enhancing enrichment. As for the promotion of work-family enrichment, it appears fundamental to encourage employees' professional development through training, tutoring and mentorship in order to foster the development of resources and competencies that can be used in the family domain as well.</figDesc></figure>
