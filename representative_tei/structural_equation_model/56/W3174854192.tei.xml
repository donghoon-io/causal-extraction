<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Shopping is an inevitable activity in people's lives and the effect of shopping on subjective well-being is a research topic of great interest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ni and Ishii (2019)</ref> call for further research to explore the impact of shopping on subjective well-being. Consumers shop not only to complete their daily purchasing tasks (i.e., utilitarian shopping value) but also to relax, have fun, and enjoy novelty, surprise, excitement and pleasure (i.e., hedonic shopping value) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Babin et al., 1994)</ref> which contributes to individual well-being (i.e., shopping well-being) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ekici et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>However, impulse buying could result in harmful consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akram et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Iyer et al., 2019)</ref> such as "financial problems, post-purchase dissatisfaction, and lower self-esteem" <ref type="bibr">(Boonchoo and Thoumrungroje, 2017, p. 5)</ref> or even have negative impact on the natural environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Zafar et al., 2021)</ref>. The literature thus currently has a gap regarding the role of impulse buying in shopping well-being or ill-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ekici et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Impulse buying is strongly promoted by pleasure and excitement <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Verplanken and Herabadi, 2001)</ref> but "is not free from cognitive processing" <ref type="bibr">(Shen and Khalifa, 2012, p. 400</ref>). Thus, it can be better explained by examining both cognitive and affective processes. As utilitarian value (cognitive benefits) and hedonic value (affective benefits) drive consumer purchases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Babin et al., 1994)</ref>, they are potential impulse buying determinants. Accordingly, the duality approach, considering both cognition and affect mental systems, has a high potential for determining the associations between shopping values and impulse buying.</p><p>The recent impulse buying research has been focused on personality traits such as sensation seeking, impulse buying tendency and self-identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Iyer et al., 2019)</ref> or the Big Five <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Miao et al., 2019)</ref>. Among these, self-control drives consumer buying behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Yim, 2017)</ref> and is validated as a determinant <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lo et al., 2016)</ref> or mediator <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Iyer et al., 2019)</ref> of impulse buying. The moderating role of self-control is implied in the reflective-impulsive model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hofmann et al., 2009)</ref>; however, to our knowledge, it is rarely adopted as a moderator in empirical impulse buying research.</p><p>In addition, existing studies on impulse buying only adopt either the offline environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Pornpitakpan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pradhan et al., 2018)</ref> or the online environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lo et al., 2016)</ref>, resulting in a lack of research comparing impulse buying in these two shopping contexts. Comparing impulse buying behavior in both offline and online settings contributes to a wider or deeper understanding of this buying motive <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aragoncillo and Orus, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>To bridge the identified research gaps, this study adopts the duality approach to: (1) investigate the impact of cognitive and affective impulse buying on shopping well-being; (2) investigate the cognitive and affective processes from shopping values to impulse buying; (3) examine the moderating effect of self-control on shopping values and impulse buying; and (4) compare the studied associations between offline and online shopping contexts. Our empirical findings support most of the hypotheses, contributing to the literature in four main ways. First, the study provides a better understanding of the role of both cognitive and affective impulse buying in enhancing consumers' shopping well-being. Second, this study extends the impulse buying literature by utilizing the duality approach. Third, self-control is validated as a significant moderator, highlighting the influence of consumers' personality on shopping. Finally, this study compares the examined associations between offline and online shopping contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature review</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The duality approach</head><p>In the extant literature, the duality approach has been widely adopted as a theoretical framework for studying consumer behavior (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Babin et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Johnson and Grayson, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kesari and Atulkar, 2016)</ref>. These two parallel processes are distinctive in terms of individuals' cognitive consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Evans, 2008)</ref>. Specifically, the first process is "conscious, slow, and deliberative" whereas the second is "unconscious, rapid, automatic, and high capacity" <ref type="bibr">(Evans, 2008, p. 256)</ref>. The duality approach, thus, includes both the cognitive and affective systems of human beings that contribute to a better understanding of consumer impulse behavior and wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Iyer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ozen and Engizek, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Verplanken and Herabadi, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Besides, "consumers purchase goods and services and perform consumption behaviors for two basic reasons: (1) consummatory affective (hedonic) gratification (from sensory attributes), and (2) instrumental, utilitarian reasons." <ref type="bibr">(Batra and Ahtola, 1990, p.159)</ref>.</p><p>Meanwhile, impulse buying is also related to both cognitive and affective processes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chan et al., 2017</ref> for a recent review). Furthermore, the reflective-impulsive model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hofmann et al., 2009)</ref> validates the influences of reflective and impulsive processes on behavior that is moderated by dispositional factors (e.g. self-control and working memory capacity). These findings make the duality approach a promising theoretical foundation for studying impulse buying and shopping well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective and shopping well-being</head><p>Subjective well-being can be defined as an individual's overall satisfaction with life, reflecting his/her positive evaluations regarding various aspects of it <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Diener et al., 1985)</ref>.</p><p>Subjective well-being relates to and can be built by an individual's state of well-being in several domains of life, such as social life, leisure and recreation, family life, work life, and health and safety, among others <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Sirgy et al., 2011)</ref>. Shopping is a "necessary and an inevitable activity" <ref type="bibr">(Ekici et al., 2018, p. 335</ref>) in several such domains. Consumer researchers have shown great interest in discovering the impact of shopping on consumers' quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ekici et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ni and Ishii, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In this research stream, shopping well-being is a facet of individuals' overall subjective wellbeing or quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(El Hedhli et al., 2013)</ref>. It is defined as "the degree to which consumers experience hedonic enjoyment and satisfaction of self-expressive needs through their shopping activities" <ref type="bibr">(Lee et al., 2014, p. 28)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ekici et al. (2018)</ref> characterize shopping well-being as the positive contribution of shopping to shoppers' quality of life. This study adopts the definition of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ekici et al. (2018)</ref> and considers shopping well-being as a component or facet of subjective wellbeing.</p><p>Shopping well-being is determined by several factors, including the shopping mall's functionality, convenience, safety, leisure, atmospherics, self-identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(El Hedhli et al., 2013)</ref>, utilitarian value and hedonic value <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(El Hedhli et al., 2016)</ref>. However, to our knowledge, the impacts of impulse buying on shopping well-being have been rarely investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impulse buying</head><p>Impulse buying is a buying style that is "mostly associated with an unplanned and sudden purchase, which is initiated on the spot, accompanied by a powerful urge and feelings of pleasure and excitement" <ref type="bibr">(Verplanken and Herabadi, 2001, p. S71-S71)</ref>. Prior researchers view impulse buying as rooted in an individual's personality, represented by impulse buying tendency (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Verplanken and Herabadi, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zafar et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zafar et al., 2020a)</ref>. Specifically, impulse buying tendency is a stable personality-based construct that includes both cognitive and affective aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Verplanken and Herabadi (2001)</ref>. Scholars widely agree on the affect-based characteristic of impulse buying <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pornpitakpan et al., 2017)</ref>, though impulse buying is not free from individual deliberation and cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Rook and Fisher, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Shen and Khalifa, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Xiao and Nicholson, 2013)</ref>. This study adopts the definition and measure of impulse buying tendency developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Verplanken and Herabadi (2001)</ref>.</p><p>The extant literature on impulse buying has several key gaps. First, as previously noted, it is unclear whether the consequences of impulse buying are positive or negative. Shoppers who buy impulsively can experience not only "financial problems, post-purchase dissatisfaction, and lower self-esteem" <ref type="bibr">(Boonchoo and Thoumrungroje, 2017, p. 5</ref>) but also novelty, surprise, selfindulgence and satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Xiao and Nicholson, 2013)</ref>. Second, existing empirical studies rarely compare impulse buying in the offline and online shopping contexts although these two shopping environments have advantageous features that facilitate impulse buying. In-store marketing activities (e.g. attractive displays, promotions) are determinants of impulse buying (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Iyer et al., 2019</ref> for a recent review), whereas ease of access, lower social pressure and excitement in the online shopping environment (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akram et al., 2018</ref> for impulse buying reviews) drive shoppers to buy impulsively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shopping values</head><p>The reason behind why people shop can be more thoroughly explained by both the utility and experiential benefits of purchases <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Varshneya et al., 2017)</ref>. The core idea is that in shopping, consumers are not only motivated by desire to maximize utility, but also by their emotional desires. Similarly, consumption activities relate to two main types of value (utilitarian and hedonic) serving as shopping's rewards that "maintain a basic underlying presence across consumption phenomena" <ref type="bibr">(Babin et al., 1994, p. 644)</ref>. Utilitarian value serves as the cognitive benefit of shopping because it represents the "work" aspect. Hedonic value, considered as the "fun" side of shopping, reflects "shopping's potential entertainment and emotional worth" <ref type="bibr">(Babin et al., 1994, p. 645-646)</ref>. This study adopts both utilitarian and hedonic values to examine the dual associations between shopping value and impulse buying.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-control</head><p>Self-control, considered a personality trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sela et al., 2017)</ref>, is defined as "conscious efforts to alter behavior, especially restraining impulses and resisting temptations" <ref type="bibr">(Baumeister, 2002, p. 129)</ref>. Self-control is one of the key factors driving an individual's conversion from what he/she "wants" to what he/she "should" <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sela et al., 2017)</ref>; thus, the decision is well-fitted to external constraints or long-term orientations instead of personal desires or temporary interests.</p><p>In the shopping context, self-control reflects shoppers' capacity to resist arrestable urges that result in impulse purchases <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Iyer et al., 2019)</ref>. Self-control also helps consumers keep their planned buying list unchanged <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Yim, 2017)</ref>. It can be inferred that buyers with low self-control are more likely to purchase impulsively, whereas those with high-self-control manage their purchases well. The predictive and mediating roles of self-control have been validated in several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Iyer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lo et al., 2016)</ref>. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of empirical evidence in the impulse buying literature regarding the moderating effect between shopping values and impulse buying.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual model and hypotheses development</head><p>Adopting the duality approach, this study proposes that shopping values significantly predict impulse buying via the dual process (cognitive and affective), which, in turn, determines shopping well-being. In addition, the dual relationship between shopping values and impulse buying may vary depending upon self-control. The proposed associations are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Research model</head><p>Impulse buying is considered a beneficial way of shopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pornpitakpan et al., 2017)</ref> because it provides feelings of self-indulgence, positivity and satisfaction for shoppers <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Xiao and Nicholson, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Rook and Fisher (1995)</ref> indicate that only 20% of the participants in their study reported negative evaluations after impulsive buying.</p><p>Further, consumers who have a high impulse buying tendency experience more arousal or pleasure <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(George and Yaoyuneyong, 2010)</ref>. Therefore, the dual process indicates that impulse buying positively predicts shopping well-being.</p><p>The impact of cognitive and affective impulse buying on shopping well-being may vary due to the shopping context (offline vs. online). Compared to offline shopping, online shopping is more efficient for shoppers because of various functional benefits, such as convenience, costeffectiveness and the time saved <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Nielsen, 2014)</ref>. Cognitive impulse buying leads to more online impulse purchases <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Verplanken and Herabadi, 2001)</ref> because the products purchased still function advantageously. Further, in the conventional shopping context, retailers and shoppers can directly interact and easily build social relationships; thus, offline shoppers are more emotionally influenced by providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chang et al., 2011)</ref>. The impacts of cognitive and affective impulse buying on shopping well-being across shopping contexts are hypothesized as follows:</p><p>H1a. Cognitive impulse buying is positively associated with shopping well-being in both offline and online shopping contexts.</p><p>H1b. Affective impulse buying is positively associated with shopping well-being in both offline and online shopping contexts.</p><p>H1c. The impact of cognitive impulse buying on shopping well-being is stronger online than it is in the offline shopping context.</p><p>H1d. The impact of affective impulse buying on shopping well-being is stronger offline than it is in the online shopping context.</p><p>Utilitarian and hedonic values drive consumer shopping behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Babin et al., 1994)</ref>, implying their potential influence on impulse buying. Underlined by the duality approach, cognitive impulse buying and affective impulse buying are considered the consequences of utilitarian value and hedonic value, respectively. Although impulse buying is characterized by few rational deliberations <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Verplanken and Herabadi, 2001)</ref>, it can benefit consumers by providing convenience, product utility, or lower price. These utilitarian benefits make consumers more comfortable with impulse purchases. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chan et al. (2017)</ref> show the positive influence of cognitive reactions on impulse buying although they are mainly based on and result in hedonic benefits to shoppers, such as excitement or joy, pleasure, or positive arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Xiao and Nicholson, 2013)</ref>, which, in turn, drive consumers to buy more impulsively <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Ozen and Engizek, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Online shopping is characterized by utilitarian benefits, such as convenience, costeffectiveness and time saving <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Nielsen, 2014)</ref>. Online shopping is also impersonal <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Zhou and Tian, 2010)</ref>, reflecting a lack of physical interaction between buyers and providers. In contrast, offline shopping is characterized by the richness of personal communication and interactions, and is thus more affective <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chang et al., 2011)</ref>. Therefore, one may expect that utilitarian value is more powerful in influencing cognitive impulse buying in the online shopping context, whereas hedonic value has a stronger impact on affective impulse buying in the offline shopping context.</p><p>Consequently, the dual associations between shopping values and impulse buying across shopping contexts are hypothesized as follows:</p><p>H2a. Utilitarian value is positively associated with cognitive impulse buying in both offline and online shopping contexts.</p><p>H2b. Hedonic value is positively associated with affective impulse buying in both offline and online shopping contexts.</p><p>H2c. The impact of utilitarian value on cognitive impulse buying is stronger online than it is in the offline shopping context.</p><p>H2d. The impact of hedonic value on affective impulse buying is stronger offline than it is in the online shopping context.</p><p>Self-control is a personality trait driving an individual to convert from what he/she "wants" to what he/she "should" <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sela et al., 2017)</ref>. Therefore, shoppers with high self-control keep their planned buying list unchanged <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Yim, 2017)</ref> and resist their impulsive buying urges <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Iyer et al., 2019)</ref>. Self-control failure, by contrast, drives shoppers to buy discounted products impulsively and even consider expensive products as inexpensive, resulting in impulse purchases <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Vohs and Faber, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>It can be inferred that shopping values subjectively determine impulse buying based on how well consumers control their buying desire. High self-control ability can mitigate the impact of shopping values on impulse buying because shoppers are more rational in buying. On the other hand, consumers with low self-control are more likely to buy impulsively to gain more utilitarian and hedonic benefits. For instance, sales promotion and website design (e.g. navigation and visual appeal) weaken self-control and, thus, increase the possibility of impulse buying <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lo et al., 2016)</ref>. Consequently, this study proposes that the dual associations between shopping values and impulse buying are subject to variation under the moderating effect of consumer self-control in the offline and online shopping contexts, as follows: H3a. Self-control negatively moderates the relationship between utilitarian value and cognitive impulse buying in both offline and online shopping contexts.</p><p>H3b. Self-control negatively moderates the relationship between hedonic value and affective impulse buying in both offline and online shopping contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research context and sample</head><p>The characteristics of shoppers in Vietnam have been described as "shop often, buy little" <ref type="bibr">(McDonald et al., 2000, p. 53)</ref>, which is derived from "a genuine joy of shopping" and "a lack of planning" <ref type="bibr">(McDonald et al., 2000, p. 53)</ref>. This reflects the nature of the impulse buying behavior of Vietnamese consumers. In Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is the leading city in terms of the 2019 Business-to-Consumer (B2C) transaction index (Vietnam E-business Index, 2019). Thus, consumers in HCMC actively engage in online purchasing, making them appropriate participants for studying impulse buying in both offline and online shopping contexts.</p><p>Adopting a convenience sampling method, a self-administered survey was conducted to collect data from two groups of consumers: offline and online shoppers in HCMC. The survey questionnaires were translated into Vietnamese and, after a pretest to ensure understandability, were distributed conveniently to the participants. The questionnaires included the same statements but targeted either offline shopping or online shopping by asking the participants to first specify an e-tailer or a supermarket they most frequently purchased from within the last three months. A target sample size of 300 was established for each consumer group. For the offline shopper group, 278 of 300 distributed questionnaires were returned; for the online shopper group, 272 of 300 distributed questionnaires were returned. The elimination of incomplete and missing responses resulted in a sample size of 266 offline and 263 online shoppers. The characteristics of the online and offline consumer groups are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample characteristics</head><p>The offline group consisted of 60.50% female and 39.50% male shoppers, who were mostly between 26 and 39 years of age (accounting for 63.90%). Most of these consumers made purchases from retailers once or twice per month (44%) and earned a monthly income of approximately VND 5 million to VND 10 million (45.50%).</p><p>The sample of online consumers was mainly female (54.00%) aged 26 to 39 years (65.80%). Most of them made online purchases once or twice per month (66.2%) and earned a monthly income of around VND 5 million to VND 10 million (47.10%). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement</head><p>The survey questionnaire measured six constructs: utilitarian value, hedonic value, cognitive impulse buying, affective impulse buying, shopping well-being and self-control. The scales measuring utilitarian and hedonic values were borrowed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Voss et al. (2003)</ref> and included six items for each value. Four items measuring cognitive impulse buying and four more measuring affective impulse buying were borrowed from the scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Verplanken and Herabadi (2001)</ref>. Shopping well-being was operationalized using five items borrowed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ekici et al. (2018)</ref>. Five items were adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Tangney et al. (2004)</ref> to measure self-control. 1 Thinking about shopping, I feel that my shopping contributes significantly to my own personal well-being.</p><p>2 Thinking about shopping, my quality of life would diminish significantly if I don't shop.</p><p>3 Thinking about shopping, I feel that shopping makes me happy.</p><p>4 Thinking about shopping, I feel that shopping contributes significantly to my quality of life overall.</p><p>5 The quality of life of my family would diminish significantly if I don't shop.</p><p>Self control (SC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Tangney et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">I am lazy.</head><p>This study used both a 7-point Likert scale and a 7-point semantic differential scale. The 7-point Likert scale was used to measure cognitive impulse buying, affective impulse buying, shopping well-being and self-control, whereas utilitarian value and hedonic value were measured using the 7-point semantic differential scale. This was aimed at reducing the potential agreement bias, with the items measured by different scaling methods randomly positioned in the questionnaire.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement validation</head><p>This study employed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to validate the measurement instruments. Specifically, the performed saturated model indicated good indices: χ2(322) = 684.27 (p = 0.000), GFI = 0.92, CFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.95, and RMSEA = 0.05. Compared to the thresholds (χ2/df ≤ 3; GFI, CFI, NFI, and TLI &gt; 0.90; and RMSEA &lt; 0.08) suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hu and Bentler (1998)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hair et al. (2010)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kline (2011)</ref>, the saturated model was well fitted to the data. Two items measuring affective impulse buying and self-control were deleted because of their low factor loadings (λ &lt; 0.50). All CFA factor loadings of the other items were above 0.5, and statistically significant (λ ≥ 0.54; p &lt; 0.001), indicating that all constructs possessed unidimensionality and convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Steenkamp and van Trijp, 1991)</ref>. In addition, the discriminant validity test (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">III</ref>) yielded satisfactory results because the correlation estimates of any pair of constructs were lower than the average variance extracted for each construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Common method bias</head><p>Common method bias potentially occurs in studies using a self-report, in which participants answer all questions at the same time <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. Thus, this study adopted several remedies to control and assess this issue. First, either a Likert or a semantic differential scale was adopted to measure the studied constructs that were placed randomly in the questionnaire in order to minimize potential bias. Second, a Harman test <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref> was also conducted that resulted in poor fit indices, indicating that the CFA single factor model was not well fit to the data: χ2(350) = 5028.11 (p = 0.000), GFI = 0.49, CFI = 0.42, TLI = 0.37 and RMSEA = 0.16, in comparison to the indexes of the CFA trait model. Third, a marker variable (habit, measured by three items adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hsu et al., 2015)</ref> that was theoretically unrelated to the studied constructs was included in the questionnaire. The marker analysis showed that the difference in correlation estimates of the constructs before and after the appearance of the marker variable was 0.004 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Malhotra et al., 2006)</ref>. Thus, the marker did not account for correlations between the studied constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lindell and Whitney, 2001)</ref>. A t-test analysis was also conducted to compare the correlation coefficients of the constructs between the model with the marker and the model without the marker. The results indicated that the correlations between the two models were not statistically different (p = 0.936). Thus, even when a common method bias existed, this was not a serious problem in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses testing</head><p>This study incorporated the moderator (i.e., self-control) in the theoretical model, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cortina et al. (2001)</ref>. Specifically, this study employed one indicator for the interaction between each shopping value (i.e., utilitarian value and hedonic value) and self-control.</p><p>Utilitarian value, hedonic value and self-control were unidimensional constructs. The composite value of these constructs was calculated by averaging the corresponding items <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gerbing and Anderson, 1988)</ref>. Note that the mean-deviated value was used for the interaction to avoid multicollinearity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cronbach, 1987)</ref>.</p><p>The results of the SEM analysis (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">IV</ref>) showed that the model possessed satisfactory fit indexes: χ2(286) = 905.27 (p = 0.000), CMIN/DF = 2.59, GFI = 0.89, CFI = 0.95, TLI = 0.94 and RMSEA = 0.06. In addition, H1a (p &lt; 0.000) and H1b (p = 0.000) were statistically significant, supporting the positive association between impulse buying and shopping well-being.</p><p>H2a (p = 0.011) and H2b (p &lt; 0.000) were also supported, reflecting the positive influence of utilitarian value and hedonic value on cognitive impulse buying and affective impulse buying, respectively. The results also supported both H3a (p = 0.006) and H3b (p = 0.045), validating the moderating effects of self-control on the dual associations between shopping values and impulse buying.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1a</head><p>Cognitive To compare the proposed relationships in the offline and online shopping contexts, this study employed multigroup analysis with structural equation modeling and separate data sets for each shopping context. By releasing the structural model path by path and then comparing the χ 2 of the constrained model to the χ 2 of the unconstrained model, this study tested the hypotheses on the moderation effect of the shopping context statistically. The results showed that the impact of cognitive impulse buying on shopping well-being in the offline and online contexts was statistically different (p = 0.017), supporting H1c. Specifically, cognitive impulse buying influences shopping well-being more strongly in the online shopping context (0.312 vs. 0.051).</p><p>However, the association between affective impulse buying and shopping well-being did not show significant differences in the two shopping contexts (p = 0.607). Similarly, the influences of utilitarian value on cognitive impulse buying and hedonic value on affective impulse buying in the offline and online shopping contexts were not significantly different (p = 0.607 and p = 0.272 respectively). Thus, the results did not support H1d, H2c and H2d. The details of the multigroup analysis are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">V</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and implications</head><p>The findings show that both cognitive and affective impulse buying are positively associated with shopping well-being. This is contradictory to <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Silvera et al. (2008)</ref>, which showed that the cognitive facet of impulse buying was negatively associated with subjective well-being, while affective impulse buying and subjective well-being were unrelated. Note that existing studies mainly consider impulse buying as an affect-based behavior, ignoring its cognitive aspect <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pornpitakpan et al., 2017)</ref> and dominantly adopt the stimulus-organismresponse (SOR) to study impulse buying <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chan et al., 2017)</ref>. Therefore, this research contributes to the existing literature by validating both the affective and cognitive processes of impulse buying and introducing an appropriate approach for studying impulse buying tendencies -the duality framework. In addition, self-control is a significant factor moderating the dual associations between shopping values and impulse buying. While self-control's predictive and mediating roles have been widely examined <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Iyer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lo et al., 2016)</ref>, this study underlines the significance of self-control traits in understanding impulse buying tendency.</p><p>Finally, the impact of cognitive impulse buying on shopping well-being is stronger in the online shopping context than in the offline shopping context. This result differs from previous studies that generally suggest that online shopping is less impulsive than offline shopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aragoncillo and Orus, 2018)</ref>. Although physical interactions in conventional shopping can effectively influence shopping enjoyment, the online environment also makes shopping enjoyable. For instance, website displays affect consumers' pleasure and arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen et al., 2020)</ref>, and parasocial relationships with digital celebrities can drive online impulse buying <ref type="bibr">(Zafar et al., 2020b)</ref>. In addition, while online shopping is more convenient, cost-effective and timesaving <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Nielsen, 2014)</ref>, in-store shopping allows shoppers to practically test product functions. These advantages of each shopping context may result in insignificant differences in the remaining associations between offline and online shopping contexts. While most impulse buying studies adopt either the offline <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Pornpitakpan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pradhan et al., 2018)</ref> or the online shopping context <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lo et al., 2016)</ref>, this research is among the first to compare offline and online impulse buying. These findings serve as the basis for theoretical and practical implications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical implications</head><p>First, existing studies show controversial consequences of impulse buying that either negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boonchoo and Thoumrungroje, 2017)</ref> or positive <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Xiao and Nicholson, 2013)</ref>. Further, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ni and Ishii (2019)</ref> call for further exploration of the influence of shopping on subjective well-being. As a result, this study contributes to the existing literature by supporting the positive consequences of impulse buying and validating the positive contribution of shopping.</p><p>Second, this study indicates that utilitarian value enhances cognitive impulse buying and hedonic value positively affects affective impulse buying. This result highlights the dual process of impulse buying from shopping values, proving that impulse buying is both affect-based and cognition-based. Scant evidence is available on how cognitive processes influence impulse buying, as most existing studies focus on the affect-based characteristics of impulse buying <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pornpitakpan et al., 2017)</ref>. This finding also validates the appropriateness of the duality approach in studying impulse buying behavior. While the SOR framework is dominantly adopted (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chan et al., 2017</ref> for a recent review), this study a new highly potential theoretical foundation for studying impulse buying.</p><p>Third, the influence of shopping values on impulse buying via dual processes was found to be negatively moderated by self-control. Existing impulse buying studies only examine the predicting or mediating role of the self-control trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baumeister, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Iyer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lo et al., 2016)</ref>, ignoring its moderating effect. This study is among the first impulse buying studies that validates the moderating effect of self-control, highlighting the significant role of selfcontrol as a general personality trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Tangney et al., 2004)</ref> in impulse buying research.</p><p>Fourth, by comparing offline and online shopping contexts, this research has demonstrated key differences and similarities among the studied associations. Specifically, the association between cognitive impulse buying and shopping well-being is stronger in the online shopping context than in the offline shopping context (0.31 vs 0.06). None of the other studied associations were significantly different across these shopping contexts. Note that existing studies have generally studied impulse buying in either the offline <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Pornpitakpan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pradhan et al., 2018)</ref> or the online shopping context <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chen et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, these results point to a new path for future research on impulse buying in different shopping environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical implications</head><p>For practitioners, the results show that providing more utilitarian and hedonic values helps to increase impulsive purchases. Thus, both in-store retailers and e-tailers should provide more utilitarian value (e.g. convenience, safety, cost, and time saving) and/or experiential benefits (e.g. entertaining, comfortable, and esthetically pleasing atmosphere) to influence consumers to make unplanned purchases. This is somewhat consistent with the managerial implications of some studies conducted in developed countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Yi and Jai, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cornish, 2020)</ref>, which indicate that retailers should provide value for money <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cornish, 2020)</ref> and an enjoyable purchasing experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Yi and Jai, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, the shopping well-being of online shoppers is more influenced by cognitive impulse buying than that of in-store consumers. Therefore, leveraging the cognitive impulse buying of online shoppers by increasing utilitarian value can significantly enhance the positive contributions of their purchases. Specifically, e-commerce managers should build the clear layout of their products and offer a variety of selection on websites that help save consumers' search costs. For instance, a well-designed retailing website can enhance online purchase experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lee and Lee, 2019)</ref>. Similarly, in the context of Taiwan, adding more website functions (e.g. recommender systems) is recommended for facilitating online impulsive purchases <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen et al., 2020)</ref>. It is hoped that consumers engaging in those activities may not be concerned about the time to carry out the task. In other words, they immerse themselves in such a pleasing online shopping atmosphere, resulting in shoppers' well-being.</p><p>Finally, the relationship between shopping values and impulse buying is negatively moderated by self-control. Therefore, retailers or e-tailers can provide solutions to mitigate its negative moderating effect. For instance, displaying related products on the same shelves or building good recommender functions of retailing websites (introduce related products appropriately) can be a great way to encourage impulsive buying <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions, limitations and future research directions</head><p>This study fills some key gaps in the existing literature by validating the positive contribution of shopping to subjective well-being inferred by the positive consequences of impulse buying. In addition, by adopting the duality approach, this study proves that impulse buying is determined by shopping values both cognitively and affectively. This finding validates the dual process of impulse buying and proves the appropriateness of the duality approach in studying this shopping motive. The moderating effects of self-control on shopping valuesimpulse buying linkages-are also evident. Finally, some key differences and similarities in the relationships among shopping values, impulse buying, and shopping well-being between shopping contexts (offline vs. online) are clarified. Consequently, this study represents a novel work on consumer behavior.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that it only partially examines the impact of shopping and subjective well-being, which is based on investigating impulse buying and shopping well-being associations. There are potentially other shopping motives besides impulse buying that future research should adopt to address the research issue more thoroughly. This study also provides additional evidence for the positive consequences of impulse buying. Future research on this topic should adopt a meta-analysis method to provide a more conclusive answer. Furthermore, although the survey approach is appropriate, it cannot explain the causal relationship between shopping values and impulse buying. Therefore, future research can adopt other methods (e.g. experiments) to better examine the causalities between shopping values and impulse buying.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><graphic coords="1,72.00,72.00,485.05,148.97" type="bitmap" /></figure>
