<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Advanced cancers, generally defined as cancers unlikely to be cured, significantly affect the quality of life (QOL) of patients and their family caregivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Unfortunately, advanced cancer is often not the only health problem that patients and caregivers face. Compared to the general population, people with cancer report a similar or higher prevalence of chronic health conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Evidence suggests that chronic diseases have a negative influence on patient QOL after a cancer diagnosis, but the extent of this influence among advanced cancers is not known <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Furthermore, little is known about how cancer caregivers' own chronic conditionsan indicator of caregiver health -influence caregiver well-being. As increased age is a significant risk factor for chronic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and cancer caregivers tend to be older <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, it is likely that the prevalence of chronic conditions in this group is high. Though various factors such as caregiver mental health and perceived burden have been identified as key predictors of cancer caregiver QOL at advanced stages of disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, considerations of caregivers' own health concerns are limited.</p><p>This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p><p>Interdependence theory, which focuses on how social interactions influence behaviors, provides a framework for investigating how the health problems of one member of the patient/caregiver dyad influence the health outcomes of the other. This theory describes both actor effects -in this case, the effects one person's health problems have on their own QOLand partner effects -or the influence of a person's health problems on their partner's QOL <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>For example, patient comorbidities may complicate patient symptom attribution and increase disease burden (actor effect) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In turn, this could influence the responsibilities of family caregivers and their QOL (partner effect) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Significant health challenges of family caregivers may influence both the quality and quantity of care they can provide to the patient, affecting the patient's QOL, another example of a partner effect. The existence of these partner effects have been little-explored in the advanced cancer context; however, this is especially important to consider given that the work of these caregivers may be more intensive than found in earlier stages of disease or for non-cancer conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>Yet, in spite of the challenges they face, patients with cancer and their caregivers often find ways to thrive. Meaning-based coping has been described as the positive reappraisal and reinterpretation of a stressor <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Patients who identify benefits or meaning from their cancer experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> or believe cancer contributes to their personal growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>may experience better QOL. The ability of family caregivers to find positive meaning in their cancer caregiving experience is also associated with improved outcomes, such as fewer depressive symptoms, lower perceived burden and better self-rated health <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. As a moderating variable, a negative This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. relationship between co-existing chronic conditions and QOL could be attenuated in individuals who engage in more meaning-based coping. As a mediating variable, meaning-based coping would help explain whyco-existing chronic conditions influence QOL. There is a noticeable lack of literature, however, exploring how non-cancer health problems affect patients' and caregivers' ability to engage in meaning-based coping after the cancer diagnosis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose &amp; Hypotheses</head><p>The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between co-existing health problems (patient comorbidities and caregiver chronic conditions) and QOL among patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers, and to assess the mediating and moderating role of meaning-based coping on that relationship. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1</ref> depicts the model used for this study. The specific hypotheses are as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1:</head><p>The number of patient comorbidities and caregiver conditions will be inversely associated with their own QOL and the QOL of their dyadic partner.</p><p>H2: The number of patient comorbidities and caregiver conditions will be inversely associated with their own meaning-based coping and the meaning-based coping of their dyadic partner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3:</head><p>Meaning-based coping will be directly associated with (a) patients' and caregivers' own QOL and (b) the QOL of the dyadic partner.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Comorbidities/conditions. Patients and caregivers responded to the following question:</p><p>"Do you have any other health problems (such as heart disease, arthritis, diabetes, etc.) at this time?" Respondents who answered "yes" then named their health problems. The number of comorbidities/conditions variable was based on a count of the number of problems reported. The maximum number reported at baseline was five (no limit was imposed). Comorbidities refer to the health problems reported by patients (cancer as the index condition); conditions refer to the health problems reported by caregivers.</p><p>Meaning-based coping. Meaning-based coping was assessed with four items from the benefit dimension of the Appraisal of Illness Scale (patients; α = .75) and the Appraisal of Caregiving Scale (caregivers; α = .70) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. An example item from this scale is "I've grown a lot since this situation began." This measure uses a 5-point Likert scale that ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Latent variables measuring patient and caregiver meaning-based coping were included.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis Strategy</head><p>The hypotheses were examined using the actor-partner interdependence mediation model or APIMeM <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. This model consists of three pairs of variables corresponding to each dyad member: predictor variables (comorbidities/conditions); mediator variables (meaning-based coping); and, outcome variables (QOL). The APIMeM captures actor and partner effects between members of a dyad. Bootstrapping and model constraints were used to test indirect effects suggested by the mediation models. An interaction term was added to the standard actorpartner interdependence model (APIM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> to test for moderation effects. All models included</p><p>This article is protected by copyright.

The indicators of adequate model fit for these indices are a non-significant chi-square statistic or a chi-square to degrees of freedom ratio of less than 2; a CFI above .90; and a RMSEA value of .05 or less <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Characteristics</head><p>Demographic information obtained from patients and caregivers at baseline is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>. The average age of patients was 60.5 years (SD: 11.5; range: 26-95) and of caregivers 56.5 years (SD: 13.4; range: 18-88). A majority of patients (62%) and caregivers (56.8%) were female. Approximately 80% of patients and caregivers were White.

The types of cancers reported by patients were breast (32.4%), lung (29.1%), colorectal (25.4%), and prostate (13.0%).

Among patients and caregivers, hypertension and heart disease were the most commonly reported comorbidities/conditions. ) and one-quarter of caregivers (23%) reported three or more comorbidities/conditions. There were also significant differences in their responses on two of the four items that comprised the meaning based coping latent variable (changes in relationships with others; inner strengths/resources). There were no significant differences in quality of life at baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses 1-4: Mediation Model</head><p>This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Supporting the study hypothesis, more comorbidities in patients (β=-0.12; p=0.005) were associated with lower patient QOL. Similarly, more caregiver conditions were associated with lower caregiver QOL (β=-0.12; p=.003). In addition, more conditions among caregivers was associated with lower QOL among patients (β=-0.11;p=0.02).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2: Influence of Comorbidities/Conditions on Meaning-Based Coping (XM)</head><p>Patient number of comorbidities were not associated with patient meaning-based coping; however, among caregivers, having more conditions was associated with lower meaning-based coping (β=-0.08; p=0.02). In addition, more patient comorbidities were associated with lower meaning-based coping among caregivers (β=-0.06; p=0.04).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3: Influence of Meaning-Based Coping on QOL (MY)</head><p>As expected, significant effects were found when examing the direct relationship between meaning-based coping and QOL. More meaning-based coping in patients was associated with higher patient QOL (β=0.26; p&lt;.001). Similarly, more caregiver meaning-based coping was associated with higher caregiver QOL (β=0.22; p=.006). In addition, more caregiver meaningbased coping was associated with lower patient QOL (β=-0.22; p=.019).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H4: Meaning-Based Coping as a Mediator (XMY)</head><p>This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Bootstrapping confirmed three significant mediation effects (a, b and d). First, there was a significant indirect effect (β=-0.02; 95% CI: -0.054, -0.002) of caregiver number of comorbidities on caregiver QOL, mediated by caregiver meaning-based coping (a). Given the evidence of a direct effect between caregiver conditions and caregiver QOL, these results confirm partial mediation. Second, there was a significant indirect effect (β=0.02; 95% CI: .001, .048) of caregiver number of comorbidities on patient QOL, mediated by caregiver meaningbased coping (b). Given the evidence of a direct effect between caregiver conditions and patient QOL, these results also confirm partial mediation. Lastly, there was a significant indirect effect (β=-0.01; 95% CI: -0.046, -0.001) of patient number of comorbidities on caregiver QOL, mediated by caregiver meaning-based coping (d). As there was no observed direct effect between patient number of condtions and caregiver QOL, these results (d) suggest a full mediation effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 5: Meaning-Based Coping as a Moderator</head><p>Meaning-based coping was also tested as a possible moderator of the relationship between comorbidities and QOL.

None of the interaction terms were significant.</p><p>This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>This study examined the relationship between co-existing health problems and quality of life among patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers, while investigating the mediating and moderating role of meaning-based coping on that relationship. Of particular interest was the influence of one individual's health problems on their own health outcomes (i.e., actor effects)</p><p>and the other person's health outcomes (i.e., partner effects). Findings suggest that as the number of patient comorbidities and caregiver conditions increased, their own QOL decreased. In addition, as caregivers' number of conditions increased, QOL reported by patients worsened.</p><p>Although cancer and non-cancer related studies have found a relationship between patient number of chronic conditions and QOL <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, this research has focused on the effect of an individuals' comorbidities on their own outcomes and has not focused primarily on the advanced cancer context.Findings from this study extend that research and indicate within the patient/caregiver dyad, the comorbidities/conditions of one member of the dyad have the potential to directly or indirectly affect the wellbeing of the other.</p><p>Associations were also found between the number of comorbidities/conditions among both dyad members and caregiver meaning-based coping. More comorbidities/conditions among patients and caregivers were associated with lower meaning-based coping among caregivers but not patients. Our findings lend support to previous studies showing that caregivers exhibit significant levels of psychological distress, especially as the patient's disease progresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Because caregivers likely bear the responsibility for managing their own health problems, as well</head><p>This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p><p>as the responsibility and burden of managing the patient's health problems, the negative impact of comorbidities/conditions on caregivers'ability to find meaning might be stronger. On the other hand, it is interesting to note that neither patient comorbidities nor caregiver conditions influenced patient meaning-based coping. The significance of advanced disease, a higher likelihood that the primary cause of patient mortality would be cancer and not co-existing conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>,could help explain why other patient/caregiver health problems posed no additional influence on patient meaning-based coping.</p><p>Meaning-based coping was found to mediate, but not moderate, the relationship between comorbidities/conditions and QOL. Specifically, onlycaregiver meaning-based coping helped to explain the negative relationship between patient comorbidities and caregiver conditions, as well as, patient and caregiver QOL. Previous research has identified caregivers as a primary source of emotional support for patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. As such, caregivers may play a significant role in setting the emotional tenor in the care-giving and care-receiving experience, helping to patients to reframe or find positive meaning in the illness. Hence, caregiver meaning-based coping emerged as an important pathway in the relationship between comorbidities/conditions and QOL.</p><p>Unexpectedly, increased meaning-based coping among caregivers was associated with decreased QOL among patients. A possible contributor to this finding could be the use of baseline data. While the diagnosis of advanced disease requires psychological adjustment on the part of both patients and caregivers, the time it takes to make that adjustment could differ. A previous study of posttraumatic growth in patients with advanced liver cancer found that, for all</p><p>This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p><p>but one of the dimensions assessed, patient's posttraumatic growth was unchanged for the first six months following diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The caregivers' ability to find growth and benefit, prior to the other partner being able to do so, could be a source of concern for the patient. In their discussion of meaning-making among individuals with advanced cancer, Lethborg and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>describes this process for patients as "dynamic", "bittersweet", and "taxing."</p><p>Challenges to the psychosocial health of individuals with a terminal illness cannot be understated. Patients may need more time than caregivers to make sense of their advanced disease and end-of life issues, adapt to the challenges they will face in the present and future, and identify areas of benefit and growth. It could also be the case that caregivers can more readily find tangible, meaningful ways that their lives have changed because of the cancer diagnosis because of their role in patient care and support. It will be important to examine this unexpected finding in future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The study collected data about the number and type of comorbidities/conditions of patients and caregivers using a self-report measure.While evidence supports the use of a selfreport measure to "count" chronicdiseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, data was not available on condition severity, comorbidities/conditions instead of a checklist could have resulted in underreporting of these health problems; however,previous research supports the use of self-report when examining psychosocial outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.Another limitation was that due the sample size and racial distribution in this study, testing differences between racial groups was not feasible.Research indicates that chronic diseases are a major contributor to poorer health outcomes among minority populations, such as African Americans <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.Testing differences between racial groups could help identify areas of risk and need. The study was also limited by the cross-sectional nature of the analysis, which precludes a determination of causality.Lastly, while significant, the indirect effects are small; however, it is important to note these estimates control for the influence of a number of patient and caregiver factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>A unique contribution of this study is the consideration of how patient comorbidities and caregiver chronic conditions influenced their QOL in the advanced cancer context. At advanced stages of disease, where curative treatment is no longer the goal, supporting and maintaining patient QOL becomes the most important goal. Thus, while advanced cancer may contribute more to patient mortality than their comorbidities, study results suggest that efforts to improve patient QOL should not ignore patient comorbid conditions -or the chronic conditions of their caregivers.</p><p>This study takes an important first step in identifying that in this sample of patient/caregiver dyads facing advanced cancer, a significant relationship was</p><p>This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Elucidating these mechanisms would identify important intervention targets. For example, in the practice setting, it may be useful to help patients and caregivers in skill-building and resource-finding that will help them manage their conditions individually, as a unit, and as often the case with multimorbidity, with multiple medical providers. Additional resources for caregiver assessment at the patient's care settings may be necessary for this to occur. Tailoring existing cancer-related interventions and chronic disease management programs could be beneficial for patient/caregiver dyads managing advanced cancer and other illnesses.</p><p>This article is protected by copyright.
