<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Innovative work behavior (IWB) refers to the generation and implementation of new ideas at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Escribá-Carda et al., 2017)</ref>. While the idea generation phase is the entry gate to the entire innovation process (Abdel <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aziz and Rizkallah, 2015)</ref> through identifying innovative solutions with the objective of seizing an opportunity or addressing a given problem, idea implementation is concerned with the phase of implementing innovative ideas at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Scott and Bruce, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>IWB has been extensively found to be important for the organization's survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Pieterse et al., 2010)</ref>, benefits (Yuan and Woodman, 2010) and competitiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Shanker et al., 2017)</ref>; this importance is reflected in the development of new products, services and organizational procedures, employee and firm effectiveness, and employee job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Janssen et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The prominent role that IWB plays at work has exhorted scholars to examine its positive associations with various factors such as work climate, leadership and personal traits (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hammond et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>It has been suggested that IWB is considerably contingent on organizational interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson et al., 2004)</ref>. As such, organizations can not be innovative without their members <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Birkinshaw et al., 2008)</ref>, including leaders <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hassi, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Vaccaro et al., 2012)</ref>. In fact, leaders exert tremendous influence on subordinates' IWB <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Basadur, 2004)</ref>. Given this context, the importance of leaders' role in organizational innovation has begun to attract the attention of scholars (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Caridi-Zahavi et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014)</ref>. Specifically, empowering leadership is a promising leadership style to examine in this regard given its enabling facets as reflected in its positive effect on IWB <ref type="bibr">(Cheong et al., 2016)</ref> and the fact that it intends to create autonomous and self-directed individuals.</p><p>Empowering leadership can be defined as a style of leadership that is mostly characterized by "behaviors that share power with subordinates" <ref type="bibr">(Vecchio et al.,2010, p.531)</ref>. It revolves around the meaning of employees' work, participation in decision making, removal of bureaucratic constraints, and increasing confidence in achieving desired performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahearne et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Empowering leadership also exhorts subordinates to display pro-active behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Martin et al., 2013)</ref> owing to the trust and confidence exhibited by empowering leaders <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Tuckey et al., 2012)</ref>. Thus, it is understandable why empowering leadership exerts a positive effect on creativity <ref type="bibr">(Zhang and Zhou, 2014)</ref>, management innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hassi, 2019)</ref> as well as product innovation, process innovation, and administrative innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lim and Gon, 2021)</ref>. However, only limited research has examined links between empowering leadership and IWB <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jada et al., 2019)</ref> and in a few industries, namely education (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gkorezis 2016)</ref>, hospitality <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Slåtten et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Wihuda et al., 2017)</ref>, and the pharmaceutical industry (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Jada et al., 2019)</ref>, and only in Western and Asian countries.</p><p>Further, these studies have mostly explored how job-linked factors, such as role conflict, knowledge sharing and role clarity, interplay between empowering leadership and IWB, while the role of other contextual antecedents of innovation such as climate for initiative and job autonomy have yet to be examined. Therefore, research is considerably needed to bridge this gap. In fact, researchers have scarcely investigated the impact of the interaction between leadership and organizational climate on innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Si and Wei, 2012)</ref>. In this respect, climate for initiative, which translates the degree to which a work environment is more or less supportive of personal initiative, is a determinant of behavior at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baer and Frese, 2003)</ref>; this is due to the fact that it significantly influences individuals' proactivity by means of impacting their mindset in regard to whether they can behave certain ways and on their motivation to behave that particular way <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Parker et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>On another note, as the nature of work is constantly and drastically changing and affecting work processes and organizational structures in present-day organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Wegman et al., 2018)</ref>, workers are pursuing increased flexibility and autonomy at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Grant et al., 2011)</ref>. Job autonomy is defined as "the degree to which the job provides substantial freedom, independence, and discretion to the individual in scheduling the work and in determining the procedures to be used in carrying it out" <ref type="bibr">(Hackman and Oldham, 1976, p. 258)</ref>. Therefore, organizations generally identify ways to promote innovation by emphasizing job autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mankins and Garton, 2017)</ref>; particularly, job characteristics (i.e., autonomy) have been shown to act as a driving force for IWB <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Oldham and Cummings, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Shipton et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In following the appeal to conducting research on business practices that promote the implementation of innovative behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Michaelis et al., 2010)</ref>, the present study aims at shedding light on the relationship between empowering leadership and IWB along the mediating effects of climate for initiative and job autonomy (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) within small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in manufacturing industries. In so doing, the current paper investigates the non-linear main effects of empowering leadership on a work-related outcome, namely IWB as recommended by <ref type="bibr">Cheong et al. (2019)</ref>.</p><p>We resort to CEOs' empowering leadership as it is relevant to innovation processes within organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lee et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lee et al.,2018)</ref>. Similarly, middle managers are key players in organizational innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Floyd and Wooldridge, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Heyden et al., 2018)</ref> owing to their knowledge of their firms and markets <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2018)</ref> as well as to their ability to make important innovation accessible to top managers and to contribute original knowledge in the innovation endeavors <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Glaser et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Climate for Initiative</head><p>empowering leadership is linked to IWB as empowering leaders create a climate for IWB by promoting knowledge sharing among their subordinates whose jobs are marked by role clarity.</p><p>Gkorezis (2016) concluded that empowering leadership and IWB are associated and there is a moderated mediation through exploration and role conflict. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Slåtten et al. (2011)</ref> found that empowering leadership positively affects IWB and this link is mediated by employees' creativity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Wihuda's et al. (2017)</ref> study revealed that empowering leadership is associated with employee service innovative behavior and this association is mediated by creative improvisation self-efficacy and employee engagement.</p><p>Empowering leaders exhort their followers to experiment innovative ways at work without running the risk of being subject to punishment in the advent of negative outcomes of their experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Jung et al., 2003)</ref>. Along the same lines, subordinates, who are empowered by their organizations, demonstrate creative behaviors at work (Chow, 2018) by aligning their desired outcomes with organizational goals as they find meaning in their professional roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Jung et al., 2003)</ref>. They are prone to be motivated to promote and exhibit IWB <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Krishnan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Yidong and Xinxin, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The first hypothesis is thus as follows:</p><p>Hypothesis 1: CEOs' empowering leadership is positively associated with middle managers' IWB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empowering leadership and organizational climate for initiative</head><p>Empowering leaders can promote and favor organizational climate for initiative because they (1) grant subordinates the freedom to take independent decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Forrester, 2000)</ref>, (2) encourage followers to act independently, take initiative, and promptly solve crises they confront at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kim and Beehr, 2017)</ref>, and (3) promote a solid sense of autonomy among followers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hon and Chan, 2013)</ref>. Therefore, empowering leadership behavior allows organizations to provide an initiative-friendly environment to its members. We draw on the above reasoning to argue that empowering leaders favor initiative-taking and build a climate for initiative within their organizations. Thus, we state:</p><p>Hypothesis 2: CEOs' empowering leadership is positively associated with climate for initiative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organizational climate for initiative and IWB</head><p>Climate for initiative is linked to IWB because personal initiative is associated with idea generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Binnewies et al., 2007)</ref> and innovation implementation in the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Michaelis et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Organizations with a strong climate for initiative promote IWB because their workers are granted discretion in the way they execute their tasks and they pursue working on their ideas until they transform them into valuable suggestions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Frese et al., 1999)</ref>. Further, subordinates who consider their organizations as having a strong climate for initiative believe that their senior managers can overcome obstacles in the process of innovation implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Michaelis et al., 2010)</ref>. Building on the above, this hypothesis can be made:</p><p>Hypothesis 3: Organizational climate for initiative is positively associated with middle managers' IWB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empowering leadership and job autonomy</head><p>Research has found that empowering leaders enhance the job autonomy of their subordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arnold et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kim and Beehr, 2017)</ref>. Conversely, low empowering leaders restrict granting autonomy to their followers <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2011)</ref>. Hence, we posit that empowering leaders grant subordinates autonomy in their job because of the following considerations. Empowering leaders support follower involvement in decision making and remove bureaucratic curtailments <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahearne et al., 2005)</ref>; they also urge subordinates to display pro-active behaviors and promote a solid sense of autonomy among subordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hon and Chan, 2013)</ref>. Hence, the following hypothesis can be proposed:</p><p>Hypothesis 4: CEOs' empowering leadership positively affects middle managers' job autonomy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Job autonomy and IWB</head><p>Work design theory is rooted in the assumption that some job or task characteristics (e.g., job autonomy) along certain aspects of the broader work environment engenders some psychological states that result in specific wok outcomes such as IWB <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Morgeson and Humphrey, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Job autonomy is vital for organizational success because the latter is oftentimes contingent on employees' behaviors that go above and beyond their standard work by demonstrating an increased level of work-related motivation and efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hernaus and Mikulić, 2014)</ref>, and innovative behavior rather than only performing tasks that are required as part of the job description (Van der Vegt and <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Janssen, 2003)</ref>. Along the same line, proximal work context features such as job autonomy have been found to be better predictors of employee creativity than distal features such as organizational policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Shalley and Gilson, 2004)</ref>. Particularly, job autonomy has been shown to permit translating innovation-related behaviors into innovation performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Burcharth et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>There is a body of literature supporting the effect of job autonomy on IWB (e.g., De Spiegelaere <ref type="bibr">et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hammond et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Slåtten et al., 2011)</ref> due to the following considerations. First, individuals are likely to commit to making creative work when they feel that they can choose the way to carry out their tasks <ref type="bibr">(Amabile et al., 1996)</ref>. Second, job autonomy permits people to experiment with new work-related approaches and techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(De Spiegelaere et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, as <ref type="bibr">Deci and Ryan's (1985)</ref> self-determination theory suggests, the sense of autonomy that individuals feel at work yields a sustained level of motivation to finding and implementing creative solutions. Hence, the following hypothesis can be made.</p><p>Hypothesis 5: Middle managers' job autonomy is positively associated with their IWB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indirect effects of CEOs' empowering leadership</head><p>The relationship between empowering leadership and IWB has been found to be mediated by exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gkorezis 2016)</ref>, knowledge sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jada et al., 2019)</ref>, and employee creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Slåtten et al., 2011)</ref> as well as creative improvisation self-efficacy and employee engagement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Wihuda's et al. (2017)</ref>. Further, except <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Slåtten's et al. (2011)</ref> work, these studies have mostly explored how personal and job-linked factors such as knowledge sharing interplay between empowering leadership and IWB, while the role of other contextual antecedents of innovation such as climate for initiative and job autonomy has yet to be examined. To contribute to bridging this gap, we posit both direct links between empowering leadership and IWB as well as indirect links through climate for initiative and job autonomy.</p><p>On one hand, organizational leaders' positive support impacts subordinates' initiative <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Ohly et al.,2006)</ref> which, in turn, exerts more discretion on the way subordinates perform their jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baer and Frese, 2003)</ref>. Empirical arguments have suggested that followers who perceive strong levels of climate for initiative respond more effectively to leaders' behaviors, in that they believe that obstacles will be tackled by top managers in the pursuit of implementation of innovation behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Michaelis et al., 2010)</ref>. On the other hand, job autonomy is expected to reinforce people's innovative behavior given that it revolves around discretion, flexibility and latitude granted by empowering leaders. Empirical evidence has demonstrated that job autonomy mediates the openness for innovation -innovation performance link <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Burcharth et al., 2017)</ref>. Based on the above, we can predict the following:</p><p>Hypothesis 6: There is an indirect, positive link between CEOs' empowering leadership and middle managers' IWB through organizational climate for initiative and job autonomy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>To test the research model of the present investigation, 800 firms located in six major cities in Morocco were approached. The list of these companies was obtained from a governmental source.</p><p>The selected companies had to have created a brand-new or considerably improved product or production process in the last three years <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(OECD, 2005)</ref>. To collect data for the current study, three separate questionnaires were utilized. The first one was destined for CEOs, presidents, or general managers (CEO for short). CEOs provided an assessment of the IWB of their middle managers who are responsible for the production departments. The second questionnaire was designed for the middle managers who provided data about the empowering leadership behavior of their respective CEOs, the job autonomy of their position (mediating variable) as well as their age, education, and company tenure. They were also asked about approximate age, education, and company tenure of their CEO. The last questionnaire gathered data about the second mediating variable (organizational climate for initiative) from four non-managerial employees working in the production division of the same firm.</p><p>The purpose of collecting data from three different sources within the same firm was, at least, twofold: (1) to obtain the right information from the right person: e.g., assessment of middle manager's innovative work behavior was carried out by the CEO would be more objective and less biased than asking the middle managers themselves; and (2) collecting data using three separate questionnaires allows reducing potential common method bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Podsakoff et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The survey questions were presented in French. The back-translation approach was utilized <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brislin, 1986)</ref> to translate the scales from English to French which is the language of communication generally adopted in the business milieu in Morocco <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Benzakour, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>No pilot study was conducted because no new scales were used; the scales used in the study were extensively validated across countries and industries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>Out of the 800 the firms that accepted to take part in the current research, 444 firms actually As per the education level, 16.4 % of the respondent CEOs have a high school degree or less, 21.6 % a college degree, 29.5% a bachelor's degree, 30% a master's degree, and 2.5% a doctoral degree. Most of the middle managers are male (68.9%). They have an average age of 37.7 years (SD = 6.07) and an average tenure in their present position of 7 years (SD = 3.89).</p><p>Concerning their education, 4.5% of the respondent middle managers have a high school degree or less, 14.2 % a college degree, 40.5% a bachelor's degree, 40.5% a master's degree, and 0.2% a doctoral degree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Responses to all items of the focal variables were measured with a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree).</p><p>Empowering leadership. We borrowed the scale created and validated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ahearne et al. (2005)</ref> which is comprised of four dimensions. These dimensions, which include three items each, are enhancing the meaningfulness of work, fostering participation in decision making, expressing confidence in high performance, and providing autonomy from bureaucratic constraints. Sample item is "My CEO believes in my ability to improve even when I make mistakes". This scale was used as a one-dimensional measure in the analyses. In order to obtain a more stable estimation of parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kline, 2015)</ref>, we proceeded with the theory-based item parceling technique of this measure yielding four parcels corresponding with the four dimensions of the empowering leadership scale.</p><p>Climate for initiative. We used the measure that was developed by <ref type="bibr">Frese et al. (1997)</ref>. Its seven items were slightly reformulated to be used at the organizational level for initiative. A sample item is "People in our company take initiative immediately -more often than in other companies".</p><p>Job autonomy. We used the following two-item scale from </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive analysis</head><p>Means, standard deviations, reliabilities and inter-correlations of the model variables are shown in  <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994)</ref>. Job autonomy has a Cronbach's alpha of .640 and the Spearman-Brown coefficient is 0.642 which is the most appropriate reliability coefficient for a two-item scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Eisinga, Grotenhuis, and Pelzer, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>These statistics that are under 0.700 threshold are probably due to the fact that the scale is comprised of two items only; nonetheless, the average inter-item correlation of job autonomy is 0.473, which is indicative of acceptable level of homogeneity <ref type="bibr">(Clark and Watson, 1995)</ref>. Several scholars support the adequacy of using single items for simple constructs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Freed, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Grapentine, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Leisen Pollack and Alexandrov, 2013)</ref> as they can be used in cases of sufficiently narrow constructs that are unambiguous to the respondents <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Freed, 2013)</ref>, so long as their reliability and validity are not affected <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Grapentine, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>The patterns of inter-correlations of the study variables are consistent with the related theoretical insights and research findings. CEOs' empowering leadership is positively linked to middle managers' job autonomy (r= 0.340, p &lt; .01) and IWB (r= 0.512, p &lt; .01) as well as climate for initiative (r= 0.251, p &lt; .01). In addition, middle managers' job autonomy is positively related to their IWB (r= 0.216, p &lt; .01). Lastly, climate for initiative is positively correlated with middle managers' job autonomy (r= 0.182, p &lt; .01) and IWB (r= 0.416, p &lt; .01).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model</head><p>Loadings of the scales' items were verified. As Table <ref type="table">2</ref> reveals, the values of standardized loadings ranged between 0.559 and 0.919. All the item loadings were statistically significant at the 0.001 level. To assess convergent validity and internal consistency of the research scales, the average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability (CR) statistics were computed <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref>. All the CR values are greater than the AVE values and the latter are higher than 0.5, indicating that the constructs were convergently valid and internally consistent; except for the empowering leadership scale which had a 0.483 AVE value.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion &amp; conclusion</head><p>The present study aimed to shed light on the connection between empowering leadership and IWB, while including two mediating variables, namely climate for initiative and job autonomy.</p><p>Specifically, this study revealed that firms which are led by empowering leaders, that enjoy a climate for initiative and that grant their middle managers (heads of production departments) autonomy in their job, are likely to have their middle managers exhibit IWB.</p><p>This study results suggest that empowering leadership is positively associated with IWB. These results corroborate findings that linked empowering leadership to IWB (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011)</ref> as empowering leaders encourage their subordinates to experiment with innovative ways at work independently from the fear of punishment in case of negative outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Jung et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Further, empowering leaders boost creativity in general (Zhang and Zhou, 2014) as they encourage followers to exhibit pro-active behaviors at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Martin et al., 2013)</ref> due to the trust and confidence they display <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Tuckey et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the positive association between empowering leadership and climate for initiative, empowering leaders permit their firms to provide an initiative-friendly environment to their subordinates. They give followers the freedom to make independent decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Forrester, 2000)</ref>, encourage a strong sense of autonomy among subordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hon and Chan, 2013)</ref>, and exhort subordinates to act independently, take initiative, and solve problems they encounter at work in a timely manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kim and Beehr, 2017)</ref>. On another note, the findings of the present study are aligned with previous research that has revealed that leaders who emphasize more task performance monitoring than innovation are considered by highly empowered subordinates as controlling and unmotivating, and instigate less IWB <ref type="bibr">(Pieterse et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The findings provide evidence that organizational climate for initiative is positively associated with middle managers' IWB. This is because personal initiative is linked to idea generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Binnewies et al., 2007)</ref> and innovation implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Michaelis et al., 2010)</ref>. In fact, firms that enjoy a strong climate for initiative encourage IWB by granting their members latitude and leeway in the way they accomplish their tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Frese et al., 1999)</ref>. In addition, employees who perceive their companies as having a strong climate for initiative believe that their top managers can remove obstacles during the innovation implementation course <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Michaelis et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>CEOs' empowering leadership has been found to positively affect middle managers' job autonomy. This conclusion is consistent with extant literature stating that empowering leaders enhance their followers' job autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arnold et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hon and Chan, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kim and Beehr, 2017</ref>) by, among others, involving them in decision making and removing bureaucratic restrictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahearne et al., 2005)</ref> as well as by urging followers to exhibit pro-active behaviors at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hon and Chan, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The current study shows that middle managers' job autonomy is positively associated with their IWB. This finding is in line with a few studies that confirmed the role of job autonomy in spurring IWB (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Burcharth et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">De Spiegelaere et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hammond et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Slåtten et al., 2011)</ref>. This association can be explained by the fact that workers tend be creative when they can choose the way to complete their tasks <ref type="bibr">(Amabile et al., 1996)</ref>. Further, job autonomy allows people to experiment with new approaches and techniques at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(De Spiegelaere et al., 2016)</ref>. Lastly, the feeling of autonomy that people sense at work results in a constant motivation to identifying and implementing creative solutions <ref type="bibr">(Deci and Ryan, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>The study demonstrates that climate for initiative and job autonomy mediate the empowering leadership-IWB link. These findings are in line with prior studies stressing the role of organizational leaders' support in positively influencing followers' initiative <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Ohly et al., 2006)</ref>, which, in turn, positively impacts the way followers carry out their jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baer and Frese, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, job autonomy has also been shown to mediate the relationship between openness for innovation and innovation performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Burcharth et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>An important strength of this study lies in collecting data from different sources. Middle managers provided data about the empowerment leadership behavior of their CEOs (independent variable) and the autonomy in their job (first mediating variable). Assessment of the middle managers' IWB (dependent variable) was conducted by the CEOs. Data about climate for initiative (second mediating variable) were gathered from non-managerial employees working in the production department. This data collection strategy aimed at reducing common method bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Podsakoff et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical and practical implications</head><p>This study has three main theoretical implications. First, it will add to the leadership literature by examining the relationship between empowering leadership and IWB of middle managers within SMEs in manufacturing industries; it is important to note that the extant literature has mainly focused on other leadership styles (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Choi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Yidong and Xinxin, 2013)</ref> and nonmanagerial employees' IWB with only a few studies that have investigated IWB of managers <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Michaelis et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Stock et al., 2019)</ref>. Second, while the extant literature sheds light on the way leadership favors and brings about managers' IWB <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2014)</ref>, the "when" or under what circumstances IWB takes place (e.g., in a climate for initiative) is still under-researched <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Lorinkova et al.,2013)</ref>. The findings indicate that CEOs' empowering leadership behavior spurs middle managers' IWB when climate for initiative is strong and job autonomy is granted to subordinates within SMEs in manufacturing industries in Morocco. Lastly, as the extant literature has mostly examined the way job-related factors interplay between empowering leadership and IWB (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gkorezis ,2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Jada et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Slåtten et al., 2011)</ref>, the current study expands the literature by examining the role of other contextual antecedents of innovation such as climate for initiative and job autonomy. Similarly, this study extends the conceptual boundaries toward an important economic sector, namely manufacturing and expands the geographical area by conducting research in an emerging country in the Middle East and Africa region (i.e., Morocco).</p><p>In terms of practical implications, this study has demonstrated that organizational leaders, who urge their middle managers to be innovative in their job, should adopt empowering leadership practices, in light of the case of SMEs in manufacturing industries in Morocco. Designing and providing leadership training programs and activities might assist in developing empowering leaders. Additionally, given the importance of individual innovation, several organizations oblige their members to perform their duties in a creative manner in order to boost organizational effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Robinson and Beesley, 2010)</ref>. To do so, the current study proposes that favorable climate for initiative can be an effective tool to spur organizational members' IWB. In fact, the climate for initiative encourages personal initiative <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baer and Frese, 2003)</ref>, and directs and supports positive behaviors in developing and implementing new ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Binnewies et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Frese and Fay, 2001)</ref>. Therefore, firms that seek to enhance the IWB of their workers ought to bank on the benefits of building a favorable climate for initiative. Lastly, job autonomy has been found to play the role of a mediator in the empowering leadership-IWB link. Thus, organizations should resort to job autonomy as a tool to exhort middle managers to display innovative behavior in their position by granting them independence and discretion in the way they carry out their tasks, particularly that job autonomy is a very influential job characteristic in motivating workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Morgeson and Humphrey, 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future research</head><p>This study has three limitations that should be dealt with in future research. As middle managers' IWB was 'subjectively' assessed by their CEOs, future research should use more objective measures to rate IWB. Furthermore, given that we sought to ensure a certain level of homogeneity of the climate of initiative, we included a sample of small and medium businesses; as result, the findings cannot be generalized to larger companies. Hence, future research should tackle the research problem in large firms. Lastly, given that the research design is cross-sectional, causeeffect relationships cannot be inferred. Thus, longitudinal design ought to be used in future research with the aim of assessing causality.</p><p>roles of connectivity and knowledge integration'', Journal of Product Innovation <ref type="bibr">Management,</ref><ref type="bibr">Vol. 33 No. 3,</ref> Chen, Y., Jiang, Y.
