<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Given limited work modeling the role of individual difference factors and processing variables in students' learning from multiple texts, such a model is evaluated in the present paper. In particular, this study models the relationship between cognitive (i.e., habits with regard to information evaluation) and affective (i.e., interest) individual difference factors and a variety of multiple text outcomes (i.e., integrated mental model and inter-text model development as facets of multiple text integration), as mediated by students' processing of multiple texts (i.e., time on texts; engagement in cross-textual elaboration). Interest and time devoted to text access were found to have a direct effect on integrated mental model formation, while time and students' engagement in cross-textual elaboration had a direct effect on inter-text model development. Additionally, time on texts mediated the relation between both individual difference factors and the integration-related outcomes examined. Implications for theory development and research on learning from multiple texts are discussed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Investigating the Cognitive Affective Engagement Model (CAEM) of Learning from Multiple Texts: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach</head><p>Learning from multiple texts is both an essential academic skill, necessary for students to understand complex topics like climate change, overpopulation, and the harms and benefits of social media use, and a critical real-world competency, necessary for students' success in the information age <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Braasch, McCabe, &amp; Daniel, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Goldman &amp; Scardamalia, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">List &amp; Alexander, 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Strømsø, Bråten, &amp; Britt, 2010)</ref>. Learning from multiple texts refers both to the processing required to understand and synthesize information presented across multiple texts and to the outcomes of such processing (e.g., construction of an integrated mental model of multiple texts). These processes are involved when individuals seek to decide on a political candidate, consider the benefits and drawbacks of a course of treatment, or, even, compare restaurant menus and reviews to decide where to go for dinner. Both multiple text processing and the resulting outcomes require that students select and coordinate a wealth of information, engage in deliberative and deep-level strategy use, and make metacognitive and epistemic judgments about information quality and their own understanding. In short, learning from multiple texts is complex and cognitively demanding. But, such learning is motivationally taxing, as well, with students' requiring topic interest and task investment to engage in the demanding cognitive processes that learning from multiple texts requires. In this study, based on the Cognitive Affective Engagement Model of Multiple Source Use (CAEM; <ref type="bibr">List &amp; Alexander, 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">2018a)</ref>, I examine the role of both cognitive and affective or motivational individual difference factors in students' learning from multiple texts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Difference Factors in Learning from Multiple Texts</head><p>A variety of individual difference factors have been investigated to determine the extent to which different students may be stymied or engaged by the complexity that learning from multiple texts presents. Individual difference factors refer to a somewhat reliable or stable set of learner characteristics that may be (a) directly assessed, independent of a specific learning task, (b) expected to vary across learners, (c) associated with and distinguishable from one another, and (d) meaningfully related to learners' processing and performance across a variety of tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Friedman &amp; Miyake, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Perfors &amp; Kidd, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Tavor et al., 2016)</ref>. Individual difference factors examined have included prior knowledge, epistemic beliefs, and argumentative reasoning skills, with these found to result in differences in task performance, both independently and in interaction <ref type="bibr">(Bråten &amp; Strømsø, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Burin, Barreyro, Saux, &amp; Irrazábal, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ferguson &amp; Bråten, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mason, Ariasi, &amp; Boldrin, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, the bulk of prior work examining the role of individual difference factors in students' learning from multiple texts has focused on factors that are "cold" or cognitive, rather than "warm" or affective, in nature. Recently, <ref type="bibr">List and</ref><ref type="bibr">Alexander (2017b, 2018a)</ref> have suggested that, in addition to focusing on the cognitive factors impacting multiple text use, affective or motivational factors ought be considered as well. In particular, <ref type="bibr">List and</ref><ref type="bibr">Alexander (2017b, 2018a)</ref> have introduced the Cognitive Affective Engagement Model of Learning from Multiple Texts to capture the joint role of cognitive and affective factors in students' multiple text comprehension and integration. In particular, the CAEM suggests that students' interactions with multiple texts, including both processing (e.g., time on texts and strategy use) and performance outcomes, are the result of students' assumption of one of four default stances, or general orientations, toward task completion. The default stances that students adopt are distinguishable according to learners' positioning along two dimensions reflecting their dispositions toward multiple text task completion. The first dimension, affective engagement, comprises students' motivation for task completion, including interest in and attitudes toward the topic of the task. It is this dimension that has been examined to the most limited extent in prior research. The second dimension, behavioral dispositions, captures the extent to which students are habituated or predisposed to engage in a variety of deep-level multiple text use strategies, including information evaluation and integration. The role of these two sets of factors are introduced in the CAEM as shaping students' processing and learning from multiple texts (see <ref type="bibr">List &amp; Alexander, 2017b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, 2018a</ref>, for a more detailed discussion of default stances; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Strømsø, Bråten, &amp; Brante, 2020</ref>, for an empirical analysis of CAEM default stances).</p><p>The CAEM, while based in prior empirical research, have yet to be fully investigated.</p><p>This study constitutes an initial step in validating the CAEM by considering the role of individual difference factors, both cognitive (i.e., students' habits with regard to information evaluation) and affective (i.e., interest), in students' learning from multiple texts. As suggested by the CAEM, students' relative positioning according to these factors (i.e., habits with regard to information evaluation, interest) should impact both processing variables (i.e., strategy use, time on texts) and performance. Performance in this study is expected to reflect students' learning from multiple texts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning from Multiple Texts</head><p>In this study, as in prior work, learning from multiple texts is considered to result in multiple text integration on the part of learners. In prior work, integration has been examined in three distinct ways. That is, integration has been examined as students' association of text-based information (a) with their prior knowledge (i.e., elaboration), (b) with other information presented in the same texts (i.e., intra-textual integration), or (c) with information presented in another, seemingly unrelated, text or texts (i.e., inter-textual integration). While students have been found to manifest all three of these types of integration when learning from multiple texts <ref type="bibr">(Anmarkrud, Bråten, &amp; Strømsø, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Du &amp; List, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">List, Du, &amp; Lee, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Wolfe &amp; Goldman, 2005)</ref>, this study specifically focuses on inter-textual integration or students' connection formation across texts. It does so both because students have been found to experience particular challenges with inter-textual integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Britt &amp; Aglinskas, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Britt &amp; Sommer, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cerdán &amp; Vidal-Abarca, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">List, Du, Wang, &amp; Lee, 2019</ref>) and because such integration has been viewed as an outcome unique to students' learning from multiple texts, rather than from a single text, alone.</p><p>Integration, within the context of learning from multiple text has primarily been conceptualized in terms of the Documents Model Framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Britt, Perfetti, Sandak, &amp; Rouet, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Perfetti, Rouet, &amp; Britt, 1999)</ref>. The Documents Model Framework suggests that integrating multiple texts involves two primary processes. First, students need to construct a single coherent representation of the common story or situation described across texts; this is done by linking redundant and complementary information presented across texts. Second, students need to tag information coming from individual texts to source(s) of origin (i.e., to answer the question: who said what?). This latter process allows students to deal with crosstextual conflict by comparing the source trustworthiness of conflicting pieces of information to decide which to privilege or to believe. Moreover, relating specific pieces of information to source(s) of origin allows these to be interpreted in light of author perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barzilai &amp; Weinstock, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">List, 2020a)</ref> and allows for cross-textual connections to be formed (e.g., recognizing that two authors agree or disagree with one another). These multiple text integration functions are accomplished by students constructing two cognitive representations of multiple texts, the integrated mental model and the inter-text model. The integrated mental model is a conceptualization of the central issue or situation described across texts. The inter-text model is a structural representation of multiple texts that captures both the relations among them and the links between content in texts and sources of origin (e.g., author).</p><p>While identifying important information and points of commonality across texts in the integrated mental model may be similar to the process of single text comprehension, carried out across multiple texts, tagging information from texts to sources of origin in the inter-text model represents a process unique to learning from multiple texts. To start, such tagging allows explicit conflicts to be resolved by comparing source trustworthiness. Moreover, this allows distinct but not necessarily conflicting points of view to be separately represented and understood as, potentially, the result of authors' differing perspectives. For instance, students learning about a complex topic, like trophy hunting, may expect distinct information to come from different domain perspectives (e.g., economic or ecological) or from the perspective of those engaged in trophy hunting vis-à-vis those whose communities host trophy hunters <ref type="bibr">(List, 2020b)</ref>. Further, students should expect not only to encounter differing perspectives but also for these perspectives to be key to appropriately interpreting the information introduced. Indeed, the understanding that different sources are likely to present different information in different ways and that such differentiation needs to be examined, and potentially resolved, in any cognitive representation of multiple texts may be understood as the fundamental feature of learning from multiple texts. That is, rather than just the assimilation of complementary and coherent information presented across texts in an additive fashion, learning from multiple texts is much more likely to involve processes like interpretation, corroboration, evaluation, and reconciliation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of Comprehension and Integration</head><p>Students' learning from multiple texts has been assessed in a variety of ways, including through students' completion of various objective measures tapping integrated mental model and inter-text model construction. The three most commonly used objective measures of learning from multiple texts have been the sentence verification task (SVT), the intra-textual inference verification task (Intra-IVT), and the inter-textual inference verification task (Inter-IVT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bråten, Strømsø, &amp; Britt, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gil, Bråten, Vidal-Abarca, &amp; Strømsø, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Strømsø et al., 2010)</ref>. The sentence verification task asks students to determine whether a variety of sentences, some accurate (i.e., originals, paraphrases) and others not (i.e., meaning changes, distractors), include the same information as was introduced across multiple texts. As such, this task can best be said to represent students' surface-level comprehension or basic understanding of information presented within particular texts. The intra-textual inference verification task asks students to identify statements, created by linking disparate ideas introduced within the same text, as valid or invalid in nature. The intra-textual inference verification task constitutes a measure of deeplevel, single text comprehension <ref type="bibr">(Strømsø, Bråten, &amp; Samuelstuen, 2008)</ref>. Finally, the intertextual inference verification task asks students to determine the veracity of statements generated by accurately or inaccurately linking statements across disparate texts. Thus the Inter-IVT may be said to tap students' multiple text integration, and, with its focus on content-based inferencing across texts, to target integrated mental model formation, in particular.</p><p>In addition to measures tapping students' integrated mental model formation, some measures have further tapped inter-text model development and, especially, students linking of source information (e.g., author) with texts' content. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Braasch, Rouet, Vibert, and Britt (2012)</ref> used a cued source recall measure to assess students' linking of content with source information from texts (i.e., recall of who said what), alongside students' citation use in writing.</p><p>Elsewhere, source-content integration tasks have been used to tap inter-text model development, with students asked to match text-based statement with one of four sources of origin <ref type="bibr">(Lund, Bråten, Brandmo, Brante, &amp; Strømsø, 2019)</ref>. These various measures, tapping both integrated mental model and inter-text model development and used extensively in prior work, have all be found to be associated with one another to various extents <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bråten et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bråten, Strømsø, &amp; Samuelstuen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hagen, Braasch, &amp; Bråten, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Strømsø et al., 2008)</ref>. Moreover, students have been found to struggle with these various measures, indicating the importance of considering individual difference factors and process variables in understanding students' learning from multiple texts. In this study, investigating the CAEM, I consider the role of cognitive and affective factors in students' integrated mental model and inter-text model development and the extent to which this is mediated by students' processing of multiple texts (i.e., deep-level strategy use and time devoted to text access).</p><p>More generally, this study contributes to prior work seeking to comprehensively model students' learning from multiple texts. Robust models, considering individual difference factors, process variables, and multiple text performance outcomes, have, thus far, been relatively rarely examined in understanding students' learning from multiple texts, with three notable exceptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling Students' Learning from Multiple Texts</head><p>Three key studies have previously sought to comprehensively model students' process of multiple text use. <ref type="bibr">First, Lund et al. (2019)</ref> examined the role of individual difference factors (i.e., prior knowledge, interest, gender) and text presentation format (i.e., with information presented across multiple texts or as one text) on students' learning from multiple texts, with learning assessed via a conflict verification task and a source-content integration measure. The conflict verification task, tapping integrated mental model development, asked students to determine whether or not a series of statements were consistent with or conflicted with other information they had read. The source-content integration measure, corresponding to inter-text model development, asked students to match statements from texts to sources of origin, or to indicate that the information did not come from any of the texts provided. Using path analysis, Lund et al. ( <ref type="formula">2019</ref>) found text presentation format as well as gender and prior knowledge to directly predict source-content integration performance. Moreover, they found presentation format as well as prior knowledge to predict conflict verification performance, which then served as a mediator for source-content integration. The path connecting interest to conflict verification performance did not rise to significance; however, interest was positively associated with gender and negatively associated with format of text presentation.</p><p>In the present study, I, like Lund et al. ( <ref type="formula">2019</ref>) look at integration outcomes tapping both integrated mental model and inter-text model construction. However, rather than examining conflict verification performance as mediating the relation between individual difference factors and source-content integration, I examine the role of processing variables as mediators of a host of multiple text outcomes. Further, like <ref type="bibr">Lund et al. (2019)</ref>, this study examines a variety of individual difference factors (i.e., interest, habits with regard to information evaluation) in association with students' processing and multiple text learning performance. <ref type="bibr">Kobayashi (2009a)</ref> similarly examined the role of prior knowledge and college experience, as individual difference factors, and students' summary notes, as a processing variable, on their recall of information in individual texts (i.e., recall of intratextual arguments) and comprehension of inter-textual relations. While <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kobayashi (2009)</ref> examined intratextual recall as a mediating factor in the study, students' use of summary notes was examined as an exogenous predictor, like prior knowledge and college experience. In fact, processing variables mediating the relation between individual difference factors and multiple text outcomes have, to my knowledge, only been examined in one prior study. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bråten, Anmarkrud, Brandmo, and Strømsø (2014)</ref>  processing variablesall within a single model (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The individual difference factors examined in this study include interest <ref type="bibr">(List, Stephens, &amp; Alexander, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Strømsø et al., 2010)</ref> and students' reported habits with regard to strategy use <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bråten &amp; Strømsø, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Firetto &amp; Van Meter, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">List &amp; Alexander, 2018b)</ref>. These have been found to be associated with multiple text learning in prior work. In addition to these individual difference factors, I also examine two primary mediators impacting students' learning from multiple texts, time on texts and cross-textual elaborative strategy use. Both of these have been investigated in prior work, with time on texts considered to be an indicator of effort and engagement and with cross-textual elaboration reflecting depth of strategy use. <ref type="bibr">List, Stephens, and Alexander (2019)</ref> found the time that students devoted to text access to mediate the relation between students' situational interest and the number of text-based (i.e., evidentiary) justifications included in their writing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hagen, Braasch, and Bråten (2014)</ref> found students' reports of engagement in cross-textual elaboration to be negatively associated with students directly paraphrasing text-based information in their notes, rather than transforming it. Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">List, Du, Wang, and Lee (2019)</ref> found that students composing better responses based on multiple texts (i.e., with more integration and citation use) also reported higher levels of cross-textual strategy use, a finding confirmed by think-aloud data <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anmarkrud et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>This study examines individual difference factors and processing variables as mediators predicting students' multiple text task performance. This analytic approach is further grounded in the CAEM in two primary ways <ref type="bibr">(List &amp; Alexander, 2017b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, 2018a</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2019)</ref>. First, it specifically examines the role of topic interest (i.e., intrinsic interest in texts' content, <ref type="bibr">List et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Schiefele, 1999)</ref> and students' habits with regard to information evaluation and integration in learning from multiple texts. These two factors, in particular, correspond to the affective engagement and behavioral dispositions dimensions that dictate students' default stances, or orientations, toward multiple task completion, as described in the CAEM. Second, as suggested by the CAEM and List and Alexander's (2019) more recent work, the default stances that students adopt shape the nature of both students' multiple text processing and task performance.</p><p>These two aspects are modeled in this study through the mediators and performance outcomes examined and the relations among them. In doing so, this study constitutes an important initial empirical examination of the CAEM.</p><p>At the same, to further inform prior work I partially replicate analyses from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bråten et al. (2014)</ref> in analyses presented in Appendix A. Although the core focus of this paper was on validating the CAEM, supplemental analyses are presented in Appendix A to further replicate earlier work examining additional contributors (i.e., need for cognition; students' beliefs regarding the need for justification by multiple texts) to students' learning from multiple texts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were 351 undergraduate students enrolled in a large university in the North Eastern United States (age: M=19.54, SD=1.39). Two participants were excluded as they only completed the individual difference measures and were not presented with any of the multiple texts. The sample was majority female (71.51%, n=251, male: 27.92%, n=98). The sample was also majority White (68.38%, n=240), with 13.68% (n=48) of students reporting Asian ethnicity, 5.70% (n=20) of students identifying as Hispanic/Latino, and 3.42% (n=12) reporting African American ethnicity. Moreover, 2.56% (n=9) of students identified their race/ethnicity as "other," while 5.41% (n=19) of students identified as biracial or as mixed-race. Students reported a variety of class standings and were pursuing a variety of majors in the social and natural science. Three students did not report any demographic information, while four students did not identify race/ethnicity. Students were recruited from five courses in educational psychology, biology, and chemistry; the author was the instructor for one of these courses. The study had IRB approval. To minimize any pressure that students in the author's course may have felt to participate two measures were taken. First, students completed the study online and had no direct contact with the author during participation. Second, students were not assigned extra credit for participation (and the author did not check which students participated) until the end of the semester, once final course grades had been determined. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for a comparison of indicators across gender, major, and year in school. Participants were recruited via an announcement either emailed to them or posted to their course site and received extra credit for study participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p>This study included three primary parts. First, students were asked to complete a variety of individual difference measures, including assessments of prior knowledge, interest, and habits with regard to information evaluation and integration. Additional individual difference factors collected (e.g., attitudes, need for cognition, justification by multiple texts) are described and analyzed in Appendices A and B. Then, students were asked to complete a multiple text task. This involved reading a set of four texts addressing a controversial topic (i.e., trophy hunting) as well as completing a variety of outcome measures tapping integrated mental model and inter-text model development. Finally, students completed a number of post-task measures, including reporting strategy use on the Multiple Text Strategy Inventory (MTSI, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bråten &amp; Strømsø, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>All study materials were presented electronically via Qualtrics. Because the study was fully online, participants completed study materials at a time and location of their choosing. The full study took participants approximately one hour to complete. Prior knowledge. Prior knowledge was assessed via a researcher-developed seven-item multiple choice measure, based on key terms and concepts found across the four trophy hunting texts. For instance, a sample item included, In trophy hunting, the trophy is: (a) the prize awarded to the hunter who was most successful, (b) the hunting license awarded to the hunter who bids the highest among, (c) the part of the animal (e.g., the horn) that the hunter keeps as a souvenir, (d) the qualifying points a hunter is required to earn before hunting big game, with (c)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>constituting the correct answer. In addition to the four answer choices, students also had the option to select I don't know in response to each multiple choice question. Responses were scored as correct or incorrect, with the I don't know option also assigned a 0, as were incorrect responses. This was done so that students' total scores reflected the number of items they responded to correctly.</p><p>Cronbach's alpha reliability for the seven-item prior knowledge measure was 0.44. This particularly low level of reliability may stem from a number of sources. These include the limited number of items on the measure, the limited extent to which this item set may correspond to a unidimensional construct (i.e., rather than to information presented across four different texts), and the relatively conservative nature of Cronbach's alpha as a measure of reliability <ref type="bibr">(McNeish, 2018)</ref>. Moreover, earlier work has found prior knowledge measures administered to low-knowledge samples to have lower than desired levels of reliability <ref type="bibr">(Bråten &amp; Strømsø, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Peterson &amp; Alexander, 2018)</ref>. This latter explanation for the low alpha level achieved is bolstered by the fact that when this measure was administered at post-test, as a measure of comprehension, its reliability increased somewhat to 0.58. Nevertheless, due to the low reliability of this measure it was excluded from further analyses. Topic interest. Topic interest was assessed by asking students to rate six terms related to trophy hunting, the topic of the texts. Specifically, students were asked to please rate how interested you are in topics related to trophy hunting, using a five-point Likert scale, ranging from not at all interested to very interested. The topics that students were asked to rate were: hunting for food, hunting for sport, wildlife conservation, animal rights, economic development in Africa, and ecology. Interest items were developed to be relevant to the topic of the study and to reflect the perspectives introduced across the four study texts (i.e., for and against trophy hunting and related to economic and ecological concerns). The full six-item scale had a Cronbach's alpha reliability of 0.77, with reliability increasing to 0.80 when the two items associated with hunting were excluded (i.e., hunting for sport, and hunting for food), based on alpha-if-item-deleted metrics. Only four interest items were used in all subsequent analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information evaluation.</head><p>The habits with regard to information evaluation scale consisted of six items capturing the frequency with which students engaged the skills and practices associated with information evaluation and integration. Although a number of related measures were examined (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hargittai, Fullerton, Menchen-Trevino, &amp; Thomas, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Strømsø &amp; Bråten, 2010)</ref>, this was a researcher designed scale, created to specifically tap source evaluation and corroboration. These are the deep level multiple text use strategies expressly identified in the CAEM as associated with students' integration of multiple texts. Specifically, students were asked to rate whether they strongly disagreed or strongly agreed with items like:</p><p>When reading or researching on the Internet I try to: decide whether texts are trustworthy/evaluate the evidence that is presented/compare sources to one another on a five point scale. Cronbach's alpha reliability for the six-item scale was 0.86.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multiple Text Task</head><p>The multiple text task included students reading four texts on the topic of trophy hunting as well as completing a variety of performance measures tapping multiple text integration.</p><p>Texts. Students were provided with four partially complementary and partially conflicting texts on the topic of trophy hunting. Trophy hunting was selected as the topic of the multiple text task for three primary reasons. First, it was a complex and controversial topic about which both conflicting and complementary perspectives could be introduced (i.e., supporting or opposing trophy hunting). Second, this represented an interdisciplinary topic about which different domain perspectives (i.e., economic, ecological) could be presented, across texts. Specifically, I sought to identify a topic that would parallel the common cross-disciplinary tensions between economic development and ecological conservation but that would be unfamiliar to students. Third, this topic was chosen because it was expected to be reactive with learners' various individual difference factors. Specifically, this topic was accessible to students (i.e., students were able to infer the meaning of the term, trophy hunting) but not likely to be supported by a great deal of conceptual knowledge, requiring students to learn new information from the texts provided. Because of its accessibility, students were expected to be able to form attitudes toward this topic. Indeed, information about this topic included the counterintuitive argument that trophy hunting, in fact, raises significant funds for animal conservation -an argument that may have sparked students' interest in the topic or challenged their initial beliefs.</p><p>Prior work on students' learning from multiple texts has, generally, constructed texts to be either conflicting or consistent in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Firetto, 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Primor and Katzir (2018)</ref> in a recent review of studies examining students' multiple text integration found 42 studies to present students with conflicting texts, while 11 studies introduced students to complementary information. Building on this prior work, the texts created for this study were systematically constructed to simultaneously be both complementary and conflicting in nature (see Appendix C). That is, the texts created varied in adopting an economic or an ecological perspective on trophy hunting and in presenting arguments for or against the practice. For instance, one text (i.e., economic perspective in favor of trophy hunting) discussed the money for conservation able to be raised through trophy hunting. A second, conflicting, text contrasted this with the money that could be raised through ecotourism (i.e., economic perspective opposing trophy hunting).</p><p>Still a third, complementary text argued that money raised allowed local areas to conserve land for animals' habitats (i.e., ecological perspective in favor of trophy hunting). In this way, each text developed connected to two of the other texts in both a consistent and conflicting fashion. This approach to text construction stands in contrast to much of prior work which has primarily organized text sets around a single, central conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barzilai, Zohar, &amp; Mor-Hagani, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Firetto, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Primor &amp; Katzir, 2018)</ref>. A variety of both complementary and conflicting relations were built into the texts used in this study to more robustly examine learners' integration or connection formation across texts. Texts were further written to be parallel to one another in structure, each including two distinct arguments about trophy hunting with corresponding quantitative evidence provided.</p><p>The texts used in this study were constructed through a three-step process. First, the author compiled information about trophy hunting from empirical work and articles in the popular press (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Creel et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Cruise, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Di Minin, Leader-Williams, &amp; Bradshaw, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Dickman, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Treves et al., 2019)</ref>. This information was used to construct four longform trophy hunting texts following the same complementary-conflicting structure used in the study (i.e., introducing economic and ecological perspectives, for and against trophy hunting). In long-form, each text included a central claim and four pieces of supporting evidence. In the second phase of development, these long-form texts were iteratively reviewed, at least three separate times, by a team of four research assistants who provided feedback on the quality of the information included, texts' parallel structure, and clarity and wording. Texts were revised between each round of feedback and ultimately reduced to include a central claim and two pieces of supporting evidence that overlapped with other texts in the document set. The selection of supporting evidence to include in these shortened texts was done to most explicitly convey the points of view intended and to most directly overlap with the complementary and conflicting evidence introduced in other texts. Texts were reviewed one final time by research assistants to ensure these were in final form.</p><p>In the last stage of development, the final form texts were piloted via Amazon's Mechanical Turk. In this pilot, texts were segmented to include the central claim and only one piece of supporting evidence, resulting in eight sub-texts. This was done to isolate whether any segments of texts were outliers with regard to trustworthiness or readability. To reduce carryover effects, participants were randomly assigned to read only one of the eight sub-texts constructed, such that each sub-text was rated by between 16 and 31 separate respondents.</p><p>Respondents were asked to rate how trustworthy, convincing, and easy to understand they considered each text to be on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from not at all to very. As can be seen in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, texts were rated as both more than moderately trustworthy and convincing and as quite easy to understand by respondents. Text segments were also rated consistently with one another.</p><p>The perspective of each text, supporting or opposing trophy hunting and introducing economic or ecological arguments on this issue, was introduced in the title (e.g., The Economic Benefits of Trophy Hunting). Texts were attributed to expert authors (e.g., Dr. Kevin Redmond, Professor of Business, Columbia University) and identified as published in reputable venues in the popular press (e.g., New York Times, Washington Post). All authors were introduced as male, as gender has been found to impact students' trustworthiness perceptions in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Armstrong &amp; McAdams, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brann &amp; Himes, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Flanagin &amp; Metzger, 2003)</ref>. Information about each text is summarized in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Texts were comparable in length to those used in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Firetto, 2020)</ref>. Texts were presented to students in one of eight different orders. That is, texts presenting economic or ecological views, for and against trophy hunting were presented in the following orders: (1) Econ-Pro, Econ-Con, Ecol-Pro, Ecol-Con; (2) Econ-Con, Econ-Pro, Ecol-Con, Ecol-Pro; (3) Ecol-Pro, Ecol-Con, Econ-Pro, Econ-Con; (4) Ecol-Con, Ecol-Pro, Econ-Con, Econ-Pro; (5) Econ-Pro, Ecol-Pro, Econ-Con, Ecol-Con; (6) Ecol-Pro, Econ-Pro, Ecol-Con, Econ-Con; (7) Econ-Con, Ecol-Con, Econ-Pro, Ecol-Pro; (8) Ecol-Con, Econ-Con, Ecol-Pro, Econ-Pro. Texts ranged in length from 256 to 285 words and had an average Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 16, indicating that these were appropriate for use with an undergraduate audience.</p><p>Process measures. Two process measures were examined in association with students' learning from multiple texts. These were the total time that students devoted to text access and students' self-reports of strategy use. Time on texts was collected during the course of multiple text use, while strategy use was self-reported following task completion. Time on texts. Time on texts was recorded via log data (i.e., recorded by Qualtrics, in association with each text accessed and then totaled). Time on texts has commonly been used in prior work as a measure of students' task engagement, effort expenditure, and depth of processing when learning from multiple texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bråten et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">List et al., 2019)</ref>. Students accessed texts for an average of 3.80 (SD=3.80) minutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multiple text strategy inventory.</head><p>Following multiple text task completion, students were asked to report their strategy use during multiple text use via the cross-textual elaboration sub-scale of the Multiple Text Strategy Inventory (MTSI, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bråten &amp; Strømsø, 2011)</ref>. The crosstextual elaboration subscale reflects students' efforts to compare and contrast information presented across texts. A sample item included: I tried to understand the issues concerning trophy hunting by comparing the content of the different texts. Due to concerns over length, only four items from the scale (i.e., those with the strongest factor loadings as per <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bråten and Strømsø, 2011)</ref> were used in this study, with a Cronbach's alpha reliability of 0.72. Because the scale was abridged from that used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bråten &amp; Strømsø (2011)</ref>, a confirmatory factor analysis was run using the lavaan package in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref> to ensure appropriate factor loadings.</p><p>The model was found to have strong data fit, 𝜒 2 (2)=5.46, p=0.07. In particular, the model had a CFI of 0.99, an RMSEA 0.07 (90% CI: 0.00-0.14), and an SRMR of 0.02. Each of the items loaded significantly onto the latent factor, ps&lt;0.001.</p><p>Performance outcomes. Four measures, tapping two underlying constructs (i.e., integrated mental model and inter-text model development), were used to assessed multiple text integration. Two different measures, similar to those used in prior work, were used as metrics for integrated mental model development <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bråten et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gil et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Strømsø et al., 2008)</ref>. These were a Statement Verification Task (SVT) and a Cross-Textual Integration (CTI) task. Two different measures were likewise used to assess inter-text model development, these were the Statement Source Match task (SSM) and the Source Differentiation Task (SDT).</p><p>Consistent with prior work examining students' learning from multiple texts, all four measures were developed using statements appearing in the trophy hunting texts, composed for the purposes of this study (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bråten, Strømsø, &amp; Britt, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Cheong, Zhu, Li, &amp; Wen, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hagen, Braasch, &amp; Bråten, 2014)</ref>. Prior to their use in this study, measures were piloted with a sample of online participants using Amazon's Mechanical to ensure both reliability and that participants' responses had an appropriate degree of variability in performance. Cronbach's alpha reliabilities ranged from 0.81 for the SVT to 0.62 for the SDT (reliability increased to 0.69 in Study 2). Performance likewise ranged from 0.71 percent accuracy for the SVT to 0.56 for the SSM, indicating appropriate variability (i.e., the lack of a ceiling effect).</p><p>Based on measures of task difficulty, established through pilot testing, students were randomly assigned to complete either the SVT and the SDT (n=168) or the CTI and SSM (n=183), in counter-balanced order. This resulted in each student completing a measure tapping integrated mental model development and inter-text model development.</p><p>Two separate measures each of integrated mental model and inter-text model development were used in this study. This was done to reflect the range of similar measures used in prior work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bråten et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Stadtler, Scharrer, &amp; Bromme, 2011)</ref> and because each of these measures tapped somewhat different aspects of integrated mental model and intertext model formation. For instance, while the SSM examined students' abilities to link information back to sources of origin (i.e., develop source-content links), the SDT task required students to further engage in source separation or to recognize whether statements introduced were intra-textual or inter-textual in nature. Participants were not asked to complete all four measures due to concerns regarding study length and possible carry-over effects. Because each measure included a variable number of items, scores were converted to percent accuracy.</p><p>Students then received a percent accuracy score for measures tapping integrated mental model (SVT or CTI) and inter-text (SSM or SDT) model construction. All measures along with sample items are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4</ref>.</p><p>The main analyses presented in this paper collapsed students' SVT and CTI and SSM and SDT performance, as reflective of integrated mental model and inter-text model development, respectively, with these different outcome variables simultaneously modeled. This is consistent with prior work on both reading comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Fesel, Segers, &amp; Verhoeven, 2018)</ref> and learning from multiple texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brand-Gruwel, Wopereis, &amp; Walraven, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Maier, Richter, &amp; Britt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Schoor et al., 2020)</ref> which has likewise randomly assigned students to complete parallel measures to allow multiple aspects of performance to be efficiently assessed. A model separately describing performance on each set of measures (i.e., SVT and SSM; CTI and SDT) is presented in Appendix D. This model was run using the multigroups analysis function (i.e., using the "group" argument) in lavaan. Groups were defined as those completing the SVT and the SDT vis-à-vis the CTI and the SSM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statement verification task (SVT).</head><p>The statement verification task included 14 statements, eight drawn from the four trophy hunting texts and six not included in the texts provided. Students were asked to: please select whether each statement below was included in one of he texts you read or not included in the text you read. Students could also select an I don't remember option. This option, along with incorrect responses received a 0, such that students' scores reflected the total amount of items that they answered correctly. An I don't know option was included because prior work has found the inclusion of such an option to reduce guessing <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Muijtjens, van Mameren, Hoogenboom, Evers, &amp; van der Vleuten, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Zhang, 2013)</ref>. Although statements on the SVT were drawn only from a single text, best corresponding to multiple text comprehension, I nevertheless considered this measure to underlie integrated mental model construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kobayashi, 2009)</ref>. The 14-item measure had a Cronbach's alpha reliability of 0.74.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statement source match (SSM).</head><p>The statement source match task was a 12-item measure, that asked students to match statements drawn from texts to their sources of origin. Specifically, students were instructed to: please verify which text the statement appeared in.</p><p>Students also had the option to select I don't remember in association with each text, with such responses likewise receiving a score of 0, such that students' total scores reflected the number of items they responded to correctly.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-textual integration (CTI).</head><p>The Cross-Textual Integration task included 12 items correctly or incorrectly integrating or connecting statements presented across texts. While six of the items included accurate instances of integration, six items reflected incorrect linkages across texts. Statements from different texts were connected via a linking term (e.g., and, because, so that) in all upper case. Specifically, participants were instructed to: please determine whether each statement is correct or incorrect based on information provided in texts. As with the other measures, an I don't remember option was also provided, and assigned a 0 when selected.</p><p>Students had to identify whether each statement reflected an appropriate or inappropriate instance of cross-textual integration. Cronbach's alpha reliability for the 12-item scale was 0.72.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Source differentiation task (SDT).</head><p>The source differentiation task included 10 items reflecting instances of intra-textual and inter-textual integration or linkages within and across texts. While four of the items reflected intra-textual integration, the other six items represented inter-textual integration or links across two of the texts. In particular, students were instructed to: Please verify whether the information in the statement came from the same text or from different texts. To reduce guessing an I don't remember option was also provided, and assigned a 0 in scoring. The reliability for the 10-item scale was 0.44; excluding three items resulted in a Cronbach's alpha reliability of 0.50.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis.</head><p>Descriptives and correlations among all measures of interest are presented in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">5</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">6</ref>. The fit of the theorized model represented in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> was evaluated using the lavaan package in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref>. The Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator was used with robust standard errors, to correct for violations of multivariate nonnormality. Nevertheless, all of the independent and dependent variables in the model were found to be approximately normal (see values for skewness and kurtosis in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">7</ref>). Outliers were not removed as all of the measures used in analyses had restricted ranges (e.g., reflecting students' ratings of Likert items and performance on various objective measures of integrated mental model and intertext model development). The exception to this was the time variable, which demonstrated considerable non-normality. In response to this, eight outliers (2.28% of the sample) were removed from the data set; outliers were defined as students who spent longer than 1.5 standard deviations above the mean on reading the study texts. Moreover, a logarithmic transformation was applied to the time on texts variable to correct for issues of non-normality, with the transformed variable used in all subsequent analyses. Listwise deletion was used to handle missing data because only four cases were found to have missing values (1.14% of the sample). As suggested by the CAEM, the focal model examined in this study (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) uses interest and students' habits with regard to information evaluation and integration as individual difference factors predicting processing and multiple text task performance. However, analyses including additional individual difference factors are introduced in supplemental appendices. These include analyses using attitudes (Appendix B), need for cognition (Appendix A), and justifications for knowing by multiple texts (Appendix A) as individual difference factors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In investigating the CAEM, this study evaluates the role of individual difference factors and processing variables on students' learning from multiple texts. Two primary sets of integration outcomes were examined. These included measures of integrated mental model and inter-text model development. Integrated mental model construction was predicted by students' interest in the topic of the task as well as by the time that students devoted to text, with time further mediating the association between both topic interest and students' habits with regard to information evaluation and integrated mental model development. Inter-text model construction was directly predicted by both the time that students devoted to text access and students' engagement in cross-textual elaboration, with time on texts further mediating the relation between inter-text model development and students' topic interest and habits with regard to information evaluation. In total, 10 direct paths relating individual difference factors, processing variables, and integration outcomes were hypothesized in our model (i.e., Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). I found support for eight out of these 10 paths and discuss each of these in-turn. Eight indirect paths were also examined, with support found for only four of these. Results expected but not found in the model are also discussed.</p><p>First, both of the individual difference factors examined in this study (i.e., topic interest and students' habits with regard to information evaluation) were found to be associated with processing variables, including the time that students devoted to multiple text access and their engagement in cross-textual elaboration. I consider this to be a focal finding, given that, among the central tenants of the CAEM are that both cognitive (i.e., students' habits with regard to information evaluation) and affect (i.e., interest) factors impact students' processing or strategy use when learning from multiple texts <ref type="bibr">(List &amp; Alexander, 2017b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, 2018a)</ref>. Second, the processing variables examined in this study, and time on texts, in particular, were significantly associated with students' integrated mental model and inter-text model development. Again, these findings are supported both by ideas in the CAEM <ref type="bibr">(List &amp; Alexander, 2017b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, 2018a)</ref>, as well as broader empirical work linking students' multiple text processing to task performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Anmakrurd et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Du &amp; List, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">List &amp; Alexander, 2019)</ref>. Despite these findings, generally consistent with the CAEM, I was specifically intrigued that interest only directly predicted integrated mental model, but not inter-text model development. And, that cross-textual elaboration predicted inter-text model development, but not integrated mental model development. This pattern of findings may be understood according to the distinct facets of integration that are captured by integrated mental model vis-à-vis intertext model construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Britt et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Perfetti et al., 1999)</ref>. Integrated mental model construction corresponds to students developing a unified and coherent understanding of a common topic, in this case trophy hunting, described across texts. Inter-text model construction reflects students' formation of structural relationships across texts and association of content from texts with sources of origin. Given the different aspects of integration captured by these two models, their associations with somewhat different predictors begin to make sense. In particular, integrated mental model construction, focused on the content introduced across texts, can best be served by students' interest in the topic of the task. That is, students more interested in aspects of trophy hunting may be more motivated to develop an understanding of the issues involved. At the same time, this interpretation requires substantiation via further replication, as the confidence interval for the path coefficient connecting interest and integrated mental development and cross-textual elaboration and inter-textual model development included zero. And these paths were directly associated with integrated mental model and intertext model development in only one of the measure-specific models examined in Appendix D. In particular, the association between interest and integrated mental model development should further be explored within the context of multiple text tasks that are more affectively engaging (e.g., interesting) for learners.</p><p>An inter-text model of multiple texts may require a somewhat complementary set of processes to develop. That is, while integrated mental model formation may emerge somewhat organically through students' multiple text comprehension, inter-text model development likely requires more deliberate and effortful construction on the part of learners. In particular, intertext model formation requires students to actively form novel, higher-order relations across texts and tag information from texts to sources of origin. Doing so requires a more demanding and complex set of strategic processes than those involved in only allowing an increasingly rich or elaborated mental model of content from across texts to form, as happens during integrated mental model construction. In other words, inter-text model development requires that students deliberately organize and, in considering sources, evaluate the content otherwise only assimilated into the integrated mental models that they form. Given these requirements, it is understandable that the cross-textual elaboration dimension of the MTSI, capturing students' deliberate attention to and reasoning about consistency and conflict across texts, was uniquely associated with intertext model construction, but not with integrated mental model development, in this study.</p><p>It is important to note that students' engagement in cross-textual elaboration was predicted by both topic interest and reports of habits with regard to information evaluation. The association between cross-textual elaboration and students' habits with regard to information evaluation is a logical one. That is, students' reports of habitual engagement in information evaluation may indicate their knowledge of and familiarity with deep-level strategies for multiple text use; making it more likely that they would deploy these when completing a particular multiple text task. The association between interest and cross-textual elaboration is a less obvious one; nevertheless, this association may be interpreted as suggesting that, given the demanding nature of cross-textual elaborative strategy use, interest, as a motivational variable, is required to drive or merit such effortful and strategic engagement on the part of learners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time on Texts</head><p>Time on texts emerged in this study as having both a direct effect on integrated mental model and inter-text model development and as mediating the effect of individual difference factors on these outcomes. The importance of the time on text variable in this study may be understood in a number of ways. First, time on texts may serve as an operationalization of the construct of behavioral engagement recently introduced by Bråten, Brante, and <ref type="bibr">Strømsø (2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bråten et al. (2018)</ref> define behavioral engagement as students' overt or directly observable participation in learning activities (e.g., persistence in text access). Second, time on texts, particularly as it was associated with interest, may reflect students' immersion in or affective engagement with the information provided. Finally, time on texts may reflect students' depth of strategy use during reading, as has been suggested in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bråten et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">List et al., 2019)</ref>. Regardless of its specific interpretation, time on texts emerged as an essential mediator in this study, connecting individual difference factors with students' ultimate task performance.</p><p>Understanding time on texts as a mediator is central to conceptualizing the CAEM, which suggests that while various cognitive and affective individual difference factors may set the stage for deeper-level processing during multiple text learning, such processing, or actual, strategy enactment during multiple text use, is nevertheless, necessary for successful task performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Missing direct path: Students' habits with regard to information evaluation</head><p>While interest was found to directly predict integrated mental model development, students' habits with regard to information evaluation were not directly associated with either measure of integration (i.e., neither with integrated mental model nor with inter-text model development). At the same time, habits with regard to information evaluation were associated with both the time that students devoted to text access and students' cross-textual elaboration during task completion, with time devoted to text access, in particular, significantly mediating the relation between this individual difference factor and integration performance. This mediation path indicates the importance of modeling students' learning from multiple text based on both (a) individual difference factors, that differentially predispose students toward task completion, and (b) the extent to which students draw on or activate these during learning. That is, results from this study suggest that although students' habits with regard to information evaluation are important for multiple text integration, their importance is only reflected in their being associated with students' higher propensity for actual strategy use during learning. Still, it is equally important to recognize that strategy use during task completion (e.g., students' engagement in cross-textual elaboration) was explained to a large extent by students' habits with regard to information evaluation. This suggests the need to develop the competency for information evaluation in learners, in both a task embedded and a task independent fashion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for the CAEM</head><p>This study contributes to the literature by validating at least three of the theoretical conjectures postulated in the CAEM. First, both affective engagement (i.e., interest) and students' habits with regard to information evaluation were found to be associated with performance on a multiple text task. In particular, while interest directly predicted integrated mental model formation, both interest and students' habits with regard to information evaluation were associated with both measures of integration, as mediated by the effects of time on texts.</p><p>These results validate the unique contribution of both affective and cognitive factors to students' learning from multiple texts. Second, these findings underscore the CAEM's proposition that a variety of individual difference factors, resulting in students' assumption of a default stance, lead to behavioral and strategic differences in multiple text processing and, ultimately, drive differences in multiple text task performance. Indeed, students' engagement in strategies corresponding to cross-textual elaboration predicted intertext model development, while time devoted to text access predicted both of the outcome measures examined in this study.</p><p>Moreover, the individual difference factors modeled, namely interest and students' habits with regard to information evaluation, significantly predicted both processing measures investigated.</p><p>All together these results underscore theoretical conceptions of multiple text use as involving a set of learner characteristics contributing to differences in processing and resulting in different levels of task performance <ref type="bibr">(List &amp; Alexander, 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rouet &amp; Britt, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, as suggested by the CAEM, the contribution of interest and students' habits with regard to source evaluation should not be considered in isolation; rather, given their strong association, these dimensions of individual difference should be associated with one another in understanding students' engagement with multiple texts. More generally informing both the CAEM and the Documents Model Framework, used to conceptualize students' mental models constructed based on multiple texts, the integration measures used in this study were found to be both associated with, yet distinguishable from, one another. That is, while students' performance on objective measures tapping integrated mental model and inter-text model construction were found to be strongly associated with one another, these facets of integration were, nevertheless, predicted by somewhat different sets of individual difference factors and processing variables, pointing to their discrete nature as aspects of the multidimensional construct that is integration. All told, this study contributes to the broader literature of learning from multiple texts in at least three ways. First, this paper contributes to a relatively limited set of analyses that aim to model the complexity associated with learning from multiple texts. Theoretical models conceptualize the process of learning from multiple texts as encompassing multiple text use behaviors and strategies and multiple text task performance, with these jointly impacted by a diverse set of individual difference factors <ref type="bibr">(List &amp; Alexander, 2017b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, 2018a</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rouet &amp; Britt, 2011</ref>). Yet, these three aspects of multiple text use have rarely been considered in conjunction with one another, with studies more commonly focusing on individual differences in multiple text task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Gil et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ferguson &amp; Bråten, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Strømsø &amp; Barzilai, 2018)</ref> or on the association among different processing variables and outcome measures of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bråten &amp; Strømsø, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hagen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kobayashi, 2009)</ref>. In this study, all three of these dimensions of multiple text task completion are considered in a comprehensive model of processing.</p><p>Second, this study contributes to the burgeoning literature examining the role of affective factors and behavioral engagement in learning from multiple texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bråten et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">List et al., 2019)</ref>. In further documenting the role of topic interest in both cross-textual elaboration and integrated mental model construction, this study pushes the literature to move beyond considering only cognitive factors in understanding students' learning from multiple texts.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this study is unique in the range of multiple text learning outcomes it considers. Complementing and expanding on measures used in prior work, this study includes distinct assessments of integrated mental model and inter-text model construction.</p><p>Moreover, in modeling these using both individual difference factors and processing variables it demonstrates how these capture complementary yet distinct aspects of learning from texts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Educational Implications</head><p>Preliminary results from this study point to a number of educational implications for literacy instruction. First, given the role of interest in learning from multiple texts demonstrated in this study, it is clear that teachers should be strategic and purposeful in the topics they select when introducing students to tasks requiring multiple texts. This is in line with more general implications of the CAEM, as well as prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Wigfield &amp; Guthrie, 1997)</ref> Nevertheless, understanding information as coming from distinct sources and as shaped by these and forming connections across sources, remain critical processes for learning from multiple texts and multiple text integration. For instance, in this study, students were presented with four texts on the topic of trophy hunting. Fully understanding this complex topic required not only synthesizing the content included in texts but also recognizing that perspectives on trophy hunting conflict and that there are multiple relevant domain perspectives that could be used as lenses on this topic. This demonstrates that considering source in the interpretation and evaluation of information is critical when students use multiple texts to learn about complex topics. To demonstrate this importance teachers should introduce students to multiple texts that are distinct not only in the information that they present but also in the perspectives on this information that they offer (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kiili, Coiro, &amp; Hämäläinen, 2016)</ref>; such as, asking students to read texts written from the perspective of abolitionists vis-à-vis slave owners during the Civil War (Monte-Sano, 2011) In doing so, teachers can demonstrate to students the importance of considering source, source-content, and source-source links in learning from multiple texts. As a final point, inter-text model formation was predicted by students' engagement in cross-textual elaboration. Cross-textual elaboration was predicted by students' reports of habits with regard to information evaluation. This points to the need to provide students with not only tasks that allow cross-textual connections to be formed but also with direct instruction in strategies for forming such connections when learning from multiple texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Afflerbach &amp; Cho, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">List 2020b)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Despite the strengths of this study, a number of limitations must be acknowledged. First, although this study sought to validate the CAEM, which identifies the role of affective factors in promoting students' learning from multiple texts, only a limited number of affective factors (e.g., interest, attitudes) were considered in analyses. An important direction for future work is to consider the role of other affective and motivational individual difference factors in processing (e.g., self-efficacy, enjoyment) as well as to consider a variety of attitude-related constructs, beyond attitude certainty, in understanding the complex relationship between attitudes and information processing.</p><p>It is also important to consider these affective factors in relation to various text characteristics (e.g., length, readability). This is especially the case given that text coherence and comprehensibility, in interaction with individual difference factors, has been found to be a key determinant of students' task performance when reading single texts <ref type="bibr">(McNamara, Ozuru, &amp; Floyd, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rawson &amp; Dunlosky, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Yano, Long, &amp; Ross, 1994)</ref>. Moreover, additional work is needed to consider which aspects of texts (e.g., their number, length, or positionality in relation to one another) may contribute to multiple text task performance. Although the texts used in this study were typical in length to those used in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Firetto, 2020)</ref>, these were nevertheless fairly short relative to the types of academic texts that undergraduate students may typically be asked to understand and integrate (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bråten &amp; Strømsø, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lehman, Rott, &amp; Schmidt-Borcherding, 2019)</ref>. Considering the cognitive and affective factors identified in the CAEM, it may be that, in part, text length increases the intra-textual integration and motivational (i.e., persistence) demands associated with learning from multiple texts.</p><p>Second, two separate measures, both of integrated mental model and inter-text model development, were used in this study and collapsed in analyses (with these measures analyzed separately in Appendix D). On the one hand, I considered this methodological decision to be necessary given the length of the study and the potential redundancy of items across measures.</p><p>On the other hand, the extent to which these measures can truly be collapsed remains an open question, and, in fact, when these measures were separately modeled somewhat different paths emerged than what was found in the sample as a whole (see Appendix D). Future work should consider creating more comprehensive measures to tap integrated mental model and inter-text model development. For instance, a single instrument can be developed to capture those facets of integrated mental model development that, in this study, were separately assessed via the SVT and the CTI.</p><p>Third, the sample used in this study was predominantly female and predominantly White.</p><p>Although this sample was representative of students enrolled in the courses sampled in this study (e.g., educational psychology, biology), this still raises questions regarding sample representativeness of university students as a whole <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Henrich, Heine, &amp; Norenzayan, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, the gender make-up of the sample may have made them particularly uninterested in the topic of the task (i.e., trophy hunting); although women in this study reported significantly higher levels of topic interest (M=3.30, SD=0.95) than their male counterparts (M=2.97, SD=0.96), F(1, 347)=8.54, p&lt;0.01, 𝜂 2 =0.02, indicating a small effect. More generally, gender differences have been found in males' and females' performance on multiple text tasks, in particular <ref type="bibr">(Bråten &amp; Strømsø, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lund et al., 2019)</ref>, and on reading tasks more generally <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Denton et al., 2015)</ref>, suggesting the need to further explore gender in learning from multiple texts. Additionally, no research, to my knowledge has examined racial differences in multiple text task performance (although national differences have been examined: <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Strømsø, Bråten, Anmarkrud, &amp; Ferguson, 2016)</ref>. This is an area that requires further exploration, especially given some findings on racial differences in Black and White users' source evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Appiah, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Appiah, , 2004))</ref>.</p><p>Fourth, this study replicated investigations of learning from multiple texts carried out with Norwegian secondary students <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bråten et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lund et al., 2019)</ref>. Doubtless, there exist many similarities between the United States and Norway as economically developed and technologically sophisticated nations, wherein students are expected to navigate the complexity inherent in learning from multiple texts, particularly online (OECD, 2019). Nevertheless, there are likely important cultural (e.g., Internet access, media environments) differences across these two countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Zevin, 2003)</ref> and their impact on multiple text task performance requires further investigation in future work.</p><p>There were also developmental differences between the secondary students used in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bråten et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lund et al., 2019)</ref> and the undergraduate sample examined in this present study. Generally, late adolescence and young adulthood have been understood as the developmental stages during which students may be expected to develop the epistemic sophistication to learn from multiple texts (e.g., appreciating a multitude of perspectives, evaluating knowledge sources, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">King &amp; Kitchener, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kuhn, Cheney, &amp; Weinstock, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, at least within the United States, curricular differences between high school and college may contribute to differences between students at these educational levels. As compared to high school, for many students, college is the first time that they are asked to make sense of multiple sources of various quality, potentially in conflict with one another, rather than learning from the authorless yet authoritative voice of the textbook <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Rouet, Britt, Mason, &amp; Perfetti, 1996)</ref>. These curricular differences may result in students at the college level being more adept at multiple text comprehension and integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kobayashi, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wiley, Griffin, Steffens, &amp; Britt, 2020)</ref>. Although speculating across samples at different developmental stages and embedded within different cultural settings is impossible, it does suggest the need to further consider such factors in students' learning from multiple texts.</p><p>Fifth, the low reliability of the measures used in this study represents a major limitation, particularly with regard to the SDT measure used in the focal analyses in this study. These measures may have had unacceptably low reliabilities for a variety of reasons. For one, the low reliabilities may be attributable to a floor effect due to individuals' generally low levels of knowledge about and interest in the topic of the task and low levels of integration-related task performance. For another, due to concerns over length and between-item redundancy, the measures used in this study were shorter than those used in prior work, further reducing reliability. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Strømsø, Bråten, and Britt (2010)</ref> included 20 items on their Inter-IVT and found this measure to only have a reliability of 𝛼=0.58. For comparison, the SDT measures used in this study only included 10 items, with this reduction in length attributable to our use of only four study texts, in contrast to the seven texts used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Strømsø et al. (2020)</ref>. Finally, the extent to which the measures represented unidimensional indices remains an open question. For instance, the prior knowledge measure included multiple choice items reflecting key terms in study texts. Likewise, performance measures, included the SDT, represented students' understanding of four different texts and the associations among them. This means that these measures may not have, in fact, corresponded to a unidimensional construct but rather multiple facets of understanding.</p><p>Finally, and on a related methodological note, all of the performance measures in this study, included an I don't know option among the answer choices available to students. This methodological decision was made to reduce students' guessing <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Zhang, 2013)</ref>. The need to reduce guessing was a particular concern in this study given that a number of the measures only had two answer choices available to students (e.g., in the texts I read/not in the texts I read options on the SVT). Nevertheless, the inclusion of an I don't know option has also been found to reduce instrument reliability, at least to some extent <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Muijtjens et al., 1999)</ref>. This reduction in reliability as well as the substantial number of students selecting the I don't know option, across measures, requires revisiting this methodological decision in future work. In particular, on average, 25.76% of students selected the I don't know option for at least one item on the SVT; 24.05% of students, on average, selected this option at least once when responding to the CTI; 25.50% of students selected this option at least once for items on the SDT; and 16.30% of students selected this option at least once in response to the SSM. In prior work, when including the I don't know option on assessments, students have also received penalties for incorrect responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Muijtjens et al., 1999)</ref>. This was not done in this study, as students' performance across measures, was already found to be fairly low. This scoring option (with points reduced for incorrect responses) should also be considered in future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>A number of conclusions regarding the nature of learning from multiple texts may be drawn based on the models examined in this study. First, interest was found to have a direct relationship with integrated mental model development, while the relation between students' habits with regard to information evaluation and integration outcomes was an indirect one.</p><p>Second, time devoted to text access, potentially reflective of deep-level strategy use, was a direct predictor and a mediator of both sets of integration outcomes examined. Third, comparing across integration measures, interest was found to contribute to integrated mental model development. At the same time, engagement in cross-textual elaboration, or the relational consideration of texts, was specifically needed for inter-text model construction, or for students to develop a structural understanding of the relations among multiple texts. Across these three conclusions, I comprehensively link individual difference factors, processing metrics, and multiple text task performance in a way that has largely been only theorized in prior work.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Despite having less good model fit, these results largely mirror findings from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bråten et al. (2014)</ref>. In particular, in this model, interest, need for cognition, and students' beliefs regarding the need for justification by multiple texts were all associated with students' deep-level strategy use, with students' beliefs and need for cognition associated with deep-level strategy use in <ref type="bibr">Bråten et al.'s (2014)</ref> model. Further, in our model, only interest was found to be associated with the time that students devoted to text access, whereas, both interest and students' beliefs about the need for justification by multiple texts were associated with time in <ref type="bibr">Bråten et al.'s (2014)</ref> study. Centrally, in our study as well as in <ref type="bibr">Bråten et al.'s (2014)</ref> work, both the time that students devoted to text access (i.e., termed effort by <ref type="bibr">Bråten et al.)</ref> and students' engagement in deep-level strategy use significantly predicted students' learning from multiple texts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B</head><p>In addition to examining interest as a measure of affective engagement, students' attitudes toward trophy hunting and attitude certainty were also examined in association with multiple text task performance. Specifically, a model including (a) individual difference factors (i.e., topic interest, information evaluation, attitudes), (b) processing mediators (i.e., time devoted to text access; reports of cross-textual elaboration), and (c) performance indicators (i.e., inter-text and integrated mental model development) was evaluated. The theoretical model evaluated is included in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> and model fit, with direct paths shown, is represented in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Direct and indirect paths are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">10</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>All measures were the same as those reported in the full study, with the addition of attitudes included in the model. Attitudes. Attitudes were assessed in two primary ways.</p><p>Attitude stance. First, students were asked to take a stance with regard to trophy hunting. Specifically, students were asked to respond to the multiple-choice question: do you support trophy hunting? In the sample, 5.98% (n=21) selected yes, I support trophy hunting; 60.40% (n=212) selected no, I don't support trophy hunting; while 6.84% (n=24) of participants reported that they could not decide, and an addition 26.78% (n=94) of participants selected I don't know enough to decide.</p><p>Attitude certainty. In addition to reporting their attitude stance, participants were further asked to rate three items corresponding to attitude certainty (i.e., how sure are you, how confident are you, how strongly do you feel). Students rated attitude certainty items on a fivepoint scale, ranging from not at all to very, with attitude certainty able to be rated by students endorsing a variety of attitude stances. That is, students who were both strongly in support of and strongly in opposition to trophy hunting were expected to strongly endorse these items and to be comparably reactive to the texts provided, as these included information both in support of and in opposition to trophy hunting. As a contrast, students without a predefined attitude stance (i.e., selecting the I cannot decide or I don't know enough to decide options) were expected to be more moderate in their ratings of attitude certainty.</p><p>These expected associations between attitude stance and attitude certainty was born out in an analysis of variance that found average attitude certainty to significantly differ in association with stance, F(3, 348)=80.28, p&lt;0.001, 𝜂 2 = 0.41. As expected, post-hoc analyses using Tukey's HSD found students supporting (M=3.54, SD=0.89) and opposing (M=3.96, SD=0.96) trophy hunting to have significantly higher degrees of attitude certainty than students selecting the I cannot decide (M=2.42, SD=0.84) or the I don't know enough to decide (M=2.17, SD=1.09) options, ps&lt;0.001. Because attitude certainty functioned separately from students' chosen attitude stance (i.e., students both supporting and opposing trophy hunting had similarly high ratings of attitude certainty) this was the measure used in analyses. Reliability for the three-item attitude certainty scale was 0.94.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results for the Model Including Attitude Certainty</head><p>The model including attitudes and other individual difference factors and processing variables to predict multiple text task performance was found to have good data fit, X 2 (103)=174.06, p&lt;0.001.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Although demonstrating good model fit, students' attitude certainty was not directly associated with any of the outcomes of interest, although it was significantly associated with students' engagement in cross-textual elaboration. As suggested by the CAEM, it may be that holding stronger attitudes on a particular topic is associated with greater strategy use (i.e., engagement in cross-textual elaboration) when students are presented with conflicting texts on a controversial topic. For instance, stronger attitudes may lead students to scrutinize and critically evaluate texts conflicting with their own points of view <ref type="bibr">(McCrudden &amp; Barnes, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>

Second, as in the full model, time was found to have an important direct and indirect effect both on students' integrated mental model and on students' inter-text model development. Third, in analyses for Group 1, students' engagement in crosstextual elaboration significantly predicted inter-text model development; although this path was not found to be significant for Group 2. On a more general level, the analyses conducted across groups, supported the general conclusions suggested by the CAEM. Individual difference factors were associated with a variety of processing variables; processing variables were generally found to predict integration performance.    Variables were considered to be approximately normal using +/-1 as a cut-off for skewness and +/-2 as a cut-off for kurtosis. a Because the time variable deviated significantly from normality, eight outliers were removed from the data and the time on texts variable was logarithmically transformed.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>examined the direct and indirect effects of individual difference factors on students' processing of multiple texts and, ultimately, on multiple text comprehension. Four individual difference factors were examined. These were (a) prior knowledge, (b) need for cognition, (c) epistemic beliefs about the need for knowledge to be justified by multiple sources, and (d) individual interest. Processing variables examined included situational interest, deeplevel strategy use, and effort, as assessed via the time that students devoted to multiple text access. Multiple text comprehension, asking students to consider or integrate disparate perspectives when responding to a series of open-ended questions, was examined as the outcome variable of interest and directly predicted only by prior knowledge. Students' deep-level strategy use was found to mediate the association between prior knowledge, epistemic beliefs, and need for cognition and multiple text comprehension performance. Effort devoted to multiple text use mediated the relation between individual interest and epistemic beliefs and multiple text comprehension. In sum, findings from Bråten et al. (2014) point to the mediating role of processing variables on students' comprehension of multiple texts. Moreover, their work suggests that a variety of individual difference factors, both cognitive and affective, have an effect on students' multiple text task performance. Present Study in Relation to Prior Work Modeling Learning from Multiple Texts This paper complements and expands work by Lund et al. (2019), Kobayashi (2009), and Bråten et al. (2014) in at least three ways. First, like Lund et al. (2019) and Kobayashi (2009), I examine the associations among a variety of multiple text-related outcomes, including measures of inter-text and integrated mental model construction, as facets of integration. Moreover, like Bråten et al. (2014), I include processing variables as mediating the relationship between individual difference factors and students' multiple text task performance. Finally, like both Lund et al. (2019) and Bråten et al. (2014), I include both cognitive and affective individual difference factors in predicting multiple text processing and performance. As such, this study models the associations among cognitive and affective individual difference factors and multiple text task performance, assessed via measures of integration, and mediated by multiple text</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Consistent with Figure 1, three types of measures, reflecting individual difference factors, process variables, and performance outcomes were examined. While individual difference factors were assessed prior to task completion, process variables and performance outcomes were assessed within the context of a multiple text task. Individual difference factors. Six individual differences were assessed in this study (i.e., prior knowledge, interest, habits with regard to information evaluation, attitudes, need for cognition, and justification by multiple texts). The individual difference factors correspondent to the CAEM are introduced in the methods, while attitudes (Appendix B), need for cognition (Appendix A), and justification by multiple texts (Appendix A) are discussed in the appendices wherein these factors are analyzed.</figDesc></figure>

In reporting results, I first describe loadings onto each latent construct in the measurement model, then results are introduced in terms of the direct and indirect paths predicting each outcome measure of interest (i.e., integrate mental model and intertext model development). Finally, additional relations in the model are d. Direct and indirect loadings are summarized in Table8.Factor loadings in the measurement modelInterest. Each of four items loaded significantly onto the interest factor (0.61-0.89), p-values&lt;0.001.Information evaluation. Each of six items loaded significantly onto the information evaluation factor (0.66-0.79), p-values&lt;0.001.Integrated Mental ModelDirect effects. Four direct effects (i.e., interest, students' habits with regard to information evaluation, total time, cross-textual elaboration) on integrated mental model development were examined in the model. However, only interest (𝛽=0.11, p=0.05) and the time that students devoted to text access (𝛽=0.44, p&lt;0.001) had a significant direct effect on integrated mental model development.Indirect effects. Four mediating paths were examined in the model (i.e., interest via time on texts; interest via cross-textual elaboration; information evaluation via time on texts; information evaluation via cross-textual elaboration) as predicting students' integrated mental model development. Two of these indirect paths were significant. First, interest predicted integrated mental model development, as mediated by time (𝛽=0.09, p&lt;0.01). Second, the relation between students' habits with regard to information evaluation and integrated mental model development were also significantly mediated by time (𝛽=0.06, p&lt;0.05).In total, 24.3% of the variance in integrated mental model development was explained by the direct and indirect effects in the model, suggesting a large effect.Intertext ModelDirect effects. Four direct effects were further examined as predicting intertext model development. The time that students devoted to text access (𝛽=0.37, p&lt;0.001) and students' engagement in cross-textual elaboration (𝛽=0.10, p=0.05) were found to have a direct effect on inter-text model formation.Indirect effects. Additionally, two of the four possible mediating effects in the model were found to be significant. That is the effect of both interest (𝛽=0.08, p&lt;0.01) and students' habits with regard to information evaluation (𝛽=0.05, p&lt;0.05) on inter-text model development were both found to be significantly mediated by the time that students devoted to text access.In total, 19.0% of variance in inter-text model development was explained by the direct and indirect effects in the model, indicating a medium effect.</figDesc></figure>

Second, this study separately modeled two outcomes associated with multiple text integration -integrated mental model and inter-text model development. While integrated mental model development corresponded to students forming a unified and coherent understanding of a particular topic, inter-text model development reflected students' structural understanding of information as coming from specific sources of origin and cross-source connection formation. While integrated mental model construction seems integral to learning from multiple texts, the purpose of inter-text model construction may be less clear.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A</head><p>Replicating analyses by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bråten et al. (2014)</ref>, I ran a latent path model to examine the associations among individual difference factors, processing variables, and multiple text task performance. Individual difference factors included were: topic interest, need for cognition, and students' endorsements of epistemic beliefs associated with the need to justify knowledge based on multiple texts. Processing factors included were: time devoted to text access, referred to by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bråten et al. (2014)</ref> as an indicator of effort, and students' reports of engagement in cross-textual elaboration. Outcome measures examined included measures of integrated mental model and inter-text model development.</p><p>These analyses differed from <ref type="bibr">Bråten et al.'s (2014)</ref> model in four ways. First, this study modeled individual difference factors as latent, rather than observed, variables. Second, this study did not include prior knowledge due to limitations in the reliability of this measure. Third, this study did not have a measure of situational interest as a processing factor. Four, this study examined an integration-focused set of multiple text learning outcomes including measures of integrated mental model and inter-text model development. The theorized model evaluated is presented in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>All measures used were the same as those reported in the full study, with two additional individual difference factors examined.</p><p>Need for cognition. Need for cognition was a six-item measure based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Cacioppo, Petty, and Kao (1984)</ref>. Only six items (e.g., I prefer complex to simple problems; I like situations that require a lot of thinking) were taken from the 18-item measure (i.e., those with the highest loadings), due to concerns over study length. Students rated each item on a five-point scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The six-item scale had a Cronbach's alpha reliability of 0.88.</p><p>Justifications for knowing by multiple texts. Students' endorsement of epistemic beliefs that knowledge ought be justified via multiple texts was assessed using four items from <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ferguson and Bråten's (2013)</ref> Justification by Multiple Sources beliefs sub-scale. Items included: Just one source is never enough to decide what is right and To be able to trust information in texts, I have to check various sources. Each item was scored on a five-point Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Cronbach's alpha reliability for the four-item scale was 0.74.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Replicating Bråten et al. (2014)</head><p>The model using individual difference factors and processing variables to predict multiple text task performance was found to have less than desired data fit, X 2 (119)=249.30, p&lt;0.001. Model fit indices were: CFI = 0.94, RMSEA = 0.06 (90%CI: 0.05 -0.07), SRMR = 0.05. In particular, the CFI index fell below the desired value of greater than 0.95 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hooper et al., 2008)</ref>. Significant direct paths and standardized loadings are presented in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Direct and indirect paths are summarized in Table <ref type="table">9</ref>.</p><p>Measurement model. All indicators were found to load significantly onto latent factors corresponding to interest (0.61-0.89, p-values&lt;0.001), need for cognition (0.68-0.85, p-values&lt;0.001), and beliefs about justification by multiple texts (0.52-0.73, p-values&lt;0.001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix C Representation of Arguments in Study Texts</head><p>The Economic Benefits of Trophy Hunting A. Trophy hunting raises substantial money for animal conservation. . . In total, trophy hunting generates $200 million annually for wildlife conservation in sub-Saharan Africa. Such a substantial sum of money for wildlife conservation could not otherwise be raised without the exorbitant fees that Westerners pay for trophy hunting licenses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Trophy hunting also benefits local communities in Africa, contributing to rural development.</head><p>Wildlife is the property of rural villages in the surrounding areas. In Zimbabwe, rural district councils allow villages to sell hunting licenses to safari operators, granting them access to their wildlife. Safari operators, in turn, sell opportunities for trophy hunting to wealthy foreigners, primarily from the United States... Selling access to their wildlife, via trophy hunting licenses is often one of the few ways that rural villages are able to make money.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Economic Harms of Trophy Hunting</head><p>A. While a common claim is that trophy hunting raises substantial funds for impoverished African nations, in fact, the trophy hunting industry is quite small, relative to the broader African tourism industry. For instance, in 2014 researchers from Princeton University found that while 8,500 trophy hunters visited South Africa each year, a staggering 9.5 million tourists did so. The tourism industry provides many more local jobs at hotels, restaurants, and wildlife parks, than does trophy hunting.</p><p>To the extent that the tourism industry rests on wildlife conservation, it can raise substantially more funds that trophy hunting, while those working in the tourism industry become personally and financially invested in wildlife conservation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix D</head><p>In addition to evaluating a model where measures of inter-text and integrated mental model development are collapsed, I also evaluated a multigroup effects model, where students' performance on the SVT, as a measure of integrated mental model development, and the SDT, as an indicator of inter-text model formation was evaluated separately from a second group of students, completing the CTI, as a measure of integrated mental model development, and the SSM, as a measure of inter-text model formation. All other measures and paths were identical to those examined in the collapsed model (See Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> for the theoretical model evaluated). Models for each group, with significant direct paths represented, are presented separately in Figures <ref type="figure">8</ref> and<ref type="figure">9</ref>. Direct and indirect paths across groups are summarized in Table <ref type="table">11</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall Model Fit:</head><p>The overall model had good data fit, X 2 (134)=217.76, p&lt;0.001; Group 1 X 2 =89.68; Group 2, X 2 =128.08. Model fit indices included CFI = 0.95, RMSEA = 0.06 (90%CI: 0.05 -0.08), and SRMR=0.05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group 1: Predicting SVT and SDT Performance</head><p>As in the full model, all indicators were found to load significantly onto interest (0.68-0.84, p-values&lt;0.001) and students' habits with regard to information evaluation (0.68-0.78, p-values&lt;0.001).</p><p>Mediators. Total time was only predicted by students' interest (𝛽 =0.24, p&lt;0.01), while cross-textual elaboration was predicted by students' habits with regard to information evaluation (𝛽 =0.22, p&lt;0.05), but not by interest (p &gt;0.13). In total, R 2 was 0.07 for the time devoted to text access and 0.08 for students' engagement in cross-textual elaboration.</p><p>Statement verification task performance. Direct effects. Performance on the statement verification task was significantly predicted by interest (𝛽 =0.14, p&lt;0.05) and by the amount of time that students devoted to text access (𝛽 =0.53, p&lt;0.001).</p><p>Indirect effects. Four mediating paths were examined, however, only one of these was significant. In particular, the effect on interest on integrated mental model development was significantly mediated by the time that students devoted to text access (𝛽 =0.13, p&lt;0.01).</p><p>In total 33.5% of variance in SVT performance was explained by the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Source differentiation performance.</head><p>Direct effects. The time that students devoted to multiple text access (𝛽 =0.29, p&lt;0.001) and students' engagement of strategies reflecting cross-textual elaboration (𝛽 =0.15, p&lt;0.05) were significant direct predictors of source differentiation performance.</p><p>Indirect effects. Four mediating paths were examined, in association with source differentiation performance, however only one of these was found to be significant. That is, interest was significantly associated with SDT performance, as mediated via time devoted to text access (𝛽 =0.07, p&lt;0.05).</p><p>In total 13.0% of variance in SDT performance was explained by the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Covariances.</head><p>Interest was not significantly associated with students' habits with regard to information evaluation (0.21, p=0.06). Integrated mental model development was significantly associated with inter-text model development (0.31, p&lt;0.001).  </p></div>			</div>
