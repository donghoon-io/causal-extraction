<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study aimed to test the original Occupational Well-being of School Staff Model (OWSS Model) from 2005. This model was tested using data collected in two stages (in 2010 and in 2013) from school staff in Finnish and Estonian public primary and secondary schools. In 2010, there were 486 Finnish respondents (Finnish study 1), and in 2013, there were 545 Finnish respondents (Finnish study 2). Correspondingly, there were 1330 Estonian respondents in 2010 (Estonian study 1), and 974 Estonian respondents in 2013 (Estonian study 2). Based on structural equation modelling, Finnish data from 2010 and 2013 suited the OWSS Model well. Based on Estonian data from 2010 and 2013, the model was slightly improved, but its main structures remained largely unchanged. On the whole, the results support the previous notion that the occupational well-being of school staff should be examined with reference to a broad spectrum of four viewpoints covering working conditions, worker and work, the working community and professional competence. General occupational well-being of the working community and subjective occupational well-being were best explained by working atmosphere and appreciation of others' work, especially in Finland. In Estonia, occupational well-being was best explained by working atmosphere and appreciation of others' work and working space, postures and equipment. Long-term testing with data from two countries and from two different testing periods confirmed that the model may continue to be applied in school contexts for planning, implementation and evaluation of occupational well-being, as well as for promoting public health.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>There is no uniform definition of occupational well-being, although it plays a significant role from a public health point of view. It may be defined as a summative concept describing the quality of an individual's working life (occupational health and safety considerations included) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Schulte &amp; Vainio, 2010)</ref>. It is perceived as a subjective <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Juniper, 2011)</ref> and multidimensional phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Horn, Taris, Schaufeli, &amp; Schreurs, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Juniper, 2011)</ref>. The multidimensional structure consists, among other things, of emotional-related cognitive, occupational, social and psychosocial issues and dimensions, and it may be best described as a multidimensional model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Horn et al., 2004)</ref>. Models developed for health promotion are useful tools for theoretical thinking and for the development of new strategies and new ways of working <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Naidoo &amp; Wills, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The Job Demand-Control Model, also known as the Job Strain Model, may be perceived as the traditional model for addressing the origin of work-related stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Karasek, 1979)</ref>. Other traditional methods of addressing occupational well-being are the model of affective well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Warr, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Warr, 1990)</ref> and the Effort-Reward Imbalance Model at Work, which is based on the relationship between work efforts and rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Siegrist, 1996)</ref>. The Job Demands-Resources Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, &amp; Schaufeli, 2001</ref>) has been frequently used in studies on occupational well-being, as well as in school contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Hakanen, Bakker, &amp; Schaufeli, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Vera, Salanova, &amp; Lorente, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Salmela-Aro &amp; Upadyaya, 2014)</ref>. In this model, occupational well-being is examined from the viewpoint of job demands (arising from physical, social and organizational factors, such as time pressure and workload) and resources (factors that help in achieving goals, coping and developing work skills, e.g., feedback, participation in decision-making and support from supervisors) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Demerouti et al., 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Models describing occupational well-being have also been developed from the perspective of the school community. The Structural Equations Model of Demands, Personal Resources and Job Resources in Teacher Well-being, for example, is a model that describes teachers' well-being from the viewpoint of burnout and commitment, which not only reflect work demands and occupational resources (autonomy, social support from colleagues and supervisors, varying work tasks and feedback) but also subjective resources (self-efficacy and cognitive and behaviouristic resources for coping) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bermejo-Toro, Prieto-Ursúa, &amp; Hernández, 2016)</ref>. Occupational well-being in schools is also well described in the Occupational Well-being of School Staff Model (OWSS Model), in which occupational well-being comprises four aspects: working conditions, worker and work, working community and professional competence. In the OWSS Model, subjective well-being and the working community's well-being are explained from the perspective of all four aspects and the following factors: working spaces, postures and equipment (working conditions); workload (worker and work); working atmosphere and appreciation of others' work (working community) and substantive competence and interaction (professional competence) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Saaranen, Tossavainen, Turunen, Kiviniemi, &amp; Vertio, 2007)</ref>.  public primary and secondary schools. The response rates were 55% in Finland and 67% in Estonia. In 2013, 545 Finnish participants (N = 961) responded from 21 schools, and 974 Estonian participants (N = 1871) responded from 38 schools. Consequently, response rates were 57% in Finland and 52% in Estonia. The schools in Finland and Estonia participated in both the initial and final measurements. Three Finnish schools involved in the initial measurement dropped out due to other obligations and therefore did not participate in the final measurement. Furthermore, three Finnish schools joined the project later, after the initial measurement, and therefore only participated in the final measurement. Background variables and the levels of subjective occupational well-being and the working community's occupational well-being are described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>The Well-being at Your Work Index Questionnaire was developed based on literature and has been utilized in previous national and international studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Saaranen, Tossavainen, Turunen, &amp; Naumanen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Saaranen et al., 2012)</ref>. It includes ten questions relating to background variables, four Likert scale (1-5) questions relating to occupational well-being and actions promoting occupational well-being, and one open question relating to actions that promote occupational well-being. The questionnaire includes individual variables relating to the four aspects of occupational well-being: 1) working conditions, 2) worker and work, 3) working community and 4) professional competence (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). After each section, the respondent has the chance to answer two open questions and to give additional information pertaining to prior statements or to name other factors affecting occupational well-being. </p></div>

To test the model, the following endogenous variables based on the original OWSS Model were used: 1) the working community's general staff well-being (GW) and 2) school staff members' subjective occupational well-being at this workplace compared with the best level (SW) (Likert scale 1-5). Both the Finnish and Estonian models had two endogenous variables, which required using a genuine multivariate approach. As exogenous variables, sum variables were used, which were formulated based on the previous OWSS Model and on factoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Saaranen et al., 2006)</ref>. As in the original model, the exogenous variables used were: 1) working space, postures and equipment, 2) workload, 3) working atmosphere and appreciation of others' work and 4) substantive competence and interaction. With the Cronbach's alpha coefficient calculated for the factors, the uniformity of a given factor was investigated with the data collected in Finland and Estonia in 2010 and 2013, and with a fluctuation margin of 0.53-0.89 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). A commonly accepted value falls between 0.60-0.70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Hair, Black, Babin, &amp; Anderson, 2010)</ref>. The relationship between the endogenous variables and the exogenous variables was unidirectional.</p><p>The data from Finland and Estonia collected in 2010 (Finnish study 1 and Estonian study 1) and 2013 (Finnish study 2 and Estonian study 2) were tested using the original OWSS Model. Statistical modelling (parameters estimation) was formulated using the AMOS software, which was also used in the construction of the original model. The effects of the standardized estimates of the model were interpreted as follows: the effect is minor if the standardized estimate is &lt; 0.10, the effect is average if the standardized estimate is around 0.30, and the effect is significant if the standardized estimate is &gt; 0.50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Kline, 1998)</ref>.

While testing the original model with the Estonian materials, it was discovered that its standardized estimates remained minor and that the statistics used for measuring its adequacy and goodness seemed weak. For this reason, the Estonian model was supplemented with one item from the variable working space, postures and equipment to the variable subjective occupational well-being at the workplace compared to the best level. This alteration seemed to improve the Estonian model's suitability (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</p><p>The suitability and goodness of the structural equation models were evaluated using several criteria ( </p></div>

Also, working space, postures and equipment were found to have an effect of medium value (0.13), and workload (0.08) had a minor effect on the working community's general occupational well-being.

Additionally, substantive competence and interaction correlated with subjective occupational well-being (0.13).</p><p>All sum variables correlated with each other (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>), and their values were mediate (0.33-0.39). The exogenous variables explained 35% of the occupational well-being of the working community and 25% of the subjective occupational well-being (see squared multiple correlations in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). The equivalent expression of the percentages is the coefficient of determination. The compatibility of material from 2010 with the model was tested, and all compatibility tests (x 2 , NFI, CFI and RMSEA) supported its suitability (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>In the Finnish model (study 2; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), working atmosphere and appreciation of others' work continued to have the most common and significant relationship with the working community's occupational well-being (0.56). It was also found that working space, postures and equipment (0.10) and workload (0.11) were related to the working community's occupational well-being. Working atmosphere and appreciation of others' work were most significantly related to subjective occupational well-being (0.36).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>To collect materials for the structural equation models, a previously developed and tested measure was used because its validity and reliability had been found to be good <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Saaranen et al., 2007)</ref>. The amount and content of the study materials are considered appropriate for structural equation models. The volume was larger compared to the materials used for constructing and testing the original OWSS Model. Response rates were reasonably good in both countries. The initial measurement comprised three Finnish schools, which did not participate in the final measurement. Additionally, three Finnish schools participated in the final measurement but not in the initial measurement. These changes were, however, small and had little effect on the whole project. The alpha values of the factors vary between 0.53-0.89, which provides a reasonable assurance of their functionality. While evaluating the suitability of the Finnish and Estonian models to the materials, acceptable p-values from the chi-square test were produced (except in the 2013 Estonian model). The models' compatibility with the materials was tested using RMSEA, and the results supported the models' suitability. Similar results were obtained from the CFI and NFI compatibility indexes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>← = one-way arrow depicts a unidirectional effect between two variables. ↔ = two-way arrow depicts a correlation between variables.  In this article, the original OWSS model from 2005 was further tested and developed with data collected in Finland and Estonia in 2010 and 2013. There are grounds for testing the model because testing and developing a theory is an ongoing process, which already began in 2002. Based on the results, the Finnish materials from 2010 and 2013 are compatible with the OWSS model, which supports the research hypothesis. However, the models did not fit the Estonian materials from 2010 and 2013 without alterations. Therefore, in this respect, the hypothesis was not fully supported by these materials. As a limitation of the study, the intervention may be considered to have a limited impact on the well-being of the school staff. The intervention was based on school-specific development activities, making development activities unique in every school. Occupational well-being is defined in the literature in different ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Horn et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Juniper, 2011)</ref>, and the self-assessment of occupational well-being can also be understood by people in a subjectively different way.</p><p>All sum variables in all models had an effect on occupational well-being, and indirect correlations between s Num variables were observed. The coefficient of determination in the original model was 23% for the general well-being of the staff in the working community (GW) and 17% for subjective well-being at this workplace compared to the best level (SW) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Based on these materials, the corresponding coefficient of determination of the Finnish models was higher (study 1: GW 35% and SW 25%; study 2: GW 43% and SW 34%) compared to the original model. Because the Estonian models could not readily be applied to the original OWSS Model, they had to be slightly altered. All in all, the Estonian models exceeded the original model's coefficient of determination, but they fell below the Finnish models' coefficients of determination (study 1: GW 22% and SW 25%; and study 2: GW 27% and SW 30%). Therefore, the tested Finnish (study 2) OWSS Model is the most applicable of these models (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</p><p>Testing the original OWSS Model with the new data (2010 and 2013) reasserted the notion that there are four aspects affecting school staff's occupational well-being: working conditions, work and worker, working community and professional competence. This study also reinforced the previous notion that the working community has a powerful impact on occupational well-being, particularly in Finland. The aspect of social support and working community/social support is also underlined in other models, which explain occupational well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Saaranen et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bermejo-Toro et al., 2016)</ref> It is also noteworthy that despite the enhancements of the Estonian models, the link between the variable of substantive competence and interaction remained insignificant, although this may be partly due to the fact that the questionnaire contained few variables related to this. This poses the future challenge of developing the Well-being at Your Work Index Questionnaire with this aspect in mind.</p><p>Workers experience occupational well-being subjectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Juniper, 2011)</ref>, which means modelling it can be a challenge. However, this model, which has been developed over a long period of time and has now been subjected to further testing, supports the conceptualization and theorization of occupational well-being. By means of this model, factors pertaining to occupational well-being can be identified, and it serves as a theoretical framework for understanding the phenomenon of occupational well-being. This previously produced model and its applicability have now been tested in two countries. With these justifications, this study further reinforces the previous perception that the structural model of occupational well-being can be used in practice in school contexts to promote occupational well-being. The results also show that the meaning and proportion of the working community in the model has a greater impact than the other sections, which must be taken into account when working to promote occupational well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>This model has been tested and developed in the framework of a long-term action research study. Initially, it was only tested in the Finnish school context, but now it has been tested further and developed in both the Finnish and the international school contexts with four different study materials. The model's further testing has reconfirmed the notion that school staff's subjective occupational well-being and the working community's general occupational well-being should be investigated with broad multi-disciplinary approaches and that they are affected by 1) working conditions (working space, postures and equipment), 2) worker and work (workload), 3) working community (working atmosphere and appreciation of others' work) and 4) professional competence (substantive competence and interaction). It seems, however, that working community has a larger effect on occupational well-being than the other aspects. This further testing has proven that the structural equation model continues to be a feasible tool for describing and explaining practice. It has been used and can be used to promote school staff's occupational well-being and to improve public health from the viewpoint of practice, education and theory. The model provides a concrete framework, which enables school staff's active participation in promoting subjective occupational well-being and the entire working community's occupational well-being. The occupational well-being index and theory require further future testing and development in varying school contexts (e.g., vocational education and higher education). Moreover, this model can, to some extent, be applied and tested for promoting occupational well-being not only in schools but in other working communities as well.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The study described in this article is part of a project called "Promoting the Occupational Well-Being of SchoolStaff-Action Research Project in Finland and Estonia, 2009-2014". This long-term action research project applied a multidisciplinary approach (combined qualitative and quantitative methodology) and the triangulation of data (quantitative initial and final measurement, qualitative interim evaluation on implementation of interventions). The purpose of this study was to test the original OWSS Model from 2005 (Figure1). This study was based on the following hypothesis: the data collected in Finnish and Estonian schools in 2010 and 2013 corresponds to the original OWSS Model from 2005. The model can be utilized by school staff and administration in school communities, professionals in nursing as well as educators and researchers working in health promotion as several examples.</figDesc></figure>
