<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this study was to determine the effect of secondary school students' writing tendency, writing selfefficacy and writing attitude variables and how these variables predict each other through structural equation modeling. For this purpose, the relational screening model was used and the study was carried out in academic year 2018-2019 on a total of 290 students;153 (52.8%) were females and 137 (47.2%) were males studying in 4 different secondary schools in Erzurum. Twenty of the students were in the 5th grade, 30 were in the 6th grade, 104 were in the 7th grade and 122 were in the 8th grade. In the study, the writing disposition scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Piazza and Siebert (2008)</ref> and adapted to Turkish by Iseri &amp; Ünal (2010); writing attitude scale developed by Can &amp; Topçuoğlu Ünal (2017); and writing self-efficacy scale developed by Şengül (2013) were applied to secondary school students. After their validity and reliability were ensured, the data were analyzed. As a result of the study, it was determined that writing tendency had a positive effect on writing attitude, and despite writing self-efficacy positively affected writing attitude, it did not affect it significantly statistically.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Language, the most perfect and complex way of communication between society and individuals, is the general name of the toolsets that provide communication between living creatures and living creatures; living creatures and things that can be counted as partly living (Machines) and living and nonliving things (physicochemist world) <ref type="bibr">(Gemalmaz, 2010, p. 53)</ref>. The basic elements of this advanced system known as language are listening, reading, speaking and writing skills, which are commonly called as the four skills of language in the literature. By help of these four skills, language becomes the most important part of the network of communication in society. The development of these four skills is necessary for both foreigners who want to learn that language and for the users of that language <ref type="bibr">(Şahin, 2012, p. 1)</ref>.</p><p>The four basic skills of the language are not in a structure that develops independently and needs to be evaluated separately but on the contrary, they complement each other and their development processes must be evaluated together. In the language training process, all skills are different, but all of them are equally important. In terms of efficiency of teaching Turkish, basic skills areas need to be developed in an integrated manner with adequate, effective and appropriate activities <ref type="bibr">(İşeri &amp; Ünal, 2010, p. 106)</ref>. Therefore, training processes for language skills should be planned well.</p><p>The writing skills, which is learnt after other language skills, constitute the narrative dimension of the language together with the speaking skill. Writing is not a mechanical process; on the contrary, it is a critical thinking process in terms of being a skill in the areas of cognitive, social and affective. This process includes learning, understanding, application and synthesis of new knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Defazio, Jones, Tennant &amp; Hook, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Demirel, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Schultz &amp; Fecho, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">White &amp; Bruning, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>There are some important factors affecting the success of writing practice which contribute to the development of students' mental, language, social and independence skills <ref type="bibr">(Güneş, 2007, p. 162)</ref>. The students' beliefs such as writing tendencies, writing attitudes, and writing self-efficacy are the leading factors. Writing is the most difficult language skill as it requires high level of thinking abilities. Having a complex nature, writing provides individuals with such skills as observation power, ability to analyze, ability to perceive, rich vocabulary, etc. when cultivated properly. However, there are many factors in play to succeed in writing. Emerging in cognitive, affective and psychomotor dimensions, these factors have a direct impact on writing to achieve its goal. Writing disposition, writing attitude and writing selfefficacy of students are primary factors in this regard. It is considered important to identify writing disposition, writing attitude and perceived writing self-efficacy of students, and to develop them in a positive direction for achieving the desired goal in writing. Having a closer look at writing disposition, writing attitude and perceived writing self efficacy provides better understanding of the subject.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Literature review</head><p>In order to improve writing skills and to ensure the success of writing activities, it is important to determine the students' tendency towards writing and to develop them in a positive way. Because this tendency towards writing is a strong motivation source <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bruning &amp; Horn, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>The word "tendency" synonymous with the words Meyil &amp; Temayül is defined as follows intending to love, want or do something in Turkish dictionary (Turkish Language <ref type="bibr">Society, 2011, p. 605)</ref>. The concept of tendency in many different areas such as politics, education, art and psychology can be understood as the internal tendency of a person to a certain view, understanding, behavior and belief. The tendency, defined as the frequency of action according to some is guided by the individual's values, beliefs, attitudes (researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Buss &amp; Craik, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Katz, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Almerico, Johnston, Henriott &amp; Shapiro, 2011)</ref>. According to this, tendency arises at the stage of the transformation of these beliefs and attitudes into behavior. Therefore, it can be considered that the tendency plays a triggering role in the process of realizing an individual behavior <ref type="bibr">(Baştuğ, 2015, p. 75)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, the writing tendency means, wanting to write, liking to write, having tolerance to any difficulties in the process of writing, and to become motivated to overcome any difficulties in writing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baştuğ, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Piazza &amp; Siebert, 2008)</ref>. Writing tendency is a concept divided into different dimensions by different scientists. For example, McClenny examined the writing tendency in three dimensions. These dimensions are: the cognitive dimension which consists of students' knowledge and skills; motivation, patience, self-efficacy, factors affecting the student's willingness to participate in any event; and, finally, the social context dimension which is formed through the combination / intersection of cognition and emotion dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(McClenny, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, Piazza and Siebert divided the writing tendency into three different dimensions. These are: confidence dimension expressing the individual's confidence in himself and his ability to write; determination dimension expressing the individuals' will to constantly wanting to write; and finally, the dedication of the individual to write and him wanting to write non-stop, the dimension of passion <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Piazza &amp; Siebert, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baş and Şahin (2013)</ref> suggested that gender, educational level of parents and family income variables affect writing disposition in primary school students. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Uçgun (2014)</ref> found that there was no significant relationship between students' writing disposition and educational level of their parents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baştuğ (2015)</ref> stressed that writing disposition and writing attitude affect writing achievement in a significantly positive way while writing attitude and disposition affect writer's block in a significantly negative way, and writer's block has a significantly negative impact on writing achievement. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berk and Ünal (2017)</ref>, writing disposition is a significant predictor of writing apprehension.</p><p>Self-efficacy is defined as situational awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bandura, 1982)</ref> about the individual's confidence in his / her ability to successfully implement the plan and to plan the steps necessary to display a certain performance in a particular subject. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Snyder and Lopez (2002)</ref>, although self-efficacy is not a skill that can be observed or perceived, it can be defined as the inner belief that the individual has for his / her answer to the question of "what I can do in this situation". Based on these definitions, writing self-efficacy refers to the individual's perception of his / her own level of writing skill. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hidi &amp; Boscolo (2006)</ref> describe the self-efficacy of writing as a personal perception of one's ability to form texts; while <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pajares, Hartley &amp; Valiante (2001)</ref> defined it as that students' beliefs about whether they can write articles that can be appropriate to their academic level.</p><p>The higher the self-efficacy that can be at different levels, strengths and prevalence in each person, the higher the strength of struggle, the sense of patience and the motivation. In other words, self-efficacy has a significant impact on the success of individuals. Thus, the writing skill of individuals is a condition associated with their ability to be successful in terms of writing performance and a positive self-efficacy perception <ref type="bibr">(Şengül, 2013, p. 82</ref>). The student with the writing self-efficacy believes that he will succeed before he starts writing and it is easy for him to continue the behavior as he / she starts with a high level of motivation <ref type="bibr">(Demir, 2013, p. 92)</ref>. It is not difficult to predict that a student with a lower self-efficacy is less involved in writing-related jobs or tasks and has given up more quickly in the face of the difficulties they face <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Pajares, 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Demir (2013)</ref> indicated that students with high writing selfefficacy also usually have good creative writing skills. <ref type="bibr">Şengül (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Büyükikiz (2012)</ref> developed a valid and reliable scale to measure writing self-efficacy.</p><p>The concept of attitude is a subject, which has been emphasized in many disciplines, especially in psychology. Attitude is an emotional readiness or tendency of an individual to accept or reject as a particular person, a group, an institution, or a thought <ref type="bibr">(Özgüven, 1994, p. 336)</ref>.</p><p>The attitudes people gain during their lives continue for a certain period of time. Thus, after gaining an attitude, attitude cannot be considered as neutral against the situation or the object it has been formed towards. Attitudes that are very difficult to change once they have been gained are considered to be the dispositional tendency of the individual and have a measurable property <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Tavşancıl, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Silah, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sözer, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Susar Kırmızı &amp; Beydemir, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In the light of this information <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Graham, Berninger and Fan (2007)</ref> consider writing attitude as one of the motivating factors in writing and describe it as a process which includes an effective writing tendency. Attitudes are critical in the education of language skills, especially in the education of reading and writing skills. What makes the writing attitude important is that it is an important predictor, which has a direct effect on students' writing achievement. Therefore, developing positive attitudes towards writing in students should be one of the primary objectives of writing activities. Because positive attitudes create an opportunity for students to increase their writing success, to make more efforts to write and to write more often; negative attitudes will cause students to lose their writing success, avoid effort to write, and avoid writing as much as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baş &amp; Şahin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baştuğ, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Graham, Berninger and Fan, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Karatay, 2011)</ref>. As a result, students' positive or negative experiences in writing in the past cause students to gain positive or negative attitudes towards writing. The attitudes gained as a factor directly affect the students' writing success. Writing activity has a positive impact on the attitude towards writing (Susar <ref type="bibr">Kırmızı, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Susar Kırmızı and Beydemir, 2012)</ref>. In parallel with this finding, it was reported that prospective Turkish teachers attached greater importance to writing thanks to the Lecturing Techniques II: Writing Training course they received <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Göçer, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>

As a result of EFA, it was determined that 40 of the 30 items are positive, 10 of them are negative, and that it consists of a fourfactor structure including writing skill awareness , writing psychology , personal progress and general progress . Since CFA was not performed, there is no data for good fit indexes of the model. In order to determine the reliability of the scale, Cronbach Alpha internal consistency coefficient and Guttman Split-Half Coefficient and Spearman-Brown Coefficient were also calculated. Cronbach Alpha internal consistency coefficient was found to be 0.92 for the scale, 0.91 for the writing skill awareness factor, 0.86 for the writing psychology factor, and 0.88 for the personal progress factor.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>In this study, the effects of writing tendency and writing attitudes on the writing self-efficacy of secondary school students were investigated. For this purpose, first of all, correlation analysis was conducted to test the relationship between the writing attitude of the research and the predictive tendency of the research and the writing self-efficacy in the process of analyzing the data related to the effect of "writing tendency" and "writing self-efficacy" on "writing attitude". The relationships between variables are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, there is a positive but low relationship between the confidence dimension and continuity dimension; while there is a positive and moderate relationship between confidence dimension and other dimensions. While the continuity dimension has positive and moderate relationship with confidence, passion and interest dimension, it has positive and weak relationship with other dimensions. In the study, there is a positive and strong relationship only between interest dimension and passion dimension. Last but not least, it can be said that there is a positive and moderate relationship between passion, interest, perception, contribution, writing skill awareness, writing psychology, personal progress and general progress dimensions. In the values between variables, 0-0.29 signifies a weak-level relationship, 0.30-0.69 signifies an moderate-level relationship, and 0.70-1.00 signifies a strong-level relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Büyüköztürk, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>After examining the relationships between the predictive and predicted variables of the research, the predictive effect of the "writing attitude" variable on the "writing tendency" and "writing self-efficacy" variable was tested through track analysis. The model tested is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>.  The goodness of fit achieved through the structural equation modeling, which is established to determine the effect of writing tendency and self-efficacy on writing attitudes was χ 2 : 4.14, sd: 32, RMSEA: 0.07, CFI: 0.89, GFI: 0.88, AGFI: 0,80. According to these results, it can be said that the obtained values are at an acceptable level. As a result of the testing of the structural model, the factor loads of the writing tendency variable were found to be between 0.57 and 0.82, the factor loads of the writing self-efficacy variable were found to be between 0.57 and 0.82, and the factor loads of the writing attitude variable were found to be between 0.56 and 0.88. The standardized regression coefficients of the structural model are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, it was determined that writing attitude was predicted by writing tendency positively and significantly (β: 1.06, p &lt;0.01) and these results were statistically significant (p &lt;0.01). According to this "H1: Writing tendency positively and significantly predicts writing" hypothesis was accepted. It was found that the writing attitude was positively but not significantly influenced by the writing selfefficacy (β: 0.02, p &lt;0.05) and that this result was not statistically significant (p&gt;.005). According to this "H2: Writing self-efficacy positively and significantly predicts writing attitudes" hypothesis was rejected.</p><p>The Results section presents the study's findings. Results should be clear and concise.</p><p>It includes numbers, tables, and figures (e.g., charts and graphs). The information presented and conveyed to the reader in this section should be written objectively, factually, and without expressing personal opinion. For example, you should not make statements such as, "We were disappointed to see that more female participants opted to use computers than male participants as we are often accustomed to seeing male students play computer games."</p><p>A good way to organize and discuss your research findings is to restate the hypothesesresearch questions, one by one, and present the data collected to test each of them. It is your decision as to what data to present in a narrative form and what to present in tables or figures. Very often, the tables and figures are accompanied by a narrative explanation. You do not need to describe in words everything presented in a numerical or visual form. Instead, take the reader through the numerical and visual information. As the author, you should highlight the main findings, point to trends and patterns, and guide the reader through the information you present. For example, in a table displaying results from four independent-samples t tests, you can state that the second t value, which was used to test the second research hypothesis, was statistically significant at p &lt; .01, and that the mean of the experimental group was eight points higher than the mean of the control group. You do not need to repeat in the narrative all the numerical information reported in the tables. Or, suppose your Results chapter includes a doublebar graph that is used to show trends and differences in the percentages of male and female teachers in preschool, elementary school, and high school. You may explain that the trend is for the percentage of male teachers to increase with grade level, whereas the percentage of female teachers decreases from preschool to high school.</p><p>Number tables consecutively in accordance with their appearance in the text. Place footnotes to tables below the table body and indicate them with superscript lowercase letters. Avoid vertical rules. Be sparing in the use of tables and ensure that the data presented in tables do not duplicate results described elsewhere in the article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion and conclusions</head><p>In this study, the relationship between writing tendencies and writing self-efficacy levels of secondary school students and the relationship between these variables were examined through structural equation modeling. As a result of the research, the model established for the related literature was tested.</p><p>The first hypothesis of the study was proved. Accordingly, it was found that students' writing disposition affects their writing attitude in a significantly positive way. Since both concepts are positive, it is only expected that they affect each other in a positive manner. Confidence and persistence, two of the writing disposition constructs, had a moderate positive impact on writing attitude while attitude towards writing had a positive, high impact on writing disposition. In parallel with the findings of the present study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baştuğ (2015)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Knudson (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lee (2013)</ref> reported that writing disposition affects writing attitude significantly. <ref type="bibr">Kırmızı (2009)</ref> found that students with low writing attitude did not want to write. There are also studies indicating that the positive high relationship between writing attitude and writing disposition improves academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(McClenny, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tüfekçioğlu, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akaydın and Kurnaz (2015)</ref> emphasize that there is a close relationship between positive attitude toward writing and engagement in writing activities happily. Those who have positive attitude toward writing are more successful than those with negative attitude since the former engage in writing more <ref type="bibr">(Graham, Berninger and Fan, 2007, p. 518)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, second hypothesis of the study was not proven. According to the results of the study, students' writing self-efficacy did not have a significant impact on their writing attitude. Although writing self-efficacy affected writing attitude of students in a positive way, no significant relationship was found between the two concepts. Despite the existence of a positive relationship between awareness of writing skills, writing psychology, personal development and overall development, and writing attitude, it was a weak relationship. An analysis of the relevant literature demonstrated no other study that investigated the relationship between writing self-efficacy and writing attitude. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">McCarthy, Meier and Rinderer (1985)</ref> as well as <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schunk and Swartz (1993)</ref> maintained that writing selfefficacy has a positive impact on writing achievement.</p><p>In the light of these results, the following suggestions can be made:</p><p>• The relationship between other language skills and self-efficacy, tendency and attitude can be examined.</p><p>• Qualitative research can be carried out involving Turkish teachers and / or prospective Turkish teachers.</p><p>Ortaokul öğrencilerinin yazma eğilim ve öz yeterliklerinin yazma tutumları üzerindeki etkisi: Bir yapısal eşitlik modellemesi </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.

Bu amaç doğrultusunda tarama modellerinden ilişkisel tarama modeli olarak desenlen araştırma, 2018-2019 eğitim öğretim yılında Erzurum ilinde 4 farklı ortaokulda öğrenim gören 153'ü (% 52.8) kız, 137'si (% 47.2) erkek olmak üzere toplam 290 öğrenciyle yürütülmüştür. Öğrencilerin 20'si 5. sınıf, 30'u 6. sınıf, 104'ü 7. sınıf ve 122'si 8. sınıf düzeyinde öğrenim görmektedirler. AraştırmadaPiazza ve Siebert'in (2008)  geliştirdiği, İşeri ve Ünal (2010) tarafından Türkçeye uyarlanan yazma eğilimi ölçeği; Can ve Topçuoğlu Ünal'ın (2017) geliştirdiği yazma tutum ölçeği veŞengül'ün (2013)  geliştirdiği yazma öz yeterlik ölçeği ortaokul öğrencilerine uygulanıp geçerlik ve güvenirlikleri sağlandıktan sonra verilerin analizi yapılmıştır. Araştırma sonucunda yazma eğiliminin yazma tutumunu olumlu etkilediği, yazma öz yeterliklerin yazma tutumunu olumlu etkilemesine rağmen istatistiksel açıdan anlamlı düzeyde etkilemediği belirlenmiştir.Faruk Polatcan currently an assistant professor in the Department of Turkish and Social Sciences at Sinop University, holds MA and PhD in Turkish Teaching from Atatürk University, Erzurum.
