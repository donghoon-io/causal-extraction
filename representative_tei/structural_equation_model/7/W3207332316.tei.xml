<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>More than 1 billion people worldwide regularly use social networking services (SNSs), such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, which are virtual communities where users interact and build online and real-life relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. Similar to the global trend, the number of SNS users has substantially increased from 68% in 2014 to 83% in 2018 in Hong Kong (HK) <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> which has 1 of the highest penetration rates of the internet and e-devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Compared with other age groups, younger age groups more popularly use SNSs, and 95% of young people in HK, aged from 10 to 24 years, used SNSs for an average of 17.7 h/week (the longest SNS use than other age groups) in 2018 <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. As SNS use has gained popularity, problematic SNS use, such as excessive SNS use, which is a relatively long duration or frequent use of SNSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, has also increased among young people <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Evidence has shown that excessive SNS use has a negative impact on young people's physical health (eg, headache, postural pain, and eye strain) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, real-life social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Moreover, although SNS platforms provide more pervasive environments for individuals to share their feelings and follow other interesting friends, previous studies have reported that excessive SNS use shows a strong association with psychological distress, including depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, such as feeling frustrated or isolated from their real life <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and feeling vulnerable to the perceptions of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Excessive SNS use has shown significant association with addictive behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, including feeling constantly anxious or uneasy about one's SNS accounts and having strong urges to use SNSs. SNS addiction is thus defined as the excessive use of SNSs that affects one's daily activities, interpersonal relationships, and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Although SNS addiction has not been specifically identified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5th Edition (DSM-5) or the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11), SNS addiction can be considered as 1 form of behavior addiction, reflecting excessive and compulsive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, similar to internet gaming disorder. However, SNS addiction can be differentiated from other behavior addictions as users focus on interpersonal networking through SNSs. According to gratification theory, users who gain enjoyment and happiness through SNS platforms would continue to spend even more time using SNSs in pursuit of more positive gratification <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Therefore, SNS addiction may result from gratification attained through online surfing and through virtual and real-life interpersonal relationships. Meanwhile, recent studies have found that 29% of university students have SNS addiction and that SNS addiction is associated with anxiety, depression, and mania symptoms, similar to prior studies that investigated excessive SNS use <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</p><p>Although recent studies have identified associations between excessive SNS use, SNS addiction, and mental health status, it remains unknown whether there is a clear pathway from excessive SNS use to SNS addiction, thus influencing users' mental health (ie, pathway). As SNS use patterns can be differentiated by their social contexts (eg, different cultural values in interpersonal relationships on SNSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>), excessive SNS use and SNS addiction can be influenced by the users' psychosocial status (ie, the influence of social factors on one's mind <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>), such as the influence of social isolation and loneliness precipitating SNS use <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, while conversely influencing their mental health. Moreover, the possible mediating effect of SNS addiction on the pathway has been deduced as SNS addiction is also associated with SNS use patterns, psychosocial status, and mental health status <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to testing a hypothetical model and the potential mediating role of SNS addiction among Chinese university students in HK.</p><p>Based on the existing literature and knowledge gap, we developed the following hypotheses for this study and a hypothetical model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>): </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design and Sampling</head><p>A cross-sectional study design was adopted. An online survey link (Google Form) and a QR code printed on survey invitation flyers were distributed in busy public areas (eg, the entrance of library and cafeteria) within 2 major public university campuses in HK from February to March 2019. The online survey website included the study aim, respondents' rights, and participation incentive (50 respondents were randomly selected through a lucky draw for a HK $25 [around US $3.2] cash voucher). The respondents were also invited to freely share the survey link with their peers from any HK university (ie, convenience and snowball sampling). The inclusion criteria were enrolled university students residing in HK with at least 1 SNS account. Exchange students from outside HK and respondents who did not answer more than 10 survey questions were excluded. To prevent multiple responses and confirm their identity as university students, each respondent's mobile phone number and university email address were collected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics and SNS Use</head><p>Demographic characteristics, including sex, age, university, degree pursued, and academic performance, were investigated. The respondents' patterns of SNS use (eg, overall time spent on SNS per day, time spent on each SNS access, SNS access frequency, and SNS use duration before sleeping and after waking) were surveyed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SNS Addiction</head><p>SNS addiction was measured using a revised version of the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale (BFAS), which consists of 6 questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. The BFAS presented 0.83 internal consistency and reported convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The overall score of the BFAS ranged from 6 to 30, with higher scores indicating a higher level of SNS addiction. The term "Facebook" in each item was changed to "SNSs" to include a wider range of SNSs, similar to Andreassen et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The internal consistency (Cronbach α) of the BFAS in this study was also 0.83.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mental Health Status</head><p>The Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) was used to screen for psychological symptoms among the respondents. The PHQ-4 consists of 2 domains (ie, depression and anxiety), and each domain has 2 questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The total score in each domain ranges from 0 to 6. Higher scores in the 2 domains refer to higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. The internal consistency of the 2 domains was 0.82 and 0.81, respectively, in the original study <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and 0.79 and 0.86, respectively, in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychosocial Status</head><p>The respondents' psychosocial status was measured according to their psychological well-being, social isolation, and loneliness. First, the Flourishing Scale was adopted to measure the respondents' subjective psychological well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The scale consists of 8 questions with an overall score range from 8 to 56, and higher scores represent higher subjective psychological well-being. The Flourishing Scale showed an internal consistency as 0.87 and convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The internal consistency in this study was 0.92. Second, we adopted the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6) consisting of 6 questions to investigate the respondents' social isolation level <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The overall score ranges from 0 to 30, and higher scores indicate lower levels of social isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The internal consistency of the LSNS-6 was 0.83 in the original study and 0.75 in this study. Lastly, a brief loneliness scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> was also adopted to measure the respondents' feelings of loneliness. The scale consists of 3 questions, and the total score ranges from 3 to 9. The internal consistency of the loneliness scale in the original research <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> and this study was 0.72 and 0.89, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>Descriptive analysis was conducted to detail the respondents' information about demographic characteristics, SNS use and addiction, and psychological profile. For continuous variables, the mean and SD were used, and for categorical variables, the frequency and percentage were used for analysis. Multiple linear regression was performed to assess the association between SNS use and SNS addiction. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to examine the pathways from SNS use to mental health status. Multiple imputation was performed for missing data. Total, direct, and indirect effects in the hypothesized model were estimated using the maximum likelihood and bias-corrected (BC) 95% CI by the bootstrapping method with 2000 replications. Fitness indices of the SEM were considered, including the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA; suggested close to or smaller than 0.06), the comparative fit index (CFI; suggested close to or larger than 0.95), the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI; suggested close to or larger than 0.95), and the standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR; suggested close to or smaller than 0.08) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. IBM SPSS 24.0 and Amos 26.0 were used for all analyses at a .05 significance level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Respondents' Characteristics</head><p>Of the 533 respondents, 483 (90.6%) who met the eligible criteria were included in this study. The mean age was 20.87 years (SD 2.68), and 66.9% (n=323) of the respondents were female. The majority (459/483, 95.0%) were from University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities (ie, large public universities) and undertook higher diploma or undergraduate courses (466/483, 96.5%). With regard to SNS use, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Associations of SNS Addiction With SNS Use</head><p>SNS addiction was significantly associated with SNS use patterns (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref>). A longer amount of time on SNSs per day (ie, &gt;3 h), a longer amount of time on SNSs each access (ie, ≥31 min), and a higher frequency of SNS access (ie, less than every 30 min) were associated with a higher level of SNS addiction (adjusted beta [aβ]=6.03, 95% CI 4.66-7.40; aβ=4.99, 95% CI 3.14-6.83; and aβ=5.89, 95% CI 4.14-7.64, respectively). A longer duration of SNS use before sleeping (ie, ≥61 min) and a shorter duration from waking to first SNS use (ie, ≤5 min) were significantly associated with a higher level of SNS addiction (aβ=5.92, 95% CI 4.19-7.65 and aβ=3.27, 95% CI 1.73-4.82, respectively). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediating Effects of SNS Addiction Between SNS Use and Mental Health Status</head><p>The hypothesized model showed good fitness indices, with X 2 /df=2.16, RMSEA=0.05, CFI=0.97, TLI=0.95, and SRMR=0.04. Results from bootstrapping showed that SNS addiction has a significant mediating effect on the relationship between SNS use and psychosocial status, and mental health status (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). H1 (SNS use and SNS addiction; β=0.49, 95% CI 0.39-0.58), H2 (SNS addiction and mental health status; β=0.17, 95% CI 0.06-0.27), H4 (psychosocial status and mental health status; β=-0.76, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.64), and H5 (SNS addiction and psychosocial status; β=-0.29, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.16) were supported. In contrast, H3 (SNS use and psychosocial status; β=-0.09, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.06) and H6 (SNS use and mental health status; β=-0.08, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.03) were not supported (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref>). Three indirect pathways between SNS use and mental health status in SEM were investigated (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">4</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref>). The indirect effect of SNS addiction was significant on the pathway of SNS use to mental health status (β=0.20, 95% CI 0.08-0.34), but the indirect effect of psychosocial status was insignificant on the pathway (β=0.17, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.47). The indirect effect mediated by SNS addiction and psychosocial status in the pathway also showed a significant impact (β=0.26, 95% CI 0.14-0.44), and this pathway showed a stronger correlation than the pathway with SNS addiction alone as the mediator. The total indirect effect between SNS use and mental health status was significant (β=0.63, 95% CI 0.37-0.93). The direct effect of SNS addiction and psychosocial status on mental health status was insignificant (β=-0.19, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.08). Furthermore, the total effect of SNS addiction and psychosocial status that mediated the path from SNS use to mental health status was significant (β=0.44, 95% CI 0.19-0.72). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principal Findings</head><p>This study found that longer and more frequent use of SNSs is significantly associated with SNS addiction. This study also identified that SNS addiction and psychosocial status significantly and positively mediate the relationship between SNS use and mental health status (anxiety and depressive symptoms) in Chinese university students in HK.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SNS Addiction-Related Factors</head><p>SNS addiction significantly differed across the respondents' demographics in this study. We found that females have a higher level of SNS addiction than males, corresponding with another study from HK <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. In contrast, several studies from Europe have reported that males have a higher SNS (Twitter) addiction level and SNS obsession than females <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Although there are limited studies investigating the sex differences in SNS addiction, the distinct findings in the HK studies may be due to sociocultural influences on SNS use and addiction. Chinese females who are influenced by a collectivism-dominant culture tend to be introverted and gravitate toward indirect communication styles <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Accordingly, they prefer to use SNSs as a way to make emotional connections and maintain their existing interpersonal relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. They also tend to spend more time on SNSs than males <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>; thus they are more exposed to the risk of SNS addiction. An in-depth qualitative study and meta-analysis would be helpful to uncover the extent of sociocultural influences on SNS addiction.</p><p>We also found that SNS addiction is significantly higher among undergraduate students and those with poor academic performance, consistent with previous findings on academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref> and undergraduate studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. As time spent on SNSs for entertainment is a negative predictor of time spent studying <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> and academic performance, such as grade point averages <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, excessive and addictive SNS use for entertainment would decrease the time on education, resulting in low academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Although the associations of SNS use patterns with SNS addiction are little known, the associations between problematic uses of smartphones or the internet, and addictive behaviors have been identified in the literature. Excessive use or habitual checking of the smartphone can lead to smartphone addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Similarly, long durations of time spent on the internet are a significant indicator of internet addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Moreover, previous studies have reported that young adults with internet and smartphone addiction mainly spend time on the use of SNS websites and applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>. Given that SNSs can be used over the internet through smartphones and other electronic devices, and that internet and smartphone addiction results in similar user behaviors, our findings on SNS addiction can be comparable to studies investigating internet use on smartphones or internet addiction. Moreover, shorter durations from waking to first SNS use and longer durations before sleeping are strong indicators of SNS addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>. These findings from previous studies resembled our findings regarding the association of excessive SNS use patterns with SNS addiction. We also further found the effect of the SNS use patterns on SNS addiction, namely that excessive SNS use can cause SNS addiction.</p><p>Although excessive SNS use can cause SNS addiction behaviors, young people are poor at recognizing their own SNS use as excessive. In 1 study that surveyed the effects of Facebook use on the social life and behaviors of 1000 university students in Pakistan, nearly 70% of those who showed addictive Facebook use did not discern themselves as having Facebook addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. Similarly, another study that collected SNS information on 804 adolescents in India revealed that only 4% perceived their SNS use to be highly problematic <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Opportunities exist for health professionals to guide young people to recognize their own excessive SNS use that can cause SNS addictive behaviors. Practical screening for SNS addiction can be assessed as a daily routine in the community when dealing with young people who show problematic and excessive SNS use. This may be the first step in recognizing potential cases before they develop further into SNS addiction. Concerning previous treatment for internet addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, interventions conducted through a cognitive behavioral approach may also be helpful for users with SNS addiction in order to reconstruct their thoughts and behaviors and mitigate mental distress stemming from SNS addiction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact of SNS Addiction on Mental Health Status</head><p>We found that SNS addition significantly influences mental health status (ie, anxiety and depressive symptoms), while the effect of SNS use patterns on mental health status is not significant. It should be noted that the difference between SNS use and SNS addiction is that the latter reflects more problematic behaviors and can lead to more severe outcomes that are associated with SNSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. General SNS use may not be a potential factor; instead, it is the excessive use of SNSs that influences addictive behavior and mental distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Similar to our results, previous studies have reported that SNS addiction is associated with negative mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and affective disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>. However, these studies have mainly focused on the bivariate association between SNS addiction and mental health, while the effect of SNS addiction on mental health remains uncertain; that is, whether mental problems lead to SNS addiction or vice versa. Furthermore, we identified that SNS addiction plays a mediating role in the pathway from SNS use to mental health status. This finding resonates with 1 study that identified that Instagram (an SNS) use predicts depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. However, the mediating role of SNS addiction was not significant in that study, in contrast with our findings. SNS use in that study was only measured by 1 item (ie, the time spent on Instagram) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, while we included diverse SNS use patterns (ie, 4 durations and 1 frequency measurement of SNS use). We also included all types of SNS use, but the aforementioned study only included Instagram use, although the use of different SNSs would be differently associated with SNS addiction and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Therefore, the findings from our study offer more holistic and integrative viewpoints on the pathway from SNS use to mental health status via SNS addiction.</p><p>Of note, SNS use in moderation can positively affect users' mental health status. SNS use can reinforce a user's online relationships and solidify their offline connections, and this may, in turn, reduce their negative feelings and emotions (eg, anxiety, depression), positively influencing their mental health status <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>. Unfortunately, when SNS use becomes excessive, it conversely has an adverse effect on users. Although excessive SNS use is a popular concept in SNS studies and is known as a predictor of SNS addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>, there is ambiguity in the cut-off between non-excessive and excessive use, making excessive SNS use difficult to define. Therefore, SNS addiction would be more suitable than excessive SNS use to objectively determine that a user's SNS use is problematic and to understand its influence on health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>. Moreover, the sense of belongingness (feeling of being accepted in groups) is high among young people, particularly from East Asian countries that have collectivism-dominant societies. The sense of belongingness is positively associated with social and psychological functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>. The characteristics of young people and the social environment in HK (ie, a high sense of belongingness that we measured in this study using social well-being, loneliness, and isolation scales) likely mediate SNS use, SNS addiction, and mental health status.</p><p>As an indispensable element of today's leisure culture, absolute abstinence from accessing SNSs is not an appropriate treatment for SNS addiction and mental distress. Restricting the excessive use of SNSs, addressing the importance of SNS addiction control to improve psychosocial and mental health status and preventing relapse by encouraging self-reflection on SNS use may be possible solutions for designing educational programs. Particularly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, which hinders face-to-face intervention delivery, internet-delivered interventions (eg, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy) can be also considered to address SNS addiction. Future studies on determining the appropriate duration of SNS use with findings transferable to practice guidelines would be needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>This study had some limitations. Cross-sectional data in this study could not provide the causality between SNS addiction and mental health status. Discussions of the magnitude of the relationship between 2 elements (SNS addiction and mental health status) were inconclusive, with different opinions that this relationship can be bidirectional <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73]</ref>. Therefore, more studies with longitudinal designs are needed to explore the direction and mechanism of causality for the relationship between SNS addiction and mental health status in the future. Additionally, as most of our participants were ethnic Chinese in HK, replication of our study for young adults in other sociocultural settings is recommended to reveal a more comprehensive relationship that was discovered through this study. Lastly, the participants responded to an online survey. Self-reported data may result in recall bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This study provided novel information about the patterns of SNS use and its association with SNS addiction among university students. Findings from SEM also addressed that there is a significant mediating effect of SNS addiction between SNS use and mental health status, including anxiety and depressive symptoms. Further studies are suggested to demonstrate causal relationships with longitudinal data. This study helps to provide preliminary solutions for reducing SNS addiction and mental problems by conducting interventions using cognitive-behavioral approaches.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
