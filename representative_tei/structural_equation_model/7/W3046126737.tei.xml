<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Up to 15% of patients are experienced as "difficult" by their providers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> "Difficult" patients are more likely to have personality disorders, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> While most studies focus on patient characteristics, one found that provider factors were important; younger providers and those with a more biomedical orientation reported more encounters as difficult. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OBJECTIVE</head><p>Our study's purpose was to develop a structural equation model of "difficulty" in a primary care clinic to capture the complex sociocultural nature of this interaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p>This is a secondary analysis of a randomized trial to improve shared decision-making among established patient-provider dyads. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Patient surveys assessed depression (Patient Health Questionarire-9), somatization (Patient Health Questionnaire-15), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), functional status (Medical Outcome Study SF-6), pain (0-10), and provider trust (Trust in Physician Scale). Encounters were audiotaped and coded for the degree of shared medical decision-making (Option-5) as well as patient rapport (Roter Interaction Analysis System). Providers rated encounter difficulty (Difficult Doctor Patient Relationship Questionnaire). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> We analyzed our data using structural equation modeling (SEM, STATA v13.2). SEM is a multivariate statistical approach to examine structural relationships, both direct and indirect to explore the nature and direction of relationships between variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Our cohort included 119 patients seen by 11 providers (7 MDs, 4 NPs) who rated 22% of encounters as "difficult." "Difficulty" was not evenly distributed across providers, but there was no impact of provider age, gender, ethnicity, years of practice, or concordance of gender and race between providers and patients. Our SEM model was well fitted (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Direct, indirect, and total standardized effects are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The variables with strong direct effects were features of the interaction dynamic (better shared decision-making -0.19, worse rapport 0.30, and higher trust -0.37). Patient factors with direct effects (higher somatization -0.33) were features of the patient's health status that are typically related to the stress of illness. Factors with indirect effects (depression 0.09, pain 0.16) are factors influencing the patient's summative experience of illness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The prevalence of "difficulty" in this cohort is similar to rates seen in other trials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> We also found that both patient and provider factors contributed to difficulty. Our study was able to tease out the direct and indirect effects of these variables. Greater somatization and lower trust increase encounter difficulty. Depression, anxiety, pain, and functional status indirectly increases difficulty, by increasing somatization. In our previous study, we found that older and more psychosocially oriented providers experienced less difficulty. While difficulty was not evenly distributed across providers, we were unable to identify provider-specific variables. Instead, we found that provider communication in "difficult" encounters was worse, with less shared medical decision-making and reduced patientprovider rapport. Pain also indirectly increased encounter difficulty, possibly reflecting frustration and lack of formal training in pain management. The composite model of total effects highlights the relative effects of each factor and creates a meaningful picture of patient suffering, such as functional status and somatization that adversely affect the patient-physician dynamic (trust, rapport) in a manner that makes the physician feel challenged (worse SMDM, more difficulty).</p><p>The use of structural equation modeling paints a picture of illness-related suffering leading to patient behavior that is noxious to providers and leads to impaired communication. This has implications for the education of healthcare providers in communication skills and professionalism and is supported by the moderate size of the total effect of poor rapport (0.3) and higher trust (-0.37) on difficulty. Both these domains are within the sphere of influence of the provider, and amenable to training. Education in the psychology and behavior of illness is important in understanding patients' illness behavior. In addition, self-awareness and self-calibration training is helpful in managing the transference dynamic of the doctor-patient relationship in which emotive responses can be redirected towards each other. Finally, more advanced training in psychosocial orientation as a dominant feature of healthcare is important to enhancing the professionalism of care and the patient experience, whatever the demeanor of the patient.</p><p>We feel this model provides a direction for future research in this area, particularly interventions that may reduce encounter difficulty and improve both the experience of care (for patients and providers). </p></div>
