<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Studies have consistently demonstrated the negative impact of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) on intimate relationships. The majority of studies have focused on revictimization in at-risk or clinical samples, with very few addressing the impact of CSA on otherwise well-functioning adults and even fewer investigating the psychological mechanisms involved. To fill this gap, this study focuses on the effect of CSA on "normative" (nonviolent) romantic relationships in otherwise well-functioning young women and the mediating role of personality dimension self-criticism and attachment in this regard. Specifically, we investigate whether self-criticism and attachment avoidance mediate the relationship between CSA and romantic relationship satisfaction, while also examining the potential reciprocal associations between these variables. Method: The hypothesized mediation model was examined in a two-wave 6-month cross-lagged longitudinal design, using structural equation modeling. Participants were 59 well-functioning (psychologically, socially, occupationally) young women drawn from an earlier study that purposefully oversampled for CSA survivors. For the purpose of the current study, data from women who had been either sexually abused by a familiar perpetrator (n = 30) or had no history of sexual trauma (n = 29) were included. Results: Consistent with expectations, self-criticism mediated the association between CSA and romantic relationship satisfaction over time. In addition, a scarring effect of romantic relationship satisfaction on attachment avoidance was demonstrated. Conclusions: Findings suggest that CSA may lead to elevated levels of selfcriticism, which in turn may be linked with reduced satisfaction in romantic relationships, setting in motion a vicious cycle involving relationship satisfaction and attachment avoidance.</p></div>

The current study reports on an independent sample of 135 young women that was purposefully oversampled for CSA survivors. Participants were sought via announcements on websites and internet forums for CSA survivors, bulletin boards posted throughout universities, rape crisis centers, public psychological service clinics, therapists' clinics, and service centers for sexually abused women. General inclusion criteria for the study were: (a) young adult (aged 18-39); (b) for those with a history of CSA, the abuse had to have involved a known, nonpeer perpetrator, as assessed using multiple measures (as detailed in Measures, below); and (c) being engaged in a meaningful romantic relationship (with a partner either of a different © 2017, American Psychological Association.

In order to sample wellfunctioning individuals, participants completed a screening questionnaire at the beginning of the study, addressing their function on occupational, educational, physical, social, romantic, and psychological aspects. Then, the first author, a psychologist, under the supervision of the last author, a certified clinical psychologist, has screened individuals according to their level of functioning, based on the "Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale" from <ref type="bibr">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (2000)</ref>.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included being currently hospitalized in an inpatient psychiatric ward or currently experiencing severe psychological symptoms or being involved in an abusive romantic relationship. The sample was demographically varied. Assessment was conducted using self-report questionnaires administered by e-mail or in person according to the participant's preference. At baseline (Time 1), the participants first completed a consent form and then completed the surveys. Upon completion of the surveys, the participants were financially compensated with $20 for their time. At Time 2 (6 months later), participants were contacted by e-mail and/or telephone and invited to participate in the next step. Time 2 questionnaires were attached to the contact e-mails. Upon completion of the Time 2 questionnaires, participants were financially compensated with $20 for their time. All 135 participants at Time 1 were contacted by e-mail and/or telephone, and 92 (68 %) responded and volunteered to participate at Time 2 within 1 to 4 weeks.</p><p>For the purpose of the current report, only women who either (a) reported having a history of CSA by a known, non-peer perpetrator or (b) did not report any history of sexual trauma were selected from the total sample. Of the total of 135 participants, 49 women reported a history of CSA by a known perpetrator; however, four of these did not meet the inclusion criteria as they had not consistently reported having been abused by a familiar nonpeer perpetrator in all measures.

The final article will be available, upon publication, via its DOI: 10.1037/tra0000271 included 30 participants who reported sexual trauma (either not in childhood and/or not by a familiar perpetrator) and 56 women who reported a complete absence of any history of sexual trauma. Thus, 45 women met the CSA survivor inclusion criteria and 56 women the non-CSA inclusion criteria; data from the remaining 34 participants, who did not match criteria for this study, were omitted. As the current study focuses on the implications of CSA for prospective romantic relationships, only data gathered from participants who also reported having been engaged in a significant romantic relationship for at least 1 month within the past 3 months at Time 2 were used. Consequently, participants in the current study were 30 young adult females reporting a history of CSA and 29 young adult females reporting no such history, all of whom reported having been in a meaningful romantic relationship for at least 1 month within the past 3 months at Time 2. There were no significant differences between participants with and without a history of CSA in age (t(57) = -1.22, ns; M = 26.22, SD = 4.83 for CSA; M = 24.99, SD = 2.64 for non-CSA) and years of education (t(56) = -.86, ns; M = 13.62, SD = 1.68 for CSA; M = 13.28, SD = 1.36 for non-CSA). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Psychology at Ben-Gurion University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Child sexual abuse. Childhood sexual trauma was assessed using three questionnaires: the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bernstein et al., 1994)</ref>, the Sexual Experiences Survey -Short Form Victimization Revised (SES-SFV; <ref type="bibr">Koss &amp; Gidycz, 1985)</ref>, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale -Part I (PDS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Foa, 1995)</ref>. The CTQ is a 28-item retrospective self-report questionnaire. Individuals are asked to indicate on a 5point Likert scale how often (1= never, 5 = frequently) they experienced certain events as children/adolescents. These items yield five different subscales of childhood trauma: emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bernstein &amp; Fink, 1998)</ref>. The CTQ has been found to be valid for use in clinical and © 2017, American Psychological Association.

In this study, only the sexual abuse subscale was used, ranging from a minimum of 5 (replying never in all five items assessing sexual abuse) to a maximum of 25. Internal consistency was α =.95. Participants scoring 6 and above were further examined to meet study criteria for CSA, namely, whether the perpetrator was both known and not a peer. In cases where participants scored higher than 6, but also reported on different measures that the abuse was perpetrated by either a non-familiar person or a peer, or during adulthood, they were omitted from the study. Also, only participants who scored 5 on the levels of sexual abuse subscale were included as non-CSA participants. The SES-SFV is a shortened, modified version of the Sexual Experiences Survey <ref type="bibr">(Koss &amp; Gidycz, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>Participants were asked if they had ever (as children, adolescent, or adults) undergone any of 11 sexual experiences, their age at the time, the perpetrator relationship (stranger, acquaintance, family member), and the frequency of the experience (four categories: none, once, few, and many). The SES-SFV was also used to gain additional information regarding the age when the abuse began and ended, its frequency, and the perpetrator's relationship to the survivor (stranger, acquaintance, family member, etc.). Data collected using this questionnaire were employed for screening for either the CSA survivors or the non-CSA participants. The latter group included only women scoring zero on the SES-SFV, indicating the absence of any form of sexual trauma. In this sample Cronbach's α = .84. The PDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Foa, 1995)</ref> asks respondents to read through a list of traumatic events and checkmark any event they had witnessed/experienced.

In this sample Cronbach's α = .94. Based on the described criteria, participants were assigned to a binary CSA dummy-variable: (a) CSA survivors and (b) non-CSA.</p><p>Self-criticism. Self-criticism was assessed via the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Blatt, D'Afflitti, &amp; Quinlan, 1976)</ref>, an extensively used self-report measure composed of 66 items assessing self-criticism (e.g., "It is not who you are but what you have accomplished that counts"), dependency, and efficacy. Individuals are asked to indicate on a 7-point Likert scale the extent to which they agree (0 = completely disagree, 7 = completely agree) with each of the 66 items. In this study, only the self-criticism factor was used. In this sample Cronbach's α = .85.</p><p>Adult attachment. Romantic attachment avoidance and anxiety were assessed using the Experiences in Close Relationships scale (ECR-R; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brennan, Clark, &amp; Shaver, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Individuals are asked to indicate on a 7-point Likert scale the extent to which they agree (1 = completely disagree, 7 = completely agree) with each of the 36 items. Two higher order dimensions are derived from the ECR-R: attachment avoidance (e.g., "I get uncomfortable when a romantic partner wants to be very close") and attachment anxiety (e.g., "I worry about being abandoned"). In this sample, Cronbach's α = .85 for avoidance and α = .90 for anxiety.</p><p>Psychopathology. Psychopathology was assessed using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Derogatis &amp; Melisaratos, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Derogatis &amp; Spencer, 1982)</ref>, a 53-item scale used to assess a wide range of self-reported psychopathological symptoms. Individuals are asked to indicate on a 5-point Likert scale how often (0 = not at all, 4 = frequently) they had experienced a symptom within the past month. A global BSI score was computed by averaging the 53 items. In this sample, Cronbach's α = .96.</p></div>

The DAS-4 is a 4-item version of the original 32-item Dyadic Adjustment Scale. Individuals are asked to estimate their relationship satisfaction (e.g., "In general, how often do you think things between you and your partner are going well?" and "Do you confide in your mate?"). In this sample, Cronbach's α = .77. This 15-item questionnaire requires individuals to rate the quality of their relationship (e.g., "What is your general feeling about your partner?") on a 7-point Likert scale. The items were averaged to create a relationship quality measure. In this sample, Cronbach's α = .86. The DAS-4 and the RJQ measures were highly correlated (r = .78, p &lt; .000 at both Time 1 and Time 2). Hence, we standardized scores on both questionnaires and created a "romantic relationship satisfaction" composite score as an average of both scales.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The aim of this study was to explore the mechanism underlying the negative impact of CSA on prospective romantic relationship satisfaction. An integrative perspective that encompasses both personality vulnerability and adult attachment <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Luyten &amp; Blatt, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sibley, 2007)</ref> was examined in a two-wave cross-lagged follow-up study of otherwise wellfunctioning young women comprising survivors of CSA by a known perpetrator and women who reported never having been exposed to sexual trauma. Two sets of major findings emerged from this study. The first set suggested that CSA had a direct negative effect on romantic relationship satisfaction, as well as an indirect effect via its effect on self-criticism, which in turn was negatively related to romantic relationship satisfaction over time. The second set of findings suggested an interplay between the quality of romantic relationships and attachment avoidance, in that romantic relationship satisfaction was negatively related prospectively to attachment avoidance, while attachment avoidance was related prospectively with decreased levels of romantic relationship satisfaction. This scarring effect with romantic relationship satisfaction may also explain the relatively modest levels of stability of attachment avoidance, as it may lead to substantial changes in attachment avoidance over time. These results held even when controlling for symptomatic distress and attachment anxiety, thus attesting to both the significance of these results and their specificity.</p><p>© 2017, American Psychological Association.

Presumably, in an attempt to find some reason and control, without having to acknowledge the abuser's deficiencies, the child might direct feelings of shame, blame, and criticism inward-either by identifying and internalizing both the perpetrator's desire and guilt and redirecting them into a more manageable mechanism of self-blame <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ferenczi, 1949;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Filipas &amp; Ullman, 2006)</ref>, or as a defense-mechanism of "turning against the self". <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(McWilliams, 2011)</ref>. This might be especially relevant for children who have been sexually abused by a known, and ostensibly trustworthy, perpetrator, where the identification of CSA is very difficult-not only on the part of the authorities but also by the victims themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Spinazzola et al., 2014)</ref>.

Both self-criticism and attachment avoidance refer to the extent to which individuals avoid closeness with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Sibley, 2007)</ref>, but they represent different levels of abstraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Luyten &amp; Blatt, 2016)</ref>. Our findings suggest that CSA has a direct effect on the more global, broad cognitive-affective self-schema (i.e., self-criticism) but not on the relationship-specific expression of this schema in a close relationship (i.e., attachment avoidance) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Luyten &amp; Blatt, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sibley, 2007)</ref>. At the same time, the stability effect of the more relationship-specific model of self-other, namely attachment avoidance, was indeed nonsignificant, as potentially can be explained by the scarring effect of romantic relationship dissatisfaction. That is, the levels of satisfaction from the participants' specific romantic relationships might be causing changes in their levels of attachment avoidance over time-specifically, on the expression of the broader self-critical schema in a close relationship. Consistently, despite a significant association between the broad schema (i.e., self-criticism) and its relationship-specific expression (i.e., attachment avoidance) in the mediational model, while controlling for levels of relationship satisfaction and for stability effects, this association (cross-lagged effect) was no longer significant.</p><p>© 2017, American Psychological Association.

In the face of this lack of satisfaction, individuals with a tendency to be more focused on autonomy in an attempt to cope with negative affect might then employ attachment deactivating tendencies-that is, the tendency to dismiss the importance of emotions, suppress negative affect, reduce support-seeking behaviors, and exhibit distrust in close relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brennan et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007)</ref>. These avoidant tendencies might render those individuals unable to deal with the difficulties in, or lack of satisfaction from, their current relationship, leaving them with a sense of guilt and detachment from their partner. This might then translate into even greater dissatisfaction from romantic relationships over time, as evidenced in our study. This pattern might partially explain the difficulties in romantic relationships, and more general dissatisfaction, that individuals who have a history of CSA and higher levels of self-criticism seem to be experiencing. In other words, CSA might lead to a chronic vicious cycle related to romantic relationships, via an indirect effect leading from self-criticism to unsatisfying romantic relationships. Relationship dissatisfaction might then further increase attachment avoidance tendencies; these tendencies in turn might lead to an additional decrease in relationship satisfaction over time. In order to confirm this hypothesized vicious cycle additional waves of measurement are needed. Finally, our findings imply that it is possible that CSA survivors are functioning well in various aspects of their lives, and on the surface may seem to be functioning well in terms of romantic relationships. However, at the same time, the fact that CSA is a relational trauma means that they might find it difficult to maintain a satisfying romantic relationship.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Our findings should be evaluated in light of the methodological limitations of the study. First, our sample was small in size, gender biased (focusing only on women), and had only a relatively modest retention rate; thus, replication of our findings in a larger sample comprising both men and women is required to enable the findings to be generalized to CSA survivors and to young adults in general. The inclusion criterion for participation of having been engaged in a meaningful romantic relationship similarly limits the study's findings, precluding generalization to individuals whose experiences of CSA have either prevented them from engaging in any romantic relationship, or predisposed them to incidents of sexual revictimization. Previous research has demonstrated the accuracy and reliability of recall among victims of childhood maltreatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bernstein et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dube, Williamson, Thompson, Felitti, &amp; Anda, 2004)</ref> and CSA survivors specifically <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barnes et al., 2009)</ref>, thus minimizing the likelihood of self-report bias. Nevertheless, reporting biases and shared method variance might still exist in our study. Future studies might thus benefit from the use of alternative assessment methods, such as interviews, as well as an assessment of romantic relationships as perceived by the participants' partners. Finally, while our two-wave design is helpful for understanding the effects of change in variables over time, tracking changes in romantic relationships for a longer period of time and including additional waves of measurement would improve the design. This is particularly important in light of the scarring effect seen in this study and the potential vicious cycle discussed herein.</p></div>

As actual disclosure of a CSA history often occurs only during young adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pilkington &amp; Kremer, 1995)</ref>, and as many young adults seek counseling for non-psychopathological problems, such as the difficulty of establishing and maintaining a satisfying romantic relationship (Hunt &amp; Eisenberg, 2010), focusing on difficulties in romantic relationships might serve as a valuable pathway through which to address the continuing effects of CSA on subsequent romantic relationships.
