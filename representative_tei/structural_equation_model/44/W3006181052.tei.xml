<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age appropriateness of the self-report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire</head><p>The self-report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a popular measure of mental health in 11-16 year-olds <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Goodman, Meltzer, &amp; Bailey, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Johnston &amp; Gowers, 2005)</ref> that has been extensively used in epidemiological research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hafekost et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">NHS Digital, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Polanczyk, Salum, Sugaya, Caye, &amp; Rohde, 2015)</ref>. Self-report measures are generally attractive in research, particularly in longitudinal and large-scale studies. This is partly because young people can be easier to recruit than parents, and data burden is reduced compared to teacher report methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Humphrey &amp; Wigelsworth, 2016)</ref>. Moreover, such measures allow direct assessment of the young person's perspective in accordance with policy recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Deighton et al., 2014)</ref>. Despite these advantages, scale-and subscale-level analysis suggest the SDQ may be unsuitable for those with reading ages below 13-14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Patalay, Hayes, &amp; Wolpert, 2018)</ref>. Not only is this higher than the intended 11-year-old population, it also exceeds general scale development recommendations, which suggest that measures should never exceed the reading level of a 12-year-old <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Terwee et al., 2007)</ref>. There is also evidence to suggest that the reading age of individuals can be up to 5 grades lower than their reported education grade, especially for those experiencing mental health difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Jackson et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Jensen, Fabiano, Lopez-Williams, &amp; Chacko, 2006)</ref>.There is, therefore, a need for better understanding of the age appropriateness of this measure.</p><p>Though the self-report SDQ has been consistently employed in large national studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hafekost et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">NHS Digital, 2018)</ref>, and has been recommended for research and clinical settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Vostanis, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wolpert, Cheng, &amp; Deighton, 2015)</ref>, robust evidence of its factor structure is scant. Two review articles have broadly advocated for the use of the self-report SDQ AGE APPROPRIATENESS 5 SDQ, as a well-validated measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Vostanis, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wolpert et al., 2015)</ref>. However, it should be noted that psychometric evidence underpinning their recommendations often related to translated versions, though psychometric characteristics are likely version dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Flake, Pek, &amp; Hehman, 2017)</ref>. Indeed, the self-report SDQ has shown only partial measurement invariance across different language versions <ref type="bibr">(Ortuño-Sierra et al., 2015b)</ref>. Furthermore, studies of the English version on which recommendations were made particularly failed to report model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Goodman, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Goodman et al., 1998)</ref>. Though exploratory factor analysis was used in the original study, a 5-factor solution was retained despite substantial cross-loadings for seven items <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Goodman, 2001)</ref>, suggesting potential problems with the structure. Where confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) techniques were employed to analyze the self-report English version, the proposed structure was also shown to be problematic, with inconsistent fit based on recommended guidelines. These suggest values of around .95 for the comparative fit index (CFI) and around .06 for the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) can be judged to be acceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Goodman, Lamping, and Ploubidis (2010)</ref> found CFI = .837 and RMSEA = .063 via weighted least squares means and variance adjusted (WLSMV), while <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Percy, McCrystal, and Higgins (2008)</ref> reported CFI = .817 and RMSEA = .047 via robust maximum likelihood (MLR) estimation. The consistently low CFI may be due to problems with the pattern of covariances specified by the model, consistent with the known substantial crossloadings <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Goodman, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Percy et al., 2008)</ref>, though discrepancies between RMSEA and CFI can occur for many different reasons (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lai &amp; Green, 2016</ref>, for more details). The fact that both studies include adolescents as young as 11-12 may also have contributed to model misfit. This lack of clear support for the self-report SDQ's factor structure suggests a need for more detailed examination of its psychometric qualities, as has been explicitly called for in a SDQ AGE APPROPRIATENESS 6 recent systematic review <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bentley, Hartley, &amp; Bucci, 2019)</ref>. This is particularly necessary given the centrality of the measure in adolescent mental health research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Deighton et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dray et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hafekost et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">NHS Digital, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Polanczyk et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Wigelsworth, Humphrey, &amp; Lendrum, 2012)</ref>. Although evidence based on the SDQ suggests an increase in mental health difficulties in mid adolescence, around ages 14-15 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Deighton et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dray et al., 2016)</ref>, it is not clear whether differences between early adolescents, around ages 11-12, and the 14-15 age group are due to differences in measurement properties, or the SDQ's high reading age <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Patalay et al., 2018)</ref>. Indeed, measurement invariance between different age groups is yet to be examined, which we therefore sought to address in the current study. The choice of age groups in the current study was selected for pragmatic reasons since we conducted secondary data analysis. Nevertheless, the use of this dataset enabled examination of the key transition to mid adolescence. It also allowed comparison between the SDQ's youngest intended age (11 years old), as per its original validation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Goodman et al., 1998)</ref>, and the recommended minimum age (13 years old) based on recent readability findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Patalay et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>While the analysis of readability by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Patalay et al. (2018)</ref> provided valuable insight into the age appropriateness of the measure, readability was only considered for whole subscales meaning three issues remain unexplored. First, while considering items together as subscales or whole measures allows the use of texts of more appropriate length for readability formulas, information is lost about individual items <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Oakland &amp; Lane, 2004)</ref>. Second, the presentation of items in accordance with psychometric best practice, including factor structure, should also be considered. For instance, items should have appropriate response formats and consist of single statements to avoid confusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Saris, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Terwee et al., 2007)</ref>. Finally, while age invariance of the proxy version has been considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(He, Burstein, Schmitz, &amp; Merikangas, 2013)</ref>, measurement invariance of the self-report English instrument has not been tested, to our knowledge. Based on these identified gaps, we aimed to explore the following for the self-report SDQ: 1) item-level readability, 2) item quality, 3) the factor structure, and 4) age measurement invariance between English secondary school students in year seven (age 11-12) and year nine (age 13-15). We hypothesized the reading age to be higher than the intended population, consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Patalay et al. (2018)</ref> and that item quality would vary according to psychometric criteria (this has not been evaluated previously and was therefore exploratory). Given that findings on the structure of SDQ have been conflicting, we were unable to hypothesize which structure would be the most appropriate, thus the third aim of our study was also necessarily exploratory. Finally, we hypothesized non-measurement invariance between the two age groups, as we expected the year nine group to have a better understanding of the items, based on previous readability evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Patalay et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Secondary data analysis was conducted of a large project aimed at promoting resilience in six areas of England, chosen on the basis of need. The original dataset consisted of 30,842 students, though 552 cases were excluded (1.8%) from current analyses since these had missing data for all SDQ items. Students were in year seven (50.7%, aged 11-12, M = 12.21, SD = 0.29) and nine (49.3%, aged 13-15, M = 14.20, SD = 0.29) from 114 schools (52.4% female). The ethnicity of our sample was very similar to national figures (Department for Education, 2017b) with 74.1% white, 9.5% Asian, 5.7% Black, 3.9 Mixed, .2% Chinese, 1.5% any other ethnic background, and 1.2% unclassified. The proportion of pupils with a special educational need was 11.6%, compared to the national figure of 14.4% (Department for Education, 2017c). Rates of low income were above average in this community sample, given the focus of the project: The percentage of students who had ever been eligible for free school meals was 36.4% which was above the national average of 29.1% for those eligible in the previous six years (Department for Education, 2017a).</p><p>Total difficulties scores for the SDQ were also above rates expected in community samples, based on the measure's 20 year-old bandings <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Goodman et al., 1998)</ref>: 62.2% scored in the 'normal' range compared to 80% in the validation sample, 18.4% scored in the 'borderline' range compared to 10% in the validation sample and 19.6% scored in the 'abnormal' range compared to 10% in the validation sample. However, self-reported psychological wellbeing in the current sample (M = 23.88, SD = 5.33) was similar to the average found in a nationally representative sample of 16-24 year-olds (M = 23.57, SD = 3.61; Ng Fat, Scholes, Boniface, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mindell, &amp; Stewart-Brown, 2017)</ref>. Reading ability was also below average based on end of primary school test results, with 63% of the year seven cohort reaching the expected grade compared to the national result of 66% (Department for Education, 2016), and 72.2% of the year nine cohort compared to the national result of 78% (Department for Education, 2014).</p><p>Following approval by the UCL Research Ethics Committee (UCL Ref: 8097/003) survey data were collected via a secure online portal during the normal school day from students whose parents had not opted-out. The SDQ was completed as part of a battery of measures, all of which had explanations for items found to raise issues during piloting. These were constructed to help pupils without altering items, and since researchers did not administer the survey face-toface they could not respond to queries. Pupils were instructed that these could be obtained by hovering their mouse over certain words. For example, if pupils hovered over the word "restless", they were given the explanation "unable to stay still". All items which had explanations are indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>.</p><p>Students responded to the 25-item SDQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Goodman et al., 1998)</ref> using a 3-point Likert scale (not true, somewhat true, certainly true). These 25 items form five subscales of five items each (more detail on the content of items can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). Internal consistency coefficients are presented in several formats to reflect both the typically reported standard (Cronbach's alpha), as well as formulae that account for violations likely present in the data (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Ordinal alpha accounts for the ordinal nature of Likert items since it is based on the polychoric correlation matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gadermann, Guhn, &amp; Zumbo, 2012)</ref>, while McDonald's omega is a model-based reliability which does not assume tau-equivalence <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Raykov &amp; Marcoulides, 2016)</ref>. In line with other assessments of the SDQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bøe, Hysing, Skogen, &amp; Breivik, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Panayiotou, Humphrey, &amp; Wigelsworth, 2019)</ref>, ordinal alpha and omega were shown to be higher than Cronbach's alpha in the current sample (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). ESEM factor loadings can also be found in supplemental table S1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>Readability testing. Calculating multiple readability estimates is recommended given the lack of a gold standard readability formula, and the variability in their focus <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Janan &amp; Wray, 2012)</ref>. The current study applied four widely used and established readability assessments, all of which are calculated by incorporating different text components. The <ref type="bibr">Dale-Chall Readability Formula (DC;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chall &amp; Dale, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dale &amp; Chall, 1948)</ref>, considers the percentage of difficult words, and the average sentence length. Difficult words are those that do not appear on the Dale-Chall Readability word list: DC = 0.1579(DW/TW × 100) + 0.0496(AWS) + 3.6365</p><p>Where DW = total number of difficult words, TW = total number of words, AWS = average number of words per sentence.</p><p>The Flesch-Kincaid Reading Grade (FK; <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kincaid, Fishburne, Rogers, &amp; Chissom, 1975)</ref>, considers average syllables per word and the average sentence length: FK = (0.39 × AWS) + (11.8 × ASW) -15.59 where AWS = average number of words per sentence; ASW = average number syllables per word.</p><p>The Gunning Fog Index (GFI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gunning, 1952)</ref> considers number of words, sentences and hard words (those with three syllables or more):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">GFI = 0.4 × [ AWS + (100HW / TW)]</formula><p>where AWS = average number of words per sentence; HW = total number of hard words; TW = total number of words.</p><p>Finally, the Coleman Liau Index (CLI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Coleman &amp; Liau, 1975)</ref>  All indices provide readability as a US grade-level. The readability of SDQ items and subscales was then calculated by averaging the US-grade level score of the four indices, and then adding six to get the average reading age. The age appropriateness of SDQ items was judged against the original minimum recommended age of 11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Goodman et al., 1998)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Item quality criteria. Consistent with readability indices, psychometric guidance</head><p>suggests scale items should be simple in language and grammar, regardless of the age of the target population <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Irwing &amp; Hughes, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Terwee et al., 2007)</ref>. Beyond this, other important aspects of the content and structure of items must be considered alongside readability tests, for a more comprehensive assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Oakland &amp; Lane, 2004)</ref>. Additional item quality criteria deemed relevant to age-appropriateness and mental health were therefore identified to supplement readability analyses. First, items should ideally consist of single statements <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Irwing &amp; Hughes, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Saris, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Terwee et al., 2007)</ref>, and avoid reverse wording to reduce confusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Irwing &amp; Hughes, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">van Sonderen, Sanderman, &amp; Coyne, 2013)</ref>. Floor and ceiling effects (endorsement of the lowest or highest response at &gt; 15%) should not be present.</p><p>Absence of these is an indication that measures reliably distinguish individuals across the range of symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Terwee et al., 2007)</ref>. Items should also be presented with a clear and appropriate reference period to the concept under study <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Irwing &amp; Hughes, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Saris, 2014)</ref>. Since all items had the same reference period, we used the first three criteria to assess items and considered those that satisfied two out of three to be of higher quality.</p><p>Factor structure and measurement invariance. Given the poor factor structure of the self-report SDQ in other samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Goodman et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Goodman, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Percy et al., 2008)</ref>, we considered both CFA and ESEM with geomin rotation (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>). We estimated three CFA models, the first of which was a correlated structure of the five subscales, based on the original theoretical structure of the measure representing the five subscales typically used <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Goodman, 2001)</ref>. Secondly, we included a correlated 2-factor higher-order structure in which emotional problems and peer problems loaded onto a second-order internalizing factor, and conduct problems and hyperactivity loaded onto a second-order externalizing factor as suggested elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Goodman et al., 2010)</ref>. Thirdly, we estimated a bifactor model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen &amp; Zhang, 2018)</ref> with a general difficulties factor, and four residual difficulty subdomain factors. This model has shown some promise in other language versions (e.g., Ortuño-Sierra, Chocarro, Fonseca-Pedrero, Riba, &amp; Muñiz, 2015a) and allows the total difficulties subscale to be represented as a general factor after accounting for specific variance captured by each of the four problem domains. The prosocial factor was excluded from both the bifactor and higher-order models since these were used to examine the hypothesized 4-factor total difficulties score <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Goodman, 2001)</ref>. We finally tested a 5-factor ESEM model, which was used to explore age measurement invariance.</p><p>Where measures lack proposed dimensionality, as is the case with the self-report SDQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Goodman et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Goodman, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Percy et al., 2008)</ref>, and invariance testing is warranted, given recent claims about age <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Deighton et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dray et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">NHS Digital, 2018)</ref>, exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM) techniques can be used <ref type="bibr">(Marsh, Nagengast, &amp; Morin, 2013a)</ref>. As others have pointed out, though ESEM structures should not be used to conceal problems with a measure, they can provide a more realistic framework for measurement invariance analysis where CFA models do not fit sufficiently well (Tóth-Király, Bõthe, Rigó, &amp; Orosz, 2017). Furthermore, given the substantial cross-loadings and shared variance in the SDQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Goodman, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Percy et al., 2008)</ref>, ESEM can provide a more robust approach than post-hoc addition of parameters (e.g., crossloadings) following modification indices <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chiorri, Hall, Casely-Hayford, &amp; Malmberg, 2016)</ref>. We therefore opted to extract five factors in line with the original theoretical model, but in ESEM every item is permitted to load onto every factor so that shared variance in the data is not misspecified.</p><p>When accounting for the fact data were sampled from pupils clustered in schools (using type = complex), the ESEM models required greater numbers of parameters to be estimated than there were schools in the sample (165 &gt; 114), thus resulting in a warning about the trustworthiness of standard errors. Given that the implications of this in model estimation are not well understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2016)</ref>, and parameter estimates would not be directly affected, clustering effects were not controlled for. This decision was guided by the small intra-cluster correlations for the SDQ variables (&lt;.05) and the fact that controlling for clustering made little difference to the standard errors and therefore conclusions (results can be provided upon request). For consistency we therefore did not account for clustering in any model.</p><p>Chi-square difference testing is typically used to compare the fit of measurement invariance models. However, its sensitivity to sample size made this inappropriate for our study, suggesting approximate fit indices should be used. Since the majority of measurement invariance simulations focusing on performance of fit indices have treated items as continuous <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Meade, Johnson, &amp; Braddy, 2008)</ref>, the degree to which common fit indices are appropriate for comparing models using polychoric matrices and WLSMV is unclear.</p><p>For instance, given that the chi-square of WLSMV is not comparable in the same way as for maximum likelihood, CFI comparisons might not be appropriate in these cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Sass, Schmitt, &amp; Marsh, 2014)</ref>. Analyses were therefore conducted in Mplus 8.3 using MLR and treating items as continuous.

All cases with data for at least one SDQ item were therefore included in our analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Readability Estimates</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> presents the four readability estimates by US grade-level, the average across the four indices, and the reading age in years. Estimates were calculated for the introductory text, individual items, subscales and total scale. The introductory text was found to have a reading age considerably greater than 11. Similarly, items 3, 13, 16 (emotional), 4, 20 (prosocial), 10, 15 (hyperactivity), and 14 (peer problems) were calculated as having readability estimates greater than 12 years old. Of the five subscales, emotional problems and hyperactivity were calculated as having the highest reading ages (&gt;12). However, despite appropriate estimates for the remaining subscales and total scale, conduct problems was the only subscale not to include any items with a reading age greater than 12 years. Items 10, 13, 15, 16 and 20 were of particular concern with reading ages greater than 15 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Item Quality Criteria</head><p>The measure's items, floor/ceiling effects, and quality scores can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>.</p><p>While we expected varied quality, results were not favorable with 17 items (68%) shown to have poor item quality (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). Specifically, of the SDQ's 25 items, 14 (four emotional problems, four conduct problems, three hyperactivity-inattention, two prosocial, and one peer problems) clearly include more than one statement, and therefore request a response about more than one experience. The measure also has five reversed items across the conduct problems, hyperactivity, and peer problems scales. All 20 difficulties items showed substantial floor effects, ranging from 21-85%, and a further eight also had ceiling effects, ranging from 15-34 %. The prosocial items showed ceiling effects, ranging from 29-69%, and one also had a floor effect at 16%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Readability vs. Item Quality.</head><p>Though our readability methodology suffers from applying formulas to short texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Oakland &amp; Lane, 2004)</ref>, this was considered alongside item quality criteria, so that items could be evaluated more comprehensively. For instance, the item with the lowest reading age, "I worry a lot", also performed well in terms of item quality since it is not reversed, and consists of a single statement. Conversely, the item "I fight a lot. I can make other people do what I want" has a low reading age, but introduces confusion since respondents must affirm two independent behaviors. Another consideration is that the measure is often deployed in schools, as was the case for our sample (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Wigelsworth et al., 2012)</ref>. The item "I am easily distracted, I find it difficult to concentrate" has the highest reading age because it contains several multiple syllable words. On one hand, young people in schools may regularly be talked to about concentration and therefore be more readily primed to recognize these words than readability formulas would suggest. However, item quality criteria confirm that this statement is unnecessarily complex, containing two statements. Readability and age-appropriateness of measures are therefore more complex than any one type of analysis might suggest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factor Structure and Measurement Invariance</head><p>School year group was available for all but one participant, and missingness for SDQ responses ranged from .5-1.5%. Variance and Covariance coverage were high (&gt;.97) for SDQ items suggesting that estimates were likely to be trustworthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Muthén, Muthén, &amp; Asparouhov, 2017)</ref>. Since data were not missing completely at random,  2 (13289)= 17509.62, p &lt; .0001, we explored missingness at the subscale level, using gender, age, ethnicity, self-reported wellbeing, special educational needs and free school meal eligibility as predictors. Special educational needs (OR = .25-.37) predicted less missing data for all subscales. Unclassified ethnicity predicted less missing data for all but the conduct problems subscale (OR = .01-.21). Asian ethnicity predicted less missing data for peer problems, prosocial behaviour and hyperactivity (OR = .28-.35). Higher wellbeing predicted less missing data for peer problems and prosocial behaviour (OR = .92-.93), while girls (OR = .33) and those from black ethnic backgrounds (OR = .28) were less likely to have missing data for prosocial behaviour.</p><p>Fit of all models estimated is provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>. The original correlated 5-Factor structure was found to have poor fit, as did the higher-order model. The bifactor structure of the four difficulties subscales similarly indicated a total difficulties score to be problematic, even though bifactor structures are highly parameterized with a tendency to overfit <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Murray &amp; Johnson, 2013)</ref>. As expected, given the flexibility of such models, the ESEM solution provided a much better fit to the data. Nevertheless, primary ESEM loadings were strongly related to their corresponding parameters in the CFA model. This was established via a correlation between loadings from the ESEM and CFA models (r = .65) following the example by <ref type="bibr">Marsh et al. (2013b)</ref>.</p><p>The ESEM solution (see supplemental table S1) revealed nine items to cross-load with a discrepancy of &lt; .30 between the highest and second highest loadings, which is indicative of problems with the item <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Matsunaga, 2010)</ref>. Each of the five reversed items also loaded above .34 on the prosocial factor, and less strongly on their theorized difficulties factors. The prosocial factor was not correlated with the emotional problems and peer problems factors at a significant level. Similarly, the hyperactivity factor was not significantly associated with the peer problems factor. Factor correlations beyond this were in expected directions, with the largest associations seen between hyperactivity and conduct problems (r = .49), and emotional problems and peer problems (r = .38). Sensitivity analysis also revealed that accounting for the categorical nature of items via WLSMV had little impact on results. No changes in fit or loadings were seen in terms of recommended cutoffs, supporting confidence in the main results reported based on MLR.</p><p>Acceptable model fit was found for the two age groups separately. Consistent with findings for the parent version with middle and older adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(He et al., 2013)</ref>, but counter to our hypothesis based on previous readability evidence, approximate age measurement invariance was supported, as the CFI was found to be below .01 in all comparisons (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Though the self-report SDQ is widely used, including to study age differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Deighton et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hafekost et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Johnston &amp; Gowers, 2005)</ref>, evidence of its age appropriateness has been limited. Building on existing evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(He et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Patalay et al., 2018)</ref> we addressed this gap by considering the measure's item-level readability, item quality, factor structure, and age measurement invariance. Items showed a wide range of reading ages, which was more varied than previous subscale-level analysis had indicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Patalay et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Many items also appeared to be too difficult for the intended age group. Beyond this, a substantial proportion of the measure was found to be problematic in terms of item quality, and the proposed factor structure was a poor fit to the data. ESEM allowed approximate measurement invariance to be tested between students in year seven versus year nine, which suggested that this flexible structure was invariant across these groups.</p><p>While <ref type="bibr">Patalay and colleagues (2018)</ref> had already demonstrated the measure may not be suitable for adolescents under 13, their analysis was unable to clarify which items might be problematic. In fact, our results suggest scale and subscale-level reading scores could be misleading since they suggested levels around age 11. Counter to our first hypothesis, item-level readability was much more varied than that found previously at the subscale level. We found some items to be much more difficult and others much easier. For instance, while the emotional problems subscale had an average reading age of 12.68, the item "I worry a lot" performed much better with an average reading age of 5.41. This item is therefore an example of optimal simplicity.</p><p>Beyond the item-level analysis, the instructions did not meet recommendations published elsewhere that even adult scales should have reading ages of no more than 12 <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Terwee et al., 2007)</ref>. This suggests there may have been problems even for higher quality items. In fact, special attention to instructions has been recommended for surveys with young people since clearer and more detailed instructions can be associated with greater reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Omrani, Wakefield-Scurr, Smith, &amp; Brown, 2018)</ref>. Similarly, Though the stated reference period in the SDQ instructions is clear, i.e. not subjective such as "often", but finite, "over the last six months", this may not be appropriate to the assessment of symptoms in adolescents. Younger adolescents, in particular, tend to find long reference periods challenging, and guidelines suggest very recent or current reference periods may lead to more valid responses in this age group <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bell, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">de Leeuw, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>As well as clarifying readability analysis, consideration of item quality criteria revealed the measure to have certain other problems. Alongside the fact that over half of items contain multiple statements, the SDQ also contains five reversed items. While such items are common in scale development, it is generally advised that these be avoided since they tend not to factor well with other constructs or be opposite indicators as developers intend them to be <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ebesutani et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Suárez-Alvarez et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">van Sonderen et al., 2013)</ref>. In the current study it was clear the reversed items were not measuring the subscale constructs cleanly, as ESEM results revealed all these items to have substantial cross-loadings. This is also consistent with findings in other language versions of the SDQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Garrido et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">van de Looij-Jansen, Goedhart, de Wilde, &amp; Treffers, 2011)</ref>. Specifically, we found each of the reversed items loaded more strongly on the prosocial factor than on their respective theorized factors. Some shared variance could reasonably be anticipated. However, the magnitude of these cross loadings (particularly on the prosocial factor), suggests that beyond age-appropriateness, these items may also face wider validity problems. Reversed items can affect instrument structure through misresponse since their content may not be perceived as opposite to positively worded statements <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Weijters &amp; Baumgartner, 2012)</ref>. Though we did not explicitly examine common method effects, our ESEM SDQ AGE APPROPRIATENESS 20 results suggest reversed items could have introduced noise into the structure through similarity to prosocial items, as they all relate to positive behaviors.</p><p>Item quality criteria also provided insight into the measure's applicability across the range of symptoms. In our community sample, which showed above average levels of mental health difficulties, high levels of floor or ceiling effects were seen for every item. While this is a common feature of clinical measures used in samples with predominantly healthy individuals, the measure's use may be somewhat limited, particularly if recommended dimensional approaches to understanding symptoms are adopted <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Krueger et al., 2018)</ref>. This is because measures with high floor and ceiling effects tend to have less discriminatory ability and responsiveness; in other words they may be less able to detect change and discriminate between individuals with different levels of problems (e.g., high versus boderline; de Vet, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Terwee, Mokkink, &amp; Knol, 2011)</ref>. The three-point response format may contribute to the skewed nature of the data since having more categories can be associated with higher reliability and validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lozano, García-Cueto, &amp; Muñiz, 2008)</ref>. While there is relatively little research on number of response categories with young people, available evidence suggests around four options may provide a good balance in terms of memory, reading, reliability and stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bell, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Omrani et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Beyond the issues already identified, further elements have also been suggested as indicators of psychometric quality. Of particular relevance to the current study, is that measures should ideally be developed in consultation with the target population <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Irwing &amp; Hughes, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Terwee et al., 2007)</ref>, since this allows assessment of acceptability and bias of items. It is possible that some of the psychometric problems identified in the SDQ are compounded by such issues, as to the authors' knowledge, such consultation did not take place in the development of the SDQ.</p><p>Regarding the SDQ's structure, we found the five correlated subdomains to be a poor fit to the data, and uncovered substantial shared variance across factors in the ESEM solution. Both the higher-order internalizing/externalizing model, and the bifactor difficulties model also failed to show good fit. These results indicate that using the SDQ to calculate subdomain scores is questionable <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Raykov &amp; Marcoulides, 2011)</ref>. Our ESEM results further suggest the hypothesized structure may be problematic since several items loaded onto more than one factor. The instrument's poor fit may also be explained by satisficing theory, which is considered to be of particular relevance to adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Krosnick, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Omrani et al., 2018)</ref>. This holds that the greater the cognitive demand on participants, the lower the reliability of their responses, as steps involved in providing appropriate responses are skipped <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Krosnick, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Omrani et al., 2018)</ref>. The following results in this study could support such an account: 1) subscales showed mixed reliability, as measured through internal consistency; 2) the instructions had a higher reading age than the lowest limit of the intended population; 3) many items did not have appropriate reading ages, with some at very high levels; 4) the reference period of six months is often considered to be inappropriate for younger adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bell, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">de Leeuw, 2011)</ref>; 5) several items, particularly those with reverse wording, were found to tap into more than one construct; 6) many items contained multiple statements which tend to increase cognitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Oakland &amp; Lane, 2004</ref>).</p><p>Since we found the hypothesized CFA structures to be inadequate, we proceeded to invariance testing with the ESEM model, which as expected showed excellent fit. We found no evidence of differences in how 11-12-year-olds versus 13-15-year-olds responded using this flexible model. Since we used CFI to establish approximate invariance, we interpret our findings as suggesting that any differences between groups are likely insubstantial. Though we anticipated older students might respond markedly differently, as previous research suggested the SDQ may be more appropriate to their reading ability, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Patalay et al., 2018)</ref>, our results suggest that both groups responded to it with the same level of ease and/or difficulty. Still, our readability evidence suggests that items with a reading age above 14 may have been too difficult for both groups. In fact our sample had below average ability in reading which could also support the idea that approximate invariance was caused in part by high reading age items being equally difficult for both groups. Further work is needed (e.g. cognitive interviews with young people) to consolidate our findings.</p><p>Taken together, our findings indicate a large proportion of self-report SDQ items are less appropriate for use with younger populations. The current study is the first to provide a detailed item-level readability analysis, thus uncovering specific issues with the self-report SDQ. While previous evidence suggested four of the five subscales had reading ages higher than the recommended minimum age <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Patalay et al., 2018)</ref>, the current study indicates this may be not be the case for all items. Still, our findings call for caution when using the self-report SDQ with younger adolescents or populations with mental health difficulties, since this group may have below average reading ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Jensen et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Moilanen, Shaw, &amp; Maxwell, 2010)</ref>. It should also be noted that self-report adolescent mental health measures have generally been found to be poor in terms of psychometric quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bentley et al., 2019)</ref>. It is therefore important that researchers and clinicians consider carefully the psychometric quality and reading age of their chosen instrument in relation to their sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Jensen et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Our study brought together robust and complementary methodological approaches to comprehensively assess age-appropriateness of a widely used measure for the first time. Indeed our findings highlight the importance of conducting supplementary analysis such as readability and item quality alongside invariance testing, since these can provide additional insight.</p><p>Together, assessment of item quality and readability with factor analysis suggested that the scale contains several difficult statements and psychometrically poor items with a response scale that prevents it from capturing the full spectrum of symptoms experienced in the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Terwee et al., 2007)</ref>. Despite these methodological strengths, a number of limitations must be acknowledged.</p><p>First, though we attempted to overcome the problem of losing information about items when applying readability formulas to subscales, our item-level readability results should be interpreted carefully. These formulas were not designed for this purpose and therefore may not be as reliable as when used with longer passages <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Oakland &amp; Lane, 2004)</ref>. However, we are confident that high-scoring items are likely inappropriate for younger audiences since they also showed poor item quality. It has also been suggested that assessment of readability at the item level is vital since this reflects how respondents actually perceive scale texts, particularly since individual items may be skipped or invalid responses provided when demands are too great <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Calderón, Morales, Liu, &amp; Hays, 2006)</ref>. In addition, although readability results were considered alongside other well-established indicators of item quality, these were not based on a standardized measure.</p><p>We also treated items as continuous so we could employ the more robust CFI index for invariance testing, though our data were ordinal. The skewness in our data was controlled for by using MLR and sensitivity analysis using WLSMV supported these findings. Thirdly, though our large sample size was likely an asset for assessing the generalizability of floor and ceiling effects, and the factor structure of the measure, it is not currently clear how approximate difference testing using CFI is affected by samples of the magnitude reported here. It is also possible that the explanations provided via the online portal affected measurement invariance by masking the differences in ability between the older and younger cohort. However, in any largescale research with young people it is likely that support would be provided in some form (e.g. by a teacher or researcher). It is therefore likely very difficult to provide measurement invariance analysis across age groups without some kind of confound for ability.</p><p>Results must also be interpreted only for the ESEM model, which is less restrictive, with cross-loadings freely estimated. The theorized CFA model by <ref type="bibr">Goodman et al. (1989)</ref> was not suitable for measurement invariance testing, and we therefore stress that invariance of this model could not be determined. Though lack of control over a priori structure in ESEM is therefore a limitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Marsh, Liem, Martin, Morin, &amp; Nagengast, 2011)</ref>, five factors corresponding to the original theoretical model were extracted in order to accommodate issues such as cross-loadings without resorting to post-hoc model modification. Similarly, though the large number of parameters in ESEM is a limitation, our large sample size was likely able to handle this with a ratio of 163.7 cases per parameter. Finally, though our sample was large, it was not representative of the general population since deprivation was seen at higher levels, given the focus of the project from which data were drawn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and Future Directions</head><p>While the self-report SDQ has been used extensively, our study suggests the measure would benefit from revisions three decades on from its original development. It is perhaps surprising that such a widely used measure suffers from issues such as those described here, although as our findings suggest, this is possibly due to the lack of attention to robust scale development practices (e.g. omission of cognitive interviews with young people). Items should be simplified, with reversed wording and multiple statements replaced with simpler alternatives, and more straightforward language used for items with high reading ages. We also recommend that such amendments be made in consultation with young people in line with policy and psychometric best practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Deighton et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Irwing &amp; Hughes, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Terwee et al., 2007)</ref>.
