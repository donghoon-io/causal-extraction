<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Many governments and their agencies are increasingly using the information and communication technologies (ICTs) as they are offering electronic services to the general public. The provision of electronic and mobile government services can enhance the effectiveness, economies and efficiencies as online users benefit from faster, more convenient and less costly service delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Scott, DeLone &amp; Golden, 2016)</ref>. The citizens and businesses who avail themselves of the e-government's and/or mobile-government's (mgovernment) services will facilitate their interactions with the government's public services whilst reducing the administrative burdens of bureaucracy and red tape <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Evans &amp; Campos, 2013)</ref>. The Internet has enabled the instant access to large volumes of data in real time <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chun, Shulman, Sandoval &amp; Hovy, 2010)</ref>. As a result, the citizens will experience faster and more efficient services from the government if they use its electronic and mobile services <ref type="bibr">(Massey, Bromberg &amp; Manoharan, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Wirtz &amp; Birkmeyer, 2018)</ref>. Moreover, they will be reducing their paperwork and the travel requirements to and from the government's agencies and departments, if they provide electronic services to online and mobile users.</p><p>However, there are still a number of challenges for the proliferation of e-government and/or m-government services, particularly amongst the most vulnerable groups in society. The provision of the e-government services can possibly exclude individuals who are positioned on the wrong side of the 'digital divide' <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lee &amp; Porumbescu, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Massey et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Van Deursen &amp; Van Dijk, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">2011)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr">Massey, et al. (2019)</ref> argued that the ease of use of these ubiquitous devices and their usability can possibly enable greater access to egovernment services through mobile technologies if the governments choose to invest in mobile friendly platforms.</p><p>However, some individuals may still not have access to a broadband or mobile internet connection, for various reasons, including; age, disability, limited digital skills and/or lack of financial resources. Alternatively, there may be citizens who live in specific areas such as remote communities where they have limited or no access to the Internet. In these cases, the respective governments ought to deliver their public services through traditional channels, including; front office operations or via toll free telephone numbers. Of course, the face-toface customer services, as well as the provision of a call center facility is more expensive than the provision of e-government and/or m-government services. Therefore, the governments ought to encourage its citizens and the businesses to use their electronic services and/or mobile applications (apps). They may have to offer the facilitating conditions including the relevant infrastructures like broadband technologies, as well as training and development opportunities for online users to entice them to use their e-Government services <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lee &amp; Porumbescu, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Layne &amp; Lee, 2001)</ref>. Notwithstanding, the citizens may be concerned about the safety and security of their personal data, if they are aware that their government is gathering and sharing their personal information to improve its service delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chun et al., 2010)</ref>. The information that is collected and captured by thegovernments may be exposed to certain risks such as data loss, data corruption, data breach or data theft <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Conradie &amp; Choenni, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Picazo-Vela, Gutiérrez-Martínez &amp; Luna-Reyes, 2012)</ref>. As a result, the citizens and businesses may be discouraged to engage with the Government's digital and mobile services as they may be wary about its privacy standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bélanger &amp; Carter, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In this light, this study addresses a knowledge gap in academia as it explores the online users' intentions to use e-Government systems. This research has adopted valid and reliable measures that were drawn from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Zuiderwijk et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wang &amp; Shih, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Venkatesh, Morris, Davis &amp; Davis, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">2012)</ref> to investigate the citizens' perceptions on the usefulness and ease of use of the e-government system, in the Scottish context. The research participants were expected to indicate whether they were influenced by other individuals to use the government's electronic services, and to reveal their attitudes on the facilitating conditions that may enable them to engage with the digital technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lee &amp; Porumbescu, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Layne &amp; Lee, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, this research sheds light on the online users' behavioral intentions to use egovernment. At the same time, it explains whether there were moderating effects from the socio-demographic variables, including age, gender and experiences on their citizens' engagement with e-government systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Several governments around the globe are utilizing the digital and mobile technologies to enhance the provision of their public services <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(EuroParl, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Zuiderwijk Janssen &amp; Dwivedi. 2015)</ref>. Digital and mobile services are the facilitating instruments that are enabling all levels of the governments' operations, to better service their citizens, big businesses, small enterprises and non-profit organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Wirtz &amp; Birkmeyer, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rana &amp; Dwivedi, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Evans &amp; Campos, 2013)</ref>. The-governments are increasingly relying on ICT, including computers, websites and business process re-engineering (BPR) to engage with online users <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Isaías, Pífano &amp; Miranda, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Weerakkody, Janssen &amp; Dwivedi, 2011)</ref>. Hence, the delivery of e-government and m-government services may usually demand the public service to implement specific transformational processes and procedures that are ultimately intended to add value to customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Pereira, Macadar, Luciano &amp; Testa, 2017)</ref>. Previously, thegovernments' consumers relied on face-to-face interactions or on telephone communications to engage with their consumers. Gradually, many governments had introduced interactive communications as departments and their officials started using the emails to engage with online users. Today, citizens and businesses can communicate and interact with thegovernment departments and agencies in real-time, through virtual call centers, via instantmessaging (IM), graphical user interfaces (GUI) and audio/video presentations.</p><p>In the past, the-governments' services were operated in administrative silos of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(EuroParl, 2017)</ref>. However, the electronic governance involves the data exchange between the-government and its stakeholders, including the businesses as well as the general public <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Pereira et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rana &amp; Dwivedi, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chun et al., 2010)</ref>. The advances in interactive technologies have brought significant improvements in the delivery of service quality to online users of the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Sá, Rocha &amp; Cota, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Isaías et al., 2012)</ref>. As a result, the egovernment and m-government services have become refined and sophisticated. Thus, the provision of online services is more efficient and less costly when compared to the offline services.</p><p>However, there are still many citizens and businesses who for various reasons may not want to engage with the-governments' electronic and/or mobile services <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Shareef, Kumar, Dwivedi &amp; Kumar, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">2014)</ref>. This argumentation is conspicuous with the digital divide in society as not everyone is benefiting from an equitable access and democratic participation in the Internet or from the e-government systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ebbers, Jansen &amp; van Deursen, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Friemel, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Luna-Reyes, Gil-Garcia &amp; Romero, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Isaías, Miranda &amp; Pífano, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The low usage of e-government systems impedes the ability of many governments to connect to citizens <ref type="bibr">(Danila &amp; Abdullah, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mensah (2018)</ref> held that the government authorities should promote the utilization of user-friendly mobile applications as the majority of citizens are increasingly engaging with their smartphones for different purposes, including to access information and services. Many countries around the world have introduced online government portals can be accessed through desktop computers as well as via mobilefriendly designs <ref type="bibr">(Camilleri, 2019a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ndou, 2004)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Massey et al. (2019)</ref> posited that the government's electronic services can be integrated among different devices in order to ensure an effective service delivery. These authors also maintained that the citizens are increasingly relying on the features of the mobile technologies as they are always connected to wireless networks. Their portable, mobile devices can provide access to a wide array of public information at any time and in any place <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Camilleri &amp; Camilleri, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Wirtz &amp; Birkmeyer, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sareen, Punia, &amp; Chanana, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In a similar vein, many citizens may easily access their respective government's online portal via virtual, open networks. They can also receive instantaneous messages and responses from the governments' public service systems in their mobile devices, including smart phones or tablets <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Shareef et al., 2016)</ref>. Therefore, m-governance can possibly enhance the quality of the public services in terms of improved efficiency and cost savings <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Madden, Bohlin, Oniki, &amp; Tran, 2013)</ref>. Notwithstanding, in the near future, the government's electronic systems will be in a better position to exceed their citizens' expectations, in terms of quality of service <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Li &amp; Shang, 2019)</ref>. The advances in technology, including the increased massive wireless data traffic from different application scenarios, as well as the efficient resource allocation schemes will be better exploited to improve the capacity of online and mobile networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Zhang, Liu, Chu, Long, Aghvami &amp; Leung, 2017)</ref>. For instance, the fifth generation (5G) of mobile communication systems is expected to enhance the citizens' service quality as they may offer higher mobile connection speeds, capacities and reduced latencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Osseiran, Boccardi, Braun, Kusume, Marsch, Maternia &amp; Tullberg, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite these technological breakthroughs, there are many citizens who are still reluctant to use the-governments' electronic and/or mobile services as they hold negative perceptions toward public administration <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Wirtz &amp; Birkmeyer, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Shareef, Dwivedi, Stamati, &amp; Williams, 2014)</ref>. These individuals are not comfortable to share their personal information online <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Van Deursen &amp; Van Dijk, 2014)</ref>. They may perceive that egovernment and/or m-government platforms are risky and unsecure <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Conradie &amp; Choenni, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bélanger &amp; Carter, 2008)</ref>. Consequentially, they will decide not to upload their data as they suspect that it can be used by third parties <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Picazo-Vela et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bélanger &amp; Carter, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Conceptual Framework and the Formulated Hypotheses</head><p>A review of the relevant literature suggests that there are a number of conceptual frameworks that have been widely used in academia. For example, Davis' (1989) Technology Acceptance Model; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ajzen's (1991)</ref> Theory of Planned <ref type="bibr">Behavior and Venkatesh et al.'s (2003)</ref> Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, among others, have often been validated in highly cited publications in communications and technology-related journals, as various researchers investigated the individuals' readiness to use technologies, in different contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Camilleri &amp; Camilleri, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Individuals' Intentions to Use e-government Services</head><p>The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) posits that the individuals' intentions to use technology would be preceded by their attitude toward usage, which would in turn be determined by their perceptions about the usefulness and the ease of use of the mentioned technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rana, Dwivedi &amp; Williams, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jaeger &amp; Matteson, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Davis, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Davis, Bagozzi &amp; Warshaw, 1989)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ajzen and Fishbein's (1975)</ref> Theory of Reasoned Actions (TRA) argued that the individuals' personal attitudes toward certain behaviors and the subjective norms in society will influence their behavioral intentions as well as their actions. Subsequently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref> have amalgamated various constructs from TAM and TRA. These authors have empirically validated them in their Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Venkatesh et al. (2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">2012)</ref> reported that the individuals' performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influences, as well as the facilitating conditions were the antecedents that were affecting their intentions to use the technology. Moreover, they maintained that the behavioral intentions anticipated the actual usage of technology. Notwithstanding, the individuals' experience with the usage of technology moderates this relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Park, Nam &amp; Cha, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wang &amp; Shih, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. This argumentation leads to the first hypothesis: H1: The individuals' intentions to use the e-government systems has a significant effect on their actual usage. Their experience moderates this effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived Usefulness of e-government Services</head><p>The perceived usefulness construct measures whether the individuals perceive that the technology will support them in their performance <ref type="bibr">(Camilleri &amp; Camilleri, 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr">2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr">2019)</ref>. This measure is closely related to Venkatesh et al.'s (2012) 'performance expectancy', and to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Davis, Bagozzi &amp; Warshaw's (1992)</ref> 'extrinsic motivation'; as it emphasizes the importance of utilitarian value. Other studies have also indicated that performance expectancy is a precursor of behavioral intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Venkatesh et al. 2003)</ref>. The relationship between the individuals' performance expectancy or perceived usefulness of technologies and their behavioral intention to use them will be affected by their gender and/or age <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>. Hence, the demographic variables can have a moderating role on the individuals' adoption of technology <ref type="bibr">(Camilleri, 2019a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Al-Hujran, Al-Debei, Chatfield &amp; Migdadi, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carter &amp; Bélanger, 2005)</ref>. Therefore, this study hypothesizes: H2: The individuals perceived usefulness of the e-government systems can have a significant effect on their intentions to use them. Age and gender can moderate this effect.</p><p>Perceived Ease of Use TAM measured the extent to which the individuals' perceived that the technology is userfriendly and free of effort. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Davis (1989)</ref> posited that the individuals' perceptions on the ease of use (PEoU) of technology will have an effect on their technology acceptance. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Venkatesh et al.'s (2003)</ref> 'effort expectancy' construct measured the degree of the ease of use of technological systems. Very often, the individuals believed that they will benefit if they use the technologies that are easy to use <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Scott et al., 2016)</ref>. Similarly, the citizens' perceived ease of use is a significant predictor of their intention to use the e-government's services <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carter &amp; Bélanger, 2005)</ref>. Therefore, the individuals' perceptions on the ease of use of technology will determine their intentions to use certain technologies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Venkatesh et al. (2012)</ref> posited that age, gender and experience influence the causal link between the individuals' effort expectancy and their behavioral intentions to utilize the technology.</p><p>Hence, this research hypothesizes: H3: The individuals' perceived ease of use of the e-government's systems can have a significant effect on their intentions to use them. Age, gender and experience can moderate this effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Influences</head><p>Individuals may be influenced by other individuals, including their family members, friends and/or by acquaintances, to use certain technologies. <ref type="bibr">Venkatesh et al.'s (2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">2012)</ref> social influence construct measured the degree to which individuals believe that they are influenced by others to use technologies. This measure is closely associated with the subjective norms construct that was included in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fishbein and Ajzen's (1975)</ref> TRA. It is also conspicuous with <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ajzen's (1991)</ref> theory of planned behavior (TPB). These theoretical underpinnings suggest that the individuals' social influences are a significant antecedent for their intention to use technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Park et al., 2012)</ref>. Notwithstanding, the demographic variables, including age, gender and experience, can possibly moderate the link between the individuals' social influences and their intentions to engage with technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Camilleri, 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>. Both genders may respond in different ways to the normative pressures from society. The males and females may be driven by psycho-social phenomena to engage in specific behaviors. Moreover, their age and experience with technologies may also have a moderating effect on the link between the social influences and the individuals' behavioral intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>. This leads to the fourth hypothesis: H4: The individuals' social influences can have a significant effect on their intentions to use the e-government's systems. Age, gender and experience can moderate this effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Facilitating Conditions</head><p>The individuals hold different perceptions on the functionality of the infrastructures that they use <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Layne &amp; Lee, 2001)</ref> and on other issues, including the provision of ongoing training and development, user support, and access to technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lee &amp; Porumbescu, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Teo, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref> suggested that their 'facilitating conditions' construct measures the degree to which individuals believe that the organizational and technical infrastructures exist to support them in the use of a technology system (p. 453). <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Venkatesh et al. (2012)</ref> posited that individuals may ask support from others. However, they went on to suggest that the link between the individuals' facilitating conditions and their intentions to use technologies will be moderated by the demographic variables, including age and experience. Various studies reported that the older individuals face more difficulty in adopting new technologies <ref type="bibr">(Camilleri &amp; Camilleri, 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Venkatesh et al. 2012</ref>). Moreover, there may be differences amongst the male and female genders on how they perceive that the facilitating conditions will influence their engagement with the technologies. Therefore, age, gender and experience can possibly have a moderate effect on the link between the individuals' facilitating conditions and their behavioral intentions to use the technologies.</p><p>Thus, this study hypothesizes that: H5: The individuals' facilitating conditions can have a significant effect on their usage of egovernment systems. H6: The individuals' facilitating conditions can have a significant effect on their intentions to use e-government systems. Age, gender and experience can moderate this effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Research Model</head><p>This study hypothesizes that the individuals' perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influences, and facilitating conditions are the antecedents of their intentions to use egovernment services, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Moreover, the behavioral intentions will precede their actual usage of this technology. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>The respondents were chosen from a database of 25,303 online users who had subscribed to receive promotional information from a group of companies, in Scotland. They had given their consent to be targeted by promotional material from third parties. Therefore, this research complied with the British Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)'s framework for research ethics and with the European Union's GDPR guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(EU, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The research participants received emails that comprised a hyperlink to this study's survey questionnaire. The research participants could not take part in this study more than once as their IP address was recorded in the survey system. There were 12,083 hits on the survey link. Of these, 706 respondents have returned the questionnaire that comprised useable data sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Measures</head><p>The respondents have indicated the extent of their agreement with this study's survey items, in a seven-point Likert scale. The responses ranged from 1= "strongly disagree" to 7= "strongly agree", where 4 signaled an indecision. The survey instrument has adapted measuring items that were drawn from Davis' (1989) TAM and from <ref type="bibr">Venkatesh et al.'s (2003)</ref> UTAUT. The constructs included; 'perceived usefulness of technology', perceived ease of use of technology', 'social influences', 'facilitating conditions', 'behavioral intentions' and 'usage of technology'. This study relied on Harman's single factor test to check for the common method variance (CMV). Moreover, the researcher examined the systematic error variances <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sharma, Yetton &amp; Crawford, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Research Participants</head><p>The surveyed respondents gave their socio-demographic details about their 'gender', 'age' and 'experience' in the latter part of the survey questionnaire. The research participants identity remained anonymous and their responses were kept confidential as only aggregate information was used during the analysis of the data. The respondents were expected to disclose their age by choosing one of seven age groups; They confirmed their gender by choosing the 1 or 0 dummy variable. Moreover, they revealed their experience with e-government systems (the experience was measured in months). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents a description of the profile of the research participants: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis and Interpretation of the Findings</head><p>There were two hundred thirty-two males and four hundred seventy-four females (n=706) who participated in this study. The respondents' 'age' varied, and this was evident in the standard deviation (σ) of 0.79. Respondents were also classified into six age groups <ref type="bibr">(16-25; 26-35; 36-45; 46-55, 56-65</ref> and over 66 years of age). There were three respondents who did not disclose their age in the survey instrument. The majority of the respondents were aged between 36 and 45 years of age (n=184), followed by those aged between 46 and 55 years (n=165). The majority of respondents (n=343) indicated that they have been using the egovernment system between 37-48 months. Whereas, two hundred fifteen respondents had used it for more than 4 years. Generally, the respondents indicated that they agreed with the survey items in the model, as the mean scores were well above the mid-point of 4.0.</p><p>Moreover, the standard deviations indicated that there was a narrow spread in the participants' responses, ranging from 0.3 to 1.4. The skewness and the kurtosis indices were congruent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kline's (2005)</ref> recommendations for the purposes of SEM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)</head><p>The analysis involved a two-step structural equation modelling that was conducted through AMOS 7.0. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) assessed the validity and reliability of the measures. The CFA results indicated the fitness indices and the standard factor loadings. The correlations between the constructs were computed simultaneously. There were certain fitness indices that did not achieve the required level. The factor loading for items PE4 and FC3 were below 0.6. Therefore, these two items were dropped. There was discriminant validity as the model had low modification indices (MI &lt; 14) and the correlation between the exogenous constructs did not exceed 0.85. The items that had a factor loading less than 0.6 and an R2 less than 0.4 were deleted as they affected the fitness index of the model. The The AVE values were above 0.8, as per <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fornell &amp; Larcker's (1981)</ref> recommendations. The composite reliability and internal consistency have exceeded the threshold value of 0.7 as they were also greater than 0.8 as reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> presents the discriminant validity index that indicated the correlation coefficients as well as the AVEs that were presented as off-diagonal elements (in bold). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>According to the structural equations modeling, there was a satisfactory fit for the research model of this study. The findings indicated that there were highly significant, direct effects on the individuals' intention and usage of e-government technologies. The participants demonstrated that they had utilitarian motives that triggered them to use the government's online services. Overall, the direct effects represented 38 percent of the variance that predicted behavioral intention, whilst the interaction terms explained 67 percent of the variance. In a similar vein, there was 41 percent of the variance that explained the direct effects, whilst 54 percent of the variance comprised the mediating effects on the usage of technology. The results suggest that there were significant moderating influences from the demographic variables, including age, gender and experience that had an effect on the users'</p><p>engagement with e-government systems.</p><p>The individuals' behavioral intention had a direct effect (0.31) that was highly significant (where p&lt;0.001) on their usage of the e-government's services. Moreover, there was a significant (p&lt;0.05), indirect effect (0.13) from the users' experience (0.13) in this relationship. The individuals' perceived usefulness of the e-government's services had a direct effect (0.32) that was very significant (p&lt;0.001) on their intention to use it.</p><p>Notwithstanding, there was also a highly significant (p&lt;0.01) indirect effect (0.11) from the mediating variables, including; age and gender that moderated the perceived usefulnessbehavioral intention relationship. The research participants' perceived usefulness of the egovernment's services appeared to be the most significant driver that predicted their behavioral intention to use this technology This finding is in stark contrast with <ref type="bibr">Mensah's (2017)</ref> study as he reported that the citizens' perceived usefulness of e-government services did not have a significant influence on their intention to use this technology. In this case, the individuals' perceived usefulness of the e-government predicted their intention to use it. The strength of this relationship varied with gender and age such that it was more significant for males and for the younger respondents.</p><p>The findings suggest that the individuals' perceived ease of use of the e-government systems (0.24) as well as their social influences (0.19) were significant antecedents for their behavioral intention to use the e-government services, where p &lt;0.05. The link between the respondents' perceived ease of use and their behavioral intention was moderated by gender and age, such that it was more significant for females and for the older respondents. Yet, those effects decreased with experience. On the other hand, this study suggests that there were no significant, mediating effects on the link between the individuals' social influences and their intentions to engage with the e-government systems.  <ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref> study also reported a significant, direct relationship between facilitating conditions and behavioral intentions. However, their study reported that there was no relationship between facilitating conditions and behavioral intentions when they tested for the moderating effects of age, gender and experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>This research adds value to the extant academic literature that investigated the adoption of e-government services. Firstly, this contribution has presented a critical analysis of the relevant theoretical underpinnings on digital and mobile government services. Secondly, the empirical study of this paper has validated the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology to better understand the citizens' intention to engage with the Scottish egovernment's services. A survey questionnaire explored the individuals' perceptions toward the usefulness and ease of use of the government's online systems. It investigated whether they were influenced by other individuals to use this technology. Moreover, it determined whether there were facilitating conditions that could have had an effect on their engagement with the governments' electronic services. In sum, this research reported that the respondents perceived the usefulness and the ease of use of the e-government systems as these constructs had the highest direct effects on their intention to engage with their government's online technology. In other words, these findings imply that the research participants felt that the e-government systems were useful and easy to use for them. In fact, they indicated that they will continue accessing their government's online services.</p><p>These encouraging results suggest that the governments should continue offering online information and value-added services to the general public. Hence, there is scope for many governments to continue improving the facilitating conditions (in terms of the provision of: accurate information; service quality and capability; reliability and secure access to interactive e-government systems; etc.) to entice citizens and businesses to use their digital and mobile services (if any). However, the governments' web sites, e-government and mgovernment systems ought to be well-designed, structured and easy to use. They can possibly offer live chat facilities to support the online users in their queries, or to address their concerns.</p><p>If they do not offer such interactions in real time, they can still acknowledge the online messages they receive. In addition to e-government, many governments are also offering m-government services that can be accessed via mobile devices, including the smart phones and tablets <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Wirtz &amp; Birkmeyer, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shareeff et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">Shareeff et al., , 2016))</ref>. These ubiquitous technologies provide an instant access to information and services from virtually everywhere.</p><p>On the other hand, there are still challenges facing many governments and societies relating to the digital divide amongst citizens. The literature review has explained that there are citizens hailing from different demographic groups from advanced and developing economies, who are still not benefiting from the digital media and/or from their mobile technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Mossey et al., 2019)</ref>. Hence, the governments' responsibility is to ensure that the e-government and/or m-government services are widely accessible and have to be easy to use for all citizens. Therefore, the provision of training programs that target the most vulnerable groups in society, can play an important role in this capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lee &amp; Porumbescu, 2019)</ref>. Arguably, the way forward is to have more inclusive governments who offer their value-added services through digital and mobile technologies. However, the governments need to ensure that progress is felt by all segments of society.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitation and Future Research</head><p>This study has revalidated the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology as it explored the individuals' behavioral intentions to use e-government systems. The number of research participants was more than enough to draw significant conclusions from the results.</p><p>Nevertheless, the respondents in this study were mostly middle-aged females (their mean age was around 37).

Future contributions can reuse the measuring items of this research. Perhaps, they can build on this empirical study by incorporating other constructs including; perceived value, perceived reliability, perceived service quality, satisfaction, secure accessibility, perceived service capability, perceived interactivity and responsiveness, among others, in order to examine the effects of other exogenous constructs on the individuals' behavioral intentions to use the e-government's services in various contexts. There is also scope in conducting qualitative studies to investigate the individual citizens' opinions and beliefs toward the-governments' electronic services. A longitudinal study can possible reveal any changes in the individuals' behavioral intentions to use e gov and/or m gov services, in the long term.</figDesc></figure>
