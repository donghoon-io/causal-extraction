<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose: Fusing knowledge-based theory, organizational learning theory and dynamics capability theory, this study explores on the one hand the linkage between exploration, sensing and tacit knowledge, and on the other hand exploitation, seizing and explicit knowledge. Thereby it argues that not only tacit knowledge, but also explicit knowledge contributes to competitive advantage for firms. The study also investigates how knowledge transforms into profitability.</p><p>Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual model is tested with a study sample of 153 industrial organizations using structural equation modelling (SEM).</p><p>Findings: Results confirm the importance of both tacit and explicit knowledge for achieving sustainable competitive advantages. Furthermore, both tacit and explicit knowledge transform into profitability, both directly and through product innovation and customer centricity which play partial mediating roles.</p><p>Practical implications: Explicit knowledge strategies can be easier to manage, implement and institutionalize than tacit knowledge strategies, which require human component and intervention to succeed. Managers should hence first implement explicit knowledge strategies to gain expeditious results. Further, with the advent of digital technologies and algorithms that can extract deep customer insights and organizational experiences which are highly tacit in nature and codifying the same into explicit knowledge, the importance of explicit knowledge is further enlarged.</p><p>Originality/value: Fusing three adjacent theories to establish a robust model specification able to demonstrate the contribution of explicit knowledge in the firm's competitive advantages.</p></div>

Discussions on knowledge are becoming increasingly important and a firm's future is largely dependent on its ability to manage this asset <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Coakes, 2003)</ref>. The source of competitive advantage is moving away from cost and productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Teece, 1998)</ref> to innovation backed by knowledge capabilities possessed by the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Egbu, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gold et al., 2001)</ref>. A firm has competitive advantage when the rents associated with such advantage, i.e., its performance and profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Rumelt, 1991)</ref> are superior in comparison to industry peers <ref type="bibr">(Grant, 1996a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Grant, , 1996b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Teece, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Knowledge is mainly present in the form of tacit and explicit <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Polanyi, 1966)</ref>; while some studies show that these two cannot co-exist within a firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hansen et al., 1999)</ref> others highlight such coexistence, interaction and a continuous dialogue between the two <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Nonaka, 1994)</ref>. While explicit knowledge can be codified and communicated tacit knowledge can only be observed through its application and acquired through 'people to people' personal interaction; its transfer between people is slow, costly and uncertain thereby making it inimitable <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Grant, 1996b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kogut and Zander, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>The resource-based theory contends that competitive advantage lies in the ability of firms to build unique capabilities that are valuable rare inimitable and organized <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barney and Griffin, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Barney, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Wernerfelt, 1984)</ref>. Extending the resource-based view, the knowledgebased theory of organizational capabilities argues that knowledge is the most strategically important capability <ref type="bibr">(Grant, 1996a)</ref>. A knowledge intensive organization acquires and exploits knowledge continuously and repeatedly in a circular process, termed as 'knowledge spiral' <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Nonaka, 1994)</ref>. The knowledge-based theory fundamentally argues that the main role of a firm is to integrate specialist individual tacit knowledge into its products and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Grant, 1996b)</ref>; hence, tacit knowledge is competitive advantage due to its inimitability, while explicit knowledge is not <ref type="bibr">(Grant, 1996a)</ref>. While some few studies point out that codification strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Inuzuka and Nakamori, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">López-Nicolás and Meroño-Cerdán, 2011)</ref> and information and communication technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Vaccaro et al., 2010)</ref> which are explicit in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Choi and Lee, 2003)</ref> are also important for firm profitability, the importance of tacit knowledge contributing to firm profitability is overwhelming in knowledge management and strategy literature. In fact, several studies in the field of knowledge management agree that explicit knowledge is not as important as tacit knowledge for generating competitive advantage <ref type="bibr">(Grant, 1996a</ref><ref type="bibr">, Grimaldi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sveiby, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Contrarily, this study advocates that while tacit knowledge is important, explicit knowledge is also very important for competitive advantage of firms; this is the first research gap of this study. To fill this research gap, two adjacent theories were used; the organizational learning theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(March, 1991)</ref> and the dynamic capabilities theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(O'Reilly and Tushman, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Teece et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Teece, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>So, the theoretical motivation for this paper stems from fusing resource based theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barney, 1991)</ref>, knowledge based theory of organizational capabilities <ref type="bibr">(Grant, 1996a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Grant, , 1996b))</ref>, organizational learning theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(March, 1991)</ref> and dynamic capabilities theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(O'Reilly and Tushman, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Teece et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Teece, 2007)</ref>. Knowledge can be considered a result of learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kogut and Zander, 1992)</ref>. The organizational learning theory prescribes two types of learning: exploration and exploitation, both competing for common organizational resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(March, 1991)</ref>. This theory advocates that both exploration and exploitation are important, and a cautious balance is required for organizations to have a sustainable competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Govindarajan, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">O'Reilly and Tushman, 2008)</ref>. In essence <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Nonaka (1994)</ref> argues that with mere 'socialization' and without 'combination' the knowledge spiral will not work; in line with the principal that exploration alone will not be effective without exploitation, in the organization learning theory. The study then imports and links the dynamic capabilities literature to argue that firms must cautiously balance between 'sensing' and 'seizing' capabilities, which again compete for common organizational resources, to achieve sustainable competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Teece, 2007)</ref>. Sensing activities in dynamic capability literature are exploratory learning in nature and akin to tacit knowledge and seizing activities is exploitative learning and is explicit knowledge intensive. So, this study stretches exploration as a learning typology <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(March, 1991)</ref> and sensing as a knowledge capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Teece, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Teece, , 2007) )</ref> to <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Nonaka's (1994)</ref> 'socialization' ontology, which is highly tacit knowledge intensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Popadiuk and Choo, 2006)</ref>. Further, the study extends exploitation as a learning classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(March, 1991)</ref> and seizing as a capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Teece, 2007)</ref> to Nonaka's 'combination' ontology that encompass explicit knowledge intensive activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(March, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Nonaka, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Popadiuk and Choo, 2006)</ref>. Given such close linkage that has been established between organizational learning theory and dynamic capability view, the study hypothesizes that not only tacit knowledge, but also explicit knowledge is important and both need to co-exist for competitive advantage and profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Nonaka, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">O'Reilly and Tushman, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Teece, 2007)</ref>. This is the first incremental contribution of this study.</p><p>Having established that explicit knowledge is also very important for competitive advantage, this study further explores as to how tacit and explicit knowledge transform into firm profitability. Despite this direct relationship between knowledge and profitability, previous research has shown that there are other variables that can also lead to firm profitability.</p><p>Earlier studies show that knowledge positively impacts product innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gloet and Terziovski, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Nonaka, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Verona and Ravasi, 2003)</ref> which in turn impacts profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(D'Attoma and Pacei, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Deschamps and Nayak, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Jajja et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Innovation is important for knowledge management practices to transform into superior firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Byukusenge et al., 2016)</ref>. Furthermore, researchers have shown that deep customer insights and customer knowledge results in customer centricity, which is defined as the ability of the firm to identify attractive customers to prospect, initiate and maintain relationships, and translating such relationships to superior firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Morgan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wang and Feng, 2012)</ref>. Product innovation and customer centricity are both result of organizational learning and knowledge creation. Firstly, a highly tacit knowledge intensive 'one on one' interaction with customers is required to assess megatrends and understand changing consumer behaviour so that the firm is able to design futuristic innovative products and services that appeal to the customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Deschamps and</ref><ref type="bibr">Nayak, 1993, O'Reilly and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Tushman, 2008)</ref>. Secondly, once such deep customer insights are captured, the firm needs to internalize the external knowledge through 'externalization', 'internalization' and 'combination' to deliver innovative products to customers, which are explicit knowledge intensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Nonaka, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">O'Reilly and Tushman, 2008)</ref>. Hence, it seems logical to hypothesize that not only tacit knowledge, but also explicit knowledge transforms into profitability and such transformation take place through product innovation and also through customer centricity. Bringing together the two most relevant mediating variables product innovation and customer centricity, this study attempts to specify a robust model that elucidates how tacit and explicit knowledge transforms into firm profitability, which is the second incremental contribution of this study.</p><p>The conceptual model developed in this study is tested using a sample of 153 organizations in the industrial sector using structural equation modelling (SEM) and hierarchical regression analysis. The layout of the paper is as follows: Section 2 offers a conceptual framework is which the mediation hypotheses are explored. Section 3 sets out the methodology. Section 4 presents the results and findings obtained. Section 5 provides discussions and conclusions.</p><p>Section 6 highlights the managerial implications of the study and explores the scope for future research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tacit and explicit knowledge</head><p>The organization's role is to primarily integrate specialist knowledge residing within individuals into its products and services by establishing the necessary coordination mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Grant, 1996b)</ref>. Although, the concept of knowledge is extensively studied in management literature, it still lacks integration of ideas and terminologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Braganza et al., 1999)</ref>. One of the reasons can be that knowledge has many dimensions and manifestations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alvesson and Kärreman, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Blackler, 1995)</ref>. It can be mainly present in the form of both explicit and tacit knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Polanyi, 1966)</ref>.</p><p>Tacit knowledge is an intangible asset consisting of mental models and schemas which is about timely extraction of relevant parts from mass data to find solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lubit, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Although scholars have variedly described tacit knowledge, it can be defined as a combination of personal, context specific experiences, ideas, values and emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Nonaka, 1991)</ref>, which is difficult to describe and transmit to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Guo, 2013)</ref>. Tacit knowledge is unique in the sense that it is more than mere deployment of technology and tools; it is about connecting people and facilitating the flow of knowledge within the firm, allowing people to think together <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alvesson and Kärreman, 2001)</ref> and is acquired through personal experience and shared by person-to-person interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hansen et al., 1999)</ref>. Researchers also view tacit knowledge as dynamic <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Sveiby, 1997)</ref>, nurtured through social interaction and personalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hansen et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Leonard and Sensiper, 1998)</ref>, centred on human resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gloet and Terziovski, 2004)</ref> and describe it as 'know-how' <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Coakes, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sveiby, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast to tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge is described as systems oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Choi and Lee, 2003)</ref> and it is generally captured, structured, codified and institutionalized in the form of procedures, manuals, policies, production schedules, forecasts, blueprints, and market intelligence data <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Schoenherr et al., 2014)</ref>. Hence, it can be easily put down on paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Coakes, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sveiby, 1997)</ref> and is deepened through codification <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hansen et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Leonard and Sensiper, 1998)</ref>. For this reason, it is easily transferred, shared and reused among members <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Nonaka 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Samuel et al., 2011)</ref>. Explicit knowledge management, as a codification strategy is centred on 'hard' information technology resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gloet and Terziovski, 2004)</ref>. Information and communication technologies including electronic data base, data transfer systems, workflows, mailing lists and video conferencing are enablers for explicit knowledge capture <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Vaccaro et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Profitability</head><p>One of the main outcomes of knowledge management is increased organizational profits <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Edvardsson, 2006)</ref>. Superior firm level profitability is a result of unique organizational capabilities <ref type="bibr">(Palacios Marqués and Garrigós Simón, 2006)</ref>, and such unique capabilities emanates from access to, and integration of, specialist knowledge <ref type="bibr">(Grant, 1996a)</ref>. In this sense, a hallmark of new economy is the ability of firms to extract value from its knowledge assets <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gold et al., 2001)</ref>. In other words, performance differences between firms are an outcome of their differing abilities in developing and deploying knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bierly and Chakrabarti, 1996)</ref>. However, what is true is that to achieve such competitive advantage and superior profitability, knowledge needs to be managed effectively and efficiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(López-Nicolás and Meroño-Cerdán, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Zack, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The eventual objective of all strategic management theories is for firms to achieve profitability higher than industry peers. Be it Porter's five forces model <ref type="bibr">(1980)</ref>, strategic conflict model <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Shapiro, 1989)</ref>, resource based theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barney, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Wernerfelt 1984)</ref> or be it the dynamic capabilities view <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Teece et al., 1997)</ref>, the deep rooted question is how firms can gain competitive advantage and achieve superior profitability in comparison to the competitors. A firm's competitive advantage manifests itself as superior firm level profitability in comparison to industry peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Teece, 2007)</ref>. In this study, the firm profitability dimension of competitive advantage as the eventual outcome of knowledge management was explored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Knowledge and Profitability</head><p>A large body of studies shows that tacit knowledge is considered to be a source of competitive advantage due to its inimitability and given its difficulty to be transferred <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Grant 1996b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sveiby, 1997)</ref>. Firms intensive on tacit knowledge management strategies are more long term focused, explorative, aggressive, innovation centred, better integrators of external and internal learning and are more profitable than other firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bierly and Chakrabarti, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>So, tacit knowledge acquisition, accumulation and learning yield the greatest potential for contributions to a firm's strategy and profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Teece et al., 1997)</ref>.</p><p>While tacit knowledge strategies are viewed to be profitable and leading up to competitive advantage, several authors think explicit knowledge has a much lesser impact on firm profitability in comparison to tacit knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Grant, 1996b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sveiby, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Teece et al., 1997)</ref>. Their predominant contention is that codified explicit knowledge is static and cannot be considered as knowledge at all <ref type="bibr">(Grimaldi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sveiby, 1997)</ref>. Several authors have stated that knowledge cannot reside outside an individual. Once codified and documented such knowledge becomes static and hence it needs to be interpreted and blended with personal knowledge to make it knowledge again <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Coakes, 2003)</ref>. In this sense, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hansen et al. (1999)</ref> argue that converting information to explicit knowledge through documentation and coding will not be effective and will not replicate the nuance and detail that are generally captured in face to face conversations. Firms intensive on explicit knowledge management strategies focus only on incremental learning and exploiting their current capabilities, are less aggressive, less innovative and are also less profitable than firm that are tacit knowledge focused <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bierly and Chakrabarti, 1996)</ref>. Further, explicit knowledge and operational management tools cannot be a source of competitive advantage for the organization as they do not have significant tacit component that makes them inimitable <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Teece, 2007)</ref>, facilitating at the most codification strategies and existing knowledge reuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alvesson and Kärreman, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Although many earlier studies viewed both tacit and explicit knowledge as inseparable <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hildreth and Kimble, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lai, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Nonaka and Von Krogh, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Polanyi, 1969)</ref>, part of the same continuum <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Craighead et al., 2009)</ref> and constantly interacting with one another <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Schoenherr et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Scully et al., 2013)</ref>, it is only recently that few studies show that explicit knowledge can also contribute to a firm's competitive advantage and profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(López-Nicolás and Meroño-Cerdán, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Vaccaro et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In this sense, this study advocates that while tacit knowledge is important, explicit knowledge is also very important for competitive advantage of firms; this is the first research gap this study has identified. To fill this research gap, the organizational learning theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(March, 1991)</ref> and dynamic capabilities theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(O'Reilly and Tushman, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Teece et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Teece, 2007)</ref> were used.</p><p>As already commented, the organizational learning theory prescribes two types of learning: exploration and exploitation. Exploration is experimentation with new ideas, alternatives and possibilities. It is futuristic where returns are distant, uncertain and often negative.</p><p>Exploitation is refinement and extension of existing paradigms, technologies and competencies, more to do with productivity and efficiency; its returns are predictable, proximate and positive <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(March, 1991)</ref>. While the focus in exploitation is achieving returns for the present, exploration is about preserving competitive advantage for the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(March, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">O'Reilly and Tushman, 2008)</ref>. Further, most firms focus too much on achieving profits for the present, resulting in their learning typology being excessively exploitation oriented; although such organizations could be successful for the present but self-destructive and unsustainable in the long run <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Govindarajan, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">O'Reilly and Tushman, 2008)</ref>. However, excessive focus on exploration is also a problem as exploitation is not only important for organizational well-being for the present, but also funds the high-risk exploration activity that makes organization sustainably successful over the longer term <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Govindarajan, 2016)</ref>. Hence, although exploration and exploitation compete for common organizational resources, the organizational learning theory advocates that both exploration and exploitation are important and a cautious balance is required for organizations to have a sustainable competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Govindarajan, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">March, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">O'Reilly and Tushman, 2008)</ref>. This study stretches exploration as a learning typology to Nonaka's (1994) 'socialization' ontology, which is highly tacit knowledge intensive, and exploitation as a learning typology to <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Nonaka's (1994)</ref> 'combination' ontology, which is highly explicit knowledge intensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(March, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Nonaka, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Popadiuk and Choo, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Nonaka (1994)</ref> conceived 'socialization' as a 'person to person' tacit knowledge exchange and 'combination' that necessitates conversion of new tacit elements of knowledge with existing explicit knowledge; his study also includes 'internalization' and 'externalization' as learning ontology completing the knowledge spiral. In essence <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Nonaka (1994)</ref> argues that with mere 'socialization' and without 'combination' the knowledge spiral will not work; in line with the principal that exploration alone will not be effective without exploitation, as in the organization learning theory paradigm.</p><p>The study then imports and links the dynamic capabilities literature to argue that sensing activities in capability building are exploratory learning in nature and akin to tacit knowledge and seizing activities is exploitative learning and is explicit knowledge intensive. Dynamic capabilities theory argues that firms must cautiously balance between sensing and seizing capabilities to achieve sustainable competitive advantage; sensing are creative activities that require external learning and ability to integrate such learning and knowledge which is highly tacit intensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Teece, 1998)</ref>. Further, exploration concerns search and discovery; it requires organizational flexibility and informality and hence is akin to tacit knowledge. Exploitation is about efficiency, productivity, certainty and variance control, and requires discipline and results in incremental improvement which is analogous to explicit knowledge. Additionally, seizing is about deploying organizational structures and procedures for seizing the opportunities that are sensed and shaped which is more akin to explicit knowledge that is documented and codified in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(O'Reilly and Tushman, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Teece, 1998)</ref>. Moreover, as sensing and seizing activities also compete for common organizational resources, the dynamic capability theory argues that both sensing and seizing are important and needs a cautious balance and co-existence for firms to have a sustainable competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Govindarajan, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">O'Reilly and Tushman, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Teece, 2007)</ref>. Given such close linkage that it has been established between organizational learning theory and dynamic capability theory, the study deduces that it is not only tacit knowledge that is important, explicit knowledge is also important in explaining firm profitability and both need to co-exist for competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Nonaka, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">O'Reilly and Tushman, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Teece et al., 1997)</ref>. The theoretical motivation fusing the four relevant theories highlighting the importance of explicit knowledge in explaining firm profitability is the first incremental contribution of this study.</p><p>At this point, it can be interesting to analyse if the linkage between exploration and exploitation, sensing and seizing and tacit and explicit knowledge gets reinforced from a customer and product innovation perspectives. In this sense, sensing, which is explorative in nature, can involve interpretations based on hunches and informed guesses related to new market opportunities and potential customer requirements which are highly tacit in nature.</p><p>Once such opportunities are sensed, seizing activities, which are exploitative in nature, become very important as involve establishing structured organizational routines, rules and procedures to seize such sensed opportunities, which are explicit knowledge intensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Teece, 1998)</ref>. Precisely, what is important to analyse is whether such tacit and explicit knowledge capabilities are equally important for achieving firm performance through both customer and product innovation capabilities.</p></div>

An organization's ability to innovate leads to competitiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Braganza et al., 1999)</ref>. In a context of intense global competition, where the market environment is increasingly dynamic and technological changes are developing at high speed, innovation is considered mandatory and a very important factor for organizations' survival (Seidler-de <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Alwis and Hartmann, 2008)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and conclusions</head><p>The results show that product innovation partially mediates the relationship between tacit and explicit knowledge and profitability (supporting H1 and H2). Hence, organizations achieve superior profitability from tacit and explicit knowledge either directly or through product innovation. The indirect effect of tacit and explicit knowledge on profitability through product innovation is greater than then the direct effect of tacit and explicit knowledge on firm profitability. This clearly demonstrates the importance of product innovation as a mediator variable and emphasizes that tacit and explicit knowledge indeed transforms into profitability through product innovation. The establishment of product innovation as a mediator variable is in line with the results of previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(López-Cabarcos et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">López-Nicolás and Meroño-Cerdán, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Vaccaro et al., 2010)</ref>. The study results also highlight that the effect of tacit knowledge on profitability through product innovation is greater than explicit knowledge transforming into profitability through product innovation; nevertheless, explicit knowledge also being a vital component in transforming knowledge to profitability through product innovation. The vitality of explicit knowledge in explaining profitability and competitive advantage which this study has uncovered is contrary to previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bierly and Chakrabarti, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Grant, 1996b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grimaldi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sveiby, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Teece et al., 1997)</ref>. Another fact that this study establishes is the coexistence of tacit and explicit knowledge for achieving competitive advantage, which is contrary to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hansen et al. (1999)</ref> but it is in line with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">López-Nicolás and Meroño-Cerdán (2011)</ref>, which shows the coexistence of codification and personalization strategies. Our results are also in line with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bollinger (2019)</ref>, who shows the importance of a 'balanced' managerial control having the right proportions of human interactions (which are tacit in nature), and information system tools (which are explicit knowledge intensive) to ensure the transformation of the firm's innovation initiatives into firm performance.</p><p>The results regarding the importance of explicit knowledge to achieve firm performance are in line with the strategies of management consulting companies operating in knowledge intensive industries, which make elaborate investments in explicit knowledge initiatives to improve organizational performance. They follow a 'people to document' approach, where knowledge is codified after being extracted from the person who develop it, stored regardless of who developed it, and reused for similar client engagements <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hansen et al., 1999)</ref>. In this sense, codification strategies can help maximize high quality reliable and fast reuse of codified knowledge across the organization with the aim to maximize organizational performance.</p><p>Having specified a robust model closely linking with two adjacent theories, the organizational learning theory and dynamic capabilities theory and confirming such model specification through the study results, it might be cautiously extended the interpretation that explicit knowledge, in line of exploitation as a learning typology and seizing as capability is very important for sustained competitive advantage. Further as documented in literature, exploitation and seizing activities are critical not only for the current success of the organization, but also for funding the exploration and sensing activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Govindarajan, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The need for coexistence of exploration and exploitation, sensing and seizing is also highlighted in the ambidexterity literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(O'Reilly and Tushman, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Teece, 1998)</ref>. The study thus draws a parallel to interpret that explicit knowledge is critical for current organizational profitability which potentially could fund the more complex tacit knowledge management activities of the firm. The study provides a clear linkage between knowledgebased theory, organizational learning theory and the dynamic capabilities view. This is the first incremental contribution of this study.</p><p>Emerging digital technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning are becoming major enablers of codifying and converting tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge within organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Schneider and Handali, 2019)</ref>. For example, the global consulting major Accenture views that more than eighty percent of data floating around are unstructured in nature and most often ignored and overlooked, thereby missing out on crucial insights.</p><p>Through its search and content analytics practice using machine learning and natural language processing, Accenture helps organizations to extract crucial insights which are highly tacit in nature and codify the same into explicit knowledge thereby unlocking value for organizations. Such algorithms as facilitators of explicit knowledge management is fast emerging <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Accenture, 2019)</ref>. Woodside, the Australian oil and gas major has codified close to million pages of documentation from historical reports, correspondence and experiences, creating explicit knowledge that deepens insights to the employees through user friendly search options. While employees used to spend 80 percent of their time researching problems and 20% fixing it, such explicit knowledge management has reversed that (IBM Woodside, 2019), demonstrating how explicit codified knowledge can improve employee productivity leading to profitability. It is clear that such digital technologies are shifting the knowledge dynamics and positioning explicit knowledge management as crucial for competitive advantage.</p><p>This study also shows that customer centricity partially mediates the relationship between tacit and explicit knowledge and profitability (supporting H3 and H4). So, besides product innovation, organizations achieve superior profitability from tacit and explicit knowledge either directly or through customer centricity, as well. The indirect effect of tacit and explicit knowledge on profitability through customer centricity is greater than its direct effect on firm profitability. Hence, customer centricity also comes out as a mediator variable thereby demonstrating that tacit and explicit knowledge transforms into profitability through customer centricity, as well. The results also highlight that although the effect of tacit knowledge on profitability through customer centricity is greater than explicit knowledge transforming into profitability through customer centricity, explicit knowledge is still a vital component in transforming knowledge to profitability through customer centricity. Bringing together two most relevant mediating variables, product innovation and customer centricity, and to specify a robust model that elucidates how tacit and explicit knowledge transform into firm profitability, is the second incremental contribution.</p><p>Explicit knowledge is already being viewed as crucial in the healthcare industry. IBM's Watson Explorer helps hospitals to extract key insights from unstructured patient medical history, physician notes and dictations to predict the risk of post-discharge complications and need for readmissions. This demonstrates the capture of tacit knowledge through digital technologies and codified in the form of predictive algorithms and explicit knowledge, thereby providing superior customer care in hospitals that use Watson Explorer <ref type="bibr">(Watson Explorer, 2019)</ref>. This increases the patient's willingness to pay resulting in increased competitive advantage of such hospitals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial implications and future research</head><p>This study attempts to answer the question on how managers can use knowledge strategies to achieve superior competitive position. The results demonstrate that tacit and explicit knowledge are both important for gaining competitive advantages. For organizations that are in the early stages of embracing a knowledge management model, explicit knowledge strategies can be easier to manage, implement and institutionalize in comparison to tacit knowledge strategies that require human component and intervention to succeed <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kruger and Johnson, 2010)</ref>. Considering this and given that both tacit and explicit knowledge are important to achieve superior product innovation, customer centricity and profitability, it would be recommended that managers create at first a robust explicit knowledge management system which can possibly provide positive results ahead of moving towards implementing tacit knowledge strategies. With the advent of digital technologies in the form of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms the importance of explicit knowledge is ballooning. In a sense, such digital technologies and algorithms are extracting deep customer insights and organizational experience that are highly tacit in nature and are codifying the same into explicit knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Holford, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Schneider and Handali, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>For organizations to tap the full potential of codified explicit knowledge, it must manage the obsolescence of the hardware in which such knowledge is stored <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barcelo-Valenzuela et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Coakes, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sveiby, 1997)</ref>. While digital recordings of disks, file systems and internet are prone to failure, emerging technologies like blockchain not only helps maintaining credible data storage solutions for inputs into artificial intelligence but can also host artificial intelligence advanced enough to work with its own data for advancing knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Sgantzos and Grigg, 2019)</ref>. Blockchain along with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms is hence expanding the horizon of explicit knowledge scope as a facilitator of knowledge creation and transfer. Given that the business impact in terms of performance to cost ratio is also lower for explicit knowledge strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Inuzuka and Nakamori, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">López-Nicolás and Meroño-Cerdánv, 2011)</ref>, organizations eventually need to become stronger in terms of tacit knowledge management capabilities, for which sound explicit knowledge management is inevitable and a precursor. This study does have certain limitations. While the variables used in the study are extremely important, but are not exhaustive; external variables like competitive rivalry and industry forces along with internal variables within the firm like managerial capabilities, organizational structure and operational excellence are some of the key variables that may have to be studied and their moderating behaviours understood. Further with the advent of digital technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and algorithmic analytics, there is an emerging view that human tacit knowledge can be extracted through special elicitation machine learning techniques thereby codifying tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Schneider and Handali, 2019)</ref>. However, other authors argue that codifying and converting tacit knowledge in terms of human creativity, heuristics and symbolic transformations into explicit knowledge is complex and is still far from reality <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Holford, 2019)</ref>. Linking knowledge management theory with emerging digital technologies to understand its implications on tacit and explicit knowledge provides scope for an interesting research agenda. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha, correlations, AVE and composite reliability Note: N = 153.
