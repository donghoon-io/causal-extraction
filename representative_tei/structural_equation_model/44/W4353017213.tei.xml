<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background Worldwide, 60% of people use social media.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Structural equation modeling showed the significant associations between BSMAS and DASS-21 (standardized coefficient [β] = 0.45; p &lt; 0.01) and between DASS-21 and YFAS 2.0 (β = 0.43; p &lt; 0.01). In addition, mediation effect with 100 bootstrapping samples showed the indirect effect of DASS-21 in the association between BSMAS and YFAS 2.0 Conclusions The present study details the relationships between social media addiction and psychological distress as well as food addiction. The results suggest the need for interventions aimed at reducing these negative outcomes.</p><p>Coping strategies for improving self-control or reducing weight-related stigma, such as food consumption monitoring or mindfulness, could be adopted for at-risk individuals to address these problems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>With the development of information technology, Internet-based social media networking has rapidly increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A recent report indicated that 59.3% of the total global population or approximately 4.7 billion people were social media users in 2022 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Both positive and negative effects of social media use have been found among social media users. Positive effects such as joy and relaxation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, information exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and increased physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> were found in some groups of social media users. However, negative social media effects such as psychological distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, excessive use <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and sedentary lifestyle <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> were also reported in small groups of individuals leading to poorer mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The group of individuals experiencing negative outcomes from social media use is considered to have a specific type of problematic Internet use (i.e., problematic social media use, <ref type="bibr">[PSMU]</ref>). The present study sought to build on several previous studies in the field <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> by focusing on social media use as individuals' recreational social interaction via online platforms, such as web sites or smartphone applications that contain user-generated content. The rapidly increasing number of social media users <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> has made PSMU a global issue that cannot be ignored.</p><p>PSMU is defined as the excessive interaction and networking on social media networking, to the extent that these behaviors impair other important activities such as education, work, interpersonal relationship, and/or psychological health and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Prior cross-sectional research has documented that PSMU was associated with poor sleep quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, psychological function <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, as well as other addictive behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Furthermore, some longitudinal research showed a prolonged influence of PSMU on increasing sleep disturbance, depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, even suicidal-related outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Among these negative influences, the association between PSMU and psychological distress (e.g., depression or anxiety) is well-reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. One study reported that psychological distress derived from PSMU is more likely to be developed via internal (e.g., loneliness) rather than external process (e.g., social isolation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. More specifically, individuals' self-regulation and use-expectation were reported to mediate the significant association between PSMU and depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In addition, individuals with PSMU reported sleep interruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> and lower physical activity level <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which may further worsen their mental health status <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. They also tend to engage in excessive self-comparison and prejudiced self-image <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, as a result of continually comparing themselves to the idealized portraits posted on social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. These physical and psychological impacts may exacerbate vulnerability and increase the risk of developing psychological distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Psychological health is one of the major health issues which may impair individuals' functional performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Individuals with mental health disturbances may be impaired in employment, educational, or relationship domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, subsequently exacerbating their perceived stress and risk of burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. For those with relatively poor emotional regulation, instinctive avoidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> of this unpleasant feeling may act as a coping strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and prompt the development of addictive behaviors such as problematic use of the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> or food addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Studies have reported a robust association between mental health symptoms and food addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Food addiction refers to individuals' uncontrollable desire to obtain food <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Specifically, as acts of comfort-seeking behavior, emotional eating and other disordered eating behaviors are commonly observed as a stress-alleviating strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. Psychological distress (e.g., depression or anxiety) is highly correlated to the development of food addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> due to increased vulnerability <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>There are more than 21.4 million (equal to 89.4% of the total population) social media users <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> in Taiwan in 2022, which is higher than global statistics (59.3%) in 2022 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Additionally, when compared to other age groups, young adults, especially those of university age <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, are much likelier to develop problematic Internet use, because university students may be living independently for the first time <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Without monitoring and supervision by parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, along with peer pressure to use technology and engage in social comparison behavior (i.e., comparing ourselves to others) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, university students may lose their boundaries or restrictions and become more vulnerable to developing addictive use (e.g., of the Internet or food intake) than older or younger peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. However, to the present authors' knowledge, currently there is no study investigating the potential association between social media addiction, psychological distress and food addiction. There is also a lack of research investigating the connections between problematic social media use and food addiction level among the Taiwanese population. Therefore, we proposed a model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) that aimed to investigate the relationship between social media addiction, psychological distress, and food addiction. Moreover, mediation effects of psychological distress were examined when the aforementioned relationships were tested. Accordingly, we hypothesized that (1) social media addiction is positively correlated to psychological distress; (2) psychological distress is positively associated with food addiction; (3) psychological distress mediates the relationship between social media addiction and food addiction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants who met the following inclusion criteria were recruited into the present study: (i) being 20 years old or above; (ii) registered in the program (either undergraduate or postgraduate regardless of study major) of any university in Taiwan when they completed the survey; (iii) had at least one active social media account (e.g., Facebook or Instagram); and (iv) able to read Chinese. The majority of participants were male students (65.38%) with a relatively young age (mean age = 22.8 years; SD = 3.75; ranged from 20 to 45) and an average body mass index (BMI) of 21.98 kg/m 2 (SD = 3.71). Specifically, 87 participants (14.5%) were defined as low weight (BMI lower than 18.5); 393 participants (65.7%) were defined as average weight (BMI ranged from 18.5 to 24.9); 118 participants (19.7%) were defined as high weight (BMI higher than 25.0) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics and social media usage</head><p>Demographics information was collected, including age, gender, along with weekly time spent on social media. Moreover, self-reported height and weight were used to calculate BMI (kg/m 2 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social media addiction</head><p>The Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> was used to assess social media addiction. The BSMAS contains 6 items with a 1 to 5 Likert-like scale (1 = seldom; 5 = very often). The item scores were summed to generate a total BSMAS score ranged from 5 to 30, with higher scores indicating more severe social media addiction. A sample item is "I feel an urge to use social media more and more". The psychometric properties (including construct validity, concurrent validity, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency) of the Chinese version of the BSMAS have been found satisfactory in prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and demonstrated an excellent internal consistency in the present study (Cronbach's alpha [α] = 0.96).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological distress</head><p>The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> was used to assess psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety and stress). The DASS-21 contains 21 items (seven items for each type of distress) with a 0 to 3 Likertlike scale (0 = never; 3 = almost always). In the present study, the overall psychological distress score was used. Therefore, the 21 item scores were summed and multiplied by 2 to generate a total score ranged from 0 to 126 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. A higher score indicates more severe psychological distress. A sample item is "I found it difficult to relax". The psychometric properties (including construct validity, concurrent validity, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency) of the Chinese version of DASS-21 have been found satisfactory in prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and demonstrated an excellent internal consistency in the present study (α = 0.98).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Food addiction</head><p>The Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (YFAS 2.0) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> was used to assess food addiction. The YFAS 2.0 contains 35 items with a 0 to 7 Likert-like scale (0 = never; 7 = everyday). YFAS 2.0 adopted an unique scoring method <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> with the 35 items converted into 11 symptoms with a 0-1 dichotomous scale (0 indicates non-endorsed; 1 indicates endorsed) to obtain a total scores ranging from 0 to 11. A higher score suggests a more severe level of food addiction. A sample item is "I have problems with my family and friends because of how much I ate". The psychometric properties (including construct validity, concurrent validity, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency) of the Chinese version of the YFAS 2.0 have been found satisfactory in prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, with good internal consistency in the present study (α = 0.87).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>An online survey hosted on Google Forms was distributed using snowball sampling from August to September, 2021. More specifically, the survey link was sent to various university departments and those who received the survey link were encouraged to disseminate the survey information via the weblink or QR code. The consent form was shown on the first page of the online survey. By clicking the "agree" icon indicated the participants gave their informed consent to participate in the present study. In addition, the participants received 100 New Taiwan dollars reimbursement (approximately $3.3 US) after they completed all the survey questions. The present study was approved by the Institutional Review Board in the Chi Mei Medical Center (IRB Serial No.: 11007-006) and the Human Research Ethics Committee in the National Cheng Kung University (Approval No.: NCKU 144 HREC-E-109-551-2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>Demographics and the scores on the three measures were first summarized using descriptive analysis. Then, the correlation coefficients between variables were computed using Pearson's correlation. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with the estimator of diagonally weighted least squares was used to examine whether the data fit with the proposed models. Because the proposed models contained mediation effect, 100 bootstrapping samples were set to examine the mediation effect. Fit indices of comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) were used to verify if the model was supported. The levels of both CFI and TLI should be &gt; 0.95 and those of RMSEA and SRMR should be &lt; 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. In addition, a total of 2 competing models considering the present of different direct effects were illustrated for model comparisons. The model with lower expected cross validation index (ECVI) is suggested to be the best fitting model. A conceptual model for SEM testing is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and the following describes the structures of the 2 competing models. Model 1: Model without correlation between social media addiction and food addiction; Model 2: Based on Model 1 with one additional correlation between social media addiction and food addiction (this is also the proposed model with all the hypotheses mentioned in the Introduction). The SEM was performed using the lavaan package in the R software <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and the remaining data analyses were performed using the SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Corp., NY: Armonk).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present study investigated the potential mechanism by which social media addiction is associated with food addiction among Taiwan university students, and the findings supported all hypotheses. The results showed the significant associations between social media addiction, psychological distress and food addiction, in which mediation effects of psychological distress was significant. Among the two competing models, Model 2 outperformed Model 1. Model 2 performed better because it contains all the hypotheses and an additional correlation between social media addiction and food addiction. Therefore, the correlation between social media addiction and food addiction could be mediated via psychological distress.  The level of social media addiction was significantly associated with individuals' psychological distress in the present study. Previous studies reported that among different types of problematic use of the Internet, PSMU has the most salient effect on dysregulating emotional management <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. More specifically, individuals with poor psychological well-being tend to adopt social media use as a coping strategy and may feel compelled to frequent use in order to avoid their problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. The situation becomes a vicious circle, because the behavior of using social media as a form of avoidance may increase vulnerability of individuals to developing PSMU <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. In turn, the addictive behavior continues to degrade their psychological health <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, which results in a higher level of addictive behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. This pattern was supported by the present finding. Other studies additionally suggested a causal link between PSMU and depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> and demonstrated that it is "the number of used social media platforms" rather than "the total used time", that is associated with psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, and body image <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. The results suggest that more detailed consideration is needed for the investigation of potential social media factors that promote psychological distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</p><p>The significant association between psychological distress and food addiction found in the present study corroborate previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. Two issues may contribute to this association: (1) lack of control over eating and (2) weight stigma. Self-control skills could be a potential explanation for the association <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> because lack of self-control can result in impulsivity and contribute to food addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Psychological distress (e.g., resulting from receiving negative information from social media) may trigger excessive emotional eating to cope with stress, which could result in food addiction, particularly in the presence of poor self-control skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>.</p><p>Another important factor explaining our finding is weight-related stigma. The correlation between weightrelated stigma and food addiction had been well-reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. For example, the fear of being stigmatized predicted greater food addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Additionally, weight stigmatization may cause psychological distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Furthermore, the internalization of weight-related stigma and psychological distress may exacerbate the relationship between weight stigma and disordered eating <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Social media addiction may increase body dissatisfaction and lead to the internalization of weight-related stigma, which may result in the psychological distress and further amplify food addiction. Indeed, our findings showed that social media addiction was associated with psychological distress and food addiction. Therefore, interventions such as psychological acceptance or mindfulness therapy may reduce the negative impact of weight stigmatization <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>.</p><p>The present study demonstrated a possible mechanism of PSMU in relation to food addiction among university students, which included the involvement of psychological distress. However, the present study had several limitations. First, the self-reported variables may be subject to social desirability bias (e.g., participants might have underestimated their social media usage) or recall bias (e.g., participants might not accurately remember their height and weight). Second, the unique characteristics of this university sample may limit generalizability to populations with different age. Third, the cross-sectional design of the present study cannot test the causal directionality of this mechanism and a longitudinal study is merited to provide more information. Despite that, the present findings still provided evidence of the possible negative correlates of social media addiction. Strategies aimed at promoting emotional regulation, self-control skills or reducing the weight stigma, such as mindfulness exercises <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>, cognitive restructuring <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, or food consumption monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, can be taught to the individuals with social media addiction, to lower these unwanted consequential effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The present study investigated the potential mechanism of social media addiction in relation to food addiction among Taiwanese university students. The results showed an association between social media addiction and psychological distress, with psychological distress linked to food addiction. The present study suggests several important negative correlates of social media addiction. Interventions to reduce social media addiction and food addiction might alleviate the negative consequences of these behaviors. Strategies to improve self-control skills or reduce weight stigmatization, such as foodintake monitoring, mindfulness and cognitive restructuring, can be taught to individuals with food addiction to neutralize its negative consequences. </p></div>
