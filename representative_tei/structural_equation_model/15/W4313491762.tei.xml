<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A digital business model is a way of generating value based on the creation of client advantages using digital technology. The goal of the digital solution is to provide a signi cant advantage that customers are willing to pay for. For businesses facing digital disruption and digitization, developing digital business models is a crucial responsibility. A global platform for communication, the Internet is rapidly being utilized as a cutting-edge tool for product and service marketing. A competitive threat to conventional retail establishments, online digital market platforms have many bene ts over traditional shopping methods. Consumers are quickly embracing internet shopping around the world, and Ethiopia is no exception. Online digital market platform marketers and retailers can further expand their marketing strategies to draw in and keep customers in order to gain a competitive edge globally if they are aware of the elements in uencing consumers' purchasing intentions.</p><p>Due to the scarcity of published research on the variables in uencing Ethiopian consumers' intention to purchase online, there is a conceptual gap in the literature on online digital marketing. By identifying the crucial variables impacting Ethiopian consumers' desire to purchase on online digital market platforms, this study aims to close this conceptual gap in the context of online market platform purchasing.</p><p>The information was gathered from 100 Ethiopian, Addis Ababa University, nal year engineering students using a self-administered 5-point Likert scale questionnaire. The partial least square structural model (PLS-SEM) technique was used to examine the data. The results of this study highlighted ve crucial decision-making elements that have an impact on Ethiopian consumers' intention to buy on online digital market platforms including Website Design, Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Trust, and Subjective Norm. With the use of this information, manufacturers, online marketers, and retailers can create effective market strategies, enhance technology, and make smart marketing choices that will help them gain global competitive advantage.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A business model describes how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Osterwalder et al., 2005)</ref>. In both theory and practice, the term "business model" refers to a wide range of informal and formal descriptions that represent the fundamental elements of an organization or business, such as the mission, business process, target market, offerings, strategies, infrastructure, organizational structures, sourcing, trading practices, operational processes and policies, including culture. Business models are used to describe and categorize enterprises, particularly in an entrepreneurial setting, but they are also used by managers within corporations to investigate opportunities for future development. Popular business models can serve as guidelines for innovative managers (Baden-Fuller &amp; Morgan, 2010).</p><p>Business strategy includes the development and change of business models, which is often referred to as business model innovation. Organizations are becoming more aware that achieving their sustainability goals requires innovation on a business model level as well as new technologies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Geissdoerfer et al., 2017)</ref>. When an organization creates a new business model, the process is called business model innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Osterwalder et al., 2005)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chesbrough, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The way technology is employed nowadays may determine the kind of company concepts. For instance, online business owners have developed brand-new business models that are wholly dependent on current or developing technology. Businesses may reach a lot of people for little money by using technology.</p><p>Additionally, strategic sourcing, complicated supply chains, and shifts to collaborative, relational contracting structures are now part of business models due to the increase of outsourcing and globalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wiener et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The growth of platforms as a business model is producing global disruption by destroying the status quo across industries and boundaries. The way we interact and conduct our everyday lives in this new corporate environment is vastly different from what it was less than a decade ago. The client is increasingly approaching company with a digital rst attitude. A tailored experience that is real-time, integrated, and seamless has become the standard. All of this leads to quick improvements in products and services, which necessitate exible business models capable of meeting the demand. This is precisely what platform as a company wants to give. The emphasis has shifted to facilitating business relationships among participants and role-players. These participants and role-players can communicate across industries, share products and services within industries, or focus only on providing best-in-class products and services inside a single rm within that industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Deloitte, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>A digital business model is a method of creating value focused on the production of customer bene ts via the use of digital technologies. The digital solution's purpose is to deliver a considerable bene t for which clients are ready to pay. Developing digital business models is a critical task for rms confronting digital disruption and digitalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Teece &amp; Linden, 2017)</ref> .</p><p>The Internet, as a worldwide communication platform, is fast becoming a cutting-edge instrument for product and service marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dwivedi et al., 2021)</ref>. Because of the internet, the traditional nature of retail purchasing has received a new dimension. Online digital market platforms, a competitive challenge to established retail enterprises, provide several advantages over traditional purchasing techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ennew et al., 2005)</ref>. Consumers all across the world are fast adopting internet shopping, and Ethiopia is no different. Marketers and merchants on online digital market platforms can further develop their marketing tactics to attract and retain customers in order to achieve a competitive advantage internationally if they are aware of the factors in uencing consumers' purchase intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ennew et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Online purchasing on digital market platforms is increasingly becoming a popular purchasing strategy for clients globally. However, internet purchasing is not as common in Ethiopia. Understanding the variables in uencing Ethiopian consumers' purchasing behavior is vital information for organizations that have already invested in online shopping, as it allows them to design stronger marketing tactics to turn potential customers into active ones. From a global standpoint, if corporations can enhance their awareness of Ethiopian customers' online purchasing preferences before entering the Ethiopian online market, the information can raise the probability of success. As a result, the primary goal of this study was to investigate the drivers of Ethiopian consumers' online market purchasing intention.</p><p>2. Theoretical Framework, Related Literature, And Hypothesis Development</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)</head><p>The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is a theory of information systems that describes how people come to accept and use technology. TAM seeks to assist academics and practitioners in determining why a certain technology or system may be acceptable or unsuitable and in taking appropriate steps by offering explanation in addition to prediction (LAI, 2016).</p><p>The real system usage is the point at which people interact with technology. People utilize technology because of their behavioral intentions. The attitude, which is the broad perception of the technology, in uences the behavioral intention (BI). According to the concept, when consumers are faced with new technology, a variety of variables impact their decision about how and when to use it, most notably perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease-of-use (PEOU) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Davis, 1989)</ref>. External elements such as social in uence have a signi cant role in determining attitude. People will have the attitude and intention to use technology once these items are in place <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Davis, 1989)</ref>.</p><p>The TAM has been continuously studied and expanded the two major upgrades being the TAM 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Venkatesh &amp; Davis, 2000)</ref> and the uni ed theory of acceptance and use of technology (or UTAUT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Venkatesh et al., 2003b)</ref> ). A TAM 3 has also been proposed in the context of E-commerce with an inclusion of the effects of trust and perceived risk on system use <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Venkatesh &amp; Bala, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Despite its widespread use, TAM has been heavily criticized, prompting the original proposers to seek to reinterpret it multiple times. TAM's critics point to its poor heuristic value, low explanatory and predictive capacity, triviality, and lack of practical utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chuttur, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Theories of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior</head><p>The two closely associated theories the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) developed by Martin Fishbein and Icek Ajzen in 1967 and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref> suggest that a person's intention to perform a behavior (behavioral intention) is predicted by 1) a person's attitude toward the behavior, and 2) subjective norms regarding the behavior. Subjective norms are the outcome of a person's perceived control over their conduct as well as their social and environmental circumstances. In general, positive attitudes and subjective norms improve perceived control and the likelihood of intentions in uencing behavioral changes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Perceived usefulness (PU)</head><p>This was de ned by Fred Davis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Davis, 1989)</ref> as the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance their job performance. It denotes whether or not someone considers the technology to be bene cial for the task at hand. Within the context of online purchasing, we may infer that the individual behavioral intention of online purchasers believes that the system will be advantageous in their personal life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Davis, 1989)</ref> showed that the capacity to attract and keep online customers is mostly dependent on the technology's usability and usefulness. The perceived utility of online shopping applications or tools can also impact whether online customers continue to purchase online or rely on traditional ways. When it comes to online purchasing, perceived usefulness refers to how much a person feels that engaging in online transactions would improve his or her performance.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sin et al., 2012)</ref> showed the effect of perceived usefulness on online purchase intentions. Hence based on TAM and empirical evidence from literature the following hypothesis has been done. H1: Perceived usefulness positively and signi cantly affects online purchase intention of consumers.</p><p>2.4 Perceived ease-of-use (PEOU) Davis described this as the degree to which a person feels that utilizing a speci c system will be painless <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Davis, 1989)</ref>. When technology is simple to use, obstacles are reduced. No one is going to like it if it is di cult to use and has a complicated feature. In an online purchasing setting, we may infer that the unique behavioral purpose of customers buying online re ects their trust in the ease with which they can order products online.</p><p>Davis stated that PEOU has a causal effect on PU, which is con rmed by several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Venkatesh &amp; Davis, 2000)</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Athapaththu &amp; Kulathunga, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Celik, 2014)</ref>. PEOU can have a substantial direct in uence on PU since, when choosing between two systems that execute the same set of operations, a user should prefer the one that is simpler to use <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Davis, 1989)</ref>.</p><p>According to Davis, among the multiple components mentioned in his model, judgments of ease of use have a considerable effect on perceived usefulness; a crucial predictor of one's inclination to adopt new technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Venkatesh et al., 2003b)</ref>. Simply said, perceived ease of use impacts perceived utility, which in uences the consumer's propensity to purchase online. Online consumers consider online buying to be simple if it gives su cient product information, facilitates product/service comparison, has simple to learn and use apps, and has sites that are simple to use and exible to engage with.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sin et al., 2012)</ref> showed the signi cant effect of perceived ease of use on online purchase intentions and Perceived Usefulness. Therefore, based on literature review and TAM the following hypnoses had been formulated. H2: Perceived Ease of Use has a positive effect on online purchase intention H3: Perceived Ease of Use has a positive effect on Perceived Usefulness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Many literatures including (Akar</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Subjective Norm</head><p>The subjective norm is the belief that the majority of people accept or disapprove of the activity. It refers to a person's opinions regarding whether peers and important individuals in his or her life believe he or she should engage in the conduct <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. According to Icek Ajezen's theory of planned behavior, subjective norm affects the behavioral intention of an individual. Many researchers including <ref type="bibr">(Dewi et al., 2020c</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sin et al., 2012)</ref> studied the effect of subjective norm on purchase intention of consumers. Hence the following hypotheses have been done. H4: Subjective norm affects online purchase intention of consumers positively and signi cantly. H5: Subjective norm affects perceived usefulness</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Trust</head><p>Because the core of commerce is the building of mutual trust, trust is a key aspect in every partnership. As consumers and sellers perform transactions without seeing each other in the online platform business, trust plays an important part in the implementation of the shopping as well as the longevity of the connection. The process of developing trust concludes with the maintenance of the achieved security. At this point, visitors are increasingly interested with brand and search mechanism technology, which eventually leads to intrinsic trust as part of buy intent <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Athapaththu &amp; Kulathunga, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In the context of online commerce, trust is de ned as a consumer's readiness to rely on the seller and act in situations when such action renders the consumer susceptible to the seller. Because the degree of uncertainty in a transaction in a virtual environment is larger than in a traditional one, trust becomes a crucial consideration. Trust should be an especially important feature in an online situation when the consumer has no direct in uence over the vendor's behavior. One of the primary reasons people avoid conducting commercial transactions on the internet is a lack of trust in online rms. As a result, the buyer's sentiments of trust toward an online vendor are a key determinant in determining his/her intents to use and online usage patterns.</p><p>Many researchers including <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Athapaththu &amp; Kulathunga, 2018)</ref> studied the positive relationship between trust and online purchase intention of consumers. Accordingly, the following hypothesis has been made. H6: Trust affects the consumers' online purchase intention positively and signi cantly. H7: Trust affects the consumers' perceived ease of use of online platform H8: Trust affects consumer's perceived usefulness of the online platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">Website Design</head><p>Website is the main communication channel between online service providers and consumers. A highquality website can result in satis ed customers and help turn web browsers into buyers. According to a study <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Afshardost, 2013)</ref>, the point of view of customers about website quality is based on features in a website that meet customers' needs, requirement and attracted to the total excellence of that website. Website design refers to the qualities and appearance of a website that ful ll and meet the expectations of online consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hasanov &amp; Khalid, 2015)</ref>. The in uence of web design and elements in uencing online purchasing behavior, as well as issues preventing consumers from purchasing online. If the web design is not user pleasant, di cult to access, or complicated, the buyer may seek out another userfriendly web design online shopping website.</p><p>Based on a group of researchers, website features have an important role on online purchase decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mansori et al., 2012</ref>). An informative website helps and assists customers to differentiate and evaluate product choices, differences and will increase customer satisfaction and contributing to online purchase decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Masoudi et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In the e-commerce market, web design has been an important role in positively in uencing consumers to shop online with satisfaction and more con dently <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hanjaya et al., 2019</ref>)(Wang Nee, 2019)(Ali, 2016)(LAI, 2016) excluding <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Halim, 2013)</ref>. Based on the empirical evidence in the literature the following hypotheses have been formulated H9: Web Design has a positive impact on consumers' perceived usefulness of online platform H10: Web Design has a positive impact on consumers' perceived ease of usefulness of online platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8">Purchase intention</head><p>Purchase intention is the likelihood that a buyer will purchase a product or service. Evaluating purchase intention entails combining data from several sources to determine which variables have the most in uence. The information is utilized to develop marketing plans as well as to ne-tune messaging across various communication and marketing platforms. One signi cant purpose of measuring purchase intent is to learn how effective an o ine or online media campaign is and whether the money spent on marketing activities provides an acceptable return on investment.</p><p>Purchase intention of the online shopper is the nal stage, after various prompts of the online shopper <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Athapaththu &amp; Kulathunga, 2018)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Indiani &amp; Fahik, 2020)</ref>, the nal stage of online transaction is intention to use a website and purchase a product. As a result, online purchase intent is critical in determining online customer behavior. Purchase intent is a state that exists between a consumer and a seller when the customer is ready to enter into a transaction with the seller. Purchase intention is described as a consumer's desire to purchase an item or service because the shopper has an intention to locate a certain item or bene t or has a favorable attitude toward, or even a favorable opinion of the product or service.</p></div>

Design (PD), Trust (TR), Subjective Norm (SN), Perceived Usefulness (PU), and Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU). In analyzing the link between dependent and independent factors, the dependent variable is Purchase Intention (PI) on the online platform, while the independent variables are PD, TR, SN, PU, and PEOU. Furthermore, PD and TR are exogenous factors, but SN, PU, and PEOU are endogenous and exogenous (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>.1).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Sample size and Sampling procedures</head><p>The sampling technique applied for this research is purposive sampling. The key informants for this study were selected based on their online purchase experience. To determine the minimum number of data required for analysis using PLS-SEM(Kock &amp; Hadaya, 2018; Ranatunga et al., 2020) Produced a table for researchers to determine the sample size of their research using partial least square (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM). This procedure was given the name R-Squared minimum technique. The minimal sample size is determined by three factors. The rst component is the number of arrows pointing at the latent variable. The second element is the chosen signi cance level, while the third element is the model's minimal R 2 . There are four arrows pointing to a construct in this study model (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>.1). The signi cance level used is 5%. The minimum R 2 in this model is 0. 25. Therefore, referring Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.1 this research required 65 samples to reach 80% prediction power for identifying R 2 values of at least 0.25 with a 5% chance of error. The researchers believe that the collected 100 data is pretty good more than the minimum requirement.  The goal of the study was made apparent throughout data collection, and respondents' agreement was ensured using o cial letters issued from the School of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Addis Ababa Institute of Technology, Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia. The questionnaire was peer reviewed and pilot tested prior to data collection. Based on the input, the questionnaire was adjusted and enhanced, such as by removing unnecessary questions and enhancing question clarity. Finally, the measurement model's reliability was veri ed using SPSS version 26 software, and the results reveal that Cronbach's alpha is larger than 0.70 and above, which is over the permissible cut-off mark <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cronbach, 1951)</ref>. In the end, the nal questionnaire (see Appendix-A) was distributed to the target sample of 115 respondents. Among distributed questionnaires 100 collected showing the response rate to be 86.95%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">The study area and timeframe</head><p>The research was carried out in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It took into account the 115 nal-year engineering students from Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia. The data gathering period lasted from May 2022 through June 2022.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Data collection and processing</head><p>Following the creation of the conceptual model for the research (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>.1), the questionnaire for data collection was designed. The questionnaire is divided into two pieces. Section 1 contains information regarding the respondents' demographic characteristics, whereas Section 2 addresses questions about the factors of consumers' online purchase intention from digital market platform. There was a total of 100 valid replies. Following that, the data was analyzed using the Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach. PLS-SEM has exceptional capability for working with small samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hair et al., 2021)</ref>. It is one of the most widely used methods of multivariate data analysis. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.1 contains the respondent pro le and associated information, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.2 has the mean and standard deviations, and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.3 contains the correlations between the variables. Furthermore, because there were several independent factors (exogenous) and dependent variables (endogenous), Partial least Square Structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) path analysis was utilized in this study to investigate the main effect and mediation hypotheses.</p><p>As a consequence, Table <ref type="table">5</ref>.1 displays the results of the construct reliability, validity, and collinearity tests. Table <ref type="table">5</ref>.2 displays the results of the Discriminant Validity test. Path coe cients are shown in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>.3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b. Structural Model cients</head><p>After the PLS-SEM algorithm, estimates are obtained for the structural model relationships (i.e., the path coe cients), which represent the hypothesized relationships among the constructs. The path coe cients have standardized values between - 1 and + 1. Estimated path coe cients close to + 1 represent strong positive relationships (and vice versa for negative values) that are almost always statistically signi cant (i.e., different from zero in the population). The closer the estimated coe cients are to 0, the weaker the relationships. Very low values close to 0 are usually non-signi cant (i.e., not signi cantly different from zero)(Joseph F. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hair et al., 2013)</ref>. Whether a coe cient is signi cant ultimately depends on its standard error that is obtained by means of bootstrapping. When the empirical "t" value is larger than the critical value, we say that the coe cient is signi cant at a certain error probability (i.e., signi cance level). Commonly used critical values for two tailed tests are 1 .65 (signi cance level = 10%), 1.96 (signi cance level = 5% ), and 2.57 (signi cance level = 1 % )(Joseph F. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hair et al., 2013)</ref> for this research the ritical value used was 1.96 (signi cance level = 5%).</p><p>The path analysis result shows that all paths have a positive relationship with their dependent variable (See Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.1 and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.6); however, not all variables are statistically signi cant. As indicated by the bootstrapping results of PLS-SEM in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.6: The effect of PU, PEOU, SN, TR, and WD on PI is positive and signi cant whereas the effect of PEOU and TR on PU are insigni cantly positive. The effect of SN&amp; WD on PU is positive and signi cant. The effect of TR&amp;WD ON PEOU is signi cantly positive (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.6). The hypotheses H1, H2, H4, H5, H6, H8, H9, and H10 were supported but hypotheses H3 and H7 were not supported.  In addition to evaluating the R 2 values of all endogenous constructs, the change in the R 2 value when a speci ed exogenous construct is omitted from the model can be used to evaluate whether the omitted construct has a substantive impact on the endogenous constructs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Conclusion</head><p>The major nding of this research provides empirical evidence towards determinates of consumers' purchase intention on digital market. The data were collected from 100 Addis Ababa University nal year engineering students who have online purchase experience. It was analyzed using descriptive statistics and PLS-SEM.</p><p>From the ndings of descriptive statistics many of the respondents were male and aged between 20-25 from electrical engineering department. The multivariate inferential statistics analysis using Partial Lease Square Structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) showed that the major determinants of consumers' purchase intention on digital market platform are Subjective Norm (SN), Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), Perceived (PU), Website Design (WD), and Trust (TR) consecutively. Subjective norm found to be the major determinate. The least effective determinant was Trust. The effect of all determinants was signi cantly positive. The coe cient of determinant (R 2 = 0.676) to PI shows that the proposed research e. Blindfolding and Predictive Relevance Q 2</p><p>In addition to evaluating the magnitude of the R 2 values as a criterion of predictive accuracy, researchers should also examine Stone-Geisser's Q 2 value <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Geisser, 1974)</ref>. This measure is an indicator of the model's predictive relevance.</p><p>The Q 2 values that are greater than 0 indicate that the exogenous constructs have predictive relevance for the endogenous construct under consideration. The values of 0.02, 0.15, and 0.35, respectively, imply that an exogenous construct has a small, medium, or large predictive relevance for a given endogenous construct as a relative measure of predictive relevance (Q 2 )(Geisser, 1974)(Joseph F. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hair et al., 2013)</ref>. model was able to explain 67.6% of the variation on consumers' online digital platform purchase intention (PI) showing the hypothetical model have high prediction power.</p><p>By identifying the crucial variables impacting Ethiopian consumers' desire to purchase on online digital market platforms, this study closed the conceptual gap in the context of online market platform purchasing.</p><p>The novelty of this study lies in its detailed examination of the relationship between determinants of consumers' purchase intention as Ethiopian context by developing a new conceptual model quite different from the other researchers. The usage of PLS-SEM analysis method for inferential statistics analysis to determine the direct, indirect, and total effect of independent variables on dependent variables makes this study unique as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Recommendation</head><p>With the emergence of digital market platform systems, many rms are confronted with critical di culties regarding their customers' technological acceptability. Because customers are so important to an organization's bottom line, companies must examine consumers' perspectives on their desire to utilize the digital market platform system.</p><p>These research ndings have several management rami cations for various online digital market platform businesses in Ethiopia. Respondents in this study want to utilize the online digital market platform because their key people use it, they believe the online platform is easy to use, the website is of excellent quality, and they trust the digital market platform.</p><p>Understanding the major factors of customer purchasing behavior is a valuable management decisionmaking input. With the use of this information, manufacturers, online marketers, and retailers can create effective market strategies, enhance technology, and make smart marketing choices that will help them gain global competitive advantage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Research Contribution</head><p>The major contribution of this study is providing an improved understanding of the consumers' decisionmaking process as it relates to online digital market platform shopping decisions in Ethiopian context using a new conceptual model based on previous literatures and theories. A theoretical research model of the factors that are predicted to in uence consumers' decisions to shop or not shop online has been developed for this study.</p><p>The information on the decision factors obtained from the empirical analysis will bene t future researchers who study consumer behavior in the online digital market platform industry. Moreover, this contribution is especially important as there is only limited published empirical research on the online shopping behavior of Ethiopian consumers.   </p><note type="other">Figures Figure 1</note></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3.1 depicts the conceptual research model created in this study.

To establish convergent validity, the factor loading of the indicator, composite reliability (CR) and the average variance extracted (AVE) have to be considered (Hair, J. F., Hult, G. T. M., Ringle, C. M., &amp; Sarstedt, 2017). The value ranges from 0 to 1. AVE value should exceed 0.50, Composite Reliability (CR) and the indicator's outer loadings should be higher than 0.708 so that it is adequate for convergent validity(Henseler et  al., 2009a)(Ab Hamid et al., 2017) (Joseph F. Hair et 2013).As shown in Table 4.4 the values of AVE are greater than 0.5. The factor loading and Composite Reliability (CR)values are &gt; 0.708 showing the convergent validity of the measurement model.d. Discriminant ValidityDiscriminant validity is the extent to which a construct is truly distinct from other constructs by empirical standards. Thus, establishing discriminant validity implies that a construct is unique and captures phenomena not represented by other constructs the model. The Fornell-Larcker criterion is a conservative approach to assessing discriminant validity. It compares the square root of the AVE values with the latent variable correlations. Speci cally, the square root of each construct's AVE should be greater than its highest correlation with any other construct. This criterion can also be stated as the AVE should exceed the squared correlation with any other construct. The logic of this method is based on the idea that a construct shares more variance with its associated indicators than with any other construct</figDesc><table><row><cell>Latent Variable</cell><cell cols="3">Indicators Loadings Collinearity</cell><cell>Construct</cell><cell>Composite</cell><cell>Average</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Statistics</cell><cell>Reliability</cell><cell>Reliability</cell><cell>Variance</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>(VIF)</cell><cell></cell><cell>Cronbach's</cell><cell>(CR)</cell><cell>Extracted</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Alpha (a)</cell><cell></cell><cell>(AVE)</cell></row><row><cell>Web Design</cell><cell>WD1</cell><cell>0.778</cell><cell>1.654</cell><cell>0.841</cell><cell>0.887</cell><cell>0.613</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>WD3</cell><cell>0.804</cell><cell>2.342</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>WD4</cell><cell>0.786</cell><cell>2.048</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>WD5</cell><cell>0.657</cell><cell>1.402</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>WD6</cell><cell>0.875</cell><cell>2.510</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Perceived</cell><cell>PU1</cell><cell>0.792</cell><cell>2.653</cell><cell>0.920</cell><cell>0.924</cell><cell>0.668</cell></row><row><cell>Usefulness</cell><cell>PU3</cell><cell>0.808</cell><cell>2.369</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>PU4</cell><cell>0.816</cell><cell>2.223</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>PU5</cell><cell>0.875</cell><cell>2.790</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>PU6</cell><cell>0.806</cell><cell>2.360</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>PU7</cell><cell>0.807</cell><cell>1.899</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Perceived Ease</cell><cell>PEOU2</cell><cell>0712</cell><cell>1.656</cell><cell>0.824</cell><cell>0.876</cell><cell>0.586</cell></row><row><cell>of Use</cell><cell>PEOU3</cell><cell>0.740</cell><cell>1.659</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>PEOU6</cell><cell>0.771</cell><cell>1.851</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>PEOU7</cell><cell>0.836</cell><cell>2.119</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>PEOU8</cell><cell>0.764</cell><cell>1.758</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Trust</cell><cell>TR1</cell><cell>0.672</cell><cell>1.216</cell><cell>0.815</cell><cell>0.870</cell><cell>0.575</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>TR2</cell><cell>0.651</cell><cell>1.426</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>TR3</cell><cell>0.810</cell><cell>2.170</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>TR4</cell><cell>0.810</cell><cell>2.161</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>TR5</cell><cell>0.828</cell><cell>2.425</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Subjective</cell><cell>SN1</cell><cell>0.706</cell><cell>1.942</cell><cell>0.768</cell><cell>0.840</cell><cell>0.516</cell></row><row><cell>Norm</cell><cell>SN2</cell><cell>0.779</cell><cell>2.100</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>SN3</cell><cell>0.852</cell><cell>2.122</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>SN5</cell><cell>0.609</cell><cell>2.628</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>SN6</cell><cell>0.614</cell><cell>3.110</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Purchase</cell><cell>PI1</cell><cell>0.807</cell><cell>1.849</cell><cell>0.824</cell><cell>0.876</cell><cell>0.586</cell></row><row><cell>Intention</cell><cell>PI2</cell><cell>0.801</cell><cell>1.816</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>PI3</cell><cell>0.813</cell><cell>1.960</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>PI5</cell><cell>0.741</cell><cell>1.706</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>PI6</cell><cell>0.760</cell><cell>1. 681</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">b.

Due to limitation of time, budget and effort this research focused on 100 purposely selected nal year Addis Ababa university engineering students who have online purchase experience. Accordingly, it is di cult to generalize the research nding to the other sectors. Only ve variables including Subjective norm (SN), perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived usefulness (PU), website design (WD), and trust (TR) have been tested to see the effect of the variables on consumers' intention to purchase on online digital market platform.</p><p>Future studies should focus on enlarging the coverage of the respondents within appropriated sampling technique to get generalizable result. More variables should be tested to clearly understand consumers' behavior towards online digital market platform purchase intention. </p></div>
