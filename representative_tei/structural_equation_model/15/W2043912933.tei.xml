<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The twenty-first century has been marked by the emergence of corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a central topic for scholars and practitioners <ref type="bibr">(Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2012: 243;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Scherer &amp; Palazzo, 2011)</ref>. Research has shown that CSR, defined as the "context-specific organizational actions and policies that take into account stakeholders' expectations and the triple bottom line of economic, social, and environmental performance" <ref type="bibr">(Aguinis, 2011: 855)</ref>, contributes to the firm's competitive advantage in terms of creating shared value <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Porter &amp; Kramer, 2006)</ref>, enhancing intangible resources and firm capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(McWilliams &amp; Siegel, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Surroca, Tribó, &amp; Waddock, 2010)</ref>, and influencing stakeholders' behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Barnett, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bosse, Phillips, &amp; Harrison, 2009)</ref>. Meta-analyses confirm this insight, revealing a small but positive link between CSR and financial performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Margolis, Elfenbein, &amp; Walsh, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Orlitzky, Schmidt, &amp; Rynes, 2003)</ref>. In the workplace, CSR perceptions enhance employees' commitment to and identification with the organization <ref type="bibr">(Jones, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Turker, 2009a)</ref>, are instrumental for attracting and retaining job applicants <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Gully, Phillips, Castellano, Han, &amp; Kim, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Rupp, Shao, Thornton, &amp; Skarlicki, 2013)</ref>, and increase organizational citizenship behaviors <ref type="bibr">(Lin, Lyau, Tsai, Chen, &amp; Chiu, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Rupp et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Research into the psychology of CSR also highlights the importance of micro-(i.e., employee-) level phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Morgeson, Aguinis, Waldman, &amp; Siegel, 2013)</ref> and the need to consider "how employees perceive and subsequently react to acts of corporate social responsibility or irresponsibility" <ref type="bibr">(Rupp et al., 2013: 896)</ref>. Although clarifying the micro-foundations of CSR can explicate the underlying psychological processes, contingencies, and outcomes of employees' perceptions of CSR, surprisingly few organizational maximize the returns on CSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Gond, El Akremi, Igalens, &amp; Swaen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rupp, Ganapathi, Aguilera, &amp; Williams, 2006)</ref>. This research attempts to address the lack of theoretically based, methodologically valid, multidimensional measures of CSR perceptions by developing and validating a multidimensional, stakeholder-based measure of employees' CSR perceptions, namely, the Corporate Stakeholder Responsibility (CStR) scale.</p><p>In developing and validating this new, stakeholder-based, multidimensional scale of CSR, we make three main contributions. First, we advance stakeholder and CSR theory by testing and confirming the multidimensionality of the CSR construct and demonstrating the robustness of a stakeholder-based structure of employees' perceptions of CSR. In line with recurrent calls (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Andriof &amp; Waddock, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Parmar et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Rowley &amp; Berman, 2000)</ref>, we build a case for a stakeholder-based approach to employees' perceptions of CSR and integrate both CSR and stakeholder theory to develop a theoretically based measure.</p><p>Second, we develop a new tool for measuring employees' perceptions of CSR and provide evidence of its reliability and content and construct validity, then clearly distinguish it from comparable constructs (e.g., organizational justice, ethical climate) derived from traditional OB and HRM literature. To do so, we follow the necessary steps to develop and validate multidimensional, higher-order constructs (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Edwards, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Johnson, Rosen, &amp; Chang, 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Johnson, Rosen, Chang, Djurdjevic, &amp; Taing, 2012)</ref>. We also cross-validate the CStR scale across significantly different samples. By providing a robust, validated measure of employees' perceptions of CSR, we address a central limitation that has prevented the development of a sound, micro-level, multilevel theory of CSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Morgeson et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Scholars and practitioners can use our CStR scale to investigate how and why employees react to CSR programs and policies in different ways and more fully appreciate employees' sensitivity to overall CSR policies.</p><p>Third and finally, our research demonstrates the ability of the new perception-based scale to contribute to micro-level research on CSR by predicting important work-related outcomes (e.g., organizational pride, identification, affective commitment, job satisfaction), beyond the predictions offered by organizational justice, ethical climate, or existing measures of perceived CSR. These findings suggest the need to acknowledge the multidimensionality of the CSR construct when evaluating the impact of employee perceptions of CSR on work-related outcomes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PERSPECTIVE</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceptions of Corporate Social Responsibility</head><p>Employees, as members of a corporation, are concerned about, contribute to, perceive, evaluate, and react to their firm's CSR activities <ref type="bibr">(Rupp et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Wood &amp; Jones, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Central to employees' reactions are their perceptions of the CSR activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rupp et al., 2006)</ref>, which may be wrong, such that CSR practices may not be as prevalent as employees believe them to be <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Fleming &amp; Jones, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Glavas &amp; Godwin, 2013)</ref>. However, their existence has implications for employees' attitudes and behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Dijksterhuis &amp; van Knippenberg, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Kaptein, 2011)</ref>, because "how employees perceive the CSR of their employer may actually have more direct and stronger implications for employees' subsequent reactions than actual firm behaviors of which employees may or may not be aware" <ref type="bibr">(Rupp et al., 2013: 897)</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, we approach CSR as a psychological and perceptual phenomenon and aim to develop a subjective measure that can capture perceived CSR, rather than actual, socially responsible actions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Issues with CSR Perceptions Definitions: Relevance of a Stakeholder Framework</head><p>Various definitions of the CSR construct appear in prior literature <ref type="bibr">(Carroll, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Gond &amp; Moon, 2011)</ref>, resulting in multiple measurement approaches. Three main conceptualizations of CSR have emerged in micro-level research. An early framework came from <ref type="bibr">Carroll's (1979: 500)</ref> definition of CSR as "the economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary expectations that society has of organizations at a given point in time." Following this responsibility-based view, <ref type="bibr">Maignan and Ferrell (2000)</ref> propose the "corporate citizenship" concept to evaluate employees' perceptions of CSR along ethical, legal, economic, and discretionary dimensions (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Peterson, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>However, <ref type="bibr">Wood (2010: 53)</ref> suggests that even if <ref type="bibr">Carroll's (1979)</ref> framework describes how managers see their responsibilities, it fails to account for "the sociological complexity of their roles in society and the effects their actions had on others." <ref type="bibr">Carroll's (1979)</ref> definition also ignores cases in which a corporation engages in these four types of behaviors yet still fails to appeal to some internal and external stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Glavas &amp; Godwin, 2013)</ref>. In the same vein, <ref type="bibr">Rupp et al. (2013: 906)</ref> suggest that only the "discretionary citizenship subscale aligns with contemporary definitions of CSR" and regard <ref type="bibr">Carroll's (1979)</ref> framework as restrictive, in that it overlooks corporate "actions that benefit stakeholders, external to the firm."</p><p>A second approach to CSR perceptions addresses this limitation by focusing on how organizations treat individuals. Building on justice theory, it distinguishes distributive, procedural, and interactional dimensions of employees' CSR perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aguilera, Rupp, Williams, &amp; Ganapathi, 2007)</ref>, such that "employees judge the social concern that is embedded in an organization's action (procedural CSR), the outcomes that result from such actions (distributive CSR), and how individuals, both within and outside the organization, are treated interpersonally as a result of these actions (interactional CSR)" <ref type="bibr">(Rupp et al., 2006: 539)</ref>.</p><p>Although this version offers a plausible structure and emphasizes the need to focus on how employees perceive the treatment of individuals or groups by corporations, it cannot capture the distinctive nature of CSR perceptions compared with perceptions of organizational justice, because it relies on similar categories.</p><p>Finally, a third approach to CSR perceptions adopts a stakeholder-based view <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Clarkson, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Freeman, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Wood &amp; Jones, 1995)</ref>. According to this approach, perceptions of CSR should be organized according to employees' perceptions of how the organization treats its stakeholders. <ref type="bibr">Post, Preston, and Sachs (2002: 8)</ref> define stakeholders as "the individuals and constituencies that contribute, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to [the firm's] wealth-creating capacity and activities, and that are therefore its potential beneficiaries and/or risk bearers."</p><p>Beyond stakeholder theory's prominence in management literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Laplume et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Parmar et al., 2010)</ref>, four main arguments justify a stakeholder focus when measuring CSR perceptions.</p><p>First, the most recent definitions of CSR in management and OB literature all refer to stakeholders' expectations and relationships (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Barnett, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Glavas &amp; Godwin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Morgeson et al., 2013)</ref>. As previously argued, "there is no need to think in terms of social responsibility. In fact we might even redefine 'CSR' as 'corporate stakeholder responsibilities' to symbolize that thinking about stakeholders is just thinking about the business and vice versa" <ref type="bibr">(Freeman, Harrison, &amp; Wicks, 2007: 99)</ref>.</p><p>Second, stakeholder theory suggests that managers think about their activities in terms of stakeholder relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Freeman, 1984)</ref>. According to descriptive stakeholder theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Donaldson &amp; Preston, 1995)</ref>, actors' representations of their environment are organized around perceptions of stakeholders groups, which reflect "who and what really count" <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Bundy, Shropshire, &amp; Buchholtz, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Crilly &amp; Sloan, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Mitchell, Agle, &amp; Wood, 1997)</ref>. Cognitive studies confirm that managerial cognition reflects stakeholder categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Crilly, Zollo, &amp; Hansen, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Lucea, 2010)</ref>. Accordingly, stakeholder groups likely offer a useful heuristic that employees use to evaluate their corporation's behaviors toward various internal and external constituents <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aguinis, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Third, the business case for CSR indicates that CSR influences on performance are mediated by stakeholders' attitudinal and behavioral responses to CSR actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Barnett, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">McWilliams &amp; Siegel, 2011)</ref>. Clarifying how a stakeholder group, such as employees, perceives CSR actions oriented toward different stakeholders can help corporations determine how their CSR programs and policies contribute to their value creation.</p><p>Fourth, a stakeholder-based view on CSR perceptions usefully extends and complements the responsibility-based view <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Glavas &amp; Godwin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Rupp et al., 2013)</ref> while remaining compatible with the justice-based view, in that it captures how employees perceive treatments of specific stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Rupp, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rupp et al., 2006)</ref>. Yet it offers a clear distinction from prior OB constructs, such as organizational justice or ethical climate.</p><p>On the basis of these combined arguments, we consider a stakeholder-based perspective a comprehensive approach for developing our CStR scale. We define CStR, in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aguinis (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Barnett (2007)</ref>, as context-specific actions and policies that aim to enhance the welfare of stakeholders by accounting for the triple bottom line of economic, social, and environmental performance, with a focus on employees' perceptions of CStR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multidimensionality of the CStR Construct</head><p>Prior studies neglect an important implication of defining CSR according to multiple, interrelated dimensions: the "multidimensional" nature of the construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Edwards, 2001)</ref>. A construct is multidimensional if it represents several distinct, related dimensions that get treated as a single, higher-order, theoretical concept <ref type="bibr">(Johnson et al., 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Law, Wong, &amp; Mobley, 1998)</ref>. Multidimensional constructs are useful for two reasons: They capture the heterogeneity of organizational phenomena while providing aggregate concepts that facilitate theory building <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Hanisch, Hulin, &amp; Roznowski, 1998)</ref>, and they can predict factorially complex outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Ones &amp; Viswesvaran, 1996)</ref>, and match the level of abstraction of dependent and independent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Edwards, 2001)</ref>. The CStR perceptions construct is multidimensional, in that it captures employees' perceptions of CSR deployed toward various stakeholder groups. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Crilly and Sloan (2014)</ref> showed that there are consistent patterns of attention related to the capacity of an organization to attend to multiple stakeholders simultaneously and effectively. A higher-order, multidimensional CStR construct thus seems relevant and useful. Recognizing this multidimensionality is especially important to facilitate theory building by maintaining "umbrella" constructs while enhancing the rigor and validity of their measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Gond &amp; Crane, 2010)</ref>. Although CSR perceptions have been related to complex, multidimensional outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Peterson, 2004)</ref>, they rarely have been operationalized with the same degree of complexity or abstraction as their outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2012)</ref>, which has created a "stakeholder mismatching" problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Wood &amp; Jones, 1995)</ref>. By considering the multidimensional and stakeholder nature of CSR, the CStR construct reflects the full set of employees' perceptions of stakeholder treatments and how they influence higher-order complex outcomes. The CStR scale then can support theorizing about the relationships between CSR and its predictors or outcomes, at a higher level of analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Existing Measures: A Review and Assessment</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> reviews notable measures used previously to evaluate CSR perceptions. We distinguish unidimensional from multidimensional scales and discuss whether they adequately capture the multidimensional and stakeholder dimensions of the CSR construct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE</head><p>Unidimensional scales. Most unidimensional measures focus on employees' general attitudes, expectations, or opinions toward CSR, including their beliefs about whether their corporations or they, as employees, should engage in CSR <ref type="bibr">(Hunt, Kiecker, &amp; Chonko, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Wagner, Lutz, &amp; Weitz, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zahra &amp; LaTour, 1987)</ref>. Criterion deficiency is the most obvious concern associated with such measures, which cannot capture all the dimensions of the CSR construct. Their operationalization also tends to confuse perceptions of corporate behaviors in relation to CSR with normative ethical evaluations (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hunt et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jin &amp; Drozdenko, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Quazi &amp; O'Brien, 2000)</ref>. Finally, these measures often provide limited reliability and validity and cannot accurately reflect employees' perceptions of how corporations treat stakeholders through CSR initiatives.</p><p>Multidimensional scales. Some multidimensional scales rely on lists of CSR issues, to gather employees' perceptions of what their organizations have done to address these issues <ref type="bibr">(Ford &amp; McLaughlin, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gavin &amp; Maynard, 1975)</ref>. These measures reflect the issue-based view in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>. To identify the key issues, they use classifications established by social rating agencies (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Ruf et al., 1998)</ref> or inferred from a particular industrial context (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Petersen &amp; Vredenburg, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stites &amp; Michael, 2011)</ref>. The process of scale development is mostly atheoretical though, so the item content depends on the contexts in which the scales have been developed. The validity of these tools accordingly is limited to their specific context (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Gavin &amp; Maynard, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stites &amp; Michael, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Most theoretically informed measures instead reflect a responsibility-based view of CSR perceptions. For example, the scale developed by Aupperle and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Aupperle, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr">Aupperle, Carroll, &amp; Hatfield, 1985)</ref> uses a forced choice procedure to assess managerial values <ref type="bibr">(Turker, 2009b)</ref>. With its basis in <ref type="bibr">Carroll's (1979)</ref> framework, <ref type="bibr">Maignan and Ferrell's (2000)</ref> scale can assess the CSR perceptions of different stakeholders (e.g., customers, employees, managers) in different cultural contexts, so it represents one of the most appealing methods to assess CSR perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Lee, Park, &amp; Lee, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stites &amp; Michael, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Turker, 2009b)</ref>. This scale captures corporate citizenship on four dimensions: economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary citizenship. However, several studies have failed to confirm the dimensionality of this scale, such as by distinguishing between the ethical and discretionary dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Pérez &amp; del Bosque, 2013)</ref>. In addition, the scale fails to capture comprehensively the stakeholder dimension of CSR, which is inherent to contemporary definitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Rupp et al., 2013)</ref>, and it suffers from validation weaknesses (e.g., administered only to samples of marketing executives).</p><p>Although no scale reflects the justice-based view of CSR perceptions <ref type="bibr">(Rupp et al., 2006)</ref>, prior studies employ justice constructs as proxies for CSR. For example, <ref type="bibr">Brammer, Millington, and Rayton (2007)</ref> evaluate employees' perceptions with items that correspond to a procedural justice component of CSR, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Rupp et al. (2013)</ref> assess CSR as a proxy for third-party justice.</p><p>Both approaches suffer from contamination though and tend to confuse the justice construct with CSR.</p><p>To date, the sole measure that adopts a stakeholder-based view of the CSR concept is <ref type="bibr">Turker's (2009b)</ref> 17-item scale, which operationalizes employees' CSR perceptions with four categories: oriented toward society (i.e., natural environment, future generations, and nongovernmental organizations), employees, customers, or government. However, this scale has several limitations. It was tested with just one sample of very young, highly educated business professionals, all in white-collar jobs in the service sector in a single country (Turkey). This lack of generalizability constitutes a major limitation for scale development and validation <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hinkin, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Spector, 1992)</ref>. In addition, <ref type="bibr">Turker (2009b)</ref> did not report any tests of convergent, discriminant, or predictive validity based on confirmatory factor analyses. Nor does the reported scale development process allow for evaluations of whether the assessed construct was multidimensional <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Edwards, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2011a)</ref>.</p><p>That is, despite the theoretically assumed multidimensionality of the CSR construct, thus far CSR perceptions have been measured with either unidimensional scales or multidimensional scales that fail to validate whether the CSR higher-order construct is actually multidimensional <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Edwards, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Johnson et al., 2012)</ref>. Considerable efforts devoted to defining and assessing CSR perceptions still have not overcome three main limitations. First, no existing scales operationalize a theoretically informed, stakeholder-based view of employees' CSR perceptions; even though this perspective is more theoretically appropriate for evaluating CSR judgments. Second, some measures suffer from criterion deficiency and contamination, and none of the measures in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> were developed and validated in accordance with the steps required to establish construct validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Hinkin, 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hinkin, , 1998))</ref>. Third, the development and validation processes for the multidimensional scales of CSR did not match current standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Edwards, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Johnson et al., 2012)</ref>. We propose a measure of employees' perceptions of CSR to capture both the stakeholder and multidimensional natures of these perceptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OVERVIEW OF VALIDATION STUDIES</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref> presents an overview of our studies. In a first phase, we sought to develop and provide an initial assessment of a parsimonious scale, composed of only those items that best characterize CSR oriented toward stakeholders. The results revealed six dimensions of employees' perceptions, in line with previous conceptualizations of corporate responsibility and stakeholder theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Laplume et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Parmar et al., 2010)</ref>. Then in a second phase, we assessed the factor structure and reliability of our CStR scale with a two-step procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Kinicki, Jacobson, Peterson, &amp; Prussia, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Netemeyer, Bearden, &amp; Sharma, 2003)</ref>. We evaluated the dimensionality of the CStR scale using an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), then submitted the retained items to a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Gerbing &amp; Hamilton, 1996)</ref>. In addition, we tested the multidimensional nature of the CStR construct using a second-order CFA <ref type="bibr">(Johnson et al., 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Johnson et al., 2012)</ref>. The focus of the third phase was the overall scale (i.e., higherorder construct), because the convergent and discriminant validity of each dimension had been tested in the previous phase. Thus we sought to cross-validate the multidimensional factor structure of the CStR construct, demonstrated the convergent and discriminant validity of the second-order CStR construct by relating it to other constructs, and tested the incremental validity of this higher-order CStR construct by conducting a usefulness analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Edwards, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2011a)</ref>. Finally, in the fourth phase we assessed the criterion-related validity of the CStR construct using a two-wave longitudinal study with a sample of working adults, spread across multiple countries.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHASE 1: ITEM GENERATION, REDUCTION, AND REFINEMENT Study 1: Item Development and Content Validity Assessment</head><p>To assess how employees perceive CSR, we generated items through combined deductive and inductive approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Hinkin, 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hinkin, , 1998))</ref>. We developed initial content specifications based on (1) a comprehensive review of literature on CSR and stakeholder theory, (2) existing measures of CSR perceptions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>), and (3) qualitative focus groups, from which we gained insights into how employees view the concept of CSR and generated items about their perceptions.</p><p>The deductive approach initiated the item generation process, because advances in stakeholder theory and CSR research provide a good foundation from which to identify relevant construct dimensions (MacKenzie, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Podsakoff, &amp; Podsakoff, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Netemeyer et al., 2003)</ref>. Six initially identified domains were deemed appropriate for constituting the CStR construct: employee-oriented CSR, customer-oriented CSR, natural environment-oriented CSR, shareholder-oriented CSR, supplier-oriented CSR, and local community-oriented CSR.</p><p>We supplemented the deductive approach with an inductive approach by conducting nine focus groups with employees to better identify how they perceived CSR initiatives oriented toward various stakeholders. These perceived initiatives provided our initial pool of items for the CStR scale. The nine focus groups included a total of 62 employees holding positions at different hierarchical levels (i.e., non-managers and managers) and coming from different companies in multiple activity sectors, such as air transport, energy and electricity, petrochemicals, building, and transport infrastructure. To start the focus groups, the facilitators asked participants to describe how they viewed their organization's engagement with stakeholders and give examples of actions that they considered representative of CSR. We conducted a content analysis of these transcribed data, using an open-coding approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998)</ref>. The emergent categories closely matched the a priori dimensions that we deduced from theory, which provided initial evidence of the multidimensionality of the CStR construct. The resulting spectrum of CStR categories that matter to employees included six targets: (1) employees, (2) customers, (3) the natural environment, (4) shareholders, (5) suppliers, and (6) the local community. In total, we gathered an initial pool of 91 items that we submitted to a content validity assessment, performed by four faculty members and doctoral students in a northern European university. These experts assigned the randomly ordered items into one of the six dimensions, which we described briefly for them. In this procedure, 47 of the 91 items matched their appropriate dimension, according to at least three of the four respondents, so we retained them for subsequent phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bolino &amp; Turnley, 1999)</ref>. Specifically, we retained 15 employeeoriented CSR items, 5 customer-oriented CSR items, 10 natural environment-oriented CSR items, 4 shareholder-oriented CSR items, 4 supplier-oriented CSR items, and 9 local communityoriented CSR items. Each subscale included more than the recommended minimum of 3 items <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Harris &amp; Schaubroeck, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Hinkin, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>To fine-tune the items and strengthen the content validity assessment, we submitted all 47 items to a discussion among subject matter experts from two universities in northern Europe and a group of 10 CSR or sustainable development managers, during a workshop. On the basis of their comments, we revised some items' phrasing to avoid redundancy, ambiguous wording, exceptionally lengthy items, or jargon <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(DeVellis, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">MacKenzie et al., 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2: Item Reduction and Refinement</head><p>Using items generated from the Study 1, we conducted a quantitative pilot study to refine the scale and explore its reliability and dimensionality.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and procedure.</head><p>A sample of 332 employed MBA students at two large European universities completed surveys during class time. Their average age was 35.86 years (SD = 10.35), and 45.5% of the sample were men. Furthermore, 25.5% of the respondents had worked for less than two years in their organization, 27.2% between two and five years, 23.6% between five and ten years, and 23.7% for more than ten years. Approximately 52% of the respondents had a master's degree. They worked for companies of various sizes (e.g., 29.8% fewer than 100 employees; 29.5% more than 5000 employees) and in various sectors of activity, such as aeronautics, banking, and pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Measures. The 47 items, generated to reflect six dimensions of CSR actions oriented toward stakeholders, appeared together with the 16-item measure of corporate citizenship developed by <ref type="bibr">Maignan and Ferrell (2000)</ref>. Respondents indicated the extent to which they agreed with each statement, on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree) Likert-type scale.</p><p>Analyses and results. To determine the factor structure of the 47-item scale, we performed an EFA using principal axis factoring and Promax rotation on the item pool; oblique rotation is generally more desirable than orthogonal rotation at this early stage of scale development <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Hair &amp; Tatham, 1987)</ref>, because it imposes fewer constraints. We dropped 13 items, on the basis of several criteria. Using the usual recommendation of a minimum cut-off level of .50 for a factor loading (see <ref type="bibr">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001)</ref>, we removed 1 item for its insufficient loading on any factor and 12 items for cross-loading on multiple factors. We thus retained 34 of the strongest items: 9 items for employees (Cronbach's α = .87), 5 for customers (α = .83), 9 for environment (α = .93), 4 for shareholders (α = .91), and 7 items for local community (α = .92) CSR. Our reliability assessments indicated coefficient Cronbach's alphas greater than .70 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994)</ref>. Nevertheless, we dropped the four-item measure of supplier-oriented CSR because it cross-loaded on employee-, natural environment-, and customer-oriented CSR dimensions.</p><p>Next, we examined the extent to which the CStR dimensions were distinct from but correlated with alternative measures of corporate citizenship <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Maignan, Ferrell, &amp; Hult, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Maignan &amp; Ferrell, 2000)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Maignan and</ref><ref type="bibr">colleagues (1999, 2000)</ref> conceptualize corporate citizenship as consisting of four components: economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary citizenship. Our factor analyses using principal axis factoring and Promax rotation instead indicated two factors: economic citizenship ( = .78) and societal citizenship, which merged the legal, ethical, and discretionary components ( = .85). Employee-and local community-oriented CSR seemingly should relate more strongly to societal citizenship than economic citizenship or the other dimensions of the scale; shareholder-and customer-oriented CSR dimensions instead should be more strongly related to economic citizenship than societal citizenship. Accordingly, the correlation of employee-oriented CSR with societal citizenship (.62, p &lt; .01) was greater than that with economic citizenship (.20, p &lt; .01). Shareholder-oriented CSR correlated more strongly with economic citizenship (.57, p &lt; .01) than with societal citizenship (.24, p &lt; .01). The correlations of local community-oriented CSR with economic and societal citizenship were, respectively, .17 and .46 (p &lt; .01). However, the correlation of customer-oriented CSR was moderately high with both economic and societal citizenship <ref type="bibr">(.42 and .43, respectively, p &lt; .01)</ref>.</p><p>Discussion. The results of this pilot study provide preliminary support for the psychometric soundness of CStR and the reliability of five CSR dimensions oriented toward employees, customers, the natural environment, shareholders, and the local community. However, the results indicated a lack of distinctiveness for items measuring supplier-oriented CSR. In discussing these results with a group of nine French managers responsible for CSR, sustainable development, or HRM, we received unanimous recommendations to add new items to measure supplier-oriented CSR. These practitioners concluded that without this dimension, the CStR scale would be deficient, in that implementing and improving responsible supply chain practices indicates firms' stakeholder orientation (e.g., ISO 26000 standards). Moreover, firms' responsibility reputations often depend on the practices of their suppliers, such that suppliers' misconduct can negatively impact their reputation (e.g., Nike), as well as employees' perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Janney &amp; Gove, 2011)</ref>. Thus, we created new items for the supplier-oriented CSR dimension. Through a brainstorming session, we generated five items, corresponding to CSR in firm-supplier relationships. In summary, we retained 34 items from the quantitative pilot study to measure five dimensions of CStR construct, then used 5 newly created items to measure the sixth dimension. We applied the resulting 39-item scale in phase 2 to test its basic psychometric properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHASE 2: BASIC PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF THE CStR SCALE</head><p>To assess the factor structure and reliability of the CStR scale, and following the recommendations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Kinicki et al. (2013)</ref>, we used a two-step procedure. First, we evaluated the dimensionality of the CStR scale by submitting the 39 items to an EFA, which enabled us to test for scale reliability and retain a parsimonious set of items that would leave the scale length manageable (Study 3). Second, in Study 4, we submitted the retained items to a CFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Gerbing &amp; Hamilton, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Netemeyer et al., 2003)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3: Exploratory Factor Analysis</head><p>Sample and procedure. The sample consisted of 261 employees of a subsidiary of a large French firm in the construction industry. Participants received survey packet, including an envelope and a letter that informed them of the purpose of the research, as well as a guarantee that their responses would be kept confidential. They returned questionnaires directly to the authors, using a postage paid envelope. We distributed 750 questionnaires and received 261 usable responses, for a 34.8% response rate. In this sample, 74% of the respondents were men, with an average age of 37.8 years (SD = 10.7), and 46% had been with their employer for at least five years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures and analyses.</head><p>Respondents indicated their agreement with the 39 items of the CStR scale, using a six-point Likert type scale (1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree). We factor analyzed their responses, using principal axis factor extraction with oblique rotation. We chose oblique rotation because the CStR dimensions should not be completely independent.</p><p>Eigenvalues greater than 1.0 and a scree plot test indicated which factors to retain. Only items with loading weights of at least .50 on a single factor and no more than .32 (approximately 10% overlapping variance) on another factor were retained <ref type="bibr">(Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001)</ref>. In addition, we computed coefficient alpha values for each factor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion.</head><p>The EFA results supported a six-factor structure, which explained 56.11% of the total variance. Nevertheless, we dropped four items that did not meet the retention criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Netemeyer et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001)</ref>. One item from the natural environment-oriented CSR dimension loaded relatively highly on the supplier-oriented CSR dimension (.47), but this result likely reflects our use of Promax rotation. When we reran the EFA with a Varimax rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hinkin, 1998)</ref>, the cross-loading dropped to less than .32 <ref type="bibr">(Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001)</ref>, so we retained the item.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 4: First-and Second-Order Confirmatory Factor Analyses</head><p>Sample and procedure. The data for this study came from employees of a subsidiary of a French energy group. The initial pool consisted of 1,000 employees. We contacted them via email, with an invitation to respond to a web-based survey; the e-mail explained the aim of the study and provided assurances of confidentiality. A sample of 426 employees responded, for a response rate of 42.6%. Of these respondents, 76% were men, more than 57% were older than 39 years, and 53% had been employed for more than 10 years by the firm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures and analyses.</head><p>Respondents indicated their agreement with each of the 35 items retained from the EFA. Accordingly, we examined whether (1) the hypothesized six-factor structure explained the covariation among the scale items, ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) each item loaded significantly on its hypothesized factor, and (3) each latent factor explained a sufficiently large proportion of its measured indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Kinicki et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Podsakoff &amp; MacKenzie, 1994b)</ref>. In turn, we computed, for each CStR dimension, the ρ vc(η) index (average variance extracted [AVE] &gt; .50) that denotes the proportion of variance in the items explained by the underlying factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>, as an initial assessment of the convergent validity of the CStR dimensions.</p><p>To examine the distinctiveness of the six dimensions of the CStR construct, we also tested for overall discriminability by contrasting the six-factor baseline measurement model with a single-factor model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bagozzi &amp; Edwards, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Kinicki et al., 2013)</ref>. To test for discriminant validity, we compared a baseline model against a series of alternative nested models, merging two of the six CStR dimensions. The model comparison was based on sequential chi-square <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(James, Mulaik, &amp; Brett, 1982)</ref> and confirmatory fit index (CFI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Widaman, 1985)</ref> difference tests. A significant chi-square difference test (Δχ 2 ) would recommend accepting the less constrained baseline model; CFI differences (ΔCFI) greater than .01 indicated relevant, practical differences in model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Kinicki et al., 2013)</ref>. We also used the recommended procedure to test for discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>, in which "if two constructs are distinct, the average variance in a construct's indicators accounted for by the hypothesized construct should be greater than the amount of variance that the construct shares with any other construct" <ref type="bibr">(Podsakoff &amp; MacKenzie, 1994a: 705)</ref>. Discriminant validity is established when the AVE for each dimension is larger than the square of the correlation between this dimension and any other dimension of the construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Rai (2014)</ref>, to establish discriminant validity, the average shared squared variance (ASV) should be less than the AVE.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr">Johnson et al.'s (2011a</ref><ref type="bibr">Johnson et al.'s ( , 2012) )</ref> procedure to validate multidimensional constructs, we performed first-and second-order CFAs. We envisioned the CStR construct as a superordinate, multidimensional construct, indicated by six subordinate dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Edwards, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2011a)</ref>. Thus, it cannot be conceived of separately from its specific dimensions, and "causality flows from the higher-order construct to its indicators, which are labeled as effects indicators" <ref type="bibr">(Johnson et al., 2011a: 243)</ref>. To test the empirical justification for the inclusion for the indicators (first-order dimensions), we used the following criteria <ref type="bibr">(Johnson et al., 2011a)</ref>: (1) The indicator variables should have significant and substantive loadings on the second-order factor (cut-off of .70), ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), the higher-order factor model should exhibit acceptable fit, and (3) the set of indicators should be unidimensional, with high internal consistency, according to the composite latent variable reliability (CLVR).</p><p>Results and discussion. We found strong support for the hypothesized baseline model. As</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">4</ref> shows, it yielded a very good fit to the data (χ 2 (540) = 879.86, p &lt; .001, standardized root mean residual [SRMR] = .049, CFI = .95, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .038). All the hypothesized factor loadings were statistically significant at the .01 level and reasonably large, ranging from .61 to .88 (M = .73). The reliability estimates (Cronbach's α) also exceeded recommended levels, ranging from .84 (employee) to .91 (local community). The average variance (ρ vc(η) ) accounted for by the factor indicators was substantial, ranging from 49% to 61%, with an average of 55%. Except for employee-oriented CSR (49%), the ρ vc(η) values were well above the 50% criterion recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE</head><p>The results also demonstrated strong support for the distinctiveness of the CStR's dimensional constructs.

The six-factor model outperformed a series of more parsimonious models that merged different pairs of constructs, in support of the distinctiveness of the constructs.

All factor loadings for the second-order factor were statistically significant and substantive in size, ranging from .51 to .84 (M = .72). Only the supplier-oriented CSR dimension did not meet the .70 standard. 1 However, the average loading met and exceeded this cut-off, so the indicators shared approximately 50% of their variance with the higher-order factor <ref type="bibr">(Johnson et al., 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">MacKenzie et al., 2011)</ref>. Furthermore, we used <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Edwards's (2001)</ref> multivariate coefficients of determination (R m 2 ) to assess the sub-dimensions of CStR as a superordinate multidimensional construct. These values were substantive, from .25 to .71 (M = .53). The average variance (ρ vc(η) ) accounted for in the second-order factor by its first-order factors was 53%, above <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Fornell and Larcker's (1981)</ref> threshold. Finally, the CLVR of the second-order CStR factor was .87-that is, well above the .70 criterion <ref type="bibr">(Johnson et al., 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">MacKenzie et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In summary, both first-and second-order models offered very good fit, significant factor loadings, high composite reliabilities, and substantial proportions of explained variance. The results supported the convergent and discriminant validity of each dimension of the CStR construct: The dimensions were distinct but not independent.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHASE 3: VALIDITY OF THE SECOND-ORDER CStR CONSTRUCT</head><p>In this phase of the scale validation process, we focused on the overall scale (higher-order construct), after having established the convergent and discriminant validity of each dimension in the previous phase. Convergent validity is the extent to which a construct is related to alternative measures of similar constructs; discriminant validity is the extent to which a construct has low or null relationships with measures of dissimilar constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hinkin, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Kinicki et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 5: Convergent and Discriminant Validity of the Second-Order CStR Construct</head><p>This study has two purposes. Following the recommendations of <ref type="bibr">Johnson et al. (2011a)</ref>, we seek to ensure that the factor structure derived in Studies 3 and 4 was not an artifact of the survey design, sample characteristics, or data collection method. In addition, we need to test the convergent and discriminant validity of the CStR measure. To assess convergent validity, we started by providing an overview of the conceptual overlap and distinctions between the CStR construct and comparable constructs (i.e., organizational justice and ethical climate). To test discriminant validity, we first applied CFA to provide a fairly robust assessment of the distinctiveness of the CStR measure compared with alternative measures of similar constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Tracey &amp; Tews, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Way et al., 2014)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Convergent Validity</head><p>According to prior research, employees' perceptions of CSR and organizational justice perceptions are inextricably linked: They share the fundamental ethical assumption of normative treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aguilera et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Folger, Cropanzano, &amp; Goldman, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Rupp, 2011)</ref>. Whereas <ref type="bibr">Aguinis and Glavas (2012: 318)</ref> argue that organizational justice is an "underlying mechanism … through which CSR leads to important outcomes for employees, organizations, and society", <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Rupp et al. (2013)</ref> suggest that in an employee-centric approach, CSR is similar to justice. Recent developments in justice theory show that employees' perceptions of organizational justice may be informed by their perceptions of how the corporation treats their own group, as well as third parties <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Roberson &amp; Colquitt, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Rupp et al., 2013)</ref>. A stakeholder approach to employees' perceptions of CSR is well aligned with this view; it relates employees' perceptions of how they are treated, as internal stakeholders, with their perceptions of how other stakeholders are treated by the organization. Furthermore, several studies on the microfoundations of stakeholder theory highlight the connection between justice perceptions and corporate stakeholder responsibilities in terms of the underlying mechanisms of influence and the outcomes. Treating stakeholders on the basis of fairness considerations (e.g., open and honest exchanges of relevant information, reliance on trust and self-enforcement, inclination to resolve problems through collaboration, avoiding arm's-length approaches) thus enhances firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Bridoux &amp; Stoelhorst, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Phillips, 1997)</ref>. Specifically, "stakeholders choose the levels of effort and resources they provide the firm based on their perceptions of justice" <ref type="bibr">(Bosse et al., 2009: 450)</ref>, such that they reciprocate by rewarding fair and punishing unfair treatment, whether of themselves or others <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Bridoux &amp; Stoelhorst, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Fehr &amp; Gätcher, 2002)</ref>. These results underscore the inextricable links between organizational justice perceptions and CStR perceptions, so we expect the CStR construct to relate positively and strongly to perceptions of organizational justice.</p></div>

To fulfill their ethical responsibility and gain legitimacy, organizations need formal codes of moral conduct that meet society's expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Carroll, 1991)</ref>.

In addition, <ref type="bibr">Groves and LaRocca (2011)</ref> suggest that the ethical values of organizations' leaders are associated with employees' expectations and beliefs that their organizations treat their stakeholders with care and develop CSR initiatives toward them. Consistent with this reasoning, we argue that the CStR construct connects with employees' perceptions of the ethical features of their workplace, usually captured through the construct of ethical climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Victor &amp; Cullen, 1988)</ref>, which refers to employees' shared perceptions of the ethical policies and practices of their organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Martin &amp; Cullen, 2006)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GENERAL DISCUSSION</head><p>With this research, we sought to develop and validate a multidimensional measure of employees' perceptions of CStR. Our comprehensive review of extant literature indicated the need for a sound, reliable, valid stakeholder-based scale of employees' perceptions of CSR.</p><p>Combining deductive and inductive approaches to scale development, we conceptualized CStR as a higher-order, hierarchically structured scale, with six subordinate dimensions. The proposed 35item scale offers adequate psychometric properties, as indicated by strong, consistent evidence across a pilot study (N = 332) and five field studies with distinct samples of working employees (N = 3,772). By using multiple, independent, relatively large samples from a broad spectrum of settings, we improve the generalizability of our findings while also accounting for the specific contexts of CSR policies and initiatives. We also found strong support for the psychometric properties of the CStR scale, in terms of content, convergent, discriminant, incremental, and criterion-related validity. Across studies, substantial support emerged for the six-dimensional structure of CStR.</p><p>Furthermore, this higher-order factor model fit the data well. Similar to previous studies of higher-order constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Linderbaum &amp; Levy, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Walumbwa et al., 2008)</ref>, we confirmed that the first-and second-order models were fairly equivalent; we concur that the second-order model is preferable, in that it is more parsimonious and allows for covariation among first-order factors.</p><p>Finally, by using longitudinal designs in the last two studies, we show that the higher-order, multidimensional CStR construct offers incremental and criterion-related validity, over and above similar constructs (i.e., organizational justice, ethical climate), for predicting outcomes such as organizational pride, organizational identification, and affective commitment. That is, our proposed higher-order CStR construct provides advantages over any of its dimensions alone, including greater parsimony and bandwidth <ref type="bibr">(Johnson et al., 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Johnson et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, consistent with Linderbaum and Levy (2010), we acknowledge that if necessary, CStR dimensions could be used separately to capture a unique part of the variance in perceived CStR and explain specific, distinct relationships with both antecedents and outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Contributions and Practical Implications</head><p>The development and validation of the CStR scale has implications for research on the psychological foundations of CSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Morgeson et al., 2013)</ref>. First, the dearth of research on micro-level CSR likely stems from the lack of useful, valid measures of employees' perceptions of CSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aguinis, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Morgeson et al., 2013)</ref>. Prior empirical research has not followed the necessary steps to ensure rigorous construct validity and evidence of perceived CSR measures. The corporate citizenship scale <ref type="bibr">(Maignan &amp; Ferrell, 2000)</ref> and other perceived CSR scales <ref type="bibr">(Turker, 2009b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Wagner et al., 2009)</ref> have been useful, but they are based on an outdated theoretical framework, or suffer from methodological limitations, with little effort devoted to their systematic validation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aguinis, 2011)</ref>. We draw on a sound theoretical framework and adopt robust, comprehensive analytic procedures, with multiple independent samples, to develop and validate our multidimensional CStR scale <ref type="bibr">(Johnson et al., 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">MacKenzie et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Spector, 1992)</ref>. This scale also includes all key stakeholders. We show that CStR is a broad, superordinate, multidimensional construct, and its nature is central for understanding both perceived CStR and its dynamic features. Specifically, the higher-order hierarchical structure of the CStR construct makes it particularly valuable for understanding why, how, and when CSR perceptions likely influence individuals and organizational outcomes. As such, our multidimensional CStR construct shows considerable promise for use in further research into CSR and the mechanisms by which it influences employees' attitudes and behaviors.</p><p>Second, we develop a CStR measure that can be used to analyze perceived CSR's antecedents and outcomes in multilevel designs. Although we define and assess the higher-order CStR construct at the individual employee level, some evidence suggests that CSR can be conceptualized and measured at multiple levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Morgeson et al. (2013)</ref> call for the development of CSR measures that can capture this multilevel nature; our CStR scale can apply to work unit, team, or organizational levels of analysis, as well as address hierarchical nested data structures.</p><p>For practitioners, our CStR scale fills an important gap. Given the growing importance of corporate investments in CSR programs <ref type="bibr">(McKinsey, 2010)</ref>, measurement tools that offer a clear understanding of how employees perceive CSR initiatives is crucial, because, "it is individuals who actually strategize, make decisions, and are responsible for their execution" <ref type="bibr">(Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2013: 317)</ref>. Beyond relying on CSR measures provided by external agencies (such as through the KLD data set), firms need to give heed to, assess, and manage CSR perceptions, because employees react on the basis of their perceptions, not actual corporate behavior <ref type="bibr">(Rupp et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Rupp et al., 2013)</ref>. The analysis of the alignment or misalignment between employees' perceptions and reality should help practitioners mix their communication practices through forums, internal reports, training, and targeted communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Glavas &amp; Godwin, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Measuring CStR perceptions also can help firms move beyond one-size-fits-all approaches to assessing the impacts of their specific CSR programs. Companies thus can evaluate more accurately how employees perceive their initiatives and tailor their CSR programs. That is, the CStR scale offers a diagnostic tool and valuable assessment of the impact of CSR initiatives oriented toward different stakeholders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Directions for Research</head><p>These findings are encouraging, yet several limitations require consideration as well. First, CSR-related concepts invariably address a moving target, because relevant domains and subdomains change over time. Although a stakeholder structure can limit this bias, compared with issue-based scales, questions related to ethics depend on cultural norms and changing public discourses <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Belk, Devinney, &amp; Eckhardt, 2005)</ref>. As prevailing discourses change and cultural shifts occur, so might employees' judgments and thus our construct. Such shifts likely do not occur abruptly or unexpectedly but rather evolve over time. To ensure the CStR tool maintains managerial relevancy, users should establish dialogues with employees and other stakeholders, to anticipate new targets and domains that might complement our scale's categorization.</p><p>Second, we decided to conceive of the CStR construct as a superordinate, multidimensional construct, so the effects indicators should be highly correlated <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Edwards, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2011a)</ref>. The results showed that the dimensions were not as highly correlated as we expected (r = .31 to .64 in the different samples), nor did they share similar relationships with the correlates and consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Edwards, 2001)</ref>. Although the effect indicators had generally high loadings and high internal consistencies across indicator scores, further research should replicate, develop, and validate additional, or revise the existing, dimensions. Including or excluding an effect indicator might not substantially alter the meaning of a superordinate, higher-order construct, because all indicators share the same underlying construct <ref type="bibr">(Johnson et al., 2011a)</ref>. In terms of continuous scale validation, we recommend research that explores other potential sub-dimensions of the higher-order CStR construct (e.g., government-oriented CSR) or the dynamics of the CStR construct as the number of indicators or their relationships with the higher-order construct change over time. The nature of the higher-order constructs even may shift from superordinate to aggregate, or vice versa <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Johnson et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Third, we tested the impact of perceived CStR on a limited set of outcomes, using the same data source. We limited the risk of common method variance with two-wave longitudinal studies that tested for incremental and criterion-related validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Johnson et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Podsakoff et al., 2012)</ref>. It also would be interesting to consider a broader array of outcomes (e.g., performance, citizenship behaviors, and turnover) measured objectively and by different sources (e.g., supervisors, colleagues). Following the call by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aguinis and Glavas (2012)</ref>, research could examine processes (mediators) and boundary conditions (moderators). For example, individual personality differences might enhance or diminish the relationship between perceived CStR and its outcomes. Using our CStR scale, further research could integrate a multilevel lens and examine relationships at different levels; with a multilevel design, researchers might assess whether the CSR climate, as perceived by employees, is likely to strengthen employees' collective identification with the firms that take care of the well-being of stakeholders <ref type="bibr">(Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2012: 954)</ref>.</p><p>Fourth, another possible extension could address employees' perceptions of corporate irresponsibility (CSiR), instead of CSR, still with a stakeholder-based approach. Recent theory suggests that employees react strongly to irresponsible behavior, due to attribution processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Lange &amp; Washburn, 2012)</ref>. A scale focused on employees' perceptions of irresponsible corporate actions and how they affect various stakeholders might complement our work and support comparisons of the relative influence of CStR or corporate stakeholder irresponsibility on outcomes. Alternatively, studies might address other stakeholders' perceptions, rather than employees. Research in marketing and consumer behavior might benefit from a better scale to measure consumers' perceptions of CSR, to assess how they affect the establishment of longterm relationships between companies and consumers.</p><p>To conclude, we believe that the development of a sound methodological and valid scale measuring employees' perceptions of CSR was a necessary step to develop and further unravel the microfoundations of CSR. This research therefore may offer a necessary blueprint for this emerging and promising field of research in organization studies and management practice. Many opportunities for further research remain and would greatly benefit from a reliable, valid, and efficient scale of employees' CStR perceptions.  <ref type="bibr">(1990)</ref> Individual agreement (1 to 7) with four behavioral items, such as "I often place my duty to society above my duty to my company" or "I sometimes place my duty to my company above my duty to society."

A series of CFAs indicated the distinctiveness of our study variables. The initial first-order CFAs assessed the distinctiveness of the six dimensions of the CStR scale; the first-order, six-factor model fit the data well at Time 1: χ 2 (539) = 780.52, p &lt; .001, SRMR = .059, CFI = .93, and RMSEA = .047. The fit also was acceptable at Time 2: χ 2 (539) = 909.41, p &lt; .001, SRMR = .065, CFI = .90, and RMSEA = .058. Next, we conducted second-order CFAs. At Time 1, the higher-order CStR model yielded a good fit with the data (χ 2 (548) = 814.53, p &lt; .001, SRMR = .065, CFI = .92, RMSEA = .049), and the factor loadings were statistically significant and substantive in size (.68-.86). Using the Time 2 measures, we found that the higher-order CStR model demonstrated satisfactory fit (χ 2 (548) = 924.02, p &lt; .001, SRMR = .069, CFI = .90, RMSEA = .058). In addition, all the loadings for the second-order factor were statistically significant and ranged from .52 to .79.Finally, we conducted a series of CFAs to examine the distinctiveness of the higher-order CStR construct from overall organizational justice and overall perceived CSR. The baseline model distinguishing the higher-order CStR construct from overall justice, measured at Time 1 (unconstrained model with the correlation between CStR and overall justice freely estimated) 2 fit the data better than a model that equated them (constrained model with correlation set to 1.00).The fit indices were as follows: χ 2 (766) = 1185.36, p &lt; .001, SRMR = .067, CFI = .91, and RMSEA = .052 versus χ 2 (768) = 1546.62, p &lt; .001, SRMR = .203, CFI = .83, and RMSEA = .070. The baseline model distinguishing the higher-order CStR construct from overall perceived CSR, measured at Time 1, also fit the data better than an alternative model that merged them (respectively, χ 2 [654] = 995.65, p &lt; .001, SRMR = .064, CFI = .91, RMSEA = .051 versus χ 2 [652] = 1061.56, p &lt; .001, SRMR = .189, CFI = .89, RMSEA = .055). All chi-square differences were significant, affirming the distinctiveness between measures of the CStR construct and overall organizational justice (Δχ 2 (2) = 361.26, p &lt; .001), or overall perceived CSR (Δχ 2 (2) = 65.91, p &lt; .001).</figDesc></figure>
