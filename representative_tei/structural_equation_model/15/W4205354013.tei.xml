<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Caregivers experience great stress, and coping can be one of the factors, which determine the extent of stress. The aim of the present paper is to analyze the effects of coping strategies on distress of the older adult's caregiver, including guilt as a mediating factor in those maladaptive strategies. The sample consisted of 201 informal caregivers of institutionalized older adults. The three constructs measured were: stress, guilt, and coping strategies. Results showed that strategies that have a better ability to reduce stress are active, positive reframing and acceptance; on the contrary, behavioral disengagement, self-distraction, self-blame and venting positively predicted the feeling of guilt that facilitated the perception of stress. Given the important association obtained between the experience of guilt and psychological distress in caregivers, it could be relevant to develop psychoeducational interventions with caregivers including techniques to reduce this feeling of guilt and develop cognitive behavioral strategies that facilitate adaptation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The negative impacts of the caregiving role have mostly been described in terms of burden or stress; the caregiver burden encompasses physical, psychological, emotional, relational, social, and financial problems due to caregiving <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Pristavec, 2018)</ref>. In order to reduce caregivers' stress, it is essential to identify strategies that allow them to cope with distress and, therefore, better adapt to the stressful situation, and strategies that increase positive adaptation and minimize the perception of stress.</p><p>One important distinction in the study of coping is the difference between situational coping responses and dispositional coping styles. The former consists of what the person does in a specific coping episode or during a specific period of time, whereas the latter (or trait coping) assume that people develop habitual ways of dealing with stress, and that these habits are defined as the tendency to use specific coping reactions to a greater or lesser degree in situations of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Carver &amp; Scheider, 1994)</ref>. People generally exhibit high variability in their responses to threats and stressors, and several distinctions have been made between different types of coping.</p><p>Initially, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lazarus and Folkman (1984)</ref> distinguished between problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carver et al. (1989)</ref> further distinguished between approach coping and avoidance coping. Approach coping is based on adaptive strategies that reflect cognitive and behavioral efforts to master or resolve life stressors. It refers to efforts to directly confront or deal with a stressor, and it may involve active attempts to resolve the stressor or manage related emotions. Avoidance coping is based on maladaptive strategies focused on escaping from the stressor, and it may involve active avoidance, denial, or even wishful thinking as ways to manage associated distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Roth &amp; Cohen, 1986)</ref>. Typically, approach coping strategies have been related to positive emotional and behavioral functioning, whereas avoidant strategies have been associated with negative outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Carver (1997)</ref> presented a brief measure of coping reactions based on the COPE inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Carver et al., 1989)</ref>. The Brief COPE is an inventory of coping reactions. Its factorial structure is oblique; furthermore, subscales have been identified that can load together and, therefore, would be better operationalized through higher-order factors. However, several measurement models have been tested based on previous theoretical and hierarchical conceptions of coping, and there does not seem to be a clear structure. Thus, there is some controversy about the best factor solution. Some of the most frequent types of coping tested in the literature are: a. the classic problem-focused/emotionfocused typology based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lazarus and Folkman (1984)</ref>; b. the three-dimensional conceptual system reflecting problem-focused, emotion-focused, and dysfunctional coping <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Carver et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Coolidge et al., 2000)</ref>; and c. the approach and avoidance coping framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Roth &amp; Cohen, 1986)</ref>. Of these models, the last two seem to offer the best results in explaining the structure of the Brief Cope questionnaire. The threedimensional model indicates that dysfunctional coping is maladaptive, whereas the other strategies (grouped into problem-or emotional-focused) are adaptive, and the twodimensional model differentiates between maladaptive avoidance coping strategies and other strategies (approach coping) that are adaptive <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Moore et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Caregivers experience great stress, and coping is one of the factors that determine the extent of the stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Pearlin et al., 1990)</ref>. Coping strategies employed by the caregiver may play a role in enhancing or reducing the caregiver's burden. Caregiver burden consists of a series of negative responses that occur while undertaking the role of primary caregiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gérain &amp; Zech, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Liu et al., 2020)</ref>, due to the impact or persistent difficulty of taking care of a dependent, older people, relative with a disability or some type of impairment that threatens the physical aspects of caregiving (objective burden), and the psychological consequences of being a caregiver (subjective burden). <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Del-pino-casado et al. (2011)</ref> showed heterogeneous results when relating coping categories and burden, but they found a positive and significant relationship with avoidance coping. Avoidance coping was related to attempts to avoid problems and engage in indirect attempts to reduce distress. Research has noted that caregivers gain greater benefits from problem-solving and emotional-cognitive coping than from dealing with the consequences of stress, and they often use more than one strategy to deal with adversities <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Salin et al., 2009)</ref>. Dysfunctional coping strategies have been consistently linked to higher levels of depression, anxiety, and caregiver burden <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Muscat &amp; Scerri, 2018)</ref>. The type of coping strategies used by caregivers appears to influence the impact of the stress of the role. Specifically, emotion-focused strategies seem to buffer the negative impact of stress on caregivers, whereas dysfunctional strategies leave caregivers more susceptible to stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lloyd et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The negative impact of stress on caregivers is usually related to feelings of denial, sadness, and anxiety. However, the feeling of guilt, an emotion that has been frequently observed in caregivers, has not received enough attention. Institutionalization is difficult for family members of older adults, as they have to cope with the sense of loss. They may experience stress and guilt, and will need a period of adjustment as they redefine and adapt to their new roles and responsibilities as caregivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Janzen, 2001)</ref>. New sources of stress may arise: financial <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gaugler et al., 1999)</ref> or guilt <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al., 2007)</ref>, which may put family caregivers at risk for outcomes such as caregiver burden <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Garity, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Definitions of guilt in the context of caregiving <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Losada et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Prunty &amp; Foli, 2019)</ref> propose that this type of emotion is the result of a negative self-evaluation of the inadequacy of one's behavior compared to one's beliefs and ideals about meaningful action. Furthermore, guilt not only seems to originate at the cognitive level, but it is also clearly shaped by the social context and the caregiver's interpersonal relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gallego-Alberto et al., 2020)</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Prunty and Foli (2019)</ref> proposed a new conceptual definition based on three key factors: a) beliefs of responsibility for care; b) negative assessments of their caregiving and role performance; and c) due to the caregiving efforts, neglect of him/herself and others in the personal environment. Guilt feelings are significantly related to caregiver distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Losada et al., 2010)</ref>, and some research considers it a main emotion in caregivers, which may add to their burden (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Brodaty, 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Losada et al. (2018)</ref> offers evidence of the pathways through which ambivalence and guilt feelings are linked to caregivers' depressive symptomatology. They provide support for the stress and coping model, which postulates that the relationship between stressors and caregiving consequences varies depending on resource variables.</p><p>The objective of this research is based on future lines recently proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gallego-Alberto et al., 2020)</ref> to explain the role of some relevant variables in understanding the factors that contribute to the distress of caregivers of older adults, further analyzing guilt as a mechanism for coping with stress in the care process. Thus, based on the two structures mentioned above that best explain the grouping of the coping strategies, we intend to verify the relationship between these two structures and stress, including guilt as a mediating factor in these maladaptive strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Individual evaluations were conducted with 201 informal caregivers of institutionalized older adults, and nine refused to participate in the research. All respondents were recruited through residences for the older people in La Rioja, Spain. Individuals were required to meet several criteria to ensure that the informal caregiver role was established: (a) identify themselves as the primary relative providing informal care to an older adult; (b) dedicate at least one day a week to visit your family member either to accompany, help or supervise the care; (c) not receive any economic remuneration; and (d) having cared for that family member for at least three months. All participants gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. The dropout rate was 5%. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Salamanca.</p><p>The study sample had a mean age of 59.32 years (SD = 12.01; range 32-89) and included mostly women (68.2%). The caregivers were mainly daughters/sons (63.2%). The participants were caring for a family member with cognitive impairment (71.1%), and the frequency of visits was mainly daily (30.8%) or between 3-6 times a week (44.8%). They had been providing care for a mean of 3.27 years (SD = 2.11), devoting on average of 8.28 hours per day to caregiving (SD = 1.99).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments</head><p>The Spanish version <ref type="bibr">(Moran et al., 2010)</ref> of the Brief-COPE <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Carver, 1997)</ref> was used, adapting it to the dispositional format. Responses rate the degree to which participants use each coping strategy to deal with a particular stressful event on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (I didn't do this at all) to 3 (I did this a lot). It consists of 28 items that make up 14 coping scales, including: active coping, planning, instrumental support, acceptance, emotional support, humor, positive reframing, religion, behavioral disengagement, self-distraction, substance use, denial, self-blame, and venting.</p><p>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cohen et al., 1983</ref>) is a self-report measure to identify the degree to which individuals perceive their life as stressful relative to their ability to cope. The Spanish version <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Remor, 2006)</ref>, evaluates the level of perceived stress during the past month, and it consists of 14 items rated on a 5-point response scale (0 = never to 4 = very often). The internal consistency was .87.</p><p>The Caregiver Guilt Questionnaire (CGQ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Losada et al., 2010)</ref> was used to assess caregivers' feelings of guilt. It is a 22-item self-report measure developed to address the shortcomings of existing measures. Response options range from 0 (never) to 4 (always or almost always). Participants rate how frequently they have experienced specified thoughts or feelings of guilt in the past two weeks. In this study, the internal consistency (Cronbach's α) was .90.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Based on the information provided by the senior centers, a reference list of relatives of institutionalized seniors was drawn up. Next, we contacted the family members by phone, briefly explaining the objective of the study and checking that they met the inclusion criteria. If so, their collaboration was requested, and if they decided to participate, an appointment was made. Before the evaluation, the objective of the study was explained to them again, and participants signed the informed consent. Using the semi-structured interview format, the instruments were administered in the psychology department office. Each interview lasted about an hour and a half.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>The statistical analyses included structural equations models using EQS 6.1. The following criteria were applied to evaluate the fit: (a) the Chi square statistic; (b) a comparative fit index (CFI and GFI) of more than .90; (c) a root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) of .08 or less.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To study the relationships among the variables included in the study, a Pearson correlation analysis was carried out (see, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>To develop the initial prediction model (see, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), we relied on the threedimensional conceptual model, which differentiates between strategies focused on the problem (active, planning, and instrumental support), strategies focused on emotion (acceptance, emotional support, humor, positive reinterpretation, and religion), and dysfunctional coping strategies (behavioral disengagement, selfdistraction, substance use, denial, self-blame, and venting). The latent dysfunctional coping factor should positively predict the caregiver's feelings of guilt, which, in turn, should positively predict the amount of perceived stress. The other two latent factors that group the strategies focused on the problem and on the emotion should show a direct and negative relationship with the amount of perceived stress because, as pointed out above, these factors seem to protect caregivers from the impact of negative stress.</p><p>This model was tested, and the indices obtained were not satisfactory, and so a new model was tested. Based on previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Meyer, 2001)</ref>, another frequently-used model to explain the Brief Cope structure is the two-dimensional model. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the new tested model, in which two latent factors that group approach coping (adaptive strategies) and avoidance coping (maladaptive strategies) are differentiated. Evidence indicates that adaptive coping scales tend to be linked to a desirable outcome, whereas maladaptive coping scales tend to be associated with an undesired outcome. Therefore, maladaptive strategies would be positively related to the caregivers' perception of guilt, which, in turn, would have a significant and positive relationship with stress, whereas adaptive strategies should show a negative relationship with stress.</p><p>When testing this second model, the fit was correct, although some dimensions did not obtain a significant relationship with their latent factor, and the Wald test (W) indicated that these dimensions and their relationship with the corresponding factor should be removed. The following relationships were eliminated: planning, instrumental support, emotional support, humor, and religion from the adaptive strategies factor; and substance use and denial from the maladaptive strategies factor.</p><p>The proposed modifications were made, and the fit indices obtained were adequate χ 2 (g.l. = 20) = 44,12, p &gt; 0,001, χ 2 /g.l. = 8,51. Furthermore, the comparative fit indices for this model showed scores within the accepted parameters (CFI = ,901, GFI = ,953, RMSEA = ,078 (90% = CI = ,047,,109)), giving rise to the final model (see, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>), in which all the relationships were significant.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Coping is considered a process that leads to adaptation, although the use of some coping strategies could produce the opposite effect by also increasing the perception of stress. In a sample of informal caregivers of older adults, this research aimed to analyze which coping strategies they used, to discover which ones could lead to a reduction in stress and which ones led to feelings of guilt, thus increasing stress. The findings showed that the strategies with a greater ability to reduce stress are active, positive reframing, and acceptance; in contrast, behavioral disengagement, self-distraction, self-blame, and venting positively predicted feelings of guilt, which enhanced the perception of stress.</p><p>Regarding the adaptive strategies, the results are consistent with the review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hawken et al. (2018)</ref>, who reported that the active strategy was one of the most helpful strategies and associated with more positive outcomes in reducing caregivers' burden. This type of strategy involves actions in behaviors that surround the situation, in order to reduce time and work, and adjusting the caregiving role and responsibilities was associated with more positive adjustment and outcomes.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kneebone and Martin (2003)</ref> report that the positive reframing strategy had an impact on caregiver adaptation, and it was positively related to life satisfaction and inversely related to depression; making meaning was significantly related to better health, but also to fewer psychiatric symptoms. These findings match those of several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Roche et al., 2015)</ref> showing that active coping strategies oriented towards problem solving and affect regulation, such as positive reframing, modify the negative impact of caregivers' distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Del-pino-casado et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, our findings show that acceptance is an important strategy to reduce stress. This result is consistent with what was obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hawken et al. (2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">), or Pérez-Cruz et al. (2019)</ref>, who report that the most widely used cognitive strategy is acceptance, and that this acceptance of the situation is unchangeable and that life would never be the same again. <ref type="bibr">Delpino-casado et al. (2019)</ref> suggest that this form of coping may be an adaptive response to caregiving, and it would decrease the caregiver's perception of the situation as stressful.</p><p>Finally, an approach coping profile characterized by high active coping, positive reframing, and acceptance may protect caregivers from distress and assist them in appraising the caregiving situation as less stressful. This finding reinforces results confirming that caregivers must engage in approach coping, which will protect them from experiencing high levels of distress. In relation to dysfunctional/avoidance coping strategies, the use of behavioral disengagement, self-distraction, self-blame, and venting predicted higher levels of distress mediated by guilt. Guilt has been shown to be a common experience of caregivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Rosa et al., 2010)</ref>, and it stems from caregivers evaluating their actions as inappropriate or insufficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gallego-Alberto et al., 2020)</ref>. As a negative emotion, guilt can be experienced as stressful. Because people start by cognitively appraising the situation to deal with it, appraisal is central to the stress process, and the interpretation of stressful events is more important than the events themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)</ref>. The results showed that guilt mediates the relationship between coping strategies and distress. Given the important association found between the experience of guilt and psychological distress in caregivers, interventions with caregivers should include techniques to reduce feelings of guilt and develop cognitive behavioral strategies that facilitate adaptation.</p><p>Finally, little is known about the relationship between dysfunctional/avoidance coping strategies and guilt. Behavioral disengagement, self-distraction, self-blame, and venting are strategies that momentarily remove the caregiver from the problem and, therefore, from the responsibility for the care. This belief of distancing oneself from responsibility for care is one of the characteristics that <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Prunty and Foli (2019)</ref> mentioned as a key factor in the concept of guilt. Therefore, it seems logical to label this type of strategy maladaptive; however, some theorists have suggested that these strategies can reduce distress levels for short periods of time and, therefore, can be adaptive in situations that appear uncontrollable and expose the individual to continually elevated stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Held et al., 2011)</ref>. However, the relationship obtained with guilt would show that, although these strategies can initially be an outlet, in the long term they would generate guilt and psychological discomfort, thus confirming their maladaptive nature. The findings of this study make an important contribution to the literature on caregivers by establishing relationships between coping strategies, guilt, and distress. The results can offer practitioners information about creating psychoeducational interventions to improve caregivers' mental health, reducing the feeling of guilt and the coping strategies that predict it, and promoting adaptive strategies that minimize the perception of stress. Although some major findings have been identified, the study also has some limitations. This study included informal caregivers of people with several types of illnesses, which may produce some heterogeneity, and it does not provide data about how caregivers deal with stress over time.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>= Perceived Stress Scale; CGQ = Caregiver Guilt Questionnaire; 1 = active coping, 2 = planning; 3 = instrumental support; 4 = acceptance; 5 = emotional support; 6 = humor; 7 = positive reframing; 8 = religion; 9 = behavioral disengagement; 10 = self-distraction, 11 = substance use; 12 = denial, 13 = self-blame; 14 = venting. ** significant at .01; * significant at. 05.</figDesc></figure>
