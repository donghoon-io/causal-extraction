<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Increasingly, MB has been growing phenomenally over the banking sector and has become an integral banking channel alongside Internet banking, Telebanking, and ATM <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lee et al., 2007)</ref>. As an innovative banking channel, MB enables customers to carry out financial transactions (i.e. balance enquiries, fund transfers, payment of bills) using mobile devices, smartphones, or Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) 24 hours a day, 7 days a week <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Zhou et al., 2010)</ref>. The prevalence in MB could be attributed to the ability of such technology to launch a variety of financial services over a wider geographical area, especially where there is a problem regarding Internet connections, or where setting up branches is difficult and not feasible <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cruz et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wessels and Drennan, 2010)</ref>. Moreover, by introducing MB services, banks aim to provide customers with a better service by means of more friendly and cost-effective channels, thereby enhancing their satisfaction and loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Alalwan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lee et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wessels and Drennan, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In Jordan, mobile technology has evolved significantly over recent years; this is evidenced by the increasing penetration rate of the mobile service which had climbed to 140% by 2012 <ref type="bibr">(The Jordan Times, 2013)</ref>. Therefore, under intense competition, MB has received particular attention from the Jordanian banks as about 15 banks out of 26 had implemented MB services by the end of 2012 <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Migdadi, 2012)</ref>. Nevertheless, in both developed and developing countries, the evolution in MB services is not in line with the boom in mobile technology, and the growth in the adoption rate of this technology is still sluggish <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Alalwan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hanafizadeh et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lin, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Püschel et al., 2010)</ref>. For instance, Cellular-News <ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref> reported that the highest rate of adoption of MB services were 25% and 22% in China and USA respectively. In the same way, these rates go down dramatically in developing countries <ref type="bibr">(Cellular-News, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The adoption of MB in Jordan is not on the desired level because Jordanian banking customers are still sluggish in accepting these technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Awwad and Ghadi, 2010)</ref>. For instance, statistics provided by some of the largest banks in Jordan <ref type="bibr">(Arab Bank and HSBC)</ref> suggest that only 1.65% of Jordanian bank customers have adopted MB up to 2009 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Awwad and Ghadi, 2010)</ref>. Hence, Jordanian banks have begun to express concern regarding the low adoption rate of MB, as well as questioning the feasibility of introducing such a channel, especially given the large amount of resources being invested in this regard <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Migdadi, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In effect, persuading customers to switch their behaviour from using traditional banking channels to MB is not an easy process, especially as there is a lack of understanding of this phenomenon from the customers' perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Dwivedi and Irani, 2009)</ref>. Thus, understanding the factors that might be responsible for the sluggish adoption of MB could help the banks speed up the adoption rate of such technology. However, as it is in the early stage of deployment and implementation, MB-related issues are yet to be examined empirically in the Jordanian context. For that reason, this study is motivated to fill this gap by empirically examining the main factors influencing the adoption of MB from the Jordanian customers' perspective.</p><p>The remaining sections of the paper are structured as follows: the next section provides an overview of the relevant literature; a proposed conceptual model and associated hypotheses follow in Section 3. Section 4 outlines the research method. The results are then presented in Section 5 followed by a discussion in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 outlines the key conclusions and briefly discusses the main research limitations and future research directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>The MB-related issues have recently been the focus of attention for many researchers (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hanafizadeh et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lee et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lin, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Purwanegara et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Zhou et al., 2010)</ref>. However, examination of the usage patterns of MB (i.e. behavioural intention, usage behaviour, adoption, and continued intention to use) has received considerable interest over prior literature of MB (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lin, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Mishra and Bisht, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Purwanegara et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Zhou et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zhou, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Zhou, , 2012))</ref>. Theoretically, in their endeavours to provide an indepth understanding of customer intention and adoption of MB, researchers have formulated and integrated many theories and models from information systems (IS), information technologies (IT), and disciplines relating to human behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Dwivedi and Irani, 2009)</ref>. For instance, the Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Rogers, 2003)</ref> has been employed by along with perceived ease of use and trust (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lin, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hanafizadeh et al., 2014)</ref>, and customer experience with cell-phone technology, self-efficacy, and facilitating conditions as proposed by <ref type="bibr">Brown et al. (2003)</ref>. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Davis et al., 1989)</ref> has also been proposed bedside system quality and social influences by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gu et al. (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hanafizadeh et al. (2014)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Akturan and Tezcan (2012)</ref> to predict the customer intention and acceptance of MB. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref> was formulated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Luarn and Lin (2005)</ref> accompanied by perceived credibility in one single model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Püschel et al. (2010)</ref> modified their model based on factors extracted from the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour (DTPB) and the IDT. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref> has been used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Zhou et al. (2010)</ref> in the company of trust to predict the actual adoption of Mobile banking as well.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is a dearth of literature addressing behavioural intention and adoption of MB in Jordan <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Awwad and Ghadi, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Khraim et al., 2011)</ref>. Based on simple regression analyses, both <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Khraim et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Awwad and Ghadi (2010)</ref> have found that innovation attributes -trialability, complexity, compatibility, relative advantages, and risk -are the key predictors of Jordanian customer intention and adoption of MB. Even though these studies enriched the current understanding regarding the main predictors of the adoption of MB in Jordan, there is still a necessity of selecting a theoretical framework appropriate to the customers' perspective as well as being able to capture the most important aspects that could formulate the Jordanian customers' intention to adopt MB. Therefore, this study is motivated to fill this gap by proposing a parsimony conceptual model being able to provide a better understanding regarding the adoption of MB from the perspective of Jordanian banking customers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Conceptual Model and Research Hypotheses</head><p>The TAM was considered as an appropriate theoretical foundation for developing the conceptual model utilised in this study. Indeed, the TAM has been considered as one of the most popular and acceptable models within the IS field <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Rana et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. For instance, according to a Google scholar report, 7,714 citations have been recorded</p><p>for the original study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Davis et al. (1989)</ref> by the end of June 2010 <ref type="bibr">(Bradley, 2012)</ref>. Further, as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Rana et al. (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Venkatesh and Davis (2000)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Irani et al. (2009)</ref>, the TAM is one of the strongest and rational models to predict the individual's intention and acceptance over the last two decades. It is worthwhile to note that the TAM has been the most adopted theory to explain the customers' intention and usage of different kinds of electronic banking channels such as Internet banking (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Al-Somali et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Curran and Meuter, 2005)</ref> and Telebanking <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Sundarraj and Wu, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Curran and Meuter, 2007)</ref>. By the same token, the TAM has successfully been used by different Mobile banking studies to predict the customer intention and adoption towards this technology (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lee et al., 2007)</ref>. Furthermore, this study aims to propose a parsimonious model which is able to capture the most important aspects that could shape the Jordanian customers' intention and adoption of Mobile banking. Therefore, the TAM was found by the current study to be more suitable theoretical foundation to propose the conceptual model rather than the TAM2.</p><p>Building on the theory of reasoned action <ref type="bibr">(Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975)</ref>, TAM was proposed to examine the individual behaviour toward computer usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Davis et al., 1989)</ref>. In accordance with the TAM, two main constructs -perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU) -are identified as main predictors of the behavioural intention (BI) towards using the specified technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Davis et al., 1989)</ref>. Therefore, both PEOU and PU were proposed in the current study model as key factors influencing the Jordanian customers' intention to adopt MB (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Nevertheless, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness would not be able to provide a clear picture of explaining individual intention and behaviour-related technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Luarn and Lin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Riquelme and Rios, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Shareef et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zhou, 2011)</ref>. Therefore, the TAM has been modified and extended by including other factors such as perceived risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hanafizadeh et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Riquelme and Rios, 2010)</ref>, trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kim et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zhou, 2011)</ref> and self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Luarn and Lin, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Given that perceived risk (PR) has been recognised as one of the most important and frequently found factors influencing customers' intention and adoption of different electronic banking channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Curran and Meuter, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Eriksson et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gan et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jaruwachirathanakul and Fink, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kolodinsky et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Taylor and Strutton, 2010)</ref>, perceived risk was included as an extension to the TAM factors in the same conceptual model. Further justifications supporting and including PR has been provided in Section 3.3. Furthermore, in order to provide a better picture explaining the Jordanian customers' perception and intention towards MB, there was a necessity to include the role of personality factors among the conceptual model. Indeed, self-efficacy has been noticed over the related literature as one of the most repeated factors impacting the customers' perception towards such novel technologies (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Luarn and Lin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gu et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Püschel et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Zhou, 2012)</ref>. Self-efficacy (SE) therefore was comprised among the conceptual model along with TAM factors and perceived risk. Further discussions regarding the research hypotheses are provided in the following subsections.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Compeau and Higgins, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Davis et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Featherman and Pavlou, 2003)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Perceived Usefulness (PU)</head><p>PU is conceptualised as 'the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance' <ref type="bibr">(Davis et al., 1989, p.320)</ref>. Over the prior literature, PU has been noticed as one of the most influential drivers of BI to adopt MB <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Akturan and Tezcan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hanafizadeh et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kapoor et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Luarn and Lin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wessels and Drennan, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Williams et al., 2015)</ref>. Such as, PU was empirically supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wessels and Drennan (2010)</ref>  According to the model of PC utilisation (MPCU), the actual use behaviour could be directly influenced by the role perceived consequences (i.e. perceived usefulness, job-fit) <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Thompson et al., 1991)</ref>. With reference to <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Triandis (1977)</ref>, individual behaviour is usually determined by potential behavioural outcomes that are attractive and are more likely to be attended. Al-Qeisi and Abdallah (2013) supported this assumption by confirming a strong relationship between performance expectancy (similar factor to PU as proposed by Venkatesh et al.</p><p>( 3.2 Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) <ref type="bibr">Davis et al. (1989, p.320</ref>) defined PEOU as 'the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort'. Due to the particular nature of MB which requires a certain level of knowledge and skill, PEOU could play a crucial role in determining the customers' intention to use such technology. This thought has been empirically supported by different MB studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Akturan and Tezcan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hanafizadeh et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Luarn and Lin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Püschel et al., 2010)</ref>. In keeping with the argument of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Davis et al. (1989)</ref>, individuals could also be involved in the cognitive trade-off process between the efforts required to successfully apply the technology in front of the benefits and advantages attained by using such technology. Therefore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Davis et al. (1989)</ref> articulated that PEOU could contribute to the BI directly or indirectly by facilitating the impact of PU on BI. Such a causal relationship between PEOU and PU has been largely proven by many researchers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Luarn and Lin, 2005)</ref> who examined the customer adoption of MB. Thus, this study assumes the following hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3: Perceived ease of use will positively influence Jordanian customers' intention to adopt MB.</head><p>H4: Perceived ease of use will positively influence perceived usefulness of using MB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Perceived Risk (PR)</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Pavlou (2001, p.109)</ref>, PR is conceptualised as 'the consumer's subjective expectation of suffering a loss in pursuit of a desired outcome.' In fact, customers could experience different kinds of risk such as performance, social, financial, psychological, and physical which makes the impacting the role of PR on BI more complicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Featherman and Pavlou, 2003)</ref>. Moreover, customers are more apprehensive for the aspects pertaining to disconnection problems and their probability; this is coupled with their concerns associated with third parties, electronic piracy and cybercrimes which, in turn, lets customers be more hesitant in accepting online banking channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Poon, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Indeed, there are several reasons for supporting and including perceived risk among the conceptual model proposed. Firstly, outcomes of using electronic banking channels have been extensively characterised with a high degree of uncertainty, intangibility, heterogeneity and vagueness <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Curran and Meuter, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Eriksson et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gan et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jaruwachirathanakul and Fink, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kolodinsky et al., 2004)</ref>. Therefore, using such a channel to attain the financial transactions could comprise of further financial, performance and privacy risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Martins et al., 2014)</ref>. Secondly, an increase in the rate of electronic financial crimes in Jordan over the last decade in addition to the media focus on such crimes represents another reason for the increased concerns among the Jordanian banking customers to use the electronic banking channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Addustour, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Al Sukkar and Hasan, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">BBC Arabic, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">SarayNews, 2011)</ref>. Therefore, it was clearly noticed that perceived risk could be one of the most important aspects that might play a vital role in forming the Jordanian customers' intention to use the SST banking channels.</p><p>A closer look at the relevant studies leads the authors to observe that PR is one of the most important obstacles hindering the customers' willingness to adopt MB (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Akturan and Tezcan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cruz et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hanafizadeh et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lee et al., 2007)</ref>. Furthermore, in their Meta analyses of twenty-five articles in the area of online channels, Taylor and Strutton (2010) asserted a negative impact of PR on the behavioural intention with an average weight effect of -0.46. Accordingly, this study assumes the following hypothesis:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H5: Perceived risk will negatively influence the Jordanian customers'</head><p>intention to adopt MB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Self-efficacy</head><p>Self-efficacy could be identified as perception and confidence of individuals in their ability to manage and conduct a set of particular actions needed to achieve specified kinds of performances <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bandura, 1986)</ref>. Within the context of the information system, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Compeau and Higgins (1995)</ref> stressed the important role of self-efficacy in contributing to both individuals' willingness to adopt new technology and their perception towards the expectation of outcomes by using such systems. These expectations were categorised by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Compeau and Higgins (1995)</ref> into two subgroups: performance expectation, which is related to behavioural outcomes of job performance; and personal outcome expectations such as individual esteem and sense of accomplishment. Accordingly, it could be argued that banking customers, who enjoy an adequate level of self-efficacy, are more likely to perceive using MB to be useful in their life as well as the simple technology to be used <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Püschel et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Wang et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>This is especially important when considering the nature of MB as one of the most recent and novel kind of self-service banking technologies requiring the customer to conduct financial transactions by himself and away from any support of banking staff <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Püschel et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Zhou et al., 2010)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref> indicated that the conceptual and operational dimensions of self-efficacy are different from effort expectancy (perceived ease of use). <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref> also added that the impact of self-efficacy on the behavioural intention is restricted by the mediating effect of perceived ease of use. Therefore, the current study proposes self-efficacy as an indirect predictor of behavioural intention by being a mediating role of both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Further customers' perception and confidence in their ability to use Mobile banking could help them to mitigate their anxious risks perceived in using such a system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bandura, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Luo et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Walker and Johnson, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Zhou, 2012)</ref>. This though has also been empirically supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Walker and Johnson (2006)</ref> who noticed that observed perceived risk was negatively correlated with customer beliefs of capacity. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Walker and Johnson (2006)</ref> argued that customers are more likely to see that using self-service technologies will be less risky if they have a positive perception and confidence in their ability to use such a system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kim et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Research Methodology</head><p>A self-administered questionnaire was employed to collect data using a convenience sample of 500 Jordanian banking customers from two main cities: Amman and Al-Balqa`. In total, twenty-eight scale items were adapted from prior information system literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Compeau and Higgins, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Davis et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Featherman and Pavlou, 2003)</ref> to measure the main underlying constructs encompassed in the conceptual model (See Appendix 1). The main constructs of the TAM (PU and PEOU) were measured by items adapted from Davis et al.</p><p>(1989) while items for PR were drawn from <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Featherman and Pavlou (2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Featherman and Pavlou's (2003)</ref> scale covered the main dimensions of PR (i.e. performance risk, financial risk, privacy risk, and social risk). Five items of SE were selected from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Compeau and Higgins' (1995)</ref> scale. All of these items were measured using the 7-point Likert scale ranging from 'strongly disagree (1)' to 'strongly agree (7)' <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dwivedi et al. 2006)</ref>. As seen in Appendix 1, five of the most common banking transactions were also selected to measure the adoption behaviour of MB. The seven-point time scale was adopted to measure the adoption behaviour towards these services with anchors including: never, once a year, several times a year, once a month, several times a month, several times a week, several times a day <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>. The questionnaire also included six closed-ended questions to represent the respondents' demographic characteristics.</p><p>As Arabic is the native language of the respondents being targeted in the current study (Jordanian banking customers), the questionnaire, therefore, was converted into the Arabic language using the back translation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Brislin, 1976)</ref>. This was followed by conducting a pilot study to assure the adequate level of reliability in the measurements used as well as to avoid any confusions or contradictions prior to conducting the main survey. Therefore, thirty questionnaires were allocated to a sample of Jordanian banking customers who were asked to fill the given questionnaire and provide any comments about it. Indeed, only twenty-two questionnaires were returned. Noticeably, the vast majority of those respondents indicated that the language used was clear and filling the questionnaire did not consume much time.</p><p>Moreover, an inspection of Cronbach's alpha values was undertaken to see the scale items being able to have an acceptable level of reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bhattacherjee, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Sekaran, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents all the values of Cronbach's coefficient alpha; they were found to be as low as (0.75) and as high as (0.92).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Respondents' Profile and Characteristics</head><p>Out of 500 questionnaires distributed, 343 (68.8%) completed questionnaires were returned and considered valid for further statistical analyses. The main descriptive statistics suggested that the vast majority of respondents were male (65.6%) with their age ranging mainly from 25 to 40 (66%) and most of them have a Bachelor's degree or above (80%). About 91% of the respondents also have had more than 3 years' experience with the computer and Internet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Outliers</head><p>An examination of the values of Mahalanobis-D squared distance (D 2 ) provided in the AMOS output file indicated that there are 17 outlier cases with a p value less that cut-off point &lt;0.001 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Even though removing these outlier cases could enhance the multivariate analysis, the results generalisability could be negatively reflected by doing this <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hair et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007)</ref>. Moreover, due to the large sample size for the three data sets, a small number of outliers would not be problematic <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kline, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007)</ref>. Accordingly, the decision was taken to retain these outliers for all three data sets. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Normality</head><p>A skewness-kurtosis approach was adopted to test univariate normality for each variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hair et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kline, 2005)</ref>. Using AMOS 21, the statistical values of skewness and kurtosis were tested and found that they were within their respective levels. As reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, all the given values support the normality of univariate distribution, as all values of skewness were recognised to be below their cut-off point of 3 as well as all values of kurtosis were found to be not more than 8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kline, 2005)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) Analysis</head><p>To validate the proposed conceptual model and to examine the research hypotheses, the twostage SEM approach using AMOS21 was employed; it began with evaluating the measurement model and then estimating the structural model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Byrne, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.1">Measurement Model Analyses</head><p>In the measurement model stage, the model fitness was tested initially followed by evaluating the constructs' reliability and validity. The initial fit indices were found as follow: CMIN/DF = 2.098: ≤3.000; GFI = 0.87: ≥0.900; AGFI = 0.79: ≥0.80; NFI = 0.88: ≥0.900; CFI = 0.93: ≥0.900; RMSEA = 0.057: ≤0.07. By comparing these fit indices with their recommended values, it was found that some of them -GFI, AGFI and NFI -were not able to attain the acceptable level <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Anderson and Gerbing, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hair et al., 2010)</ref>. This, in turn, demonstrated that the measurement model had poor fit to the observed data <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Byrne 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hair et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, there was a need to conduct a purification process on the measurement model by removing the problematic items ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Byrne 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hair et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the standardised regression weight table, three items (one item from SE, one item from PR and one item from adoption) were found to have values less than their cut-off value of 0.50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hair et al., 2010)</ref>. Therefore, all of these items were removed from the revised version of the measurement model. Further, one item from behavioural intention and another one from PEOU were found to have residual values (4.5689 and 4.2459 respectively), and accordingly, the decision was to delete these two items as well <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 1995)</ref>. By doing so, the revised version of the measurement model was tested without including these problematic items. All the fit indices at this time were able to reach their threshold level as follow: CMIN/DF = 1.792: ≤3.000; GFI = 0.913: ≥0.900; AGFI = 0.888: ≥ 0.80; NFI = 0.938: ≥ 0.900, CFI = 0.971: ≥ 0.900; RMSEA = 0.048 ≤ 0.07.</p><p>All constructs were also tested to ensure an adequate level of scales reliability using composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE). As seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, the CR value for all latent constructs existed within their respective level of higher than 0.70 as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hair et al. (2010)</ref>. By the same token, the AVE value of the latent constructs ranged from 0.54 (adoption) to 0.81 (BI); all of them were above their threshold value of .50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hair et al., 2010)</ref>. Moreover, both convergent and discriminant validities were inspected to perform the constructs' validity. All scale items have a factor loading above the threshold value of 0.50 and were found statistically significant with a p value of less than 0.001. Relating to the discriminant validity, as seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, the squared root of AVE for each construct was larger than the corresponding inter-constructs-correlation estimates. Finally, the statistical results on Harman's single-factor indicated that no single factor was able to emerge; the first factor was able to account for 43.401 per cent of variance which is less than the cut-off value of 50 per cent as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Podsakoff et al. (2003)</ref>. Thus, there were no concerns regarding the common method bias. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.2">Structural Model Analyses</head><p>In the second of the SEM analyses, an inspection of the structural model was conducted with eight causal paths. The fit indices of the structural model were tested and found to be within their acceptable level: such as, CMIN/DF=2.120; GFI=0.90; AGFI=0.87; NFI=0.92; CFI=0.96 and RMSEA=0.057. Thus, the structural model adequately fitted the observed data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Anderson and Gerbing, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Byrne, 2010)</ref>. Besides, the structural model was able to explain 58 per cent and 33 per cent of variance in BI and actual adoption respectively (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>).  Furthermore, an assessment of path coefficients showed that PU (γ=0.36, p&lt;0.001); PEOU (γ=0.44, p&lt;0.001); and PR (γ= -0.12, p&lt;0.004) were all found to be significant predictors of BI. PEOU (γ=0.53, p&lt;0.001) was also recognised as a considerable determinant of PU (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Consequently, all research hypotheses -H1, H2, H3 and H4 -are approved. SE was approved to be a significant predictor of PR (γ= -0.30, p&lt;0.001), PEOU (γ= 0.61, p&lt;0.001)</p><p>and PU (γ= 0.26, p&lt;0.001). Finally, adoption of MB was strongly predicted by both BI (γ= 0.47, p&lt;0.001) and PU (γ= 0.15, p&lt;0.040).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>This study was conducted with the intention of providing further understanding regarding the main factors that could shape the clients' intention and adoption of MB in Jordan. Therefore, to achieve this aim, a parsimonious model comprising factors taken from TAM (PU and PEOU) along with PR and SE was proposed. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>, the statistical results supported the predictive power of the conceptual model in explaining adequate variance in BI. Specifically, all values of R 2 [BI (58%), PU (51%), PEOU (38%), PR (30%) and adoption (33%)] were observed within an acceptable level of 30% as suggested by <ref type="bibr">Arambewela and Hall (2009)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Holmes-Smith et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Kline (2011)</ref>. In addition, such values of R 2 in the current study are fairly close to those accounted for by other IS and MB studies that have been formulated using TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Akturan and Tezcan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kim et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Venkatesh and Davis, 2000)</ref>. This, in turn, provided further evidence supporting the conceptual model proposed in the current study to explain the Jordanian customers' intention and adoption of MB.</p><p>Taking into account the absence of a credible and updated list including the Jordanian banking customers or their contacts, as well as the banks preventing any information regarding their customers for privacy and security reasons, convenience sampling was found to be the more appropriate approach to be conducted to reach the banking customers in the present study <ref type="bibr">(Castillo, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dillon et al., 1994)</ref>. However, such a technique is more likely to be vulnerable to sampling bias. This is attributed to fact that units in non-probability samples are not randomly chosen, and accordingly, measuring the errors of sampling is not possible for those kinds of samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bhattacherjee, 2012)</ref>. Conducting such sampling technique could also lead to systematically avoiding the inclusion of other banking customers who exist in different bank branches or somewhere else at the time of allocating the questionnaires <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bhattacherjee, 2012)</ref>. So, to address the issues related to convenience sample generalizability and to reduce the probability of sampling bias, a large sample size was used.</p><p>In addition, the researcher was keen to have a better representation of the targeted population considering the diversity in the banking customers' profiles and characteristics (e.g.</p><p>education level, income level, gender, occupation, area of residence, social status) during the distribution of the questionnaires <ref type="bibr">(Miller et al., 2002)</ref>. The self-administered questionnaires were personally allocated in an attempt to address the problem related to the lower response rate; there was a chance to remind and motivate respondents to fill in the questionnaires and return them as soon as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bhattacherjee, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Saunders et al., 2003)</ref>. Theoretically, convenience sampling has been noticed as one of the most popular and frequently used sampling techniques applied to the studies of organisations and consumers <ref type="bibr">(Bryman and Bell, 2007)</ref>. Furthermore, several studies either in the technology acceptance field (i.e. <ref type="bibr">Taylor and Todd, 1995a)</ref> or in the online banking context have successfully used the convenience sampling technique (i.e. <ref type="bibr">Brown et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Curran and Meuter, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dean, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Khraim et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Purwanegara et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Zhou et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The statistical results highly proved PU as a key factor predicting both BI with a weight of 0.36 and actual adoption of MB with a regression weight of 0.15. In other words, Jordanian customers seem to be more motivated to adopt MB if they perceive it as more effective, productive, and a useful technology in their daily life. Likewise, the adoption of MB services is more likely to increase among those customers who perceive such system as a more useful and efficient channel to attain the banking transactions. This could be attributed to the ability of MB as a convenient way of allowing customers to access a wide range of the highest quality financial services without any time or place restrictions. Theoretically, these results are parallel with prior studies of MB that have tested and approved PU as a crucial factor in determining the customers' intention (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Akturan and Tezcan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hanafizadeh et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Luarn and Lin, 2005)</ref> and actual adoption of <ref type="bibr">MB (i.e. Al-Qeisi and Abdallah, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Zhou et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The empirical results have also supported the significant relationship between PEOU and BI with a weight of 0.44. This, in turn, means that respondents were more likely to have a higher intention to adopt MB if they perceived that the use of such technology was not difficult and required less effort. Given the particular nature of MB, a certain level of knowledge and skill is required to properly use such system. Furthermore, using MB requires customers to perform all tasks alone without any assistance from banking staff which, in turn, PEOU could play a crucial role in determining the customers' intention to use MB. Such results of PEOU extracted in the current study are in line with existing literature in the IS area (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref> and in MB as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hanafizadeh et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Luarn and Lin, 2005)</ref>. PEOU was also found to be a key predictor of PU with a weight of 0.53. In other words, if the customers perceive that using MB needs less effort and is not difficult, they will perceive to use such a system more advantageously and be more useful in their daily life <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Davis et al., 1989)</ref>. By the same token, several studies in the area of MB have supported the instrumental influence of PEOU as a contributing factor of BI via PU (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Luarn and Lin, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>SE was also found to be key predictors of PU, PEOU and PR. To put it differently, those customers who enjoy an adequate level of SE are more likely to have a positive perception that MB is more useful, easy and a less risky to attain the banking transactions. By increasing the daily interaction with technology and mobile innovation and having an adequate level of technological savvy, awareness, skills, and knowledge, individuals are more likely to be confident in their ability to get used to new technology as long as they are less likely to be influenced by the degree of difficulties that exist in technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Castañeda et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Davis et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Venkatesh et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Venkatesh et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wessels and Drennan, 2010)</ref>. Over the prior literature, there are several studies that have supported the important role of SE in contributing both PEOU and PU <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Al-Somali et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cheng et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Luarn and Lin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Wang et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Zhao et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, this study empirically proved that PR was a significant negative factor determining the BI to adopt MB (γ=-0.12). Accordingly, it could be concluded that Jordanian customers are less likely to be encouraged to adopt MB with a higher degree of expectation of suffering a loss as a result of using such a system. This relationship could return to the particular and sensitive nature of the banking industry in general as well as online banking technology which is universally characterised by a high uncertainty, intangibility, heterogeneity and vagueness along with the absence of human interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Akturan and Tezcan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lee et al., 2007)</ref>. It is also worthwhile noting that within the Jordanian bank sector, Alalwan et al.</p><p>(2014) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Khraim et al. (2011)</ref> strongly support the impacting role of PR on the Jordanian customers' intention and acceptance of MB and Internet banking. This could be attributed to the increase in the number of electronic financial crimes in Jordan over the last ten years as reported by the mass media in Jordan in particular, and the Middle East in general (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Alghad, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">BBC Arabic, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> The Jordan Times, 2014).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Research Contribution</head><p>This study has significantly contributed to the knowledge and literature in Jordan by focusing more on MB as a more novel technology which, so far, has not been well evaluated in the Jordanian context. From a statistical point of view, the empirical results highly support the adequacy of the TAM factors, SE and PR to predict the customers' intention and adoption of MB. Hence, aspects relating to these factors must be the focus of attention of any bank in their endeavour to motivate their customers to use MB. Practically, expanding the range of financial services provided by the MB and maintaining the permanency of their performance efficiently and effectively, 24/7 will support the role of PU <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jaruwachirathanakul and Fink, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Zhou et al., 2010)</ref>. Moreover, a simple and friendly design of MB services will not only enhance the ease of use perceived in using such a channel but also will contribute to the role of PU <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jaruwachirathanakul and Fink, 2005)</ref>. Further, an effective, personal and practical training programme that will educate customers on how they can efficiently use MB could be more helpful to override any complexity and confusion related to the use of this system <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Laukkanen et al., 2008)</ref>. Such a programme could also enhance the individuals' self-efficacy which, in turn, contributes to their perception towards such systems as more useful and easier than less banking channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Compeau and Higgins, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>More effort should be spent on alleviating customers' concerns and apprehensions from using MB as well. In this regard, banks should benefit from the advancement in the biometric technology area which introduces many solutions and tools to improve the customers' authentication mechanisms such as fingerprints and iris recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Laukkanen et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Other strategies that could be more useful in mitigating PR include a money-back guarantee policy in the case of fraud; along with improving a structural assurance to prevent any hacking and piracy processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Yousafzai et al., 2005)</ref>.</p></div>

Firstly, this study just considers MB, which negatively reflects on the results' generalisability to other kinds of online banking channels. Therefore, future research should consider other channels such as Internet banking and Telebanking. Secondly, there are other factors that have been ignored and therefore should be measured by future researches such as intrinsic motivation, financial limitations, trust and habit. Thirdly, while this study has been conducted in Jordan which, in turn, mitigates the generalisability of the current results, future researches could worthily employ comparative studies by considering technological, cultural, and human differences between developed and developing countries. Fourthly, this study concentrated on the customers' intention adoption; yet, customer satisfaction, word-of-mouth, and customer loyalty as a consequence of using MB will be valuable directions to be examined in future researches.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Proposed Conceptual Model of the Adoption of MB by Jordanian Customers (Adapted from<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Compeau and Higgins, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Davis et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Featherman and Pavlou, 2003)</ref> </figDesc><graphic coords="7,72.00,86.64,439.56,252.84" type="bitmap" /></figure>
