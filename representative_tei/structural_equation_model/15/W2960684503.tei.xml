<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Live streaming is now a new trend worldwide: with a live streaming app, anyone can broadcast anything, from eating, gaming to singing; and people can watch all kinds of live streams anytime and anywhere. Data shows that in 2017, 48% of Internet users in the U.S. watched live streaming at least once a week <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kats, 2017)</ref>. Based on the report published by China Internet Network Information Center, live streaming users in China reached 422 million by 2017, accounting for more than half of China's whole Internet population <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(CNNIC, 2018)</ref>. At times, the number of viewers for a particular live stream can go beyond one million during the broadcasts by popular streamers. Another remarkable fact of live streaming lies in the large revenue it can generate. The market size of live streaming in China was valued at USD 3 billion in 2016 which was an increase of 180% compared to <ref type="bibr">2015</ref><ref type="bibr">(iResearch, 2017a))</ref>. Goldman Sachs estimated that by 2020, China's live streaming market could expand to USD 15 billion <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cheng, 2017)</ref>. The novel function embedded in live streaming-the consumption of virtual gifts-has led to the emergence of a new monetization model. Virtual gifts are digital pictographs such as virtual flowers or virtual yachts offered by live streaming platforms with the price ranging from RMB 0.10 (around USD 1.45 Cents) to RMB 10,000 (around USD 1,451). Viewers can purchase virtual gifts via online payments during the broadcast of a live stream to express their appreciation for the streamer. The virtual gifts received by the streamer can be converted into cash and the revenue is then split between the streamer and the platform. The consumption of virtual gifts contributes to the vast majority of live streaming revenues <ref type="bibr">(The Economist, 2017)</ref>. In China, popular streamers can potentially earn a lot. For example, it is reported that Yu Li, who came from a hardscrabble area in North China and used to fix trucks in a small city, now earns USD100,000 per month as a streamer <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Rauhala, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Different from other forms of social media, live streaming can be seen as a hybrid involving video content, real-time communication and consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Li et al., 2018)</ref>. It is also worth noting that in contrast with the consumption in online shopping, the consumption made in live streaming is mainly to express appreciation. Despite the popularity of live streaming and its distinctive features, live streaming has not received much research attention. Previous literature on social media has mainly focused on addressing the issues of social media adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Zolkepli and Kamarulzaman, 2015)</ref>, users' engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Labrecque, 2014)</ref> and knowledge contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Majchrzak et al., 2013)</ref>, as well as how social media serves as a marketing intelligence tool for marketers <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lamberton and Stephen, 2016)</ref>. Limited attention has been paid to users' continuous participation or consumption in social media. The study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kim et al. (2012)</ref> has investigated members' purchase of virtual items for themselves in social network sites for self-identity communication purpose. However, lacking in previous research is an explanation of people's behavior of purchasing virtual gifts for others in live streaming. The lack of a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon offers an opportunity to explore the extent to which existing theories can explain people's behavior in such a new context. How can live streaming platforms survive in the intensified market competition? How can they continuously attract people's attention and create value? These are the concerns of the live streaming industry. A better understanding of the factors influencing viewers' willingness to participate continuously and to purchase virtual gifts can yield the potential of guiding streamers and platforms to refine their strategies.</p><p>The gaps in existing literature and the practical problems faced by the live streaming industry serve as motivations for our study. This research aims to investigate the factors that can influence people's intentions of continuous watching and consumption in live streaming. Consumption intention here refers to viewers' intention to purchase and give virtual gifts to steamers. Due to the limited research in this area, a mixed-methods research design was applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Furneaux and Wade, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Venkatesh et al., 2016)</ref>. This study adopts a theoretical lens from the Uses and Gratification Theory (UGT) which suggests that people's behavior in social media is affected by the extent to which their needs are satisfied <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Zolkepli and Kamarulzaman, 2015)</ref>. This study thus focuses on people's core psychological needs -entertainment and social interaction. The initial theoretical framing was used to guide a series of semi-structured interviews with viewers to identify salient influences. The research framework and hypotheses evolved based on the interview results were empirically tested via survey using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).</p><p>This research makes several important contributions. First, we employ a mixed-methods research design to explore the viewer's behavioral intentions in live streaming, extending our understanding of social media-enabled business models. Second, the theoretical framework developed explores how people's core needs in terms of entertainment and social interaction are satisfied in live streaming. It combines interactivity, social status display and stimuli together to explain people's continuous watching intention of live streaming and consumption intention of virtual gifts. Our findings suggest that interactivity, social status display, humor appeal and sex appeal are important factors influencing the viewer's behavioral intentions in live streaming. Third, the relationships are examined under three types of live streaming respectively, namely event, education and personal sharing. We highlight how these factors can shape viewer behavior differently under different live streaming types. Accordingly, practical suggestions can be provided to platforms and streamers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Live Streaming</head><p>The world has witnessed the emergence of live streaming. The global live streaming market was predicted to expand from USD 30.29 billion in 2016 to USD 70.05 billion by 2021 <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Research and Markets, 2016)</ref>. Live streaming is particularly popular among the young generation. For example, in 2016, 63% of the U.S. Internet users aged between 18 and 34 watched live streaming <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(EMarketer, 2017)</ref>. In China, more than three quarters of mobile live streaming users were below the age of 36 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cheung, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>One feature of live streaming lies in the social aspect, that is, the real-time interaction. Viewers can post real-time questions and comments which are visible to the streamer and all other viewers.</p><p>The streamer can therefore react immediately. The next remarkable feature lies in the new monetization modelthe consumption of virtual gifts provided by the platform. It is visible to both the streamer and other viewers regarding what the gifts are, whom the gifts are from, and how many gifts in total are received by the streamer. The new monetization model has created considerable value. For example, YY, a popular live streaming platform in China, achieved roughly USD 1 billion net revenue in 2016, most of which was from viewers' consumption of virtual gifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen, 2017)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>  Despite its rapid growth, live streaming also faces challenges. The competition is increasingly fierce. For example, a live streaming platform named Guangquan recently shut down as it struggled to keep up with its rivals <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Yu, 2017)</ref>. Moreover, among the viewers in China, only 21.4% purchased virtual gifts although the consumption of virtual gifts is the major revenue contribution of most live streaming platforms <ref type="bibr">(iResearch, 2017a)</ref>. Further monetization of the traffic is a big challenge for the live streaming industry. In order to enhance the competitiveness of live streaming platforms and the performance of streamers, there is a need for a deep understanding of the factors influencing viewers' behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Theoretical Framing</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Uses and Gratification Theory</head><p>In this study, we introduce the UGT to investigate whether live streaming attracts people by satisfying their psychological needs. The UGT has already been used to explain why people watch video game streaming on platforms such as Twitch <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Sjöblom and Hamari, 2017)</ref>. It assumes people to be active users in terms of media choice. User choice of certain media is driven by the gratifications the media brings. Prior studies have attempted to classify different types of needs that motivate people to choose certain media. For instance, West and Turner (2010) have categorized five types of motivation: cognitive, affective, personal integration, social integration and tension release. Affective motivation refers to the need for entertainment <ref type="bibr">(Wei and Lu, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Tension release can also be incorporated as a dimension of entertainment <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Korgaonkar and Wolin, 1999)</ref>. Accordingly, we believe that the need for entertainment can be a type of people's core needs motivating people to use certain media. Other dimensions such as personal integration and social integration reflect one's need for social interaction. Based on prior studies, entertainment and social interaction can be the core needs that motivate people to use social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Zolkepli and Kamarulzaman, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Liu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sjöblom and Hamari, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dux, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Social Interaction</head><p>Given that people's need for social interaction is critical in driving them to use live streaming <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Sjöblom and Hamari, 2017)</ref>, interactivity and presence are system features that should be considered as they enable smooth and effective communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bao et al., 2016)</ref>. Moreover, it is found that people use social media to express and enhance their social status <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Sjöblom and Hamari, 2017)</ref>. Hence, the features enabling people to display and express their social status may also influence viewer behavior in live streaming. The following three factors are thus proposed:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Interactivity</head><p>Interactivity is seen as a key element in online communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Ou et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Tajvidi et al., 2017)</ref>. It refers to the extent to which people are allowed to communicate in real time <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Steuer, 1992)</ref>. It encompasses three dimensions, namely active control, two-way communication and synchronicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Liu, 2003)</ref>. Active control refers to the degree of control that participants have over the information exchanged; two-way communication indicates that the interaction allows two-way flow of information; and synchronicity means the degree to which participants are able to communicate synchronously. Previous studies have shown that interactivity is closely related to positive attitudes such as trust and satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bao et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Teo et al., 2003)</ref>. In e-marketplace, interactivity plays a critical role in building good relationships between buyers and sellers as it helps achieve high-quality communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Ou et al., 2014)</ref>. As such, we believe that interactivity may account for viewer behavior in live streaming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Presence</head><p>Presence is one's perception of being in an environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Steuer, 1992)</ref>. It often consists of two dimensions: telepresence and social presence. Telepresence is defined as one's sense of being present in an environment induced by the medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kim and Biocca, 1997)</ref>. It describes the feeling of physical closeness to a remote person. Social presence refers to one's awareness of other people and interpersonal relationships during the interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Khalifa and Shen, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lowry et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>It reflects psychological distance between the communicator and the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Khalifa and Shen, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Richardson and Swan, 2003)</ref>. While telepresence reflects the extent of physical proximity one feels, social presence reveals the degree of psychological proximity in terms of human contact, human sensitivity and warmth <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gefen and Straub, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ou et al., 2014)</ref>. Presence can lead to rich interpersonal relationships and contribute to the purchase and repurchase intentions in online shopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gefen and Straub, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ou et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jin et al., 2017)</ref>. Thus, it is possible that presence in live streaming is appreciated by viewers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Social Status Display</head><p>It is suggested that 'social status is frequently thought of as the relative ranking of members of each social class in terms of specific status factors' <ref type="bibr">(Schiffman and Kanuk, 2004, p. 372)</ref>.</p><p>Consumption as a manifestation of one's social status was first prescribed in the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">O'Cass and Frost (2004)</ref> where conspicuous consumption is a characteristic of the social class with certain accumulated wealth. Studies have shown that people's consumption motivations are driven by how consumption can allow individuals to associate themselves with a higher social status and boost their self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(O'Shaughnessy and O'Shaughnessy, 2002)</ref>. Apart from the enhancement of selfesteem, another reason for social status display can be the desire to achieve social compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Goldsmith et al., 1996)</ref>. People with higher social status are more likely to gain social approval within the group <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Solomon, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ger and Belk, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Goldsmith et al., 1996)</ref>. In live streaming, many viewers do not purchase virtual gifts, so the consumption behavior can differentiate viewers who buy virtual gifts from average viewers. Some viewers may show off their financial power by buying expensive virtual gifts. Therefore, social status display is considered in live streaming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Entertainment</head><p>Entertainment can be the core need that drives people to use social media. Advertising studies have already elaborated how stimuli (e.g., humor appeal and sex appeal) can shape people's behavior by satisfying their needs for entertainment <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Whiting and Williams, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1.">Stimuli</head><p>In live streaming, streamers seek to retain viewers' attention and to stimulate their consumptions.</p><p>Live streams thus can be considered not only as the products or services that streamers offer and 'sell', but also as advertisements that streamers use to promote themselves and attract viewers.</p><p>Advertisements are persuasive stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Moore and Lutz, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bart et al., 2014)</ref>. Accordingly, we expect that live streams can also serve as advertising stimuli and have persuasive power.</p><p>A well-recognized advertising stimulus in marketing literature is humor. Humor appeal is often characterized with incongruent framing, such as bringing together frames beyond people's expectation or reinterpreting the original frames <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Conway and Dubé, 2002)</ref>. With humor appeal, people tend to experience pleasure and emotional release <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Spielmann, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sternthal and Craig, 1973)</ref>. Moreover, humor appeal may attract people's attention toward the message and stimulate information processing. The increased attention is likely to enhance comprehension, yielding, retention and action regarding the message. In addition, humor appeal may activate arousal, causing positive affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lammers et al., 1983)</ref>. Prior literature has also suggested that humor can function as a reward which in turn affects persuasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Markiewicz, 1974)</ref>.</p><p>Another commonly studied advertisement stimulus is sex appeal. Sex appeal involves sexually erotic features including body display, sexual and suggestive behaviors, and sexual referents <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Reichert, et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Reichert, 2002)</ref>. Body display is about displaying the human body in revealing ways. There are different levels of body display depending on what clothes are worn and how much is revealed. Sexual behaviors are provocative actions. For example, exposing the neck and talking in seductive tone are commonly used sexual behaviors in advertisements. Sexual referent involves using verbal and/or visual elements for sexual innuendo or suggestive double entendre. Previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Das et al. 2015)</ref> have suggested that sex appeal may affect the effectiveness of advertisement through four mechanisms. First, sex appeal tends to elicit momentary and prolonged attentional responses. Second, sex appeal may stimulate positive (e.g., attraction) or negative (e.g., embarrassment) affective responses. Third, sex appeal may cause misattribution of arousal where people misinterpret their physiological activities as caused by the interest in the brand or product. In addition, sex appeals may also influence information processing and distract people from elaborating informational content.</p><p>Humor and sex appeal are common in live streams. Although encouraging the use of humorous communication skills and employing good-looking individuals are widely-used strategies in live streaming, few studies have empirically investigated their impacts. Therefore, this study adopts the concepts of humor appeal and sex appeal from marketing literature to study their effects on viewers' continuous watching intention and consumption intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Qualitative Exploration</head><p>There is limited consolidated research investigating the live streaming phenomenon in a systematic way. According to <ref type="bibr">Venkatesh et al. (2016)</ref>, when researchers try to holistically investigate a phenomenon that lacks systematic and conclusive studies, a mixed-methods research design should be applied. Therefore, a sequential mixed-methods research design is employed in this study. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Furneaux and Wade (2011)</ref>, this research started with an exploratory qualitative study and then a quantitative study was conducted to test the refined framework.</p><p>The initial theoretical foundation aims to develop an understanding of potential factors that may play important roles in live streaming. We expected that knowledge about the phenomenon would increase as the study progressed. This research adopted the semi-structured interview to explore the following questions: What types of live streaming did people watch? What factors might have salient influences on continuous watching and consumption intentions in live streaming?</p><p>The semi-structured interview method was selected for the following reasons. First, it enables indepth investigation of research questions from each participant's independent perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Furneaux and Wade, 2011)</ref>. Furthermore, it can avoid potential embarrassment of sharing opinions in front of a group. It also enables researchers to raise new issues during the process <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bryman and Bell, 2011</ref>). An interview guide was developed based on the initial theoretical framing for qualitative investigation. It also incorporated questions about participants' watching habits such as the types of live streaming they often watched.</p><p>The criterion-based sampling was used to look for participants who had diversified experience of watching live streaming or spending money in live streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Furneaux and Wade, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Participants were university students (selected from different universities) as the main users of live streaming are from the younger generation. According to recent reports and news, around 70% of live streaming users were under 30 years old and university students played a dominant role in the growth of live streaming industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Larson, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lin and Lu, 2017)</ref>. The interview participants of this study had rich experience of watching and/or consumption experience in different types of live streaming. We continued seeking participants until no new type of live streaming was mentioned and each type of live streaming was equally mentioned <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Strauss and Corbin, 1998)</ref>. A total of 16 participants were interviewed. The general information about the participants is illustrated in Appendix A. Each interview was held for around 35 minutes. All interviews were radio recorded with participants' consent. The interviews were conducted in Chinese and then transcribed into English based on the recordings by one researcher and one translator independently. The final version of the transcript was decided upon the agreement between the researcher and the translator <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brislin, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Temple and Young, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Data Analysis</head><p>The texts were analyzed using manual coding. Two coders were required to independently and iteratively read the transcripts, as well as to label the texts to identify all possible motivations and any other relevant factors. This was to ensure that the salient factors came from the data set instead of the prejudice of researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Furneaux and Wade, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Strauss and Corbin, 1998)</ref>. When each concise code set was established, the codes were checked to ensure coding consistency. The process stopped when coders reached an agreement on the codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bryman and Bell, 2011)</ref>. Based on the agreed coding scheme, two coders processed the full transcripts and discussed the inconsistencies until reaching an agreement on the final version.</p><p>Typology of live streaming was identified based on the information provided by the participants.</p><p>Participants were asked to describe the live streams they had watched and to nominate as many live streaming categories as possible. The mentioned live streaming categories were then assembled and disassembled into types to ensure external heterogeneity between types and similarity within one type <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kluge, 2000)</ref>. The typology was mainly descriptive. It was iteratively checked with participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Results and Hypotheses Development</head><p>According to the interview, live streaming was classified into three broad types based on content, namely event, education and personal sharing (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Event live streaming refers to the live stream that broadcasts large events such as e-sport matches. Education live streaming is the live stream that offers the teaching of certain skills. For example, several participants mentioned that they learned make-up skills from streamers who provided step-by-step tutorials in real time. In such cases, they may gain certain knowledge which they could not obtain from mainstream educational resources (e.g., how to make a model of an anime character on one's own). Personal sharing live streaming involves sharing of an individual's life or talents. This can be a showcase of talent, such as singing, dancing or gaming. It can also be the sharing of personal life like showing one's pet and just eating or sleeping. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1. Typology of Live Streaming</head><p>In terms of the concepts from the initial theoretical framing, changes were made based on the responses from interviewees. Participants pointed out that in live streaming they could interact with the streamer freely, which was more entertaining than passively receiving the content. They could also ask questions and communicate with others, which encouraged further engagement in the environment. There was also evidence from participants showing that they spent money because it showed their 'importance' among the viewers as they were making significant contributions to the streamer. With regards to the appeal from streamers, there were participants emphasizing that they stayed in the live stream room because the streamer was funny, good looking or sexy. They were willing to buy virtual gifts if the streamer was attractive. Therefore, interactivity, social status display, humor appeal and sex appeal were reflected from and supported by the data. We originally considered presence as a potential factor encouraging viewers to visit a live stream room repeatedly. However, the participants' responses provided relatively little evidence to indicate that the feeling of or desire for presence was important. When the researchers discussed presence related questions, the responses from most participants indicated little importance of presence. Hence, the concept of presence was not incorporated in the refined theoretical framework. Based on the literature and the qualitative findings, the hypotheses were developed accordingly (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Interactivity</head><p>We argue that interactivity contributes to high-quality inter-personal communication in live streaming. The interactive communication process makes viewers feel that the streamer is approachable. They can freely deliver their thoughts and messages in real time. At the same time, the streamer can get feedback from viewers and react simultaneously. The high efficiency and effectiveness, reciprocal communication and active control experienced by viewers enhance the interaction quality and result in favorable attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chiang and Hsiao, 2015)</ref>. Furthermore, interactivity can increase viewers' perceived value of the live stream <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bao et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Teo et al., 2003)</ref>. Streamers can show that they care about what viewers expect and act according to what viewers request. The favorable attitudes such as satisfaction or sense of fun may enhance viewers' loyalty and motivate them to continue watching. Therefore, we propose: H1: Interactivity is positively associated with continuous watching intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Social Status Display</head><p>As only few viewers tend to purchase virtual gifts in live streaming, consumption of virtual gifts can be considered as one's manifestation of financial power <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Huang, 2012)</ref>. Since the consumption is visible to all other viewers, those who make purchases can be considered as the rich class by others. Moreover, a viewer who purchases gifts may have more power in shaping the content and the streamer's performance as other viewers are willing to follow up the requests posted by her or him. This indicates that one may attempt to demand social compliance through the consumption of virtual gifts in live streaming. Therefore, we propose: H2: Social status display is positively associated with consumption intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Humor Appeal</head><p>A humorous message tends to enhance people's perception of source credibility and liking for the source, which further helps create a positive attitude and increase the persuasive effect of the message <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Sternthal and Craig, 1973)</ref>. In live streaming, a humorous streamer can first serve viewers' entertainment purposes. The enjoyment or relief from emotional strain experienced by viewers may lead to their favorable attitudes toward the streamer. The enjoyable environment created by the streamer can induce positive evaluations and boost credibility, which in turn motivates viewers to watch continuously. Additionally, humor also promotes persuasive effects, leading to a greater impact of the message delivered by the streamer. When a humorous streamer shows interests in gifts, viewers are more likely to be affected and to send virtual gifts. Thus, the favorable attitudes and persuasive effects stimulated by humor may increase viewers' willingness to buy virtual gifts in live streaming. Therefore, we propose:</p><p>H3a: Humor appeal is positively associated with continuous watching intention.</p><p>H3b: Humor appeal is positively associated with consumption intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4.">Sex Appeal</head><p>Sex appeal is found to be attention grabbing, emotion inducing, sex suggestive and memorable. It thus can have positive effects on people's processing of messages and purchase intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Reichert et al., 2001)</ref>. Live streams with sex appeal are more likely to grab viewers' attention and to win their limited information processing resources, thus standing out from numerous other live streams.</p><p>As sexual content tends to be memorable, it can be easier for the viewer to recall the streamer's performance, which encourages the viewer to watch the streamer's live streams in the future.</p><p>Moreover, live streams with sex appeal may lead to a stronger sense of engagement and gratification. As behavioral scientists suggest, if a communicator is considered to stimulate gratification, favorable attitudes are likely to be developed toward her or him, which enhances persuasion effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brand et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Caballero and Pride, 1984)</ref>. In addition, sex appeal has emotional effects. By inducing positive valence and high arousal emotions toward the streamer, sex appeal again may lead to positive attitudes and evaluations toward the streamer. Such positive attitudes and evaluations would further stimulate viewers' continuous watching intention and consumption intention. Based on the above, we propose that:</p><p>H4a: Sex appeal is positively associated with continuous watching intention.</p><p>H4b: Sex appeal is positively associated with consumption intention.</p><p>Research model is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1.">Measurement Development and Survey Design</head><p>Survey method was used to test the proposed model as it is an effective way to obtain personal attitudes and beliefs, along with the benefits of the generalizability of findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kerlinger, 1973)</ref>.</p><p>All measurements were adapted from prior studies. The scale for interactivity was adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Liu (2003)</ref>. The scale for social status display was adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Souiden et al. (2011)</ref>. The humor appeal scale was adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Zhang (1996)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cho (1995)</ref>, and the sex appeal scale was adapted into English <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brislin, 1970)</ref>. A pilot study was conducted with a small sample of 8 live streaming users to get feedback on the scale items. After further adjustments on the items, an agreement on the final version of questionnaire was reached. In the survey, we employed the recall method to obtain respondents' perceptions. Respondents were asked to recall their watching experience of the live stream they liked most and to respond to items based on the experience. The recall method is a commonly used approach in the marketing field to collect perceptual data by tapping into one's memory for personal experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fang et al., 2014)</ref>. Information systems research has also shown that the recalling process facilitates people's access to the long-term memory to shape perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kim, 2009)</ref>. Thus, we believe that the recall method is applicable to the live streaming context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2.">Data Collection</head><p>Questionnaires were distributed online and offline. In total, we received 350 responses. As this study focuses on people's continuous watching and consumption intentions in live streaming, an upfront question was set to filter out those who had no experience of watching live streaming.</p><p>Respondents who chose 'no experience of watching live streaming' at the beginning were directly led to the end of the questionnaire and therefore did not complete the questionnaire.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Armstrong and Overton, 1977)</ref>. Respondents that completed the questionnaire within the first three days of data collection were considered as the early respondents, while those who completed the questionnaires within the last three days were considered as late respondents. We found no significant differences between the early and late respondents on our key measures for each live streaming type, confirming that nonresponse bias was not a problem for our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Data Analysis and Results</head><p>PLS-SEM was used to test the research model and hypotheses <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>. Analyses were conducted based on the overall sample including all three types of live streaming and on each type respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1.">Measurement Model</head><p>The measurement model was assessed on its validity and reliability. Interactivity is a second-order construct and was measured following the repeated indicators approach. Composite Reliability (CR) was assessed to evaluate the reliability of measurement items, and Average Variance Extracted (AVE) and Fornell-Larcker criterion were assessed to verify the convergent and discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 5</ref> For the analysis of the total sample, the value of CR for each construct ranged from 0.831 to 0.973, which was well above the acceptable level of 0.70. Moreover, the value of AVE ranging from 0.620 to 0.895, all exceeded the threshold of 0.50. In addition, a construct's correlations with other constructs were all below the square root of the construct's AVE, fitting with the Fornell-Larcker criterion. Therefore, the model was reliable and valid when considering the total sample. When separating the types of live streaming, all constructs' CR values were higher than the required 0.70 and their AVE values were higher than the required 0.50 for all types of live streaming. The construct correlations were also below the square root of each construct's AVE on all occasions.</p><p>Thus, the reliability and validity were also verified for each live streaming type.</p><p>Several efforts were made to address common method bias. All respondents were made clear that they should choose the answers they considered correct and appropriate, and that the responses would be kept anonymous. Also, all measurement items and scales were adopted from existing studies. Harman's single factor test was performed to check for common method bias. The results revealed that the total variance for a single factor was less than 50%, confirming that common method bias was not a concern in the study. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2.">Structural Model</head><p>SmartPLS 2.0 was used to test the hypotheses. Interactivity is a reflective-formative second-order construct, and this study used the repeated indicator approach to obtain the latent variable scores of the first-order constructs. Those latent variable scores were then used as indicators to form the second-order construct. The results of the structural model are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref>.</p><p>The results indicate that the relationship between interactivity and continuous watching intention is significant if the live streaming type is not specified. When considering the live streaming type, such relationship is significant for education and personal sharing live streaming, but not significant for event. Thus, H1 is partially supported. In terms of social status display, it is positively and significantly associated with consumption intention without specifying the live streaming type. For each type of live streaming, this association is also consistently positive and significant. Therefore, H2 is supported. Humor appeal is found to significantly and positively influence continuous watching intention for all live streaming types. Hence, H3a is supported.</p><p>However, the relationship between humor appeal and consumption intention is not significant when type is not taken into consideration. When types are specified, this relationship appears to be significant for education live streaming. Thus, H3b is partially supported. For sex appeal, it does not significantly affect continuous watching intention without considering live streaming types. Taking types into account, the relationship between sex appeal and continuous watching intention is found significant for event and personal sharing live streaming. Therefore, H4a is partially supported. Moreover, sex appeal is significantly related to consumption intention when types are not distinguished. While testing the relationship in different live streaming types, the relationship is found significant for education and personal sharing live streaming but not significant for event live streaming. Based on the results, H4b is also partially supported.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>There are several key findings based on the results. First, social status display is found to strongly motivate people to purchase virtual gifts in all types of live streaming. Streamers tend to show their gratitude toward those gift senders in front of other viewers. In such cases, the gift senders can show their social status to others and are likely to feel their self-esteem enhanced, as suggested by previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ger and Belk, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Solomon, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thruong et al., 2008)</ref>. Moreover, demonstrating social status through the purchase of virtual gifts may grant gift senders with higher social power, which is consistent with prior studies arguing that conspicuous consumption is able to bring social compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Goldsmith et al. 1996)</ref>. The results also imply that in the live streaming context, people tend to buy virtial gifts to show off their wealth no matter what type of live stream they are watching.</p><p>Second, our results highlight the role of sex appeal in both continuous watching and consumption intentions. The encouraging effects of sex appeal on people's behavioral intention can be illuminated by extant literature in advertising. Sex appeal like sexual arousal can easily draw people's attention and trigger people's favorable attitudes toward the live stream <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Caballero and Pride, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Reichert, 2002)</ref>. Nevertheless, for education live streaming, sex appeal does not seem to be an incentive for continuous watching. One possible explanation can be that, in event and personal sharing live streaming, entertainment is the focus and sex appeal is likely to increase the entertainment value of live streaming <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(MacInnis et al., 1991)</ref>. However, for viewers who watch education live streams, learning is the main purpose and sex appeal is not supposed to facilitate learning. Surprisingly, although sex appeal does not encourage continuous watching in education live streaming, it contributes to people's willingness to purchase virtual gifts in this type of live streaming. This may be because sex appeal provides extra value in addition to the initially expected benefits and viewers tend to be willing to pay for such additional value <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kuo et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Zeithaml, 1988)</ref>. This also happens in personal sharing live streaming. When it comes to event live streaming, the marginal entertainment value from the streamer's sex appeal may be masked by viewers' emphasis on the event itself. Hence, sex appeal does not lead to consumption intention in event live streaming.</p><p>We find humor appeal to positively influence continuous watching intention for all types of live streaming. This is because humor appeal functions effectively in fulfilling one's desire for enjoyment and relief of emotional strain <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Spielmann, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sternthal and Craig, 1973)</ref>. However, humor appeal only affects consumption in education live streaming. One possible explanation is that humor appeal is perceived as an additional value in education live streaming since it helps viewers learn in a relaxing way. People watch event and personal sharing live streaming mainly for entertainment while they watch education live streaming mostly for learning. Therefore, event and personal sharing live streaming are likely expected to be entertaining, whilst viewers are less likely to assume education live streaming to be funny. The marginal value of humor appeal can be stronger in education live streaming than any other types. Consequently, viewers are more likely to purchase virtual gifts to reward the the streamer with humor appeal in education live streaming.</p><p>Finally, interactivity enhances continuous watching intention in all types of live streaming except for event live streaming. It is supported by extant studies that high interactivity brings high involvement and high-quality communication experience, which in turn increases perceived value of live streaming and strengthens favorable attitudes of viewers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bao et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Teo et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The results can also be explained by prior research on perceived sense of community: people may expect certain level of interactivity in online activities that involve multiple participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Drouin and Yartanian, 2010)</ref>. For education and personal sharing live streaming, real-time interaction not only enriches content but also ensures the quality of viewers' experiences. In contrast, event live streaming does not emphasize interactivity. For example, viewers prefer to focus on what is going on in events rather than commit to two-way communication or unnecessary interruption. Thus, interactivity does not lead to continuous watching intention for this type of live streaming. The summary of findings is illustrated in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>.</p><p>we categorize live streaming into three types (i.e., event, education and personal sharing). We also propose a theoretical framework with factors from two dimensions: interactivity and social status display from the social interaction dimension; and humor appeal and sex appeal from the entertainment dimension. The model is then tested quantitatively. Our results confirm that in general, continuous watching intention is affected by interactivity and humor appeal while consumption intention is influenced by social status display and sex appeal. The effects of these factors are found to vary across different types of live streaming.</p><p>This paper has three main theoretical contributions. First, our study provides a starting point to examine the phenomenon of live streaming. We have developed a theoretical understanding of this new form of social media from two dimensionssocial interaction and entertainment. Drawing on UGT, our study is among the first to theorize and empirically verify factors that drive people to continuously watch live streaming and purchase virtual gifts. Second, although prior literature has highlighted the importance of interactivity, social status display, humor appeal and sex appeal in shaping people's attitudes and behaviors, most studies have investigated their effects separately.</p><p>This study incorporates these factors into one framework and tests their influences together in the live streaming context. Moreover, our study not only focuses on finding the factors that affect viewers' behavioral intentions in live streaming, but also investigates how these factors work differently in different live streaming types.</p><p>This paper also provides significant insights into how live streaming platforms and streamers can better design their strategies and maximize their value. We recommend that to retain viewers, platforms should promote interactive communication especially when the content is related to education and personal sharing. For example, platforms can reward viewers with user credits to encourage them to express ideas. Platforms can also offer monetary incentives to streamers to encourage them to respond to viewers actively. To increase financial benefits, platforms and streamers can fulfill viewers' desire to show their social status in public for all live streaming types.</p><p>For example, platforms may design features that can highlight the names of viewers who send gifts, and streamers can acknowledge these viewers' names during their broadcasts. When developing business strategies, platforms and streamers should also take humor appeal and sex appeal into consideration. We suggest streamers of all types of live streaming to inject humor into their content as viewers are more likely to continuously watch live streams from a humorous streamer.</p><p>Streamers who are humorous in an education live stream can also make viewers more willing to purchase virtual gifts. Platforms can provide guidance and tips for streamers on how to tell jokes, especially for streamers broadcasting education-type streams. Platforms should also recruit streamers who are good looking and sexy, especially when the live streaming content is related to personal sharing. This is because sex appeal in personal sharing can not only enhance viewers' stickiness to the streamer but also help turn the traffic into monetary values.</p><p>Future studies can extend this research in the following ways. Firstly, our study is conducted in China and future research can test the research model in other contexts. Moreover, in the Chinese context where there is a strong materialistic culture <ref type="bibr">(Podoshen et al., 2010)</ref>, viewers mainly 'purchase' gifts for streamers. In some Western contexts, gifts may be framed as being 'donated' to streamers. Future research can thus compare the differences in live streaming design between different cultures. Next, though the sample used for data analysis in this study is representative of live streaming users, whether the initial sample is representative of the whole Internet population is not confirmed. Future study is recommended to test the generalizability of our conclusion.</p><p>Besides, this study did not consider viewers' gender differences. Previous studies have found that the effects of stimuli could be different for different genders. Therefore, future research can extend 2 Given the chance, I predict that I should spend money in live streaming in the future.</p><p>3 It is likely that I will spend money in live streaming in the near future</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Examples of Live Streaming in China</figDesc></figure>
