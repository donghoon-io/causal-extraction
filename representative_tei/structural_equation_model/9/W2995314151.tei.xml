<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>School counselor is professional assistance directly for students. As a profession which requires intensive interaction with the served individuals, it requires high emotional so that counselor is fragile to experience burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Schaufeli, Bakker, &amp; Van Rhenen, (2009)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Awa, Plaumann, &amp; Walter, (2010)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">(Gunduz, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Morse, Salyers, Rollins, Monroe-DeVita, &amp; Pfahler, (2012)</ref>, reported 21 -67% mental health service providers experienced burnout. It was supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lloyd, King, &amp; Chenoweth, (2002)</ref>, telling that social workers experienced high stress level and burnout than any other professions. Such burnout is caused by high stress level due to job task, role ambiguity, role conflict, numbers of students, and lack of monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kesler, 1990)</ref>. Counselor in serving growing up individuals and having many problems needs positive energy to keep survive. Lack of positive energy will cause burnout or exhaust both physically, emotionally, and mentally.</p><p>The experts' statements are relevant to counselor phenomena at school nowadays. The demand of 2013 curriculum in guiding and counseling service and various problems faced by students increase lists of problems faced by school counselor. Moreover, additional tasks outside of his job description and function frequently make counselor feeling burned out both physically and emotionally. This condition will influence counselor's performance in carrying out his task. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mondy &amp; Noe, 2005)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Friedman, 2000)</ref>, stated that high burnout could decrease productivity and performance. Burnout also makes ineffective counseling service given to counselee. It causes the counselee does not feeling satisfied toward the counselor's performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Morse et al., 2012)</ref>. Another impact of burnout could be seen on physical and mental health as well as the counselor's wellbeing, such as flue, mag, pain on neck and back, stress, anxiety, and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Maslach, Schaufeli, &amp; Leiter, (2001)</ref> <ref type="bibr">;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Acker, (2010)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Peterson et al., (2008)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Stalker &amp; Harvey, 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ivancevich, &amp; Konopaske, (2008)</ref>, stated that burnout is psychological process of individuals whom experience emotional fatigue, personality change, and digression of personal achievement feeling due to stress and working pressure. Counselor experiencing burnout will negatively influence his given service <ref type="bibr">(Mullen &amp; Gutierrez, 2016)</ref>. The findings showed that fatigue statistically contributed significantly to direct counseling frequency. Regan, (2013) also stated that burnout had effects on counselor and counselee's interaction and negative effect toward the given treatment to counselee. Similar to <ref type="bibr">Regan, Lim, Kim, Kim, Yang, &amp; Lee, (2010)</ref> explained that untreated fatigue would influence wellbeing of counselor and counselee as well as counseling efficacy.</p><p>Prevalence of school counselor burnout and its influential factors have not frequently been investigated. Dealing with burnout emergence, there are several influential factors both internal and external factors. The internal factors are emotional intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Maslach et al., (2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Goleman, (2009)</ref> stated that emotional intelligence influenced daily life. Low capability in controlling emotion is also a personal characteristic causing burnout. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Leiter &amp; Maslach, (1988)</ref> stated that an individual during serving a client typically experienced negative emotion, such as anger, fear, annoyed, worry, anxious, and so forth. When those emotions could not be controlled, they would make them impulsive and make them using exaggerated self-defense mechanism on the client's problems. This condition would make emotional fatigue and cause burnout.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Problem of Research</head><p>Meanwhile, the external factor causing burnout is school climate (working environment and working facility availability). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Riswani, (2018)</ref>, working load, free school system, curriculum change, social support, environment, and school facilities are influential factors of school counselor burnout. Based on the explanation, this research aims to analyze correlation among emotional intelligence, and school climate to school counselor burnout. These research question are:</p><p>• Is there significant relationship between the emotional intelligence and school counselor burnout? • Is there significant relationship between the school climate and school counselor burnout?</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Design</head><p>The design of the study is correlational, using structural equation modeling approach to investigation the relationship counselor emotional intelligence, school climate and counselor burnout. This research aims to test correlation of two or more investigated variables through statistical procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Creswell, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The population consisted of all 664 counselors in Malang Raya, Eastern Java Province, Indonesia. The sample consisted of 250 school counselors taken by proportional cluster random sampling. The descriptive analysis results about respondents' identities showed most of them were female, consisting of 198 persons out of 250 guidance and counseling teachers (Counselor). Thus, there were only 52 male teachers. From the age aspect, there were 25 respondents aged 23 -25 year old (10%), 25 respondents aged 26 -30 (10%), 28 respondents aged 31 -35 year old (11%), 41 respondents aged 36 -40 year old (16%), 29 respondents aged 41 -45 year old (12%), 29 respondents aged 46 -50 year old (12%), 38 respondents aged 51 -55 (15%), and 35 respondents aged 56 -60 (14%). From the working period, there were 45 respondent working for less than 5 years (18%), 54 respondents working for 5 -10 years (21.6%), 52 respondents working for 11 -15 years (20.8%), 26 respondents working for 16 -20 years (10.4%), 27 respondents working for 21 -25 years (10.8%), 24 respondents working for 26 -30 years (9.6%), and 22 respondents working for 31 -35 years (8.8%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection</head><p>Three questionnaires were used in the present to study including emotional intelligence scale (EIS), school climate scale (SCS), and counselor burnout inventory.</p><p>The emotional intelligence scale base on the theoretical model emotional intelligence deveopled by <ref type="bibr">Golemane (2009)</ref>. Emotional intelligence scale included five dimensions, containing self-awareness (4 items), self-regulation (4 item), empathy (4 items), motivation (4 items) and social skills (4 items). Responden use a 6-point scale, on wich a "1" represented "strongly disagree" and "6" represented " strongly agree," to indicate to what extent each item described them. All parts of the model were represented by multiple items. In this set, 22 items valid. The validity levels ranged between 0.583-0.834 and the Cronbach Alpha Coefficient of 0.873 supported the high internal reliability of the instrument.</p><p>The school climate scale developed by adapting the National School Climate Center (2012). The school climate scale include three dimensions, containing safety (6 items), relationship (10 items) and institutional environment (7 items). Responden use a 6-point scale, on wich a "1" represented "strongly disagree" and "6" represented " strongly agree," to indicate to what extent each item described them. All parts of the model were represented by multiple items. In this set, 23 items valid. The validity levels ranged between 0.557-0.925 and the Cronbach Alpha Coefficient of 0.777 supported the high internal reliability of the instrument.</p><p>The burnout inventory developed with reference to Maslach's theory and adapted from the Burnout Inventory Human Service Survey (MBI-HSS). It contained three dimensions, i.e. emotional exhaustion (7 items), depersonalization (8 items), and personal accomplishment (6 items). Responden use a 6-point scale, on wich a "1" represented "strongly disagree" and "6" represented " strongly agree," to indicate to what extent each item described them. All parts of the model were represented by multiple items. In this set, 22 items valid. The validity levels ranged between 0.596 to 0.910 and the Cronbach Alpha Coefficient of 0.918 supported the high internal reliability of the instrument.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>The data analysis and process method used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) based on Partial Least Square (PLS) assisted by Warp -PLS version 6.0. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Latan, &amp; Ghozali, (2012)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of Emotional Intelligence</head><p>The analysis result by using descriptive statistic score of counselors' emotional intelligence had mean 103 and median 103 (high), minimum score 66, maximum score 126, and standard of deviation 10.57. Most of the subject, 190 subjects (76%) obtained score with high interval, 60 subjects (24%) obtained moderate interval, and no one (0%) obtained low score. It showed that generally the counselors had high and moderate scores in answering emotional intelligence scale. Based on the guideline, higher score of emotional intelligence would make counselor more positive. It could be concluded that the counselors had high ability to control their own emotions and to recognize other people's emotions (empathy), to manage their own emotion, to motivate and build relationship with others. In detail, the descriptive statistics analysis result could be seen on table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outer Model Evaluation</head><p>This research used all reflective indicators. The convergent validity was addressed to test correlation among scores of indicators to measure the construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Latan, &amp; Ghozali, 2012)</ref>. Based on the measurement, it was known that all indicators had loading factor score higher than 0.60 and significant p-value with score lesser than 0.05. The result of the loading factor measurement (reflective) showed that all indicators which measured demography resulted to 2 greater loading factors than 0.6. All indicators of emotional intelligence had loading factors higher than 0.6. 3 indicators of school climate had loading factors higher than 0.6 and all indicators of burnout were also higher than 0.6. Therefore, the indicators were valid to measure demography, emotional intelligence, school climate, and burnout. Here are the details. a. Convergent validity and reliability Score of Average Variance Extracted (AVE) showed that all reflective constructs had AVE higher than 0.05. It showed that all indicators had met the determined standard so the convergent indicators were valid and met all requirements of convergent validity. shows that all indicators measuring the constructs have higher cross loading score to each construct. Thus, it could be considered valid. The score of Square Root of AVE obtained from each construct was higher than correlational score among construct to other construct in a same column. The findings indicated that discriminant validity requirement was fulfilled. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model Evaluation Result (Inner Model)</head><p>Structural model evaluation could be done by looking at R-squared score (R2), predictive relevance, and Goodness of Fit Model. Based on the data process by using Warp -PLS 6.0, the inner model was used to see the correlation among constructs, significant score and R-square of the research model, evaluated structural model by using R -square for t-test dependent construct, and significance of structural path parameter coefficient. Here is the figure of the hypothesis test by using SEM Warp -PLS.  Based on the estimation on 10 indexes of GoF measurement, it could be concluded that the research model generally had good goodness of fit and was reliable. Then, the hypothesis test was used to find out existence of exogenous variable toward endogenous variable influences. The criterion of the test stated that when p -value &lt; level of significance (alpha), then the influence of exogenous variable was significant to endogenous variable. a. Emotional intelligence' correlate to burnout P -Value of emotional intelligence to burnout was &lt; 0.001. It showed that emotional intelligence positively and significantly correlate to burnout. b. School climate's correlate to burnout</p><p>The p-value score of school climate toward burnout was &lt; 0.001. It showed that school climate positively and significantly correlate to burnout. In detail, the correlation among variables could be seen from direct -effect coefficients. a. Emotional intelligence direct effect coefficient to burnout was 0.579. It showed that emotional intelligence significantly correlate. Thus, better emotional intelligence of the counselors would not experience burnout. b. School climate direct effect coefficient to burnout was 0.325. It showed that school climate significantly influenced. Thus, supportive school climate would not cause burnout. Then, based on total analysis result, it was known that the most influential variable to burnout was emotional intelligence. In another word, the exogenous variable, emotional intelligence, had dominant influence toward endogenous variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>The findings showed that emotional intelligence was an correlate and significant factor to burnout. The findings were proven to support <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">( Harrichand, Knight, &amp; Captari (2017);</ref><ref type="bibr">Testa &amp; Sangganjanavanich (2016);</ref><ref type="bibr">Guitterez &amp; Mullen (2016)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Avionela &amp; Fauziah, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">), Colomeischi, (2015)</ref>, stated that there was correlation between emotional intelligence to burnout of the teachers. Emotional intelligence is as an individual ability consisted of ability to motivate, to defend in facing frustration, to control desire, to not exaggerate any joy, to manage feeling, to manage stress, and to have empathy to other people <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Goleman, 2009)</ref>. Scientists reported the importance for counselor to implement strategy in decreasing stress and defending fatigue. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kurtoglu, (2018)</ref> explained the individual with a high emotional intelligence score is predicted to be able to cope with this process more effectively and better by focusing on the problem or the situation that needs to be decided more carefully. One of preventive ways to avoid burnout is improving emotional intelligence.</p><p>School climate is hypothesized directly correlate to burnout. The finding supported <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Grayson &amp; Alvarez, (2008)</ref>; telling that school climate could improve and decrease emotional fatigue, depersonalization, and low feeling achievement. Furthermore, social support from principal and peers toward the teacher could improve their commitment toward their professions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kumar &amp; Singh, (2013)</ref> also found negative and insignificant correlation between school climate and two dimensions of burnout: emotional fatigue and depersonalization of teachers. However, there was also positive-insignificant correlation (third dimension). It was school climate and digression of teachers' achievements. Numbers of researches also showed that school characteristic level such as administrative support, collegiality, and school climate influenced fatigue of teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Caprara, Barbaranelli, Borgogni, &amp; Steca, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Sufficient school climate correlate to condition of school members, included service given by guidance and counseling teachers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Murod, (2011)</ref> showed that professional performance of counselor percentage data proved that counselors working at schools which held sufficient guidance and counseling service generally had higher performance than those working at poor counseling service. They were 70.14% (high) and 64.55% (moderate) respectively. The percentage difference showed that counselors working at Public Senior High School with health school climate could make better competence performance of guidance and counseling teachers than those with unhealthy or not supportive school climate. In another word, supportive school climate for guidance and counseling's contributed high performance achievements of the teachers.</p><p>From the findings, it could be concluded that all goodness of fit indexes of this PLS model were good. The hypothesis test showed that from two hypotheses, all hypotheses had significant influences. The emotional intelligence and school climate variable were proven positively influencing burnout and the percentage of emotional and school climate were categorized high. The exogenous variable influencing dominantly to endogenous variable was emotional intelligence. Thus, better emotional intelligence of counselor and supportive school climate would avoid counselors from burnout. The findings proved that personal factors such as emotion and environment effectively influenced burnout of school counselors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head><p>Further researchers are suggested to use other variables or factors which are more influential to burnout so that the determinant coefficient resulted become higher and the variable are categorized strong.</p><p>For school counselors are suggested to always improve emotional intelligence as professional counselors' character empowerment with strong and thought personality quality and readiness to carry out task and function in various situations.</p><p>For school policy makers are suggested to always support positive system and always have synergy with school stakeholders to create positive and dynamic school climate. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
