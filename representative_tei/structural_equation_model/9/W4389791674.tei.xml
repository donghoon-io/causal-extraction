<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO) industry is recognised as a cornerstone of economic growth and development. It also wields a significant environmental footprint marked by excessive resource consumption and waste generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ajayi &amp; Oyedele, 2018)</ref>. The AECO industry has historically been characterised by its linear consumption patterns, accounting for 40% of the global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(UNEP, 2021)</ref>. Additionally, the industry contributes significantly to global waste generation, with approximately one-third generated from construction and demolition waste <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Menegaki &amp; Damigos, 2018)</ref>. The circular economy provides a transformative strategy to reduce these environmental impacts, aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goals <ref type="bibr">(Urain et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>The global pursuit of sustainability has led to the emergence of the circular economy principles, which presents an alternative to the linear "take-make-dispose" economic model <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Pomponi &amp; Moncaster, 2017)</ref>. The AECO industry's traditional linear production and consumption patterns are increasingly acknowledged as unsustainable, prompting a global shift towards a circular economy paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Munaro et al., 2020)</ref>. Circular economy principles emphasise the regeneration of resources, reduction of waste, and maximisation of value retention throughout the product lifecycle <ref type="bibr">(Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015)</ref>. As industries globally seek to address the pressing challenges of resource scarcity, environmental degradation, and climate change, the AECO industry stands out as a critical focus area due to its substantial resource consumption and waste generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Liu et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>In the AECO industry, implementing circular economy principles offers multifaceted benefits, ranging from reduced resource depletion to curbing greenhouse gas emissions and minimising waste <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gonz'alez et al., 2021)</ref>. Given the benefits, several countries are promoting the implementation of a circular economy in the construction industry, including Denmark, Japan, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, and Switzerland <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(García-Quevedo et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kirchherr et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The development of circular economy principles in the AECO industry is motivated by resource scarcity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ghisellini et al., 2016)</ref>, waste reduction imperatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Tura et al., 2019)</ref>, regulation and policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Munaro et al., 2020)</ref>, cost savings through material reuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ghisellini et al., 2018)</ref>, climate change mitigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Wuni &amp; Shen, 2022)</ref>, social responsibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Oyinlola et al., 2018)</ref>, technological innovation and stakeholder demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Giorgi et al., 2022)</ref>, and alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>Developing countries, which often exhibit rapid urbanisation and industrialisation confront unique challenges and opportunities in their pursuit of circularity <ref type="bibr">(Bello et al., 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Oluleye et al., 2022)</ref>. The construction industry in these economies, characterised by exponential growth and substantial infrastructure demands, is central to the discourse on circularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Torgautov et al., 2021)</ref>. While these nations contribute significantly to global resource consumption, they face heightened vulnerabilities due to limited resource availability and waste management infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bello et al., 2023b)</ref>.</p><p>Nigeria, a major African economy and a rapidly urbanising economy exemplifies the complexities of implementing circular economy practices in a developing country. The Nigerian AECO industry has experienced remarkable growth due to population expansion, urban migration, and infrastructural demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aboginije et al., 2021)</ref>. However, this growth has been accompanied by inefficient resource use, inadequate waste management, and environmental degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Ojo et al., 2021)</ref>. The Nigerian government has recognised the need for sustainable development and circular economy implementation, as evidenced by the Nigeria Circular Economy Working Group (NCEWG). The NCEWG framework promotes sustainable production and consumption patterns within the AECO industry.</p><p>However, the knowledge of circular economy principles is limited among the professionals in developing countries which contributes to the slower transitioning and implementation of this sustainable and efficient approach. Moreso, while studies on circular economy implementation in developed countries are apparent <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Giorgi et al., 2022)</ref>, there is a paucity of research that examines the factors that influence the implementation of circular economy in Africa built environment industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Mhlanga et al., 2022)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Idris &amp; Bello (2023)</ref> further substantiated the prevalence of limited knowledge of circular economy among the Nigerian AECO professionals. These challenges necessitate the need to examine the drivers that could influence circular economy implementation in Nigeria. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Aslam et al. (2020)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Paiho et al. (2020)</ref> and Mahpour (2018) demonstrated how government can drive and support the circular economy implementation while <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hina et al. (2022)</ref> shows how technological application can drive the implementation of circular economy. Similarly, factors such as adequate research and development and financial system have been noted to drive the implementation of circular economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Wuni, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adabre et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Agyemang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hart et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adams et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>This study aims to bridge these gaps by employing a Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) approach to elucidate the impact and relationship between key drivers of circular economy implementation in the Nigerian AECO industry. As a robust statistical technique, SEM enables the assessment of direct and indirect relationships among various factors thereby providing clarity on the complex interplay of variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hair et al., 2019)</ref>. The study introduction provides an overview of the study, while subsequent sections provide insights into the principles and drivers of circular economy, adopted methodological approach, presentation and discussion of results and conclusion of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Review of Related Literature</head><p>This chapter provides an exploration of the principles and drivers underpinning the circular economy. The chapter underscores how the implementation of CE principles can lead to environmental protection, economic development, and the creation of new business opportunities. The diverse range of drivers is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, showing a comprehensive overview of the multifaceted factors that contribute to the successful implementation of CE practices in the construction industry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principles of Circular Economy</head><p>Circular economy principles have gained significant attention in recent years as a sustainable approach to resource management and environmental conservation. The principles of a circular economy are centred around minimizing waste and maximizing the value of resources by promoting reuse, recycling, and regeneration. The CE concepts are summarised in the 10 Rs, which are as follows: R0 Refuse, R1 Rethink, R2 Reduce, R3 Reuse, R4 Repair, R5 Refurbish, R6 Remanufacture, R7 Repurpose, R8 Recover, and R9 Recycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Peiro et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Vermeulen et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Geissdoerfer et al. (2017)</ref>, the core principles of a circular economy include designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems. This holistic approach emphasizes the importance of product design that enables easy disassembly and recycling, reducing the environmental impact of production processes. The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Stahel (2016)</ref> highlights the significance of extending the lifespan of products through repair, refurbishment, and remanufacturing, thereby reducing the need for continuous extraction of raw materials. Furthermore, the principles of a circular economy advocate for the use of renewable energy sources and the adoption of sustainable production practices to minimize the environmental footprint of industrial processes <ref type="bibr">(Urain et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>By implementing these principles, companies can transition from the traditional linear model of "take, make, dispose" to a more sustainable and regenerative approach. This shift not only reduces the strain on natural resources but also promotes energy efficiency and fosters the development of a more resilient and environmentally friendly economy. As argued by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bocken et al. (2016)</ref>, the adoption of circular economy principles can lead to increased resource productivity, cost savings through reduced material inputs, and the creation of new business opportunities based on the development of innovative and sustainable products and services. Additionally, a circular economy can contribute to the mitigation of climate change by minimizing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing the overall environmental impact of industrial activities <ref type="bibr">(Urain et al., 2022)</ref>. To conclude, the principles of the circular economy offer a comprehensive framework for achieving sustainable development goals while fostering economic growth and environmental stewardship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drivers of Circular Economy Implementation in the AECO Industry</head><p>In achieving a sustainable future, implementing circular economy practices is paramount, and regulatory and institutional drivers stand at the forefront of propelling this transformation. A comprehensive literature review shows that the availability of government-level action, circular vision, and well-defined goals is pivotal in setting the stage for circular economy implementation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Aslam et al. (2020)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bilal et al. (2020), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Wuni (2023)</ref> emphasize that when governments take the lead by establishing clear circular economy objectives and strategies, it acts as a powerful impetus for businesses, industries, and communities to align their operations and behaviours with circular principles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Paiho et al. (2020)</ref> and Mahpour (2018) underscore the significant impact of increasingly stringent landfill regulations and taxes on fostering circularity.</p><p>As elucidated in the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Urbinati et al. (2021)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Burke et al. (2021)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Kazancoglu et al. (2018)</ref> collaborative culture within the supply chain network stands out as a core driver which encourages knowledge exchange, innovation, and the establishment of sustainable practices across the supply chain, paving the way for circularity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Wuni (2023)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hina et al. (2022), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Aslam et al. (2020)</ref> emphasis on availability of adequate technology to drive the rapid and successful implementation of circular economy in the AECO industry. Moreso, adequate technological solutions streamline the monitoring and management of circular processes, promoting transparency and traceability <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Giorgi et al., 2022)</ref>. Critical organizational related drivers such research and development, design for circular business model good organizational structure has been reported by extant of literature such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Wuni, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Konietzko et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Nogueira et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Effective business strategies are pivotal in adopting circular economy principles, aligning economic goals with sustainable practices. A good business strategy serves as a fundamental driver <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Tura et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hina et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bilal et al., 2020)</ref>. This approach involves understanding and responding to market demands for environmentally responsible products and services, which fosters sustainability and positions businesses favourably in today's ecoconscious consumer landscape. The environmental drivers underscore efficient resource management, reduced environmental footprints, and energy savings, as highlighted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Wuni, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Giorgi et al., 2022)</ref>. While social related drivers emphasize the creation of employment opportunities, public health concerns, and cultural change, as discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Tura et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Patwa et al., 2020)</ref>. Economic related drivers stress the development of new businesses, long-term revenue generation, and the maximization of the data economy <ref type="bibr">(John et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Giorgi et al., 2022)</ref>. The summary of the categorised drivers is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Methodology</head><p>In conducting this research, a quantitative approach was adopted to systematically examine and quantify the relationships and drivers pertinent to implementing circular economy principles among selected AECO professionals in Nigeria. This technique allows for the precise measurement and analysis of attitudes, perceptions, and factors influencing the circular economy adoption in this specific context <ref type="bibr">(Saunder et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The study's target population consists of selected AECO professionals namely Architects, Builders, Civil engineers, and Quantity Surveyors, operating in selected regions across Nigeria, namely the North Central, North West, South-South, and South West regions. These regions were chosen to ensure geographical diversity and representation of the Nigerian context, which is crucial for obtaining a comprehensive understanding of circular economy implementation in Nigerian AECO industry. The professional's categories were selected based on their leading roles and direct involvements in AECO activities in the Nigerian AECO activities. The other two regions (North East and South East) were excluded from the study due to the high insecurity rate, which has hampered the economic developments in the regions.</p><p>A snowball sampling technique was adopted to collect data from the population. This technique was chosen for its effectiveness in reaching professionals in a specific field and for generating a sample that reflects the diversity of the population <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bryman, 2016)</ref>. The initial questionnaire was pilot tested to ensure wider respondents will not have difficulties in filling the questionnaire and also to exclude drivers that might be similar or have same meaning. Participants consented to participate in the study while their confidentiality and privacy are protected as research ethics demands. The questionnaire was distributed virtually using Google Forms. At the end of the survey, total of 208 valid responses were received and subsequently considered for the study. This sample size was considered adequate based on related studies in Nigeria that has used similar sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Idris &amp; Bello, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Olanrewaju et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Data collection was facilitated through a well-structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed to elicit responses related to the perceptions, attitudes, and practices of AECO professionals regarding circular economy principles. Questionnaire survey was adopted because it is cost effective and easy to reach wider respondents to participate in the study.</p><p>Respondents were asked to rate their responses using a five-point Likert scale, a common approach for assessing levels of agreement or disagreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dawson, 2013)</ref>. Subsequently, the data was subjected to a rigorous analytical process. To identify potential variations in responses across different regions and professions, the Kruskal-Wallis test, a non-parametric statistical test, was employed. The non-parametric approach was chosen due to the ordinal nature of the collected data, ensuring the validity of the analysis within the context of the study. This test helps compare multiple groups and determine whether observed differences are statistically significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Field, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, Smart PLS-SEM (Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling) version 4 was employed to delve deeper into the complex relationships and dependencies within the dataset. SEM is a robust and comprehensive statistical technique that allows for a more intricate analysis of the structural relationships between variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hair et al., 2019)</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model</head><p>A measurement model is a fundamental component of SEM used to assess the relationships between observed indicators (variables) and their underlying latent constructs. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hair et al. (2006)</ref>, the validity of the measurement model is assessed based on its ability to demonstrate both convergent and discriminant validity.</p><p>Convergent validity is a critical aspect of measurement validation in SEM and assesses whether different indicators measuring the same latent construct converge <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hulland 1999)</ref>.</p><p>High convergent validity indicates that multiple indicators effectively capture the same underlying concept. Convergent validity is examined using Cronbach alpha (α), composite reliability (ρc), and average variance extracted (AVE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fornell &amp; Larcker (1981)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> comprehensively assesses convergent validity for each identified cluster within the study. The high alpha (&gt; 0.70) coefficients indicate strong internal consistency within each construct, while the substantial composite reliability values emphasise the reliability of the measurement model. Furthermore, the AVE values, all surpassing the 0.5 threshold, established that a substantial portion of the variance in the indicators is attributed to their respective constructs.</p><p>Multicollinearity was assessed using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) test. The VIF values for each construct were all below the acceptable threshold of 3.3, as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kock (2015)</ref>. This suggests that common method bias is not present in the data.</p><p>Consequently, the findings in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> substantiate the absence of multicollinearity issues in the data. These robust measures collectively affirm the convergent validity of the measurement instruments for each essential domain, providing a solid foundation for subsequent structural analyses within the study.   <ref type="formula">2017</ref>) a load value of 0.700 is considered adequate. However, if the study is exploratory then a value of 0.4 higher is adequate <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hulland, 1999)</ref>. Hence, this study set minimum benchmark of 0.6 load factor. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows 52 initial loaded items, while 34 items were later determined to have a load factor above 0.6 after loading three times as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>: Initial Loading (Authors data analysis) Discriminant validity aims to confirm that the measurement instruments effectively capture unique and separate concepts. To establish discriminant validity, examining the correlations <ref type="bibr">(Fornell-Larcker)</ref> between constructs and ensuring that they are lower than the square root of the AVE for each construct is pertinent. When correlations are lower than the AVEs, it indicates that the constructs are distinct and do not measure the same underlying concept, reinforcing the validity of the measurement model. The discriminant validity in this study was evaluated using the Hetrotrait-Monotrait ratio (HTMT) and the Fornell-Larcker criterion. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the results of the Fornell-Larcker criterion, which examines the relationship between the square root of AVE and the correlation between constructs.</p><p>The correlation results indicate that the square root of AVE surpasses the inter-construct correlation for all the constructs. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kock (2015)</ref> if the square root of the AVE is greater than the correlation then the model discriminant validity is adequate. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> also summarises the HTMT analysis, which reveals that all the constructs have correlations that fall below the recommended threshold of 0.900, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gold et al. (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Henseler et al. (2015)</ref>. Path bootstrapping is a resampling technique commonly used in SEM to assess the significance and robustness of path coefficients in a model <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hair et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kline, 2023)</ref>. Examining path bootstrapping, the statistical significance of path coefficients, calculating confidence intervals, and assessing the model stability and reliability can be determined, enabling adequate hypotheses testing. In examining the validity of the hypotheses, the Bootstrapping technique was applied by randomly resampling the original dataset to create 5,000 new samples at a 95% confidence interval (CI), a commonly used maximum number of random samples. The standardised path coefficients (β) and p-values are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, indicating that all the hypotheses are significant.</p><p>Predictive evaluation is crucial as it enables researchers to determine whether their proposed model can outperform a naive baseline, a core predictive validity component <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Sharma et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Shmueli and Koppius, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Prediction-oriented tools for PLS-SEM have been introduced to aid in these assessments, including PLSpredict <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Shmueli et al., 2016)</ref> and CVPATcompareoverall <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Liengaard et al., 2021)</ref>. Before conducting a CVPAT analysis, it is essential to note that both alternative models meet the necessary measurement and structural evaluation criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hair et al., 2019)</ref>. The evaluation of these models indicates that they meet the required benchmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hair et al., 2022)</ref>. For the models to possess predictive validity, their average loss must be significantly lower (higher predictive accuracy) than the benchmark of naïve indicator averages. If this is not the case, the models should be discarded <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Shmueli et al., 2019)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows strong predictive validity (Average loss difference = -0.382, t = 19.194, p = 0.000). The study's results indicate 7 of the 8 hypotheses are significant. Firstly, the relationship between business factors and the implementation of the circular economy is strongly established (β = 0.403, t = 12.659, p = 0.000).

These dimensions collectively emphasize the necessity of integrating these drivers to establish a robust framework for implementing circular economy principles in the Nigeria AECO industry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This study delved into the multifaceted landscape of circular economy implementation in the Nigerian AECO industry. Through rigorous quantitative research and SEM, the impact of 8 key drivers was investigated: Business, Economic, Environmental, Organizational, Regulatory and Institutional, Social, Supply Chain, and Technological. The findings of this study have illuminated the profound influence of these drivers on the successful implementation of circular economy principles in the Nigerian AECO industry. These insights hold significant implications for various stakeholders, including policymakers, industry practitioners, and researchers. Consequently, the study further established that professionals have similar opinions on the drivers for implementing a circular economy irrespective of their profession or region of operation. This implies that development of strategies or interventions might be universally applicable or accepted across different groups, simplifying the implementation process. This research has comprehensively espoused the interplay between various circular economy drivers and their influence on the Nigerian AECO industry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for the Study</head><p>The implications derived from this study encompass practical, theoretical, and managerial aspects, offering valuable guidance for various stakeholders in the Nigerian AECO industry.</p><p>From a practical perspective, the study highlights the urgent need for policymakers to proactively shape and enforce regulatory frameworks that foster circular economy principles. This includes revisiting existing regulations to align them more effectively with circularity goals and providing incentives for sustainable construction practices. The elucidation of these drivers can provide the stakeholders with the requisite information to implement circular economy in the Nigerian AECO industry. Further, it can provide guidance to policy-makers in making informed decisions in the implementation of this novel approach.</p><p>This practical collaboration can accelerate the adoption of circular material flows and enhance resource efficiency in the industry. Theoretically, this study contributes to understanding circular economy implementation in the Nigerian AECO industry and enriches the literature by validating the impact of the various drivers. It paves the way for future research to explore the mechanisms behind policy implementation, assess the longterm sustainability implications of circular practices, and examine the interactions and potential trade-offs among drivers.</p><p>Managerially, the insights generated can encourage AECO professionals and policymakers to strategically integrate circular economy principles into their decision-making processes, ensuring a more sustainable and environmentally responsible construction industry in Nigeria. The implication of this study can be extended to other developing and least developing economies.</p></div>
