<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Globally, it is estimated that over 700 million people are living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with the majority not yet at the advanced grade of kidney failure (previously termed end stage kidney disease; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cockwell &amp; Fisher, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Levey et al., 2020)</ref>. Owing to the chronic, unpredictable, and insidious nature of the disease trajectory, the impact of CKD on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a priority in clinical practice. Conceptually, HRQoL is a multi-dimensional phenomenon that incorporates the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual attributes of a person's life impacted by disease and treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ferrans, Zerwic, Wilbur, &amp; Larson, 2005)</ref>. While those with CKD experience lower HRQoL compared to the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kefale, Alebachew, Tadesse, &amp; Engidawork, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yapa, Purtell, Chambers, &amp; Bonner, 2020)</ref>, various factors could influence the reasons for this.</p><p>Factors that have been found to negatively affect HRQoL of those with CKD include advanced disease grade <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almutary, Douglas, &amp; Bonner, 2017)</ref>, having comorbidities <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Tonelli et al., 2015)</ref>, receiving haemodialysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anees et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jung et al., 2019)</ref>, reduced serum haemoglobin <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kefale et al., 2019)</ref>, symptom burden <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almutary et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ng et al., 2020)</ref>, and limitations in physical functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jung &amp; Kim, 2020)</ref>. Socio-demographic factors that could also impair HRQoL are older age <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mahato et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2017)</ref>, female gender <ref type="bibr">(Zhou et al., 2017)</ref>, lower spiritual wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Pilger, Santos, Lentsck, Marques, &amp; Kusumota,, 2017)</ref>, lower levels of education <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kefale et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mahato et al., 2020)</ref>, low income <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kefale et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tannor et al., 2019)</ref>, and difficulties with accessing healthcare services <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anees et al., 2014)</ref>. While several factors influence HRQoL, only two studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almutary et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jung &amp; Kim, 2020)</ref> have reported the direct relationships between symptoms and HRQoL in the CKD population. Identification of these factors and the relationships with HRQoL could assist nurses with the implementation of strategies to improve the wellbeing of those with this disease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACKGROUND</head><p>Several models explaining HRQoL have been reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Armstrong, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ferrans et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Larson et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Stucki, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wilson &amp; Cleary, 1995)</ref>. Of these, the revised Wilson and Cleary model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ferrans et al., 2005)</ref> was chosen to inform the present study as it incorporates a range of factors (personal, environmental, and disease) that have unidirectional theoretical relationships to account for HRQoL. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, this model contains five central constructs: (1) biological function, (2) symptoms, (3) functional status, (4) general health perceptions, and (5) HRQoL; and two other constructs: (1) individual characteristics and (2) environmental characteristics influencing each of the central constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ferrans et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Biological function refers to the cellular and organ level processes of diseases as well as abnormalities of these which may influence HRQoL due to their effects on physical function <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ferrans et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wilson &amp; Cleary, 1995)</ref>. For example, in CKD, reduced kidney function contributes to the development of a number of symptoms such as fatigue and muscle weakness, causing a decrease in physical functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jung &amp; Kim, 2020)</ref>, and hence, reduced HRQoL <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almutary et al., 2017)</ref>. Symptoms follow biological function in the model and are the subjective perceptions of physical and psychological symptoms which may impact on a person's HRQoL <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ferrans et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wilson &amp; Cleary, 1995)</ref>. The third construct in the model is functional status, which refers to the ability to perform the normal activities of daily living that are essential to fulfil an individual's basic needs, family and social roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ferrans et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wilson &amp; Cleary, 1995)</ref>. While integrating all of the previous three constructs in the model, general health perceptions represent an individual's rating of their own health <ref type="bibr">(Wilson &amp; Cleary, 1995)</ref>. Finally, the HRQoL construct is the subjective well-being, essentially describing how satisfied an individual is with their life <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ferrans et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wilson &amp; Cleary, 1995)</ref>. The revised Wilson and Cleary model also depicts how individual (e.g., age, gender, level of education) and environmental characteristics (e.g., monthly household income, number of people living in the household, distance between home and hospital) influence each of the central constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ferrans et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The revised Wilson and Cleary model has been used to inform previous research. In a systematic review, this model was used as a research framework in 26 studies spanning different countries (e.g., Brazil, Hong Kong, Norway, Thailand, and the United States) and a range of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Ojelabi, Graham, Haighton, &amp; Ling, 2017)</ref>. The model demonstrated usefulness in formulating hypotheses to inform these studies, to assist with identifying important variables and outcomes of interest, and to investigate the model's empirical usefulness in explaining the real-world. However, research using this model in the context of CKD is sparse, with only one previous study testing its applicability only in those receiving haemodialysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jung &amp; Kim, 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jung and Kim (2020)</ref> reported that the model explained 79% of the variation in HRQoL in this patient group. However, given that most of the global CKD population are in early grades of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cockwell &amp; Fisher, 2020)</ref> and that many older and/or frailer people opt not to have kidney replacement therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brown, Gardner, &amp; Bonner, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Teruel et al., 2015)</ref>, this model's suitability to inform nursing practice when caring for those with CKD is unknown. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p>A cross-sectional design reported using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE; see Appendix S1; von <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Elm et al., 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and setting</head><p>Participants were conveniently recruited from outpatient clinics, renal wards and the haemodialysis unit at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka. Inclusion criteria were adults (&gt; 18 years) with a known medical diagnosis of CKD, able to understand Sinhalese (language) and willing to provide voluntary informed consent. Those acutely unwell in renal wards (e.g., peritonitis, respiratory infections, myocardial infarction, etc) were excluded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size</head><p>In this study, the sample size was determined to obtain a sample adequate for study design (i.e., cross-sectional study) as well as structural equation modelling analysis. Accordingly, the sample size was calculated based on a 5% type 1 error for 15% estimated prevalence of CKD in Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Jayatilake, Mendis, Maheepala, &amp; Mehta, 2013)</ref>. With an emphasis on maximising representativeness of the disease trajectory, a sample size of 196 was required for each CKD grade (i.e., G3b, G4, G5 and G5D; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Levey et al., 2020</ref> for further explanation of each grade). The final sample was increased by 15% to account for non-response data, resulting in an overall sample size of 900. Sample sizes greater than 200 are considered acceptable to perform structural equation modelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kline, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p>Data collection occurred between October 2018 and January 2019. Prospective and consecutive participants were identified with the assistance of nursing staff in the renal department of the hospital. Using hospital records, patients' eligibility was screened by HEY, then the researcher or one of three research assistants (previously trained by HEY), collected data directly from participants once via an interviewer-administered method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>In this study, key variables were determined based on the constructs in the revised Wilson and Cleary model. However, functional status was not measured due to the unavailability of a short and validated instrument in Sinhalese language.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biological function</head><p>Biological function was examined by number of comorbidities and several laboratory measurements (estimated glomerular filtration rate [to measure level of kidney function], albumin, creatinine, urea, and haemoglobin). The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Levey et al., 2020)</ref> was used to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate. All renal clinical information was extracted from hospital records and recent blood test reports.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Symptoms</head><p>The self-report symptoms were measured by the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale (IPOS-renal), which assesses the symptom experience of people during the previous three days <ref type="bibr">(Cicely Saunders Institute, 2012)</ref>. The instrument assesses 15 physical and two psychological symptoms with each item score using a five-point Likert scale, 0 (not at all) to 4 (overwhelmingly). The composite score of 17 symptoms ranges from 0 to 68, with zero being 'no symptoms experienced' and 68 being 'worst experience of symptoms'. A higher score relates to greater symptom burden. The original version of the IPOS-renal instrument has shown good reliability, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.84 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Raj, Ahuja, Frandsen, Murtagh, &amp; Jose, 2018)</ref>. The instrument was translated to Sinhalese using forward and back translation methods and it demonstrated good reliability prior to its use in this study (Cronbach's alpha = 0.79).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General health perceptions</head><p>A visual analogue scale in the EuroQol five-dimension three-level (EQ5D3L), a 20cm long health thermometer with two distinct end points, was used to evaluate general health perceptions (EuroQol <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Group, 1990)</ref>. The scale ranges from zero to 100, with zero being the 'worst possible health state' and 100 being the 'best possible health state' (EuroQol <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Group, 1990)</ref>. The Sinhalese version <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kularatna, 2014)</ref> demonstrates good reliability (Cronbach alpha = 0.93; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mahesh et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Health-related quality of life</head><p>The descriptive component of the EQ5D3L (EuroQol <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Group, 1990</ref>) was used to assess HRQoL. The levels of each dimension measure the degree of severity of problems with level one indicating no problems, level two: some problems, and level three: extreme problems.</p><p>Each dimension is expressed as a single digit which is combined to give a five-digit number (the five-digit number represented by responses of each dimension) and then converted to a single weighted index score <ref type="bibr">(EuroQol Research Foundation, 2018)</ref>. Considering the value set derived for Sri Lanka, the index scores range between one (perfect health with no problem in any dimension) and -0.73, with a negative score indicating a worse health state than death <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kularatna, 2014)</ref>. The Sinhalese version of the EQ5D3L instrument has good reliability, with Cronbach's alpha equal to 0.83 and ranging from 0.78 to 0.83 for each of five dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Senanayake, Mahesh, Gunawardena, Graves, &amp; Kularatna, 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual and environmental characteristics</head><p>A self-report socio-demographic instrument was used to collect age (years), gender, level of education, spiritual beliefs, number of people living in a household, monthly household income (LKR; Sri Lankan rupees), and distance between home and hospital (km). Spiritual beliefs were assessed using five items (researcher developed), rated on a five-point Likert scale (1-strongly disagree and 5-strongly agree). Scores range from 5-25 with a higher score indicating greater perceptions of spiritual health. The scale demonstrated good reliability with Cronbach's alpha of 0.98.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical considerations</head><p>Ethical approvals were received from two university human ethics committees (Ethics Review </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Data were analysed using IBM SPSS™ statistics version 23.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(IBM Corp., 2015)</ref> and IBM SPSS Amos™ version 25.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arbuckle, 2014)</ref>. Using descriptive statistics, participant characteristics were summarised. There were few missing values for haemoglobin (n = 12; 1.35%) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (n = 15; 1.69%). Given the amount of missing data was &lt;5% and its random distribution (confirmed by the Little's missing completely at random test), these data were not imputed.</p><p>The hypothesised relationships among the variables presented in the revised Wilson and Cleary model were examined using the maximum likelihood method of structural equation modelling, an analysis approach that tests direct and indirect relationships among variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007)</ref>. Twelve observed variables were included as exogenous (independent) variables to six latent variables in the model (see Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>). Data were assessed for univariate and multivariate outliers, and normality. Histograms, Q-Q plots, closeness of mean and median values, and values of skewness and kurtosis confirmed that data were normally distributed.</p><p>Strength of linearity between variables was confirmed using Pearson's correlation tests.</p><p>Multicollinearity was not observed among the variables included in the model. The overall model-fit was confirmed to be acceptable when normed χ 2 was &lt; 5, the standardised root-meansquare residual index (SRMR) was &lt; 0.08, the root-mean-square error of approximation Model parsimony was evaluated using Akaike information criterion <ref type="bibr">(West et al., 2012)</ref>. After confirming the model-fit, individual standardised parameter estimates of paths (i.e., coefficients values) were assessed for magnitude, statistical significance (p ≤0.05), and direction. A bootstrapping sample of 500 was used to calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) and respective significance of the standardised direct and indirect effects. Finally, the total variance of endogenous (dependent) variables explained by exogenous variables in the model was evaluated using squared multiple correlations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant characteristics</head><p>In total, 886 people participated with the majority being male (68.40%). Participants had CKD grade 3b (n = 224), 4 (n = 222), 5 (n = 221), and 5D (n = 219) and their mean age was 57.10 (standard deviation [SD] 11.08; range 18-84 years). Most participants had at least one comorbidity (n = 705; 79.47%) with hypertension (n = 626; 70.66%) and diabetes (n = 254; 28.67%) the most common. On average, participants travelled 36 km to receive renal healthcare services. As for health outcomes, the mean IPOS-renal symptom score, the mean EQ5D3L index score, and the mean EQ5D3L visual analogue scale were 16.06 (SD 7.74), 0.57 (SD 0.32), and 49.14 (SD 23.30), respectively. Participant characteristics are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall model-fit</head><p>The initial model did not demonstrate a model-fit and was re-specified by adding a direct relationship between symptoms and HRQoL variables. This path was drawn by considering the substantive meaning and modification indices computed from the model-fit test (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S2</ref>). Following model re-specification, a further 10 models were tested by excluding observed variables of individual and environmental characteristics one at a time (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Finally, age and distance between home and hospital remained in the model to reflect </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Direct and indirect effects of the final model</head><p>Of the 12 paths investigated, seven were statistically significant (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>). In the final model, the strongest significant relationship was found between symptoms and HRQoL. This was a direct negative relationship (β = -0.481; 95% CI: -0.531, -0.420; p = 0.006; supporting H2). Biological function (i.e., decreased kidney function and haemoglobin, and greater number of comorbidities), significantly and directly contributed to increased symptoms (β = 0.367; 95% CI: 0.288, 0.445; p = 0.003). Symptoms had a significant direct negative relationship with general health perceptions (β = -0.443; 95% CI: -0.503, -0.391; p = 0.003).</p><p>Better general health perceptions significantly and directly influenced increased HRQoL (β = 0.308; 95% CI: 0.250, 0.369; p = 0.003; supporting H3). Considering direct effects of individual characteristics, when age increased, biological function (β = -0.106; 95% CI: -0.192, -0.003; p = 0.030), general health perceptions (β = -0.219; 95% CI: -0.281, -0.162; p = 0.003), and HRQoL (β = -0.091; 95% CI: -0.146, -0.033; p = 0.005; supporting H4) were all significantly decreased. Although distance between home and hospital fitted with the final model to reflect environmental characteristics, a direct relationship with HRQoL was not evident, thereby rejecting H5. Parameter estimations, including path coefficients, are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>.</p><p>With respect to indirect effects, the relationship between biological function and HRQoL was significantly and negatively mediated by both symptoms and general health perceptions (β = -0.226; 95% CI: -0.282, -0.176; p = 0.003; supporting H1). General health perceptions significantly mediated the relationship between symptoms and HRQoL (β = -0.137; 95% CI: -0.176, -0.110; p = 0.002). Age significantly and negatively affected symptoms via biological function (β = -0.039; 95% CI: -0.077, -0.004; p = 0.022), and HRQoL via both biological function and symptoms (β = -0.078; 95% CI: -0.120, -0.024; p = 0.005). The relationship between environmental characteristics (i.e., distance between home and hospital) and HRQoL was significantly and negatively mediated by general health perceptions (β = -0.044; 95% CI: -0.098, -0.004; p = 0.034). Overall, the final model explained 47.9% of the total variance of HRQoL. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> shows the standardised direct and indirect effects of the final model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>This study aimed to test whether the revised Wilson and Cleary model identifies which factors contribute to HRQoL in people with varying grades of CKD. Structural equation modelling is considered to be a robust and precise method to test for complex, and direct and indirect (causal) relationships among variables rather than using multiple regression models <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007)</ref>. In this study, several factors (three biological functions, symptoms, general health perceptions and one individual characteristic) were confirmed to have direct relationships with HRQoL, although there was one environmental characteristic which had only an indirect relationship. Due to the strong direct relationship between symptoms and HRQoL which required a minor modification of this model in the CKD population, the final model was able to predict which factors were contributing to a worsening of HRQoL. Knowledge of these factors provides evidence for nurses and other clinicians involved in managing CKD to assess and intervene for symptoms in earlier grades of the disease as this is likely to lead to improved HRQoL.</p><p>Overall, the final model explained approximately half of the total variation in HRQoL, indicating that the revised Wilson and Cleary model fits with CKD grades 3b -5 (including 5D). These results have expanded the evidence of this model's applicability in this patient population and show that, even at CKD grade 3b, HRQoL is decreased. The model also demonstrated that increasing symptom burden had the greatest impact on reducing HRQoL.</p><p>Interventions that target improving symptoms are needed much earlier in the disease trajectory. Education and non-pharmacological interventions can be provided by nurses who work in primary care (i.e., general practice or community-based services) or in hospital outpatient clinics, where most people with CKD are receiving healthcare.</p><p>Level of kidney function, haemoglobin, and the number of comorbidities were the biological functions relevant for the model in this study. While there is a known physiological explanation for the link between reduced kidney function and haemoglobin due to decreased erythropoietin production <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Webster, Nagler, Morton, &amp; Masson, 2017)</ref>, as CKD progresses, increased comorbidities also occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Vanholder et al., 2017)</ref>. Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jung and Kim (2020)</ref>, this study found that deterioration in kidney function had a direct relationship with symptoms, and that kidney function had an indirect relationship with HRQoL. Thus, interventions aimed at delaying CKD progression and/or controlling coexistent chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, may improve HRQoL in this patient population.</p><p>Symptoms demonstrated the strongest direct negative relationship with HRQoL in this study. This study and two previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almutary et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jung &amp; Kim, 2020)</ref> have collectively demonstrated that increasing symptom burden causes worsening of HRQoL, indicating overwhelming symptoms restrict many aspects of a person's life. Routine assessment of symptoms as part of nursing care plans would assist the implementation of timely and personalised interventions to relieve symptom burden, which in turn is likely to improve the wellbeing of people.</p><p>Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jung and Kim (2020)</ref>, general health perceptions in this study also had a direct positive relationship with HRQoL. This relationship suggests that having a better perception of one's own general health may positively influence HRQoL. Nurses are in an ideal position to support people to improve their general health through patient education about the disease and to assist them to adjust to life with CKD and its lifelong treatments.</p><p>These efforts could collectively benefit people by improving their HRQoL. Similar to that of other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almutary et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jung &amp; Kim, 2020)</ref>, age, an individual characteristic, had a direct negative relationship with HRQoL in this study. While having a debilitating and life-limiting disease such as CKD, older people may perceive that their higher-order needs such as self-esteem are at risk <ref type="bibr">(Westerhof, Whitbourne, &amp; Freeman, 2012)</ref>, which could negatively affect their general health and HRQoL. Furthermore, as people age, their biophysiological functioning declines <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Jamshidi et al., 2020)</ref> and symptoms worsen; thus, their perceived HRQoL also seems to decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Almutary et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Proactively monitoring for symptoms in older people with CKD such as using short patientreported outcome measures such as the IPOS-renal will enable monitoring of symptoms over time and provide a prompt for nurses to intervene sooner to avoid the greater deterioration in HRQoL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>There are, however, some limitations to this study. First, using a cross-sectional design limits the validity and confirmability of causal relationships although it is far more challenging to undertake longitudinal studies in this population due to the lengthy (years) and variable trajectory of the disease. Second, while participants were recruited from one site, due to the catchment area and referrals from surrounding districts, the sample was representative of the CKD populations in Sri Lanka (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abeywickrama et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gooneratne, Ranaweera, Liyanarachchi, Gunawardane, &amp; Lanerolle, 2008)</ref>. Third, the use of self-report measures is a source of bias, however, given the subjective nature of symptoms, general health perceptions, and HRQoL, valid and reliable patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were used. Fourth, considering the increased respondent burden with each additional instrument administered and the unavailability of a short-validated Sinhalese translated instrument to assess functional status, prevented functional status being measured directly in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Given the greater robustness and precision of structural equation modelling, direct and indirect relationships between various factors and HRQoL in CKD were identified in this study. As symptom burden increased, it strongly accounted for the deterioration in HRQoL in CKD. This relationship was also present at early grades of the disease trajectory. As nurses work not only in kidney services but also in primary care, aged care, and other healthcare settings where they care for people with CKD, they are ideally placed to intervene early.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE</head><p>Theories are used to inform nursing practice although it is important for theories to be tested in real-world situations and in range of contexts. As symptoms, health perception, and quality of life are subjective experiences, and that each person's characteristics are individual, the revised Wilson and Cleary model could be helpful to inform practice. While extensive clinical experience caring for those with kidney failure does afford understanding of the impact of this disease on HRQoL, nursing practice is not necessarily informed by evidence.</p><p>As this study has demonstrated, the revised Wilson and Cleary model (and its seven constructs) does fit with and explain the deterioration in HRQoL in those with CKD grades 3b -5D. Considering the slow progression of CKD, nurses working in primary healthcare (where most people with CKD grades receive healthcare) or in renal units (where most will have advanced grades of CKD), could assess symptoms and HRQoL using PROMs such as the IPOS-renal and HRQoL as part of routine nursing assessment. Frequency of assessment would vary depending on level of kidney function, age of the person, number of comorbidities and degree of frailty. These regular assessments could help nurses to track people who need increased attention so that prompt and timely interventions such as education, pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies, could be implemented to relieve symptom burden. Additionally, identification of those with lower (or at risk for lower) HRQoL could be referred to support services (e.g., social services) in a timely way.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>This study aimed to test whether the revised Wilson and Cleary model could identify which factors contribute to HRQoL in CKD using a structural equation modelling approach.
