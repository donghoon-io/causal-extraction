<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) plays an important role in corporate marketing and is understood as a strategic variable, because if managed properly, it can increase the corporation's market share. This study investigates the various causal relationships between corporate social responsibility, corporate brand credibility (CBC), corporate reputation (CR) and corporate brand equity (CBE). Data were collected through a survey with a selfadministered structured questionnaire, with five response options scored on a Likert scale. The sample included 310 consumers who expressed their opinions on a large Brazilian oil and gas company. The data were treated through structural equation modeling with partial least squares. The results showed that CSR has direct and indirect effects on CBE. Mixed methods are worthwhile to those who are working on a doctorate research work. Moreover, it will be helpful to develop knowledge through this method that can be beneficial to academia and Practitioners.</p></div>

When consumers perceive that CSR initiatives are sincere, they tend to trust the company, believing it will continue to honor its promises <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bhattacharya et al., 1998)</ref>. Corporate brand credibility is based on the perception of trust by consumers in the company, and this construct, along with corporate reputation, has an impact on the brand equity <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hur et al., 2014)</ref>. This study examines the causal relationship between CSR and corporate brand equity, including credibility and reputation as mediating latent variables.</p></div>

On the other hand, the instrumental view considers the existence of a positive correlation between socially responsible behavior and financial performance.</p><p>Nowadays, the idea of sustainable development is closely associated with CSR activities, according to which the overarching objective of all economic agents should be to meet the needs of the current generation without compromising the development of future generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bianchi et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bouglet et al., 2012)</ref>.

In this sense, a firm's CSR initiatives can cause a favorable impression on consumers who are sensitive to social questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Pivato et al., 2008)</ref>.</p></div>

Several studies have suggested that a positive correlation exists between corporate reputation and brand equity.

It is a listed corporation and is active in the exploration, production, refining, transport and sale of oil and natural gas, as well as the manufacture of petrochemicals and biofuels and generation of electricity. The consumers were approached at service stations, repair shops and specialized automotive stores. The company studied has received several international awards and certifications in the petroleum sector, and has a policy of rendering transparent information to its stakeholders through sustainability reports regularly disclosed to the public at large.</p><p>The survey was conducted by means of a self-administered questionnaire, with items scored on a Likert scale with five response options. Each respondent participated voluntarily in the survey. Any doubts were clarified by the researcher while applying the questionnaire.</p><p>All told, 310 valid questionnaires were obtained, of which 16 were dropped for containing outliers. The descriptive analysis revealed that 77.7% of the respondents were men, with average age of 39.07 years (SD = 8.60) and age range from 20 to 65 years. With respect to schooling level, 31.7% of the respondents only had high school diplomas, while 35.4% had college degrees, 31.5% had MBA or MSc degrees, and only 1.4% had doctorates (PhDs). With respect to occupation, 9.4% were students or unemployed workers, 56.2% were employees of a company, institution or other organization, 28.1% were freelance service providers or merchants, and 6.3% were retirees.  </p></div>

In this study, besides the direct impact on brand equity, CSR had an indirect impact by means of corporate credibility and reputation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INDEPENDENT JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT &amp; PRODUCTION (IJM&amp;P)</head><p><ref type="url" target="http://www">http://www</ref>. <ref type="bibr">ijmp.jor.br v. 12, n. 4, May-June 2021</ref><ref type="bibr">ISSN: 2236</ref><ref type="bibr">-269X DOI: 10.14807/ijmp.v12i4.1380</ref> CSR should not be viewed as an unrecoverable expenditure, since it has a strong positive impact on credibility and reputation, thus representing an investment whose fruits will be harvested in the future. CSR affects firms' credibility, but also exerts a strong influence on reputation, as proposed by the theory. As mentioned earlier, corporate reputation is a rare and valuable asset that is hard to imitate, thus making an inestimable contribution to the formulation of business strategy.</p><p>In the case of the corporation studied here, CSR and credibility together explained 57% of the variance of its reputation. This result shows that the company's social responsibility practices, which are not limited to care for the environment according to its published reports (also including relations with employees), have been successful, with broad national recognition.</p><p>The impacts caused by CSR will be translated into gains of the company, more specifically by increasing sales revenue and decreasing costs. The stronger a firm's reputation is, the more motivated its employees will be, meaning higher productivity. Furthermore, by creating psychological income, a good reputation attracts more talented job applicants, since employees take pride in working for a company with a good reputation.</p><p>In the case here, the strengthening of the corporate brand equity will also facilitate penetration in the international downstream market, which is composed of customers who are increasingly exigent regarding the environmental footprint of their suppliers. The results of this study demonstrate that companies should not ignore social responsibility practices, because they positively affect rare and unique assets, such as credibility and reputation.</p><p>The study has some limitations. Chief among them is the use of a convenience sample, which prevents generalization of the results. Therefore, we recommend using random samples in future studies. The sample was also limited to consumers in the Brazilian market, leaving room for future studies including consumers from other countries.</p><p>The hypothetical model was applied to a single company. Future studies could include other firms in the oil and gas sector, or companies in other sectors. Finally, the study did not consider all the dimensions of corporate social responsibility, so future works can analyze whether the economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic dimensions have similar or different effects on corporate brand equity.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Path diagram of the hypothetical model Source: Proposal conceptual model, adapted from Hur et al.
