<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this study is by investigating the Information Security Awareness of University Students via statistical techniques, revealing the existing awareness and giving some suggestions to improve this awareness. By the internet, which entered our daily life snappily, information and technology era has been started and it gave new point of view by changing our lifestyle in many areas as electronic commerce, education and government. By developing and rapidly improving technology, Individuals' having enough capacity to use it, information culture has spread over all parts of the society. By increasing the information systems and internet every day, by using private and secret information, doing both public and individual processes via these systems has increased the importance of information and information systems and resolve the information awareness as an obligatory case. It can be observed nowadays that there are many information guilt is being perpetration. Its known that related ministry in our country is taking enough security precautions both hardware and software for the information and system security and researching on new actions. However, the most important factor to pan out for the information and system security is the development of corporate and individual awareness. With this purpose, to measure the computer usage praxis and Information Security Awareness levels of Students of Afyon Kocatepe University, by using "Information Security Awareness Scale", which has developed previously the related data is obtained via a questionnaire and analyzed by SPSS and LISREL software. In this study as statistical techniques, Explanatory Factor Analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analyzes and Structural Equation Modeling is used.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>As a result of improvements in information technology, central bodies have been replaced by scattered architectural designs, and electronic applications that are accessible through internet and network. Several concepts beginning with e-(e-commerce, e-education, e-reservation, e-exam, e-school, ebank, etc.) have been become a part of our life as a consequence of an increase in using of electronic information infrastructures, for instance internet, computer networks, online systems, remote access and so on <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Awareness and behavior among all kinds of users are important parts of the information security performance of an organization. Adequate information security training is thus required in order to create and improve user awareness and behavior. This paper discusses and evaluates the effects of a training programme aimed at improving users information security awareness and behavior by involving them directly. Several single or combined measures might be taken in order to improve users information security performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, ranging from the distribution of messages via, e.g. pamphlets, emails, intranet pages, screen savers, posters, mouse pads, and pens to games, formal presentations, lunch meetings, and training courses <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Most IS security managers pay more attention to technical issues and solutions such as firewalls, routers, and intrusion detection software, while pay less focus on soft issues such as the hazards caused by end users lack of IS security awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Information security awareness can be described as a state where users in an organization are aware of their security mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>Cyber threats increase continuously with the introduction of new technologies and the legal boundaries related to the privacy of personal information and its use by the corporations are not clear and are often subject to legal interpretation. Consequently, it is an obligation of the person to be aware of the threats and to protect his or her personal information. However, due to inappropriate use of technology and since individuals level of awareness toward threats on information security is low, significant information security risks do exist. Therefore, with the aim of achieving higher information security, numerous software and hardware protection methods have been developed, making it quite hard to exploit information systems (IS) in terms of software and hardware gaps. Despite these high investments, as stated by Pahnila et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the number of security incidents does not decrease. Abawajy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> points out that no matter how many and how strong the layers of technological defenses in an organization, the information security is only as strong as its weakest link, and different tools, such as social engineering, can been used to target individuals, who can be considered to be the weakest link of the security chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Stanton et al. [21]</ref> concisely address this by stating that even the best technology that can be used to mitigate numerous IS security problems cannot work successfully unless the people in organizations do the right thing <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Students (aged 1824 year olds) are high-risk and attractive candidates for security attacks. This can be explained by the fact that students are typically transient and have less credit history than more established adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. A student may receive a web postcard in an email, and inadvertently installs a Trojan horse onto his system, becoming a victim of a clever social engineering attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method</head><p>Structural Equation Model (SEM) is a method for representing, estimating and testing a theoretical network of linear relations between variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The structural model is that component of general model that prescribes relations between latent variables and observed variables that are not indicators of latent variables. SEM is a statistical technique for testing and estimating causal relationships using a combination of statistical data and qualitative causal assumptions. It is used in social, behavioral and educational sciences, namely, psychology, biology, economy, marketing and medicine.</p><p>SEM is a comprehensive statistical method used in testing hypotheses about causal relationships among observed and unobserved (latent) variables and has proved useful in solving the problems in formulating theoretical constructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Its function has found to be better than other multivariate statistics techniques which include multiple regression, path analysis and factor analysis. Other statistics techniques could not take them into consideration due to the interaction effects among depend and independent variables. Therefore, a method that can examine a series of dependence relationships simultaneously helps to address complicated managerial and behavioral issues. SEM also can expand the explanatory ability and statistical efficiency for model testing with a single comprehensive method <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. As the assumptions of structural models, five general conditions must met before one can reasonably infer a causal relation between two variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>:</p><p>The presumed cause (e.g., X) must occur before the presumed effect (e.g., Y); that is, there is temporal precedence. There is association, or an observed covariation, between X and Y. There is isolation, which means that there are no other plausible explanations (e.g., extraneous or confounding variables) of the covariation between X and Y; that is, their statistical association holds controlling for other variables that may also effect Y. The form of the distribution of the data is known; that is, the observed distributions match those assumed by the method used to estimate associations. The direction of the causal relation is correctly specified; that is, X indeed causes Y instead of the reverse, or X and Y cause each other in a reciprocal manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Sample and Scale</head><p>In terms of sampling theory, since the general proportion of the attitudes and behaviors of the population within the frame of research was not obvious, the contingent sampling technique could not be applicable. Assuming the normality assumption is met, the method that grounds on the acceptable error level was used in determining the volume of the sample. In the equation, which is calculated by using the formula indicating that the number of units to which the scale is carried out, n = {(z 2 )(σ 2 )}/(d 2 ); the volume of sample was calculated as 500; on 0.05 significant level, z = 1.96 d(sensitivity) = 0.043, p and q values as 0.5. After determining sampling, a 5-point Likert-type questionnaire ranging from 1 (definitely disagree) to 5 (definitely agree) is applied to randomly 560 students in the campus of Afyon Kocatepe University between dates 1-30 November, 2016. Because of some unfilled and wrong replied questionnaires, analyzes are concluded over 546 questionnaires via SPSS and LISREL software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Findings</head><p>Before applying the SEM, as a statistical order, Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) applied to related data set. The results of EFA and Cronbachs α values for the factors A, B, C, D and E are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. E3. I am aware that my user information in application software may be sold to any companies with the intend of questionnaire, advertisement and marketing.</p><p>.705</p><p>As a result of the EFA, there are 5 factors for general information security awareness named as A: Internet security, B: Social Media Usage, C: Web browser and Network Security, D: Password Generation and E: Social Media Traps explained the 57.177 % of total variance and total Cronbachs alpha values for these fife factors is calculated as 0.839. According to EFA results 2 factors named as X: Threats and Y: Precautions related with Information Security Awareness (ISAX and ISAY) explains the 58.478 % of total variance and total Cronbachs alpha values for these two factors is calculated as 0.912.</p><p>Related with these EFA results, CFA is applied to this data set and results are given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. For CFA and SEM, to improve the fitness of the model, there has also some modifications applied by suggestions of the software, by adding some error covariances to the variables.</p><p>There are more than one goodness of fit index for CFA and SEM. The most commonly used test statistics in SEM are likelihood ratio chi-square statistics (X 2 ), root mean square error of approximation statistics (RMSEA), goodness of fit index statistics (GFI) and adjusted goodness of fit index statistics (AGFI). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, shows that the Structural Model given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is statistically significant and has a good fitness according to all goodness of fit statistics. Besides these Fitness Criterions X 2 (124) = 231.30; X 2 /df = 1.865 &lt; 3 also means that there is an acceptable fit.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> RMSEA: Root Mean Square Error of Approximation, NFI: Normed Fit Index, NNFI: Non-Normed Fit Index, CFI: Comparative Fit Index, SRMR: Standardized Root Mean Square Residual, GFI: Goodness of Fit Index, AGFI: Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index)</p><p>For the sub-factors of Information security, named as : (A) Internet security, (B) Social Media Usage, (C) Web browser and Network Security, (D) Password Generation and (E) Social Media Traps, the results of CFA, given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> indicate that, the most important variables on these factors are A2. "I am aware of not to click on the links that I dont know, otherwise a malware may infect device when I am surfing", B3. I am aware that my personal pictures that I shared in social media may be used in bad faith. C2. I am aware that my information can be followed by packed users from any network that I connected. D2. I am aware of generating a strong (complex and long) password, may increase my security and E1 "I am aware that when I connect to some social networks, my location information can be seen" with the coefficients of 0.68, 0.72, 0.67, 0.60 and 0.67 respectively. The results also indicate that among these sub-factors while the highest correlation is between Internet security and Password Generation with the coefficient of 0.68, the lowest correlation is between Social Media Usage and Web browser and Network Security with the coefficient of 0.40. According to all goodness of fit statistics, given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, the Model given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> is also statistically significant. Besides for this model X 2 (54) = 153.55; X 2 /df = 2.843 &lt; 3 is also another indicator to an accept this model statistically significant.</p><p>According to results of CFA, given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>., for Threats (X) and Precautions (Y) which are the sub factors of general security information, the most important variable on the students information about Threats is ISAX3: "I know precaution methods for spywares" with the coefficient of 0.78. the most important variable on these students information about precautions is ISAY4: "I know about the points to consider when I use the USB drives" with the coefficient of 0.73. The results also indicate that there is a positive and strong correlation between the information of Threats and precautions with the coefficient of 0.84. Considering the EFA and CFA results, to determine the relations among the students information about Threats and sub-factors of information security awareness, the results of SEM is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. and for this model the alternative research hypotheses are given in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.  According to all goodness of fit statistics, given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, the Structural Model given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> is within the acceptable limits and for this model X 2 (259) = 581.19; X 2 /df = 2.244 &lt; 3 means statistically significant too.</p><p>As it can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>., on the information about threats, the most and the less important sub-factors of information security awareness are Internet security awareness and Password Generation awareness respectively. Because the path from threats to social media usage is not statistically significant as given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>., the coefficient of this path is ignored. According to other coefficients it can be said that for the one unit increase on the students' information about threats there will be 0.21 unit increase for their awareness about Internet security, 0.20 unit increase for their awareness about Web browser and Network Security, 0.17 unit increase for their awareness about Social Media Traps and 0.15 unit increase for their awareness about password generation. Results of the hypothesis tests for the structural model given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>. (Y ) → (E) 0.17</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.89">Confirmed</head><p>As it can be seen from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. except H2, all the hypotheses about this Structural Model are confirmed. To determine the relations among the students information about Precautions and sub-factors of information security awareness, the results of SEM is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. The alternative research hypotheses for this model are also given in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.  For the Structural Model given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, X 2 (238) = 502.49; X 2 /df = 2.111 &lt; 3 and all the goodness of fit statistics, given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> are within the acceptable limits for this model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 6. Alternative Study Hypotheses</head><p>Results of Structural Equation modeling given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>., indicate that on the information about precautions, the most and the less important sub-factors of information security awareness are Internet security awareness and social media usage awareness respectively. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> also indicate that for the one unit increase on the students' information about precautions there will be 0.49 unit increase for their awareness about Internet security, 0.45 unit increase for their awareness about Web browser and Network Security, 0.37 unit increase for their awareness about password generation, 0.25 unit increase for their awareness about Social Media Traps and 0.20 unit increase for their awareness about Social Media Usage.</p><p>Results of the hypothesis tests for the structural model given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">7</ref>. As it can be seen from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">7</ref>. all of the hypotheses about this Structural Model are confirmed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results and Discussion</head><p>There are many studies on information security and they all mention the importance of threats and the precautions to be more secure in this digital era. In this study the effects of threats and precautions on the awareness of information security is examined separately via structural equation modeling. As a result within the threats as information security knowledge, the most effective factor found as knowledge on taking measure about the security precautions for ID robbery (ISAX2). Edgeways, knowledge about Threats most effect internet security as the sub-factor of information security awareness. Within internet security awareness, the most effective factor is found as being aware of not to click on the links that he/she doesnt know, otherwise a malware may infect device when they are surfing (A2).</p><p>This results also corresponds with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In their research on the main factors of information security, they found that some malevolent people make some information robbery via using the sore points of the systems and getting personal and corporate information. As a precaution they also mentioned the importance of checking and controlling these kinds of software continuously.</p><p>Similarly, in another study, Gökmen and Akgün <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> mentioned that in recent years one of the most important attacks towards information systems is forwarding the users to fake web sites by fishing. By this way malevolent people get the bank accounts, e-mail and social media accounts of the people who are unaware of information security.</p><p>In their study Çakr and Kesler <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> mentioned the importance of not to click on the links which the users are not completely sure. This result also corresponds with the result of our study. In our study, we found that the awareness on clicking the unknown links while surfing is the most effective variable on internet security awareness. Importance of using anti-virus software is also the common result as getting some precautions.</p><p>One of the other results of this study by considering the effects of information security knowledge about precautions on the information security awareness is; within the precaution knowladge, the most effective factor found as knowing how to use the virus protection software in information systems (ISAY1). Effect of precautions again shows itself much on internet security as the sub-factor of information security awareness and again within internet security awareness, the most effective factor is found as being aware of not to click on the links that he/she doesnt know, otherwise a malware may infect device when they are surfing (A2).</p><p>Besides other studies, the results of this study also correspond itself and internet security becomes the most important factor to be considered among all other factors. Combining with the other factors if it is not considered and supported with other useful tools, people may be in trouble both from economical and spiritual sides.</p><p>Additively to the results of this study, to improve the information security awareness, people should be warned and much educated about spywares, points to consider when using the USB drives, generating a strong (complex and long) password, being careful for sharing location information, being careful when connecting the internet from an unknown network, being careful while sharing personal picture.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.Figure 1.
