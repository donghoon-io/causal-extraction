<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Values are goals and beliefs that affect a person's decisions, behaviors, choices and the resulting lifestyle <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Each individual has its own values and these values are gained as a result of education, experience, culture and interpersonal relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Values representing basic beliefs about what is right, good or desired affect both personal and professional behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Professional values are defined as common beliefs about the value or quality of common concepts and behaviors over a particular discipline. Professional values as common beliefs bring together individuals with different cultural backgrounds and are considered the basis for creating a standard professional identity and ideology <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>. Professional values that form the basis of nursing practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> are one of the most important factors that guide nurses' thoughts, actions, practices and interactions with patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7)</ref>.</p><p>Nurses are guided by professional values in the decisionmaking process regarding care actions to be implemented and in resolving ethical problems. Nurses who internalize professional values gain competence in resolving conflicts and determining priority actions and so they contribute to maintaining a quality, safe and ethical care <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. It is extremely important for nurses to be aware of professional values such as accuracy, honesty, altruism, autonomy, and equality in order to offer a qualified and humanistic patient care (9). Studies examining the professional values of nurses have shown that nurses adopt values such as human dignity, social justice, autonomy, honesty, responsibility, professional commitment and trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>.</p><p>Nursing care is based on a series of universal humane and altruistic values that will bring meaning and satisfaction to people's lives in their relationships with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Conditions such as insufficient or undeveloped nurses 'professional values affect nurses' goals, strategies, actions and especially caregiver roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. The care giving role emerges as an ancient role that forms the core of the traditional practice of nurses. And other roles of modern nursing are thought to derive from the caregiver role, while nurses are most independent in practicing their caregiver roles, and this role is the role of nursing profession <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. In their study, Pang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> have determined that nurses' problem solving and critical thinking skills, determining patient care needs and resolving patient and family concerns are affected by values. In addition, similar studies have reported that nurses' attitudes towards caregiver roles are positive <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>. American Nurses Association (ANA) have stated that professional values improve the quality of nursing care <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. The relevant literature reports that nurses 'professional values affect nurses' caregiver roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. However, no study explaining this relationship has been found. Therefore, in this study, it was aimed to examine the extent to which professional values affect nurses' caregiver roles by using the structural equation model. Nurses' awareness of their values and how these values affect their care behavior are the basis of humanistic nursing care. Therefore, it is important to demonstrate care roles developed by nurses based on their professional values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Purpose of the Research</head><p>This study examines the relationship between the professional values of nurses working in a university hospital in Central Anatolia Region of Turkey and their attitudes towards caregiver roles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Hypotheses</head><p>H 1 hypothesis assumed that providing care positively affects the attitude towards nurses' caregiver roles. H 2 hypothesis assumes that professionalism positively affects the attitude towards nurses' caregiver roles. H 3 hypothesis assumes that activism positively affects the attitude towards nurses' caregiver roles. H 4 hypothesis assumes that justice positively affects the attitude of nurses' caregiver roles. H 5 hypothesis assumed that the professional values of loyalty positively affect the attitude towards nurses' caregiver roles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Design</head><p>In this study, a model was predicted to examine the relationship between nurses' professional values and attitudes towards caregiver roles. The predicted model based on the literature was tested with a descriptive research design using structural equation modeling. In the predicted model, it was assumed that the professional values of nurses will positively affect their attitudes towards caregiver roles (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Sample and Data Collection</head><p>The descriptive correlational study was conducted in the second largest university hospital in Konya, between July and September 2018. The hospital, with a total bed capacity of 934, also serves patients from nearby provinces. A total of 501 nurses work in the hospital. Working hours are carried out in two shifts, 08: 00-16: 00, 16: 00-08: 00. Due on the service, a nurse provides care to an average of 15 patients. The hospital does not have an in-service training program on nursing care and nursing values.</p><p>The entire population was created without sample selection. All the nurses working in this hospital (N:501) form the universe, the sample of the study consisted of 366 (72%) nurses meeting the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were determined as follows: working as a nurse in internal diseases, surgical and intensive care clinics, providing one-toone patient care, volunteering to participate in the research and not being on leave/have report between the dates of the research (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Nurse Promotion Form, Nurses Professional Values Scale, Nurses' Attitude Scale Regarding Nursing Role were used to collect data. Before starting the study, pilot study was performed with 10 nurses who were not included in the sample. After the pre-application, it was determined that all the questions in the data collection forms were understandable. The nurses included in the pre-application were not sampled. Verbal consent was obtained from the nurses by explaining the purpose of the study, and then a questionnaire was given. The questionnaire forms were taken back from the nurses one day later in order to be filled in during the hours when the workload was low. Forms filled in about 15 minutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Nurse Promotion Form</head><p>In this form, which was created in line with the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref> by the researchers, there were 14 questions that questioned the socio-demographic and working characteristics of nurses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Nurses' Professional Values Scale</head><p>Nurses Professional Values Scale was developed by Weis and Schank, to determine the level of perception of nurses and nursing students' professional values <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. The Professional Values Scale of the Nurses whose Turkish version was made is a 5-point Likert type with 26 items (Not important= 1, Somewhat important= 2, Important= 3, Very Important 4, Very Important 5). The scale includes five factors: caregiving, professionalism, activism, justice and loyalty. The lowest score that can be received from the scale is 26 and the highest score that can be received is 130. The high score indicates that professional values are high. The Turkish version of the scale was considered valid and reliable based on the study by Geçkil et al., (2) (Cronbach's alpha=0.92). In this study, the Cronbach's alpha value for the whole scale was 0.96; for the subscales, it ranged between 0.74 and 0.90.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Attitude Scale of Care Giving Role of Nurses</head><p>Nurses' Attitude Scale Regarding Caregiving Roles (NARRCR) was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Koçak et al., 2014)</ref> to determine the attitudes of nurses towards caregiver roles. And this scale is a 5-point Likert type scale consisting of 16 items whose validity and reliability have been made by the same researchers. NARRCR consists of three sub-dimensions, namely, Elimination of the patient's self-care needs and attitude towards the nurse's counseling role, Attitude towards the nurse's role in protecting the individual and respect for their rights, and Attitude towards the nurse's role in the treatment process. The items of the scale are evaluated by the participants in line with the answers I definitely disagree, I disagree, I partially agree, I agree, I totally agree. And these evaluations are scored between 1-5 points. The lowest score received from the scale is 16, and the highest score is 80. Accordingly, as the score obtained from the scale increases, the attitudes of nurses towards caregiver roles are interpreted positively. As the score received from the scale decreases, it is interpreted as negative. The Cronbach Alpha value found in the work of Koçak et al. 0.91 was found <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. The Cronbach's alpha value for the whole scale was 0.96; for the subscales, it ranged between 0.72 and 0.83.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Ethical Dimension</head><p>Ethics committee approval was obtained from a university's Drug and Non-Medical Device Research Ethics Committee (2018/1446), institutional permission was obtained from the hospital where the study was conducted. Participants were informed on the front cover of the questionnaire, and those who gave consent were included in the research. Necessary use permit was reached from author to use the Nurses 'Occupational Values Scale and from author to use the Attitude Scale of the Nurses' Care Giving Roles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Evaluation of the Data</head><p>The reliability analysis of the scales used in the study were determined by the Cronbach's Alpha coefficient and the relationship between the scales by Pearson correlation coefficient. Student t test, One-Way Variance Analysis and Kruskal Wallis analysis and structural equation model were used in the statistical evaluation of scale scores according to demographic characteristics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head><p>This study was determined nurses' perception of professional value and attitudes towards caregiver roles a good. It was found that the professional values of the nurses explain 39% of the change in the value of attitudes towards nurses' caregiver roles. Hypothesis that professional values of loyalty positively affect the attitude towards nurses' caregiver roles was accepted in the path analysis.</p><p>The reason for the existence of nursing is the nursing philosophy, which guides the behaviors and practices towards care. However, the most important building block of this philosophy is nursing values <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Professional values gained by nurses through their education and practice throughout their lives are essential for professional nursing practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7)</ref>.</p><p>In our study, the mean NARRCR total score of the nurses was 94.73 ± 17.87. Considering that the highest score that can be obtained from NARRCR is 130, it can be stated that nurses' perception of professional value is at a good level. Similar to our study finding, there are studies showing that nurses' perception of professional value is good <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</p><p>NARRCR total score of the nurses was found as 62.41 ± 9. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref>.</p><p>When the highest score that can be obtained from NARRCR is considered to be 80, According to these results, it can be said that nurses' attitudes towards caregiver roles are at a good level <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, it was found that there were similar findings with our research result. It was found that nurses have a good level of caregiver roles. Similar results were obtained in other studies on this subject <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref>.</p><p>According to the models developed in this study, we found that care giving, professionalism; activism and justice values do not directly affect the attitude towards the caregiver role. Although care is not specific to nursing, it is unique for nursing and is the main responsibility of nurses all around the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28)</ref>. It is a factor which contributes significantly to the relationship between the nurse and the patient and to the treatment and cure of the patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(29)</ref>.</p><p>Professionalism is defined as expertise, knowledge, skills and behaviour in a given field <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref>. Nurses who embrace the role of professional caregivers take more responsibility in care and thus quality of care is improved <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32)</ref>. Activism, another value, is an action which is more than awareness, participation and advocacy and refers to a conscious, strong effort to achieve change. Activism is a component of the nursing's social contract and contract with people. Nurses prefer activism as an intervention to address inequalities in healthcare and so nursing transforms from a passive but supportive role to a role that takes action to create change (33). Justice includes equal treatment and fair distribution of resources in healthcare services <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(34)</ref>. Justice which plays a role in developing a professional identity is necessary to protect people's health and survival just like healthcare. For nurses justice includes participating in social actions, taking action for vulnerable people and addressing weaknesses of the healthcare system <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(35)</ref>. Values described according to the information found in the literature are estimated to have a positive effect on the attitude towards the caregiver role <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. American Association of Nurses have reported that the professional values of nurses improve the quality of nursing care and are directly related to their caregiver roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Geyer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(36)</ref> have reported that care behavior and work performance are positively influenced by professional values. Another study have reported that nurses with positive professional values take more responsibility and provide better patient care compared to their colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. However although nurses received high scores in these set of values, these were not found to have any effect on the caregiver role. In addition, the fact that the explanation rate of all values is 39% also supports this result. The reason for this finding could be that although nurses have professional values at cognitive and emotional level, they have trouble in reflecting these in behaviour and attitude. Because attitude is an emotional, cognitive state which is developed based on education and experience and has the power to orientate and affect one's behaviour. Attitude is for the long term and includes the process of cognitive, emotional and behavioural development <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(37)</ref>. We believe that the nurses included in this study did not have sufficient care attitude due to their low education level and work experience.</p><p>In the hypothesis direct effect of loyalty on the attitude towards the caregiver role is supported. Loyalty refers to being loyal and keeping promises. Loyalty principle includes the commitment in the patient-nurse relationship and keeping promises based on this principle ensures to maintain an environment of trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(38)</ref>. This finding can be associated with strong loyalty value which is among the personal values of nurses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Strengths and Limitations</head><p>This study was conducted on 501 nurses and achieved the desired power to find significant relationships. In addition, this study is the first to examine the relationship between nurses' attitudes towards care giving roles and their professional values. This study has some limitations. First, the results cannot be generalized since the study was carried out only in a single hospital. Secondly, results may have been affected by Turkish healthcare system and cultural characteristics of the nurses. Another limitation is that the study is based on self-reporting. The tendency to respond as expected in such survey studies may affect the results of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Implications for Practice and Research</head><p>Professional values ensure improvement of care outcomes and preservation of professional identity. It is important for the professional values to be addressed and improved as the driving force behind the care behaviors of the nurses. Further studies that evaluate how professional values of nurses are reflected in behaviour and on-the-job training about values for nurses who are newly recruited and for nurses with high school/associate degree are recommended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION</head><p>As a result of these data obtained, it was found that nurses' professional values and attitudes towards caregiver roles are at a good level. It was seen that the professional values of the nurses partially affect the attitude towards the caregiver roles. Care giving, professionalism, activism, justice, loyalty variables were found to explain 39% of the change in the value of attitudes towards care giving roles of nurses.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .Figure 1 .</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
