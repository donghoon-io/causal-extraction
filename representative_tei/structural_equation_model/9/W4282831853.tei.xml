<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Depression has a multitude of clinical and public health consequences for HIV patients. The magnitude of HIV patients who failed first-line antiretroviral treatment and switched to second-line therapy is becoming a growing public health concern. However, unlike first-line therapy, to date, little attention has been given to mental health problems in such patients, particularly in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this research was conducted to determine the magnitude of depression and its determinants among HIV patients on second-line antiretroviral therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p>A multi-centered cross-sectional study was conducted on 714 HIV patients on second-line therapy who were selected via systematic random sampling. Data were collected in personal interviews as well as document reviews. The nine-item patient health questionnaire score was used to assess depression, while the three-item Oslo Scale was used to assess social support. The associations between exogenous, mediating, and endogenous variables were identified simultaneously using structural equation modeling. Statistical significance was declared at a P-value less than 0.05, and the effect sizes were presented using 95% CI.</p><p>Results: Depression was reported in 27.7% of HIV patients on second-line therapy [95% CI: 24.7-31.1%]. Social support has a direct [ β = -0.9, (95% CI: -1.11 to -0.69)] and indirect [ β = -0.22, (95% CI: -0.31 to -0.13)] negative effect on depression. Perceived stigma was a mediator variable and significantly associated with depression [ β = 0.40, (95% CI: 0.23-0.57)]. Co-morbid illness [ β = 0.49, (95% CI: 0.35-0.63)], high viremia [ β = 0.17, (95% CI: 0.08-0.26], moderate and high-risk substance use [ β = 0.29, (95% CI: 0.18-0.39)], and not-workable functional status [ β = 0.2, (95% CI: 0.1-0.31)] were all positively associated with depression.</p><p>Conclusions: This study revealed that there was a high prevalence of depression among HIV patients on second-line antiretroviral therapy. Social and clinical factors were associated with depression risk. As a result, screening, prevention, and control strategies, including psychosocial support, should be strengthened in routine clinical care.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Globally, 27.5 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) have accessed antiretroviral therapy (ART) by the end of 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, currently, the magnitude of HIV patients on second-line antiretroviral therapy is becoming a growing public health concern. A considerable number of patients worldwide had experienced first-line treatment failure and switched to second-line antiretroviral treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In Ethiopia, the proportion of people living with HIV on second-line antiretroviral therapy is also a rising issue; according to a systematic review, 15.9% <ref type="bibr">(11.6-20</ref>.1%) of PLHIV had failed their first-line regimen <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Treatment failure is characterized by a worsening of HIV clinical symptoms while on antiretroviral treatment, and those patients will be switched to second-line antiretroviral therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>PLHIVs are disproportionately affected by mental health problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. "Depression is a common mental health problem characterized by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, feelings of tiredness, and poor concentration" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. According to the Ethiopian national health survey, the prevalence of depression in the general population was 9.1% (95CI%: 8.39-9.9%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In contrast, a systematic review conducted in Ethiopia revealed that the pooled prevalence rate of depression in PLHIV on first-line antiretroviral was 36.65% (25.48, 47.82%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Furthermore, in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, PLHIVs not only have a higher risk of severe illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, but they also may have an increased risk of depression, which is associated with stress, social isolation, and stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Depression and HIV infection have a bidirectional relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Depression can result in worsening HIV-related treatment outcomes and compromise the overall quality of life, including poor medication adherence, immunological failure, and the development of severe opportunistic infection. Consequently, increase the chance of subsequent treatment failure and the development of drug-resistant strains. Depression can also raise the likelihood of substance abuse and other highrisk behaviors including the risk of HIV acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. Similarly, HIV infection causes depression as a result of coping with the diagnosis, worsening clinical symptoms, stigma, social rejection, co-existing poverty, and the adverse effects of certain antiretroviral medications <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Even though HIV and depression are linked, very little is known about the magnitude of depression among HIV patients who were receiving second-line antiretroviral therapy, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, some symptoms of depression and HIV are mimicked; consequently, depression in PLHIV might be under-recognized and under-treated.</p><p>The risk factors for depressive symptoms are interconnected, and most previous studies have used the univariate analysis method to address these issues. However, this method of analysis has limitations in terms of identifying the direct and indirect effects of covariates, as well as failing to account for measurement errors for latent constructs such as depression, social support, and internal and perceived stigma. Furthermore, factors which lead to depressive symptoms are heterogeneous, and local evidence is required for context-based decision making and intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing and other mitigation strategies in the prevention of COVID-19 have a considerable effect on social support and mental health problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. To mitigate COVID-19, HIV, and mental health issues, it is necessary to generate cultural and context-based evidence.</p><p>Hence, based on the above-identified gaps, we conducted a multi-centered cross-sectional study to determine the magnitude of depression and to investigate the association between depression symptoms and socio-demographic, clinical, social support, and internal and perceived stigma among PLHIV on second-second antiretroviral therapy. To investigate such factors, the Structural Equation Model (SEM) was employed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study setting</head><p>This study was conducted in twenty public health facilities that currently provide second-line therapy in the eastern Amhara region, northeast Ethiopia. Of those facilities, six were hospitals, and fourteen were health centers. According to Ethiopia's national HIV/AIDS guideline, health centers having greater than 200 HIV patient loads are allowed to initiate second-line treatment. Eastern Amhara is a high-burden area in the region <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>. Currently, 2332 PLHIV are attending the second-line program in the above health facilities.</p><p>In Ethiopia, the current standard second-line antiretroviral therapy consists of a combination of three ARV drugs (at least two of which are new to the patient); two Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) as a backbone; Lamivudine (3TC) and Abacavir (ABC), or Zidovudine (ZDV) or Tenofovir (TDF) and one protease Inhibitors (PIs); Lopinavir/ ritonavir (LPV/r) or Atazanavir /ritonavir (ATV/r) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15]</ref>. Those PIs drugs are safer, more effective in viral suppression, and have a lower risk of resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, all facilities use the same documentation and reporting system, and HIV data are handled by SMART care, ART registration/logbook/, and chronic ART follow-up form <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. At every clinical visit, these registers are updated. PLHIV is currently scheduled every 3 months. Patients will be assessed for nutritional status, opportunistic infections, medication adherence, drug side effects, and refilled with ART and other preventative medications at each appointment. Antiretroviral treatment success is monitored using clinical, immunological, and viral load (VL) assessment, in which viral a load test is done after initiation of ART at 6 months, 12 months, and every 12 months and serves as a gold standard monitoring tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and period</head><p>A multi-centered cross-sectional study was conducted in the Eastern Amhara region, Northeast Ethiopia, from December 2020-to February 2021.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Source and study population</head><p>HIV patients who were receiving second-line antiretroviral therapy and following their HIV care and treatment in the eastern Amhara region were considered a source population, whereas those who were available during the data collection period were considered a study population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variables and measurements</head><p>The primary outcome variable in this study was depression, which was measured using the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. Each question requires participants to rate the frequency of a depressive symptom experienced in the two weeks before evaluation. The total score ranges from 0 to 27. The severity of depression symptoms was divided into five categories: not depressed (5 points), mild depression (5-9 points), moderate depression (10-14 points), moderately severe depression <ref type="bibr">(15-19 points)</ref>, and severe depression (20-27 points). To determine the prevalence of clinical depression, patients having depression scores of ten or above were considered as having clinical depression. This PHQ-9 items depression screening tool was validated in the Ethiopian context <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Perceived and internalized stigma were measured by six and eight items on the HIV Stigma Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>. Items were evaluated using a four-point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, agree, and strongly agree), with higher scores indicating higher levels of stigma. The total score of the scale for PS and IS ranged from 6-24 and 8-32, respectively.</p><p>In this study, social support is expected to have a direct and indirect effect on depression, which was measured using the three-item Oslo Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. The Oslo Scale's total score ranges from 3 to 14, with the higher value indicating strong social support. For descriptive purposes, the social support scale was divided into three broad categories: "poor support" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, "moderate support" (9-11), and "strong support" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref>. For SEM analysis, the row social support score was used as a continuous scale.</p><p>The risk of substance use was measured using the WHO Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) (V.3.1), which consists of seven items for each of alcohol, khat use, and tobacco products <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. Participants were then classified as having low, moderate, or high-risk substance use depending on their score.</p><p>The socio-demographic characteristics include age, sex, marital status, education level, independent source of income, and substance use. Similarly, the following patient clinical characteristics were included: Body mass index (BMI), functional status, WHO-clinical stage, viral load, medication adherence, and comorbidity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). An individual's comorbidity status was assessed using a selfreport method. Co-morbid NCDs are defined as a patient who has one or more of the following confirmed noncommunicable illnesses (NCDs): diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and cancer. Medication adherence was assessed using a self-report method taken from the patient's medical records. Patients who were taking 95% of the prescribed antiretroviral medication were considered to have optimal adherence unless classified as not having optimal medication adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. Patients with viral load measurements below 1000 copies/mL are considered as low viremia unless they have been classified as having high viral load (high viremia) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Two criteria were used to classify CD4 cells. Healthy individual CD4 cell counts range from 450 to 1500. The risk of opportunistic infection begins in HIV patients when CD4 cell counts are less than 450. Hence, based on the above two concepts, 450 cells/mm3 was used to categorize the last CD4 cell measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size</head><p>The basic rule of thumb for determining the minimum required sample size for structural equation modeling is 5 to 20 times the number of free parameters to be estimated in the hypothesized model <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. A 1:10 ratio of free parameters to be estimated to respondents was used to calculate the required sample size to meet the study's objectives. This implies that there should be ten responders for each free parameter in the hypothesized model. As a result, the required sample size was determined to be 670, based on the 67 parameters to be estimated based on the postulated model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The final sample size, after adding 10% for non-response, was computed as 737.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling procedure</head><p>A systematic random sampling method was used to select the sample individuals. First, the sampling frame was secured in each facility by reviewing the updated ART registration logbook. Then, based on the number of patient loads, samples were proportionally allocated to each health facility. Finally, using the systematic random sampling method, sample clients were recruited every third interval while the clients came for routine follow-up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p>Data were collected using a structured questionnaire via face-to-face interviews by trained degree nurses at the ART outpatient department (ART-OPD). A questionnaire was prepared in the local language and data were collected for a three-month duration while the patient came for a routine clinical visit. Moreover, document reviews are also done to extract patient clinical profiles. The extraction sheet was prepared per the national consolidated antiretroviral guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data quality management</head><p>To ensure the quality of the data, the questionnaire was prepared by considering existing literature and guidelines. Furthermore, validated tools were used to measure latent constructs. The questionnaire was also pretested, and necessary modifications were made. Data collectors were trained on the objective of the study, the content of the questionnaire, and, in general, how to collect the required data. The data collection procedures were closely supervised, and on-site feedback was given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Data were cleaned and entered into the EpiData Version 3.1 software. Then, exported to Stata version 14 for further analysis. For categorical variables, frequency (%) was computed. For a continuous variable, first, distributional assumptions were checked using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk test. Then, for normally and skewed distributed continuous variables, mean with standard deviation (SD) and median (interquartile range, IQR) were employed, respectively.</p><p>The hypothesized association between various exogenous and endogenous or mediating variables was verified using the Structural Equation Model (SEM). The effect size was presented using standardized and unstandardized beta coefficients, and statistical significance was declared at a P-value less than 0.05. The analysis began with the hypothesized model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), and modifications were made iteratively by comparing model fit indices and information criteria of each model fitted, then adding path links or including mediator variables if the path coefficient is statistically significant and theoretically supported. Finally, an over-identified model with the best model fit indices and the smallest amount of information was kept (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The direct, indirect, and total effects were calculated using a nonlinear combination of estimator techniques when the mediation effect was present.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Socio-demographic characteristics</head><p>Out of 737 approached sample patients, 714 (96.87%) agreed and gave their consent to participate in this study. Of those surveyed, 468 (65.5%) lived in urban areas, 400 (56%) were female, and 342 (47.9%) were married. Concerning the source of income, 511 (71.6%) participants had an independent source of income. Similarly, of the 714 participants, 281(39.4%) had not attained formal education, and 355 (49.7%) were orthodox religious followers. The median (IQR) age and year on antiretroviral therapy of participants were 37 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(42)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(43)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(45)</ref> years and 10 (8-13) years, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical characteristics</head><p>Out of 714 study participants, 545 (76.3%) had a BMI of &gt; = 18.5 kg/m 2 , while 540 (75.6%) participants had viral load measurements below 1000 copies/ml. Similarly, 685 (95.9%) and 608 (85.2%) participants were not in advance of the WHO clinical stage and workable functional status, respectively. Regarding medication adherence and comorbidity status, 679 (95.1%) patients had optimal adherence and 63 (8.8%) patients had a comorbid disease. TDF-3TC-ATV/r (361 (50.6%)) and AZT-3TC-ATV/r (338 (47.3%) were the most prescribed secondline antiretroviral regimens (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlations between depression, social support, perceived stigma, and other covariates</head><p>The relation between depression with social support and perceived stigma was statistically significant with Pearson correlation coefficient (r) measurement (r = -0.63, P-value &lt; 0.001) and (r = 0.57, P-value &lt; 0.001), respectively. Social support was negatively correlated with perceived stigma (r =-0.48, P-value &lt; 0.001) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement model</head><p>Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) revealed that all the factor loadings for latent variables were statistically significant at a P-value less than 0.001. Furthermore, an evaluation of model fitness was made. It revealed that the final model was a good fit at Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.07, Standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = 0.04, and a Comparative Fit Index (CFA) = 0.93 value (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factors associated with depression (direct and indirect effects)</head><p>Social support has a direct and indirect negative effect on depression. The direct effect of social support was that as a patient's social support score increased by one unit, their depression score fell by 0.90 factor on average while holding the effect of other covariates in the model constant [ β = -0.9, (95% CI: -1.11 to -0.69)]. Fur- thermore, perceived stigma moderated the effect of social support on depression [ β = -0.22, (95% CI: -0.31 to   Patients with a non-workable functional status had a 0.2 higher average depressive symptom score than those with a workable functional status [ β = 0.2, (95% CI: 0.1- 0.31)]. Patients with a high HIV viral load and those who had comorbid disease had an average depression score of 0.17 and 0.49 points higher than their counterparts, respectively. Patients at moderate and severe risk of substance use have a 0.29 higher risk of depression than lowrisk patients [ β = 0.29, (95% CI: 0.18-0.39)] (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude of depression and its determinants among PLHIV on second-line antiretroviral therapy. And found that more than one in four HIV patients had experienced clinically significant depression. Poor social support, high perceived stigma, comorbidities, substance use, uncontrolled viremia, and non-workable functional status were factors significantly associated with depression.</p><p>The prevalence rate of clinically significant depression in this study was 27.7%. This finding is higher than Ethiopia's national health survey depression prevalence rate (9.1%), which was conducted on the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> as well as other studies done on HIV patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. In contrast, the finding of this study is lower than some other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. This variation could be due to the difference in depression screening tools used in different research. Besides, socio-demographic and cultural variation might have a role in the variability of depression prevalence from place to place. In general, this finding confirms that a considerable number of HIV patients are affected by depression. This may have multi-face implications at the individual, public, and policy levels. Hence, screening, prevention, and control strategies including psychosocial support should be strengthened in routine HIV clinical care by integrating with WHO's mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. The likelihood of depression was found to be negatively related to social support. This association is supported by many studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>. Perceived stigma, on the other hand, was positively correlated with depression, which is consistent with prior research findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref>. Patients who receive social support from family, friends, and other concerned individuals can develop a stronger sense of self-worth <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>, gain strength and courage, and feel safe and supported during their illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. Social support also improves medication adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, clinical outcomes, and reduces HIV/AIDS stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>, all of which may reduce the risk of depression. Furthermore, social support reduces stress, fear, and the risk of depression associated with COVID-19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. Generally, this study implies that social support plays a pivotal role in averting mental health problems. Hence, support from family and friends should be encouraged at the societal level while keeping COVID mitigation strategies.</p><p>Being non-workable functional status and being comorbid with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were positively associated with the risk of depression. This finding is consistent with the findings of other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>. Prior literature showed that a significant number of PLHIV had developed non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44]</ref>. Co-occurrence of NCDs in people living with HIV increases pill burden, worsens chronic pain, impaired diet, and disrupts sleep patterns. This also further increases the risk of depression and other mental health problems. Moreover, being unproductive and dependent on others in daily living aggravates the occurrence of depression. Hence, NCD intervention packages should be integrated and delivered with chronic HIV care at the ART clinic.</p><p>Uncontrolled viremia and the risk of depression were also positively correlated, which is supported by other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46]</ref>. When viremia is uncontrolled while on second-line antiretroviral therapy, patients may be concerned about developing drug resistance, treatment failure, and clinical worsening. As a result, depression and other mental health concerns will become more common. Thus, patient-centered psychological counseling, routine viral load monitoring, and enhanced adherence support should be strengthened for high viral load patients.</p><p>Substance use was linked to an increased risk of depression, which is supported in prior studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47]</ref>. Patients on second-line antiretroviral therapy may experience psychological stress, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and substance use might provide temporary relief from mental distress. Substance abuse, on the other hand, leads to depression and other mental health issues over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>. Depression, in turn, may increase the chance of substance use. This finding suggests that screening for risk of substance use should be promoted in routine HIV clinical care to reduce the burden of depression in HIV patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strength of the study</head><p>First, the study is the first of its kind in Ethiopia to provide first-hand information to improve depression in HIV patients on second-line therapy. Second, this study examines the direct, and indirect effects of covariates using SEM analysis while controlling measurement errors for latent variables. Third, it was conducted with large sample size and considered social and clinical variables simultaneously. Lastly, the findings of this study can be generalized to other low-income areas where similar WHO HIV treatment modalities are used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitation of the study</head><p>This study failed to examine depression episodes across time. As a result, longitudinal research should be considered as a possible solution that allows seeing depression episodes across time after the commencement of ARV.</p><p>The other limitation was related to the depression screening tool, which is not a diagnostic tool. Self-reported adherence measurement may introduce an overestimation of adherence secondary to social desirability and intentional recall bias. Similarly, risk of substance use and stigma assessment tools may also have social-desirability and intentional recall bias. Comorbidity is measured via self-reported whether a patient has confirmed diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and cancer. This may undermine the proportion of comorbid cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>This study revealed that there was a high prevalence of depression among HIV patients taking second-line antiretroviral therapy. Social support has a direct and indirect effect on depression. Perceived stigma mediates the effect of social support on depression. Having comorbid NCDs, uncontrolled viral load, substance use, and not-workable functional status were all found to be significant predictors of depression in PLHIV.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 A</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 A hypothesized model for factors associated with depression among people living with HIV on second-line antiretroviral therapy (oval and rectangular shape variables represent latent and observed variables, respectively)</figDesc><graphic coords="4,62.75,94.96,470.52,291.48" type="bitmap" /></figure>
