<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In low and middle-income countries, adolescent mental health is not only a major public health challenge but also a development concern. Depression and anxiety are the most common mental health disorders and somatic symptoms often co-exist with them. Adolescents with common mental health problems are associated with an increased risk of suicide, future unemployment, and poor quality of life. However, little is known about the mental health of adolescents in Ethiopia. Thus, this study aimed to assess the determinants of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms among adolescents in Northwest Ethiopia, in 2022.</p></div>

Somatic symptom disorder is a disorder in which individuals excessively or disproportionally think or experience feelings about the symptoms, which results in significant disturbance in daily life <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56]</ref>. Depression and anxiety often coexist with somatic symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59]</ref>, widespread issues in primary health care and subspecialty settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Somatic symptoms result in more than half of the patient visits to primary health care <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[60]</ref>. Its prevalence is estimated to be 5 to 7% <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[61]</ref> in the general population and 5 to 30% <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">63]</ref> in adolescents. Somatic symptoms delay the diagnosis of depression and anxiety because most people seek medical attention for bodily symptoms. Finally, individuals with somatic symptoms may experience physical harm from unnecessary medical procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[64]</ref>. Different scholars reported that female <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[67]</ref>, being in private school <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[65]</ref>, physical inactivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">69]</ref>, extracurricular tutoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70]</ref>, stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref>, anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">75]</ref> and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">77]</ref> had significant positive relations with somatic symptoms.</p><p>Mental health is a key part of sustainable development goals that affect every other goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, yet the prevalence of mental health disorders is still high <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. To decrease the burden of mental illness, targeting adolescents is important; since more than half of mental health problems start at this age <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and 50% of adolescent mental health problems will proceed to adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[78]</ref>. Although adolescents in low and middle-income countries are disproportionally affected by mental health disorders, there is limited data on the prevalence and determinants of mental illness in Sub-Saharan Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">80]</ref>.</p><p>In Ethiopia, although mental health services were included in the national health policy, there is a paucity of evidence on the prevalence and determinants of anxiety, somatic symptoms, and their relation with depression. Adolescents in northwest Ethiopia are especially vulnerable to mental illness, due to repeated internal conflicts in northern Ethiopia <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[81]</ref>. Moreover, studies conducted outside of Ethiopia had methodological flaws, as they used logistic or linear regression to assess multiple mental health outcomes, which cannot address the bidirectional relationship between outcome variables and the indirect effect of predictors. In such cases, non-recursive structural equation modeling, which is a multivariate statistical framework used to measure the complex relationships between different observed and latent variables simultaneously is preferable.</p><p>Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence, and determinants of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms and the relationship between these variables among high school and preparatory school adolescents in Gondar town by using non-recursive structural equation modeling. The findings from this study will help psychologists, psychiatrists, policymakers, students, the community, and the government to tackle the increasing burden of mental health problems. Moreover, it will be used as input for sustainable development and as baseline data for further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods and materials</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and context</head><p>An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from June 8 to June 24, 2022, among high and preparatory school adolescents in Gondar town, Northwest, Ethiopia. It is located 728 kilometers from Ethiopia's capital city of Addis Ababa, and 180 kilometers from Bahir Dar, the capital city of the Amhara regional state. There are 395, 000 residents <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[82]</ref>, and 48 healthcare facilities including one comprehensive specialized hospital, eight health centers, one private general hospital, fifteen specialist clinics, fifteen medium clinics, and eight primary clinics. Adolescents comprise more than 25% of the Ethiopian population and the health of adolescents determines the future development of the country. According to the town administrative educational department report, the town has seventeen (twelve public and five private high schools), with a total of 24,308 students. Among them, 2408 students were from private schools (1457 girls and 951 boys) and 21900 students were from public schools (12052 girls and 9848 boys).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>All high and preparatory school adolescents in Gondar town who were registered for the second semester of the 2021-2022 academic years were included in the study. Night preparatory and high school students and students who were transferred in from other areas after January 8, 2022, were excluded.</p><p>The sample size was determined using the general rule of thumb approach for calculating sample size in structural equation modeling. This approach suggests a range of 5 to 20 times the number of free parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[83]</ref>. In this study, a 5:1 ratio was used to obtain the minimum adequate sample size. Based on the hypothesized model Considering 134 free parameters, the sample size was 134*5 = 670: Since the sampling procedure is multistage sampling with 2 stages, a design effect of 2 was considered.</p><p>Therefore, the sample size becomes 670*2 = 1340 After adjusting for 5% for non-response rate, the final sample size became 1340+1340*5% = 1407 Therefore, the sample size becomes 670*2 = 1340 After adjusting for 5% for non-response rate, the final sample size became 1340+1340*5% = 1407 To select 1407 participants, a two-stage stratified random sampling technique was employed (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Out of 1407 randomly selected individuals, 1379 completed the questionnaire; hence, the response rate was 98%. The mean (± SD) age of the respondents was 17.23 ± 1.25 years with a range of 15 to 19 years. The majority, 1238(89.78%) of the respondents were from public schools, and regarding residence, two-thirds 915(66.35%) of respondents were from urban areas. Approximately half, (654, 47.43%) of the respondents had moderate stress. The majority, 1237(89.7%), of the respondents did not have a history of chronic illness (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Behavioral, academic, and relationship-related factors of participants. A history of alcohol consumption was reported by more than one-third of the respondents (493, 35.75%). In terms of physical activity, only a minority of the respondents (224, 16.24%) reported being physically active. The majority of respondents (656, 47.57%) rated their academic ability as good. When it comes to perceived social support, approximately two-fifths of the respondents (564, 40.9%) reported low levels of perceived social support (S1 Table ).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection procedures and tools</head><p>Primary data in pen and pencil format were gathered using a structured questionnaire through a self-reported questionnaire for those who could see and by face-to-face interview for 3 individuals who could not see. Four trained data collectors with a first degree in public health were assigned for data collection. The data collection took place in a classroom setting, and it required approximately 15-25 minutes to complete the questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed to gather data on socio-demographic characteristics, behavioral factors, academic-related factors, relationship-related factors, clinical factors, depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and stress domains (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) (S1 Dataset). All questionnaire details were supplied in the supplementary information (S3 Table ). public health experts and two psychiatrists. Reliability, construct validity, convergent validity, and omitted variable bias were all examined in the analysis process (S1 Annex).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data processing, model building, and analysis</head><p>Collected data were coded and entered into Epi-data software version 4.6, and exported to STATA version 16 and AMOS version 21 for further analysis. Non-recursive structural equation modeling was employed to assess the complex relationship between different latent and observed variables. Model assumptions such as: specified and identified model, multivariate normality, missing, outlier, sample size adequacy, independency, common method bias, and strong and valid instrumental variable were checked. Finally model fitness evaluation and model comparison were considered.</p><p>Specified model: In this study, we specified the model after extensive literature searching and reading as presented in (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1)</ref>.</p><p>Identified Model: In this study, non-recursive structural equation modeling with complete correlation of error terms was employed. There are three methods of identification in nonrecursive structural equation modeling; which are: the presence of unique instrumental variables, the order condition, and the rank condition. Among these, only the rank condition is sufficient for identification, and the remaining two are necessary, but not sufficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[91]</ref>. In this study, all endogenous variables in the reciprocal loop had unique instrumental variables. Order condition: the number of excluded variables for that specific endogenous variable minus the total number of endogenous variables minus one should be greater than or equal to 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[91]</ref>. In our model, to satisfy the order condition, each endogenous variable in the recursive loop should have at least 3-1 = 2 excluded variables. For depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms 9, 8, and 11variables were excluded respectively. Therefore, the model fulfills the requirement of the order condition. Rank condition: In this particular study, there are 3 endogenous variables in the non-recursive loop 17 exogenous variables, and one endogenous variable out of the feedback loop (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Rank conditions were determined using the system matrix. To formulate the system matrix, a separate equation for each endogenous variable in the feedback loop is mandatory. Therefore, the equations for depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms disorder are presented as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Depressionðy1Þ ¼ x2 alcohol use þ x3 chronic illness þ x4 physical activity þ x5 family mental ilnessþ x7 school ty þ x11 death of beloved one þ x12 social support þ x16 family pressur þ x18 stress þ x20ðy2Þ þ x21ðy3Þ somaticsymptom</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">Anxietyðy2Þ ¼ x2 alcohol use þ x3 chronic illness þ x4 physical activity þ x5 family mental ilness þ x7 school type þ x13 physical trauma þ x17 acadamic ability þ x18 stress þ x19ðy1Þ þ<label>x21ðy3Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">Somaticsymptomðy3Þ ¼ x2 alcohol use þ x3 chronic illness þ x4 physical activity þ x5 family mental ilness þ x7 school type þ x14 study time þ x15 extra school tutoring þ x18 stress þ x19ðy1Þ þ x20ðy2Þ</formula><p>Rank conditions in the system matrix below begin by constructing a system matrix based on the above equations. Endogenous variables are presented in the row and all variables are presented in the column. In each row, zero or one appears in the column that corresponds to that row. One indicates that the variable represented by the column has a direct effect on the endogenous variable in that row or on the endogenous variable itself, and 0 indicates the excluded variables for that specific endogenous variable in that row <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[91]</ref>.</p><p>x 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 y1 y2 y3 The following steps were followed for the identification of rank condition Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.

Multivariate normality was assessed using Mardia's kurtosis and its critical ratio. The data were not normally distributed, since Mardia's kurtosis was above 7 and its critical ratio was above 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[91]</ref>. Although item parceling and outlier deletion were attempted, there was no improvement.

There were 62 observations with Mahalanobis distance p-values less than 0.001. The data were examined to determine whether they were outliers or caused by data entry errors. However, this was not due to a data entry error, and as mentioned above, multivariate normality did not improve significantly with their exclusion. Therefore, those outlier observations were kept to maintain the study's power.</p><p>From the total observations, there were six observations with missing values. All missing values were from predictors and had no relationship with the outcome variable; thus, list-wise deletion was performed because they constituted less than 5% of the total sample and were considered missing completely at random, so 1373 observations were used for the final analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[93]</ref>.</p><p>Sample size adequacy and strength of correlation: The critical ratio for Bartlett's test of sphericity in this study was high and significant for all constructs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independency of observations:</head><p>The intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to test the independence of observations. School type and grade level were employed as clustering variables. The ICC was less than 0.1 in our study (S4 Table ), and a classical structural equation model was used.</p><p>Common Method Bias: Harman's one-factor test was used to check common method bias (CMB).There was no CMB in this study since the overall variance covered by one factor was 25.2%, which is below the suggested cut-off (50%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[94]</ref>.</p><p>Strong and valid instrumental variables: The strength and validity of instrumental variables were checked by using the Cragg-Donald Wald F statistic and Sargan Hansen test, respectively.

In the present study, the strength and validity of the instrumental variables between anxiety and somatic symptoms, and between somatic symptoms and depression were invalid and weak. As a result, the non-recursive paths from somatic symptoms to anxiety and depression were excluded; since deleting a non-recursive path is one treatment for a weak and faulty instrument. Finally, an identified model with valid and strong instrumental variables in a non-recursive loop was preserved in (S5 Table ).</p><p>Model fitness and model comparison. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to evaluate the measurement model in the study. Model fit measures, including CMIN/ DF, CFI, TLI, and RMSEA, were utilized to assess the overall goodness of fit of the model. However, in the hypothesized measurement model (S1 Fig), the goodness of fit fell below the acceptable threshold: CMIN/DF = 5.10, CFI = 0.81 and RMSEA = 0.05. To enhance the model fit, factorial item parceling was implemented <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[96]</ref> (S6 Table ). Following this adjustment, the model fit improved, yielding CMIN/DF = 2.60, CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.99, and RMSEA = 0.001 (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</p><p>In the study, model comparisons were conducted for the structural and measurement components of the model using various criteria such as AIC, CMIN/DF, TLI, CFI, and RMSEA. The model that included only significant variables with significant disturbances after parceling was chosen as the well-fitted model. This selected model exhibited desirable characteristics, including a small AIC and CMIN/DF, a small RMSEA, and a large CFI and TLI (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, the prevalence and determinants of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms and their relationships were examined using non-recursive structural equation modeling. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and somatic symptoms were moderate.

The bidirectional relationship between anxiety and depression was significant. Depression and anxiety were significant determinants of somatic symptoms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms</head><p>In the current study, the overall prevalence of self-reported depression was 28.21% (95% CI = 25.8%, 31%). This is in line with the study conducted in Jimma 28% <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>, but it was higher than the meta-analysis conducted in China (24.3%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>, and lower than the studies conducted in Aksum (38.2%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>, Nepal (44.2%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[98]</ref>, Bangladesh (36%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[99]</ref>, and India(57.7%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[100]</ref>. In this study, the prevalence of anxiety was 25.05% (95%CI: 22.8, 27.5%). This is consistent with the study conducted among children and youth in Ethiopia 0.5 to 23% <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. However, it is lower than the study conducted in Kenya at 37.99% <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, Saudi Arabia at 63.5% to 66% <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">102]</ref>, Jordan at 42.1% <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and Chandigarh at 80.85% <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In contrast, it was higher than the worldwide estimates of anxiety among children and adolescents (6.5 to 10%). In our study, the prevalence of self-reported somatic symptom disorders was 25.24% (95% CI = 23, 27.6%). This is consistent with the study conducted among children and adolescents in Tarragona which reported 5 to 30% <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[62]</ref>. However, it was higher than the prevalence in the general population (5-7%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[103]</ref> and lower than that in a study conducted in Qatar (47.8% in females and 52.2% in males) <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[104]</ref>. The variation in the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms across different settings can potentially be attributed to differences in screening tools and the choice of cutoff points used for assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">105]</ref>. Furthermore, since mental health is the combination of physical, social, cultural, and religious environments this could be explained by socio-cultural differences in different settings. Poverty, violence, and other stressful social conditions are not unique to any one region of the world, nor are the symptoms and manifestations that result from them. However, factors that are frequently associated with race or ethnicity, such as socioeconomic position or country of origin, can enhance the likelihood of being exposed to these sorts of stressors, and thus stressors may lead to depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[106]</ref>. Furthermore, the ongoing internal conflict in northern Ethiopia may contribute to an increased prevalence of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. The exposure to traumatic events, displacement, and the disruption of social support systems can have profound psychological effects on individuals living in conflict-affected areas. The constant fear, uncertainty, and instability associated with conflict can lead to heightened levels of stress and psychological distress, resulting in a higher incidence of mental health issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[81]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between anxiety, depression and somatic symptoms</head><p>After controlling for other factors, we observed that depression had a direct positive effect on anxiety [adjusted β = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.508, 1.010]. This finding aligns with a study conducted in the United Kingdom <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. It is possible that individuals with depression spend a significant amount of time worrying about their symptoms, leading to increased anxiety. Additionally, the co-occurrence of depression and anxiety could be influenced by a shared set of genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[107]</ref>. Furthermore, we observed that high level of anxiety was also significantly related to higher level of depression [adjusted β = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.483, 1.081]. This finding is compatible with other findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">54]</ref>. One possible explanation for this association is that individuals with anxiety may attempt to control their worries. However, if they are unable to effectively manage their anxiety, it can negatively impact their emotions, leading to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and depression. Additionally, this relationship could be influenced by the presence of shared genetic factors and environmental influences <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[107]</ref>.</p><p>As the level of depression increases the level of somatic symptoms will also increase [adjusted β = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.167, 3.629]. In the same way, as the level of anxiety increases the level of somatic symptoms also increases [adjusted β = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.270, 3.825]. This result is supported by other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[77]</ref>. A possible explanation for this consistency could be that in depressed individuals' neurotransmitters such as nor-epinephrine and serotonin are low; a decrease in neurotransmitters may lead individuals to focus on physical symptoms. Moreover, it could be explained by the co-occurrence of somatic symptoms, anxiety, and depression. The sharing of common sets of gene and environmental factors may also be a possible justification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factors related to depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms</head><p>Female sex had a statistically significant positive effect on depression [adjusted β = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.003, 0.109], anxiety [adjusted β = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.059, 0.179], and somatic symptoms [adjusted β = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.074, 0.198]; this implies that being female increases the levels of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms compared to being male, controlling for other factors. This finding is consistent with other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>. The observed differences between men and women can be attributed to various factors, including variances in brain chemistry and hormonal fluctuations. Women may experience changes in neurotransmitters due to menstrual fluctuations in progesterone and estrogen, which can contribute to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and somatic complaints. Additionally, the presence of androgen receptors in males may provide some protective effects against certain mental health disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[108]</ref>. Another influencing factor could be the differences in reporting behavior between genders. Females may be more inclined to report and seek help for mental illnesses compared to males. Cultural factors also play a role in how men and women approach and disclose their experiences with depression and other mental health conditions. These cultural influences can shape the willingness of individuals to openly discuss and seek support for their mental health challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[109]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[110]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[111]</ref>. Gender role might also be the possible reason: Girls are often socialized to prioritize traits such as being nurturing, accommodating, and conforming to societal expectations. These expectations can create pressure to meet unrealistic standards, leading to increased stress and vulnerability to mental illness.</p><p>Self-rated academic ability, being in private school and perceived social support had significant association with depression, anxiety and somatic symptoms. As the self-rated academic ability of adolescents increases, the levels of depression [adjusted β = -0.05, 95% CI: -0.083,-0.031], anxiety [adjusted β = -0.03, 95% CI: -0.065, -0.006], and somatic symptoms [adjusted β = -0.02, 95% CI: -0.039, -010] decrease. This result is compatible with the study conducted in Iran <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[112]</ref>, and Slovakia <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[113]</ref> and with other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">114]</ref>. The possible explanation for this might be that students with low academic ability are terrified of negative responses from teachers, parents, and friends, which may lead to fear about their future career, which will lead them to become anxious, and anxiety will lead to depression and somatic symptoms. Learning in a private school had a statistically significant positive effect on depression [adjusted β = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.016, 0.207], anxiety [adjusted β = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.159, 0.415 and somatic symptoms [adjusted β = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.046, 0.292]. This means that participants in private schools had higher levels of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms than their counterparts. In contrast to our finding, the study conducted in India <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref> showed that public school students had a higher level of depression than private school students; this disparity may be explained by differences in sample size and method of analysis. Our study had a larger sample size than the India study, and the India study did not address the confounding effect. Higher levels of depression, anxiety and somatic symptoms in private schools may be due to parents' expectations of high academic achievement in private schools; which leads students to be stressed when they try to meet their parents' expectations, and stress leads to depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. Perceived social support had a significant negative effect on depression [adjusted β = -0.13, 95% CI: -0.229,-0.029], anxiety [adjusted β = -0.22, 95% CI: -.304, -0.139], and somatic symptoms [adjusted β = -0.11, 95% CI: -0.176, -0.067]. This means that as social support increased, the level of depression, anxiety and somatic symptoms decreased or students with low social support had higher levels of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms than those who had high social support. This finding is compatible with different reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">55]</ref>. The probable reason for this might be that low social support may increase feelings of loneliness, worthlessness, and hopelessness, leading to a loss of interest in activities and depression, depression might leads to anxiety, and somatic symptom. Moreover, students with low social support are more likely to have low self-esteem and negative cognition than those with higher social support, which may lead to depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[115]</ref>.</p><p>Stress had a significant positive effect on depression [adjusted β = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.642, 0.900], anxiety [adjusted β = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.955, 1.264], and somatic symptoms [adjusted β = 086, 95% C: 0.700, 1.025]. This indicates that participants with high levels of stress had higher levels of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms, holding other predictors constant. Our finding is supported by different studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">71]</ref>. The possible justification for this could be that high-level stress impairs brain function, which may lead to fluctuations in neurotransmitters such as dopamine, which leads to depression. In addition, immune dysregulation during stressful life events leads to anxiety, and anxiety leads to depression and depression may lead to somatic symptoms.</p><p>Alcohol use had a positive effect on depression [β = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.073, 0.201], anxiety [adjusted β = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.041, 0.188], and somatic symptoms [adjusted β = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.062, 0.211]. This implied that adolescents who had a history of alcohol drinking had higher levels of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms than those who did not drink. This finding is congruent with the study conducted in the USA <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref> and in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">116]</ref>. This could be because alcohol affects brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine, which are responsible for happiness, and the decrease in these chemicals leads to feelings of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[117]</ref>. Furthermore, alcohol consumption may contribute to sadness, anxiety, and somatic symptoms in adolescents by reducing age-appropriate activities such as physical activity and social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[118]</ref>. Moreover, it could be due to the direct effect of ethanol on nerve cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[119]</ref> which leads to heightened awareness of normal body sensations. It is also worth noting that alcohol use can be a potential symptom of these disorders.</p><p>Our findings showed that holding other predictors constant, having a history of physical trauma had a direct positive effect [adjusted β = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.014, 0.125] on anxiety. This indicates that students with physical trauma had higher levels of anxiety than those who did not. Our finding was supported by the study conducted in the Netherlands <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[120]</ref>. This consistency could be justified by the fact that in reaction to trauma, neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and gamma amino butyric acid may be impacted by cortisol and depletion of these neurotransmitters may lead to anxiety. In addition, individuals with physical trauma may internalize the event and may have subsequent negative thoughts about themselves, which affect their emotional experience and might lead to anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[121]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p>The study examined a bidirectional relationship between anxiety and depression, considering both direct and indirect effects of various independent variables on different dependent variables. The sample included adolescents from both private and public schools, focusing on an underrepresented segment of the population. However, it is important to acknowledge that this study is not without limitations. First, only school adolescents in Northwest Ethiopia were included in the study which may affect generalization to all adolescents in Ethiopia. Second, self-reported screening tools were used, which may overestimate the effect size. Third, we only asked about alcohol use in the last 3 months, not how much, how frequently, or for how long, which could influence the outcome. Last, the temporal relationship between predictors and outcomes was not evaluated due to the cross-sectional nature of the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this study, a moderate prevalence of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms was found. Self-rated academic ability, physical trauma, school type, sex, stress, alcohol use, and perceived social support were significant determinants of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. The bidirectional relationship between anxiety and depression was significant. Depression and anxiety were significant determinants of somatic symptoms. Based on the study findings, the authors suggest the following points: Policymakers should prioritize bolstering the prevention and management of mental health disorders among adolescents. One effective approach is to introduce and establish school-based mental health screening services. It is crucial to recognize and address the bidirectional relationship between anxiety and depression, while also considering somatic symptoms as potential indicators in individuals with these conditions. Additionally, conducting studies that encompass out-of-school adolescents is highly recommended.
