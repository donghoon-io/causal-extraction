<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Globalization of the 21 st century increased the cross-border assignments leading to the international collaboration of people around the world. With the pandemic engul ng the entire world, countries closed their borders and imposed lockdowns, people were advised to stay at home, public places, including schools and colleges, were closed and employees were asked to work from home. Therefore, psychosocial impact is widely found linking with the socio-demographic and many attributed factors <ref type="bibr">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background Of The Study</head><p>Perceived loneliness (PLS) referred to the deprivation in social relationships and degree of de cit social interaction <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>. It is considered as a subjective phenomenon causing unpleasant and distressing situations <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>. Besides, insu cient social connectedness such as lack of trust in close persons/interpersonal trusts (IPT), institutional trust (IT) boosts the experience of loneliness <ref type="bibr">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6)</ref>. This degree of loneliness is situational, transient and varied over different chronic period that observed during this pandemic <ref type="bibr">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8)</ref>. Subsequently, it creates several distressful events and perceived stress (PSS) resulting from the aversive state of mind (6, 9). Lonely people were more sensitive to social threats as the consequences of loneliness generate a lack of trust and make them paranoid <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, felt hypnotic like stressed, faultily evaluate others by declining optimism and self-esteem <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>. Such behaviours are extended to mental disorders and suicidal tendencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. A recent review reported that the impact of loneliness in the form of social isolation and being alone can increase the mortality by 29-32% <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</p><p>The way individuals construed and interpreted their experiences seems to matter more in predicting adverse effects associated with loneliness than the actual social network available to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Evolved de nition of loneliness refers to the discrepancy of one's desired and actual relationships with individuals and circumstances (4) that make them self-isolated due to lack of trust (16-18). Primarily, the evolutionary theory of loneliness suggested it as an adaptive mechanism posited to produce an "aversive state" that elicited social pain of feeling unsafe, threat sensitivity and negative social information bias <ref type="bibr">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref> that deteriorating the social bond <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>. This model explicates that, loneliness integrates the unsafe feelings of a person and activates an anarchy mechanism inside of his/her mind. This also incorporates the trust issues in the form of social connectedness as it connotes sensitivity to social contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Trust is crucial to psychosocial functioning of interactions with others that via a cognitive model and critical facet of personal relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>. Weiss (5) distinguishes these emotional (absence of connection and trust in others) and social loneliness (a perception of a lack of interpersonal connections or a de cient social network). Various research of lead by Rotenberg support these loneliness classi cations by adopting the mechanism of cognitive schema and social disengagement. Negative form of trusts affects the socio-emotional behavior and elevated the state of loneliness (cognitive schema) or low trusts incorporate to the ineffective social interactions reduced the social relationships (social disengagement) (16, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Therefore, loneliness can be negatively correlated to the trusts in forms of social disengagement and cognitive attachment of individuals.</p><p>Contrarily, loneliness contains self or social alienation due to isolation, emotional pain and cognitive development (26). In this way, expatriates rely on and get attached to the people or organizations they may trust during important life events. Thus, a major factor in loneliness causing mental stress is a loss of faith in the people or institutions that one relies on.</p><p>Expatriates (or expats) are experiencing higher cultural diversity than others because of community level objective factors and cultural parameters including communication trusts <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. They optimized the cross-cultures serving their practical needs from survival to maintaining order, socio-economic viability, and communication pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>. Therefore, they are mostly deal with the socio-cultural and psychological adjustment for mental wellbeing. It includes negotiation with the organizational and environmental trust or daily stress in the host culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>. There are evidence that expatriates felt loneliness when they faced acculturation and adaptation problems in the host country <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. Besides, the COVID-19 enhanced individual level of isolation integrated with socio-cultural isolation and impacts on their psychosocial wellbeing, perceived loneliness and stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr">36)</ref>. One study found that social disconnectedness with increased stressors during pandemic reduce trusts from government institutions as well as business <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</p><p>In previous literature, the cross-cultural experiences of loneliness, stress and trust issues are loosely used and explored for expatriates subject to intercultural psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. Besides, this relationship is not clearly explained yet during long term non-aversive situation that need another look during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, we developed a conceptual model of perceived stress, loneliness and trusts based on the previous literatures integrated with theory of loneliness and dynamics of attachment theory (See Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Both models of perspective are posited a socio-cognitive perspective of loneliness (6). It can develop the cognitive stresses of a person affected by loneliness and the lack of trust manifested in their behavior <ref type="bibr">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>. Therefore, we evaluate the psychological distress (PSS) subject to loneliness (PLS), interpersonal (IPT) and institutional trusts (IT) regarding expatriates' cross-cutting the borders as well as the cultures. All these models indicate the trust issues of a person can contribute to their stress and loneliness correlates in both ways as a mediator. But this relationship is not clearly explained yet for expatriates and need another look during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, psychological distress (PSS) is needed to evaluate the subject to loneliness, IPT and IT regarding expatriates' cross-cutting the borders as well as the cultures.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study overview</head><p>People who are living outside of their country of origin or living in a foreign country (country of residence not by birth or originality) are considered as the primary respondents of this study (we used the term "expatriates" to refer this group). We used data from the collaborative COVIDiSTRESS global survey (COVIDiSTRESS global survey network, 2020-available at <ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/2ftma/">https://osf.io/2ftma/</ref>). The aims of this survey were to improve understanding on human experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic from the psycho-social perspectives. The survey collected data from March 30 to May 30, 2021 through an open science foruman online platform. A total of 125,306 respondents aged 18 years and more voluntarily participated from 179 countries. The survey was conducted in 47 different languages and dialects with collaborators from 39 countries and regions. Details of the sampling procedure have been published elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>A total of 21,439 respondents were included in this study (See gure 2). The conditions of inclusion were: (i) respondents living outside of their country of origin, and (ii) provided responses to all items of the PSS scale (UDRA-UCLA PSS-10).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical approval</head><p>The data collection was anonymous and ethical clearance for the COVIDiSTRESS was waived by the IRB legal department, Aarthus University, Denmark to conduct urgent data collection. The data was collected online using Qualtrics platform and individual participated voluntarily and gave informed consent. As required, the study was pre-registered in the OSF platform as a project (details given in <ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/6ut4v">https://osf.io/6ut4v</ref>).</p><p>[Insert the gure 2: Sample selection here]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variables and Measures</head><p>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10): Comprised of 10 items with a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 5 (Very often). Among the items, 4 items (items 4,5,7, and 8) were scored reversed as these were positively stated (38). Later, the PS score was formulated by aggregating all the items which range from 10 to 50. The Cronbach alpha 0.8736 indicated the good and accepted range of reliability.</p><p>Perceived loneliness scale (PLS-3): This scale is comprised of three items with a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 5 (Very often). The items are-How often have you (i) felt that you lacked companionship? (ii) felt left out? and (iii) felt isolated from others? The items were aggregated and comprised the score of individuals PLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>. The higher the scores, the higher the degree of PLS. The Cronbach alpha (0.7448) indicated the accepted range of reliability.</p><p>Trust issues: Trust issues were divided into two categories-interpersonal trust and institutional trust. All these items were recorded using a scale of 10 equivalent distances ranging from 0 (do not trust) to 10 (have complete trust) on each of the items. Interpersonal trust has 2 items that aggregately constitute a composite score of trust on people ranging from 0 to 20 whereas institutional trust has 6 items that aggregately constitute a composite score ranging from 0 to 60. In both cases, the Cronbach alpha shows acceptable reliability of interpersonal (0.7612) and institutional trust (0.8959).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>Frequency distribution was reported for the sample characteristics of group data where descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation and ranges) were used for the continuous variables. Besides pairwise correlation coe cients were also estimated between those continuous variables scores at &lt;5% and &lt;1% level of signi cance. We also used hierarchical linear regression analysis (HLRA) to estimate the nal model and structural equation modeling (SEM) to con rm the relationships among the latent variables.</p><p>We used maximum likelihood estimation method (mlmv) performing SEM to con rm the relationship.</p><p>Measurement errors of SEM were considered during the analyses. In the model, the PLS attribute was enacted as the mediator as well as the exogenous variable, whereas the institutional and IPT was the exogeneous variable for PSS (exogenous variable) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. The goodness t of SEM was evaluated by the likelihood ratio (Chi-square/df), the comparative t index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis t index (TLI), the goodness of t index (GFI) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The acceptable threshold of RMSEA was ≤0.06, that of χ 2 /df was &lt;3, and that of the rest of the indices such as CFI was≥0.95 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, HLRA estimates the best-tted model from the theoretical aspects. It is one of the best tools to explore the theoretical assumptions in psychology, counselling and social science <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>. A detailed advantages and disadvantages with possible remedies were discussed in other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44)</ref>. HLRA provide the best tted model based on the signi cant changes in R 2 and its corresponding changes in F statistics and p values <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>. One of the very assumptions of the use of hierarchical multiple regression is multicollinearity which is also addressed using the variation in uence factor (VIF) with an acceptable cutoff point (45) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hair et al., 2009)</ref>. All analyses were conducted in statistical software STATA 14 (StataCorp, 2015)</p></div>

We estimated a signi cant covariance between PSS with loneliness (ρ &lt;0.001), PSS with trust in people (ρ &lt;0.001) and loneliness with trust in people (ρ &lt;0.05) (See Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Further, the PLS directly and positively contributed to the PSS (0.66, SE, 0.0116) whereas the IPT (-0.131, SE, 0.006) and IT (-0.034, SE, 0.004) directly contributed to the PLS. We also found an indirect but negative impact of IPT (-0.087, SE, 0.004) and IT (-0.022, SE, 0.003) on PSS (see table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3a</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present study investigated the role of the perceived loneliness between the perceived stress and trust issues (considering both interpersonal and IT) among the expats during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Initial correlation analysis supported the relationship among age, perceived stress (PSS), perceived loneliness (PLS), interpersonal trust (IPT) and institutional trust (IT). Our tted model supports the impact of IPT and IT on PSS through the PLS. A person's responsibility depends on their age that is directed to modify the stresses. As the age increases, coping resource effectiveness improved, and life satisfaction elevated (46). Besides, older adults get bene tted from their past experiences compared to the younger people <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>.</p><p>Our ndings suggested a negative effect, i.e., a decrease to a certain extent; of both trusts (more likely to the interpersonal trust) with expatriate's loneliness. Similar ndings were expressed for university students (48) and marital couples <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>. The insecure attachment is oriented by responsiveness in the relationship and convert the self-centred preferences into pro-relationship motivations. This type of motivation is inferred from the interpersonal trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. Another multi-modal study explains the cognitive effect i.e., acute loners have signi cantly less interpersonal trust compared to non-acute loners <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>. They are less likely involved in social interactions as they increased the interpersonal distances due to safety behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. This mostly prevails among the marginalized individuals (i.e., expatriates) because of their weakened social immune system and social in ammation (6, 51, 52). All these sensitize the social stimuli to avoid hostile conspeci cs and allied to trusted ones while vulnerable <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>. Therefore, integrated and compromised trusts effectively contribute to loneliness and ineffective social interactions of expatriates <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref> and as social disengagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53)</ref>. For example, for old people when the neighbours are trustworthy, the loneliness reduces signi cantly <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>. IPT interacted and mediated the social and family loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55)</ref> in a way that IPT mediated between attachment and relationship quality whereas the relationship quality mediated between loneliness and attachment <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>.</p><p>Our analysis found a reverse relationship of interpersonal trust and perceived stresses because of perceived threat (56), negative social interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref> and psychological discomfort (58). Studies also found that trust can moderate distressful events by eliminating those threats and discomforts (56, 59).</p><p>Higher trusts increased the positive expectations and con dence of others by mitigating psychological discomfort <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59)</ref>. Besides, depressive symptoms are linked to reduced engagement with the community where interpersonal trust is implicative to more social engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Nickerson and others (2019)</ref> found this relationship for the settled refugees in other countries (60). Though online engagement is promoted to reduce loneliness by increasing trusted interactions, studies showed that online is not a de nite solution of it (61, 62).</p><p>In our sample, most of the expatriates were students and labour/jobholders who were dependent on their respective organizations. Besides, international organizations integrated with national agencies of different countries channeling the latest and updated news with measures of reduce transmission and adverse impact. Expatriates are mostly relied on these social, national and international organizations as well as their working places. It exhibits the organizational dynamics of attachments including institutional trusts (63). Besides, the relationship between students and their respective academic institutions were largely strained in lockdown and isolated situation during pandemic. It is due to changing institutional regulations and restrictions by time being and some regulations creates distinctive situation that make them feel disconnected with their academic institutions (64). Controlling the individual and cultural diversi cations, institutional trusts can in uence the expat's stresses and stress factors. On the other hand, loneliness in the workplace resulted from the trust in organizational leaders, because trust in leaders creates a space of social interactions with the organizations (65). COVID-19 period creates job recession, prioritize locales rather than migrants, change strategies and policies defeating COVID-19 and restraint the organizational and political economy; that reliably in uenced their trusts to organizations in uencing their psychological distress (63). We found institutional trusts more likely to in uence an individual's stress rather than loneliness. Slight relations with loneliness occurred due to isolation and movement controls, and frequent decision changes that pose expatriates more to stay idle and alone (65, 66).</p><p>We found positive, direct and extended relationship among the loneliness and stress whereas these mediates other biopsychosocial outcomes (ref). Many recent studies have supported this relationship related to pandemics (61, 67-69). During this pandemic, Landmann and Rohmann integrated the physical dimension of loneliness which is occurred mostly during this pandemic due to preventive protocols. Though in the study, emotional and social loneliness predicted a presumably low level of psychological wellbeing and enhanced stress factors, physical loneliness signi cantly reduced positivity regarding mind and body, joyfulness, connectedness and enhanced worries. Emotional loneliness, on the other hand, resulted in a physical distance as well as losing frequent contacts and social loneliness reduced the social networks (68). Besides the impact of a pandemic, our results supported the relationship of loneliness and stress of expatriates like other studies conducted on the general population and students (6, 9-12).</p><p>We found that lack of trust enhances the loneliness of expatriates and the loneliness increases the perceived stress. Besides, trust in a person is more likely associated with stress and loneliness compared to trust in institutions. Our results concrete the previous study of the adverse relationship of stress with trusts issues and cooperated with loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(70)</ref>. Therefore, loneliness here mediated trust and stresses in our tted model. Alike this yields, other studies also supported loneliness as a mediating factor between stress and other variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72)</ref>. Primarily, the evolutionary theory of loneliness suggested it as an adaptive mechanism posited to produce an "aversive state" that elicited social pain of feeling unsafe, threat sensitivity and negative social information bias <ref type="bibr">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref> that deteriorating the social bond <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>. This model explicates that, loneliness integrates the unsafe feelings of a person and activates an anarchy mechanism inside of his/her mind. Therefore, they also heightened their sensitivity to threats and attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. This incorporates the trust issues in the form of social connectedness as it connotes sensitivity to different socio-cultural contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p>Study results have several strengths and a few limitations. We connect the social and cognitive psychology of the expatriates. This type of relationship is neither found in literature nor theory, especially for expatriates. Though ndings re ect during the crisis without socio-economic adjunction, the novelty of these ndings underlie the social-cognitive psychology of expatriates during any situation as their psycho-social adjustment is a continuum process. Besides, our study integrates the attachment component of adults with the cognitive and evolutionary perspective of loneliness to output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Expatriate's mental wellbeing entirely relates both on recent circumstances and impacted psychological attributes due to the circumstances. The dynamics of the attachment and evolutionary cognitive theory of loneliness aggregately describe the yields. Interventions related to increase trust factors indirectly precipitate stress through behavioral acts of submerged loneliness. As it is the rst study conducted, more empirical studies may be required to establish these facts for migrants and people who are more likely lived in different culture with challenging situations.</p></div>
