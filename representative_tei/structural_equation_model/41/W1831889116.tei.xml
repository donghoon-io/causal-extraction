<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>an adequate fit and results show that strategic management does influence human resource practices. Human resource flexibility practices and performance management have a positive impact on organizational performance, while training was not found to have a significant impact. A direct positive impact of competitive intensity and industry attractiveness on strategic management was supported by the data, as well as a direct positive effect of industry attractiveness on perceived organizational performance.</p><p>One of the central topics of discussion in management and organization theory in recent years has been change in business landscapes (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bettis &amp; Hitt, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Parks &amp; Kidder, 1994)</ref>. These changes have been assumed to be forcing organizations to adapt their practices in order to remain competitive. These adaptive efforts may be due, to a great extent, to the rapid diffusion of new technologies that created conditions for the socalled knowledge revolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hitt, Ireland &amp; Lee, 2000)</ref>, which brought human resource management practices to a new prominence. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kanter (1986)</ref> states, the new workforce is meeting a changing workplace. The management of human resources is one of the ways companies may use to increase their competitiveness in the new organizational landscapes, since managing in a global marketplace, introducing new technology, developing organizational knowledge, improving customer service or product quality or reducing product/service costs, requires considering the "human equation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Pfeffer, 1998a)</ref>.</p><p>A significant body of previous research has reported positive associations between human resource management (HRM) systems and organizational performance. These studies focus on the impact of several specific HRM practices, such as compensation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gerhart &amp; Trevor, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gomez-Mejia, 1992)</ref>, training <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bartel, 1994)</ref> or performance management systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(McDonald &amp; Smith, 1995)</ref>. Other studies report the positive impact of progressive HRM practices on organizational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Delaney &amp; Huselid, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Huselid, 1995)</ref> as well as the virtuous impact of HR sophistication, measured by investments in HR planning, in hiring and in employee development on labor productivity, particularly in capital intensive organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Koch &amp; McGrath, 1996)</ref>. How these various HRM practices are jointly affected by external and internal environmental variables and how they affect organizational results is a comparatively understudied topic (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Jackson &amp; Schuler, 1995)</ref>. This study addresses this gap by testing a model that offers a comprehensive framework. We integrate exogenous market forces and endogenous strategic management characteristics and HRM practices, and examine how these factors influence perceived organizational performance.</p><p>A major contribution of this study is that it explicitly considers direct and indirect influences on organizational performance, in an integrated model. We do so by applying structural equation modeling to a large sample of European companies in 11 different countries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES</head><p>Companies have been advised to develop mission statements and elaborate strategy definitions, which provide direction, goals and profitability targets for their activities (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chandler, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Mintzberg, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Porter, 1980)</ref>. They should also create specific functional strategies, such as financial management or marketing strategies, which define how the companies will allocate their resources in order to achieve their mission and goals. The exercise of strategic planning helps managers to analyze the relevant environmental and internal conditions, in order to anticipate opportunities and threats and therefore improve organizational performance. According to this logical incrementalism perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Quinn, 1978)</ref>, the top management teams set the corporate strategy and sub-units develop specific strategies and tactics needed to respond effectively to environmental challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Wright, McMahan &amp; McWilliams, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>The implementation of corporate and functional strategies depends on the companies' resources and, particularly, on people. The human resource strategy focuses on how the company should manage its staff to assist the organization in the achievement of corporate objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Walker, 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">, Schuler &amp; Jackson, 1987)</ref>. As such, it is argued that companies with explicit mission statements and corporate strategies could be expected to have developed aligned human resource strategies to address the issues relevant for strategy implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Schuler &amp; Jackson, 1987)</ref>. Thus, the strategy pursued by the company is correlated with the needs of human resources, the skills that must be acquired, or that are already possessed, and the types of control systems to ensure the achievement of business goals. According to the resource-based view of the firm, strategies are contingent on having the human resources needed for their implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Wright, McMahan &amp; McWilliams, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Positive correlations have been found between the degree of planning formality and firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Lyles et al, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Pearce, Robbins &amp; Robinson, 1987)</ref> because greater emphasis will be placed on improving the quality of the strategic decisionmaking process, such as goal formulation, developing distinctive competences, determining authority relationships, deploying resources and monitoring implementation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Tregaskis (1997)</ref> also found that organizations with a formalized HR strategy had a higher probability of adopting practices in line with high performance work systems than those with informal or no HR strategy. These views of the strategy formulation process are somewhat at odds with the latest thinking on corporate strategy, which argues that in practice strategies are incremental, emergent and messy <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Johnson &amp; Scholes, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Mintzberg &amp; Waters, 1982)</ref>. However, the counter-argument is that the "commander" model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bourgeois &amp; Brodwin, 1984)</ref> does have value: strategic clarity, which derives from a clearly defined mission and corporate strategy, plus a matching HR strategy, may be expected to positively influence organizational performance through HR practices. In our model, strategic management is measured by the existence of a mission, corporate strategy and HR strategy, as well as by the degree of formalization of these factors. We also consider that strategic management will act as a trigger to the implementation of more progressive HR practices and that these practices will impact organizational performance.</p><p>As <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Delaney and Huselid (1996)</ref> point out, HRM practices affect organizational performance through their impact on employees' skills and ability, motivation and work organization. In this study we also focus on HRM practices in these three areas, by considering training, performance management and HR flexibility respectively, and analyzing how they are associated with strategic management issues.</p><p>To improve employees' skills and abilities and, thus, increase the quality of the existing workforce, companies with formalized strategic management practices will emphasize and invest in employee training and development activities, in line with the business strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arthur, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Huselid, 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Jackson &amp; Schuler, 1995)</ref>. In the same vein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Tregaskis (1997)</ref> found out that organizations with formalized strategies were more likely to invest in training and development activities. Investments in the development of firm-specific skills have been found to be associated with productivity pay-offs and a degree of inimitability that competitors cannot duplicate <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Koch &amp; McGrath, 1996)</ref>, stressing the importance of internal fit for achieving sustainable competitive advantage.</p><p>Our first hypothesis, therefore, will be:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1: Strategic management positively affects the amount of training provided by companies.</head><p>Research studies have demonstrated that training has a positive influence on organizational performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bartel (1994)</ref> for example, has demonstrated that investments in training programs made by low productivity companies resulted in productivity growth large enough to reach the labor productivity levels of comparable businesses. Russell, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Terborg and Powers (1985)</ref> have shown a strong positive relation between percentage of trained employees and performance. In their study of retail stores, the percentage of trained employees had a significant positive relation with two measures of store performance: volume per employee and store image. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Pfeffer (1998a)</ref> also considers training to be one of the characteristic dimensions of organizations that produce profits through people, not only because it is a way of developing skills but also because of the positive attitude it elicits in individual employees, of being part of the company, "playing in the game" <ref type="bibr">(Pfeffer, 1998b, p.116)</ref>. We should therefore expect that financial investment in training activities as well as amount of training received is positively associated with organizational performance. Hence:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2: Training positively affects organizational performance.</head><p>Strategic planning should also be related to motivation and performance management programs, the second factor to which <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Delaney and Huselid (1996)</ref> attribute an impact on organizational performance. Performance management, which is composed of two closely related components (appraisal and pay) is intended to improve organizational performance by motivating employees to achieve objectives that are critical to the organization's strategic direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Marshall, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Several motivation theories stress the contribution of performance pay for work motivation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Porter &amp; Lawler, 1968)</ref>. Additionally, research has shown that compensation strategies include at least two options: fixed pay and variable pay, and that the relative weights of these two components are aligned with corporate strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gomez-Mejia &amp; Balkin, 1992)</ref>. For example, organizations facing high degrees of turbulence need to be more financially flexible <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Stroh et al, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Thompson, 1967)</ref> shifting the risk to the workforce in the form of variable pay.</p><p>However, for performance pay schemes to operate effectively, there should be a link between employee performance and subsequent reward, as well as a perception of equity in reward distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Lawler, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Milkovich &amp; Wigdor, 1991)</ref>. Appraisal provides the means by which organizations can assess the contribution of employees, provide feedback on current performance and motivate staff to reach higher standards of performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Marshall, 1998)</ref>. Performance appraisal systems, on the other hand, define what is meant by implementation and adherence to the strategic plan at the level of an individual employee <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Becker, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Latham, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Murphy &amp; Cleveland, 1991)</ref>. They then become organizational mechanisms for strategy communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Beck, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Reed &amp; Buckley, 1988)</ref>. Hence: H3: Strategic management positively affects performance management practices, through use of performance pay systems and of performance appraisal systems.</p><p>Empirical research has demonstrated positive links between incentive compensation and organizational performance, through productivity increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gerhart &amp; Milkovich, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gupta &amp; Shaw, 1998)</ref>, lower employment variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gerhart &amp; Trevor, 1996)</ref> and the reinforcement of corporate strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gomez-Mejia, 1992)</ref>. It is this kind of research that suggests that there seems to be an "increasing link being forged between pay and performance" among both American and European organizations <ref type="bibr">(Sparrow &amp; Hiltrop, 1994, p.46)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, the use of more valid and accurate performance appraisal systems can also contribute to employee motivation, through feedback, the identification of training and development needs, and goal setting practices. Multi-source feedback, or 360º feedback, has gained increased popularity in the literature, precisely because of the value of the feedback employees may receive from sources not covered in more traditional performance appraisal systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(London &amp; Smither, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Considering that accurate feedback and contingent rewards are the essence of performance management <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Marshall, 1998)</ref>, and that these must be closely aligned with corporate strategy, it has been shown that this combination has a significant impact on the organizational financial and productivity measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(McDonald &amp; Smith, 1995)</ref>. Pay for performance and accurate feedback (particularly of the 360º type) constitute a powerful tool for managing organizational performance.</p><p>From these arguments, we derive our next hypothesis: H4: Performance management systems positively affect organizational performance.</p><p>Due to changing market opportunities and technology, as well as increasing international competition, firms experience greater uncertainty and are, therefore, motivated to cost reduction. Given that labor costs are, for most organizations, the largest single element of operating costs, there is a strong relationship between strategic management and the use of contingent employment. Evidence has been presented that high users of part-time workers are more likely to have written corporate strategies and written HR strategies, their use being the result of strategic decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Mayne, Tregaskis &amp; Brewster, 1996)</ref>. Companies with formal strategic planning processes will most likely, more carefully consider this strategic alternative. The reliance on an increasingly contingent staff, made up of temporary and part-time workers, has also been depicted as a way to reduce benefits costs, to screen potential workers for regular full-time positions or even to adjust staffing levels to cope with fluctuations in companies' workload or fluctuations in demand, while avoiding the morale problems caused by layoffs <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Pfeffer, 1994)</ref>. Contingent employment practices take many forms and are likely to have differential effects <ref type="bibr">(Brewster &amp; Tregaskis, forthcoming)</ref>. In this study we have chosen to focus on the most common form in Europe, part-time employment. In the European Union, the average percentage of the workforce in parttime jobs has increased from 14.3 in 1992 to 16 percent in 1995 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Clifford, Morley &amp; Gunnigle, 1997)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Houseman (2001)</ref> concluded that the main reasons for using part-time workers in the U.S. is that this type of HR flexibility had to do with accommodation of employee's desires for short hours and the need to accommodate workload fluctuations.</p><p>On the other hand, results from her study of 550 American private sector companies from several industries and sizes, led her to suggest that in order to deal with workload fluctuations, "the lower benefits costs made such arrangements more attractive as an option" <ref type="bibr">(Houseman, 2001, p.168)</ref>.</p><p>From this, we derive our hypothesis:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H5: Strategic management positively affects HR flexibility practices.</head><p>Although it has been argued that some contingent working practices may have dysfunctional effects, such as temporary and fixed term contracts <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kelley, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Medcoff &amp; Needham, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Pfeffer, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Turnley &amp; Feldman, 1999)</ref> this may not apply to practices such as part-time contracts, which may benefit both employers and employees, by making it more likely that employees are only paid for actual hours worked and adjusting to particular needs of the workforce (namely women) who want less working hours and more flexible work schedules <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Nayar &amp; Willinger, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Papalexandris &amp; Kramar, 1997)</ref>. Increasing female participation in the labor force and the need to balance work and family life has been used as explanation to the higher proportion of part-time employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Brewster, Hegewisch &amp; Mayne, 1994)</ref>. On the other hand, part-time contracts increase working time flexibility, to cover for longer opening hours or weekend working <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Sparrow &amp; Hiltrop, 1994)</ref>, contribute to cost reduction for employers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anon, 1994)</ref> and may result in productivity increases <ref type="bibr">(Anonymous, International Labour Review, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Considering the positive effects for employers and employees, our next hypothesis will then be: H6: HR flexibility practices will positively impact organizational performance.</p><p>Finally, we consider two constructs associated with organizational environment: competitive intensity and industry attractiveness.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> These two constructs are qualitatively different and correspond to what <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Milliken (1987)</ref>, for example, has referred to as state of the environment and effects of the environment, respectively.</p><p>State of the environment comprises key organizational constituencies, such as suppliers, competitors, consumers, government, shareholders, etc., which may affect organizational strategic planning and are associated to a certain type of uncertainty.</p><p>Effects of the environment concern the impact of a given set of conditions of the environment on the organizational ability to function in that future state. Competitive intensity is characteristic of the state of the environment, while product/service demand and market growth are effects of the environment. These two types of external factors are expected to indirectly influence organizational performance, through the process of strategic management and HRM practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Schuler &amp; Grover, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Competitive intensity, or the degree of competition that a firm faces, affects organizational focus and attention on competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Grewal &amp; Tansuhaj, 2001)</ref> and leads top management into spending a greater amount of time and resources on environmental scanning and forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Milliken, 1987)</ref>. Enlargement or even introduction of product market competition has been one of the purposes of major privatization programs around the world because it will force organizations to develop better competitive strategies and pay closer attention to costs <ref type="bibr">(Ramaswany, 2001)</ref>. Evidence has also been presented that increased competition enhances productivity, by making better use of available resources and selecting out less fitted competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hannan &amp; Freeman, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pavcnik, 2002)</ref> and by increasing innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Blundell, Griffith &amp; Van Reenen, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, our next hypothesis: H7: Competitive intensity will positively affect strategic management.</p><p>Although several factors have been associated with industry attractiveness, by different authors, we use two indicators, product/service demand and market growth, which are consistently included in this construct.</p><p>Industry attractiveness is supposed to affect organizational performance by forcing companies to perform more effective environmental scanning <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Grewal &amp; Tansuhaj, 2001)</ref>, to define appropriate corporate strategies, with a better internal fit among functional policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Porter, 1996)</ref> and to spend more managerial time "in the environmental threat and opportunity analysis phase of strategic planning" <ref type="bibr">(Milliken, 1987, p.140)</ref>. Industry attractiveness is also likely to affect organizational performance, namely due to higher environmental munificence <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978)</ref>.</p><p>Environmental munificence is positively associated with strategic options available to firms, but in the same industry, an environmental condition can present an opportunity for some organizations and a threat to others, depending on their strategic goals, strengths and weaknesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Castrogiovanni, 1991)</ref>, which means that attractiveness has a differential impact, depending on the firm's relative advantages. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Wernerfelt and Montgomery (1986)</ref> the amount by which efficient firms outperform inefficient ones is smaller when there are more inefficient firms and if industry prices are less volume sensitive, two conditions that are associated with high industry growth.</p><p>These authors have shown that efficient diversifiers do better in more profitable industries while inefficient diversifiers benefit from high market growth. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Luo (1998)</ref> found out that both firm competence and industry attractiveness attributes contribute and are critical to high organizational performance, although industry structural attributes have a somewhat stronger influence. It may be expected, therefore, that a decrease in demand for a product or service or a decline in market growth will have a direct negative impact on organizational performance, although strategic competencies will play a major role in the way firms react and cope with these attributes.</p><p>From these arguments, we may consider that industry attractiveness may have an indirect impact on organizational performance, through the strategic management process, but also a direct effect, due to environmental threat reduction. Hence, our last hypotheses:</p><p>H8: Industry attractiveness will positively affect strategic management. H9: Industry attractiveness will positively affect organizational performance.</p><p>The model presented in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> was built considering the hypotheses derived from the literature review presented above.</p><p>- <ref type="figure">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref>INSERT FIGURE <ref type="figure">1 HERE   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref>According to this model, two exogenous variables -competitive intensity and industry attractiveness -are expected to have an indirect positive impact on organizational performance, through the development of a strategic management emphasis. Industry attractiveness is also expected to have a direct positive impact on organizational performance. Strategic management, in turn, is expected to influence performance through its impact on the development of matching HR practices, in such areas as training, performance management and HR flexibility. These HRM practices are hypothesized to have a direct positive impact on organizational performance. In the following section, we discuss how we have tested the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>For this study, we used the 1995/96 survey on strategic HRM, developed by the CRANET-E Network. This survey provides comprehensive organizational information on the strategic human resource management of companies in a number of European countries. The same data collection instrument has been used in all countries, after translation and back translation in the participating countries by a local team. In each organization, the instrument was completed by the senior HR manager. The survey is organized around six sections covering the personnel/human resource function, staffing, employee development, compensation and benefits, employee relations and communications, and organizational details (for further information see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Brewster et al, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>A total of 6,289 questionnaires were returned from 29,540 distributed in the countries involved. This makes it perhaps the largest survey of HRM policies and practices ever conducted in Europe. The response rate was 21%: high for a full-population, postal survey. There was, as in past years, some variation in response rates across countries, ranging from over 50% in Sweden to just over 10% in some of the Southern European countries. This may in part be due to differences in attitudes towards surveys and the willingness for the disclosure of organizational details across countries. Academic partners in each country were responsible for checking the data against other information, but reliable comprehensive databases of organization are not available.</p><p>Using employment numbers as a proxy it would seem that, across Europe, the responses over-represented manufacturing and larger firms. It was not possible to check respondents/non-respondents, although first-ten-percent/last-ten-percent comparisons showed no significant differences. Europe has substantial proportions of public sector and small and medium sized enterprises, which were not relevant to our hypotheses.</p><p>Restricting the sample to private sector companies with more than 200 employees, reduced the total numbers to 1,806 firms. Since this is a large sample, we deleted all cases with missing data on any of the measures, as well as the cases pertaining to countries with a sample size up to 15. The final sample has 1,301 organizations. The average size, by number of employees, is 1,690, ranging from 200 to 174,400, with a median of 440.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>The overall measurement model employs 18 measures for the 7 constructs. Two of the constructs are exogenous factors that represent market characteristics -competitive intensity (ξ 1 ) and industry attractiveness (ξ 2 ). The other five are endogenous factorsstrategic management (η 1 ), training (η 2 ), performance management (η 3 ), HR flexibility (η 4 ) and organizational performance (η 5 ).</p><p>Competitive intensity was measured by one question, concerning change in the level of competition over the last 3 years, on a 3-point scale (1-decreased; 2-same; 3-increased).</p><p>Industry attractiveness was measured by two questions, on a 3-point scale, concerning change in demand for product/service over the last 3 years (1-decreased; 2-same; 3increased) and change in market growth (1-declining; 2-same; 3-growing).</p><p>Strategic management was measured by three questions regarding the existence of a mission statement, a corporate strategy and a personnel/HRM strategy, on a 1 to 3 scale (1-no; 2-yes, unwritten and 3-yes, written). Each of these three variables was transformed into two dummy variables: existence (0-No; 1-Yes) and formalization (0unwritten; 1-written). In order to estimate the model, we had to add the three dummy variables pertaining to existence, to produce one indicator of the existence of strategy, ranging from 0 (no mission, no corporate strategy, no HR strategy) to 3 (existence of mission, corporate strategy and HR strategy). We also added the three dummy variables pertaining to formalization, to produce one indicator of strategy formalization, ranging from 0 (unwritten mission, corporate strategy and HRM strategy) to 3 (written mission, corporate strategy and HRM strategy).</p><p>To estimate the model, the latent variable strategic management is therefore measured by two indicators: strategy existence and strategy formalization.</p><p>Training was measured by five indicators: a continuous variable representing the proportion of annual salaries and wage bills spent on training, and four continuous variables representing the average number of days of training for managers, for technical/professional staff, for clerical employees and for manual employees. All these five measures report to the year before the survey, and were standardized for the estimation of the model.</p><p>Performance management was assessed by five indicators: the use of multi-source feedback, by counting the number of participants in the performance appraisal procedure (immediate superior, next level superior, the employee, subordinates, peers, customers and others), ranging from 0 to 7. From the whole sample, 234 companies did not have a performance appraisal system for any of the work categories (managers, technical/professional, clerical and manual).</p><p>The other four manifest variables indicate how many types of different incentives the company gave to managers, technical/professional employees, clerical employees and manual employees. Five types of incentives were mentioned in the questionnaire, for respondents to check all applicable: employee share options, profit sharing, group bonus, individual commission and merit pay. We therefore have four variables, ranging from 0 to 5. In the whole sample, only 149 companies did not have any kind of incentives for any of the four work categories. The five indicators for the latent variable performance management were also standardized, for the estimation of the model.</p><p>HR flexibility was measured by two questions: change in the use of part-time contracts, on a 3 point scale (1-decreased; 2-same and 3-increased) and approximate proportion of the workforce on part-time contracts, on a 5 point scale (1-&lt;1%; 2-1-5%; 3-6-10%; 4-11-20% and 5-&gt;20%). These two indicators were standardized for the estimation of the model.</p><p>Organizational performance was measured by one question asking the respondent to report the company's perceived gross revenue over the past three years, on a 5-point scale (1-so low as to produce large losses; 2-insufficient to cover costs; 3-enough to break even; 4-sufficent to make a small profit and 5-well in excess of costs).</p><p>The choice of a subjective measure of organizational performance is based on the fact that in international surveys, objective performance measures are dangerous, because of cultural differences between national long-term and short-term orientations, and differing tax and fiscal regimes, which may bias the financial statements and make them non-comparable <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lahteenmaki &amp; Vanhala, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Martell &amp; Carroll, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Verhage &amp; Waarts, 1988)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>We tested the measurement and structural models using AMOS 4.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arbuckle &amp; Wothke, 1999)</ref> to generate maximum likelihood parameter estimates through the analysis of the matrix of covariance among variable scores. We assessed model fit using the Goodness of Fit (GFI) and Adjusted Goodness of Fit (AGFI) Indices, the Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). These last two indices include parsimony as a criterion in the estimation of fit (i.e., impose a penalty for inclusion of additional paths). GFI, AGFI and TLI values greater than 0.90 are generally considered to indicate a good fit. Values of RMSEA below 0.08 indicate a reasonable fit, and those below 0.05 indicate good fit to the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1993)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper reports on our attempt to draw a model of how environmental factors, strategic management and HRM practices combine to influence organizational performance, using a European sample. The model illustrates the role played by market characteristics, namely competitive intensity and industry attractiveness. The characteristics of the market do in fact show a direct influence over several of the endogenous variables in our model. For example, the level of competition experienced by a firm is related to the degree to which organizations attempt to define and formalize mission statements, corporate strategies and HRM policies. This is consistent with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Blundell, Griffith &amp; Van Reenen, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Grewal &amp; Tansuhaj, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pavcnik, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Stimpert &amp; Duhaime, 1997)</ref> arguing that firms have to focus on what competitors are doing and on the ways to improve organizational effectiveness and efficiency, by cutting costs, innovating, creating market share and improving customer satisfaction. In the same vein, industry attractiveness affects strategic management, which is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Luo (1998)</ref>, who stressed that the match between firm competence and industrial conditions is essential to achieve benefits from international investment. Our results also support a direct positive effect of industry attractiveness on organizational performance, a similar result to that obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Luo (1998)</ref>, suggesting that industry structural attributes have a stronger effect on performance than firm competence variables. Thus, and not surprisingly, market dynamism can be thought of as a powerful influence on the functioning of organizations, with more attractive and competitive markets leading to attempts to introduce higher levels of systematization (e.g. strategic clarity) and to enhanced effectiveness (i.e. performance) in management practices. The importance of environmental scanning for the characteristics of competitors and for environmental threats and opportunities is one of the implications of this study.</p><p>Managers must consider and respond to these challenges by defining unique corporate strategies. Future research should focus on how strategic planning is affected by different environmental characteristics, including factors not included in this study, such as the institutional context. European surveys may prove to be useful for that purpose, since even within the European Union, different institutional backgrounds are present, regarding labor markets, fiscal policies, educational and legal systems, for example.</p><p>Secondly, our results also illustrate the important role of strategic management as a determinant of HRM practices. The existence of strategic thinking and strategic formalization impacts the adoption of part-time work contracts and performance management, as well as the amount of training provided. This can be interpreted as meaning that companies that invest more in defining precisely what goals to pursue may be more willing and able to rigorously define what performance they want to obtain and how it should be measured, as well as how performance-enhancing behaviors should be identified and rewarded. These companies will also be more willing to invest in the development of required employee skills and knowledge, through the provision of training programs that are aligned with strategic objectives and to consider contractual options that are advantageous for both firm and workers. The strategic role of HRM is emphasized by these results. The involvement of the HR function at the strategic/board level may guarantee the needed unique configuration of corporate strategy and matching HRM, which will contribute to sustained competitive advantage. On the other hand, there is room for future research on how strategic is HRM in different competitive situations and how valuable is the internal fit between corporate strategy and HRM for organizational performance, namely taking organizational culture in consideration.</p><p>A third set of results pertains to the direct impact of HRM practices on organizational performance. Performance management showed a positive and significant impact on organizational performance, as expected and consistent with previous literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gomez-Mejia, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gupta &amp; Shaw, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">McDonald &amp; Smith, 1995)</ref>. Part-time working also has a significant positive impact on organizational performance, as hypothesized. Organizations, which can make more cost-effective use of their labor, whilst meeting employee needs, are more likely to be successful. Much to our surprise, training did not have a significant impact on organizational performance, which deserves a special analysis and discussion. Several explanations may contribute to this result. Firstly, training results are usually visible in the long-run, and at the same time, organizational knowledge can be considered as a "stock", while we were measuring "flows" (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Narasimha, 2000)</ref>. Another possible explanation concerns training design. Effective training should be based on analyzing people's needs, turning explicit "what people must start doing, stop doing and continue to do to execute strategy" <ref type="bibr">(Latham, 2001, p.4)</ref>. Training must not only be evaluated, but also aligned with corporate strategy and the other HR practices, such as performance appraisal and compensation. Our data did not capture this internal fit. Thirdly, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bartel (1994)</ref> found significant increases in productivity due to implementation of training programs, over a period of 3 years, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Koch and McGrath (1996)</ref>  This third set of results suggests that competitive advantage may be strengthened through performance management practices that enhance worker motivation as well as through flexible contracts that are valued by both workers and organizations, within a long-term perspective. In this sense, investments in the development of core competencies still hold a promise for organizational performance, that the data in this study did not reveal.</p><p>Taken together, these results stress the fact that companies are exposed to the effects of market characteristics and the ones that face more competition and have more attractive industry conditions, are more motivated to conduct better environmental scanning and strategic planning, becoming better equipped to adopt performance-oriented management systems through strategic HRM practices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of the study</head><p>Our model, while focusing the impact of the external market, does not take into account the firm's strategic type (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Porter, 1985)</ref>, or the life-cycle stage of the organization (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hendry and Pettigrew, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>There are other methodological limitations on this research imposed by the process of using survey data with single respondents <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gerhart et al, 2000)</ref>. Additionally, two of the latent variables suffered from low reliability, HR flexibility (α=0,68) and especially industry attractiveness (α=0,64), which must be presented as a limitation, considering the large sample size in the study.</p><p>Another limitation probably comes in the conflation and restriction of the data to Europe. The European countries are by no means alike in their management of human resources and the techniques used here risk "averaging out" important differences. On the other hand, there are clear differences between Europe as a whole and other continents <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brewster, 2001)</ref>. There have been attempts to describe a European model of HRM, which emphasizes the cultural differences, the extensive role of Government and legislation, the influence of the unions and the extent of consultation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brewster, 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brewster, , 1995;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Sparrow &amp; Hiltrop, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Thirley &amp; Wirdenius, 1989)</ref>, but a comparative analysis was not the goal of this study. These differences in HRM between Europe and the rest of the world may mean that replications of this research elsewhere will not find exactly the same results.</p><p>It would have been interesting to compare the finding on part-time working with other, perhaps more contentious and employee-unfriendly forms of contingent working, such as short-term employment. There should also have been a variable dealing with staffing practices, which we were not able to include, due to lack of reliability of the measures in the survey. We nevertheless acknowledge the importance of recruitment and selection practices for organizational performance and will attempt to address it in future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In general, this research confirms the need to study HRM not as an internal organizational function but as an instrument of organizational adaptation. This is in line with the literature that suggests the need to understand HRM in the context of the relationship between organizations and their environments (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Jackson &amp; Schuler, 1995)</ref>. HRM practices seem to be influenced, in fact, by the way organizations perceive their environment and how they respond to environmental challenges. This relationship between environmental textures and organizational structures and processes is far from new in the organizational debate (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lawrence &amp; Lorsch, 1967)</ref> and even in the HRM literature (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Sisson &amp; Timperley, 1994)</ref>. Nevertheless, the way the environment influences the practice of human resource management is far from uncovered. We dare to say that the black box is still closed and in most cases it is only studied at the theoretical or anecdotal levels. Our contribution with this paper is to explore, at a macro level, the way HRM practices and market factors interact. Based on a large sample of European firms, we highlighted how market characteristics and strategic factors combine to generate a stream of HRM decisions that influence organizational performance.</p><p>Our conclusions may also have relevant consequences for HRM practitioners. Apart from the aspects derived from each individual hypothesis, the study clearly suggests the need to match HRM and organizational strategies. This, again, is not new in the literature (e.g. Gomez-Mejia &amp; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Balkin, 1990)</ref> but has been demonstrated here with a large scale, international, non-American sample. Therefore, the need to understand HRM in a strategic perspective is emphasized. Our results reinforce the advice offered by <ref type="bibr">Tichy, Fombrum and Devanna (1982)</ref> twenty years ago: "effective strategic management requires effective human resource management" (p.60). Our evidence, in fact, indicates the strength of the links between the environment, organizational strategy and HRM practices, as well as the connection between strategy and HRM factors. The strategic view of HRM, therefore, seems to be here to stay.  </p></div>

In this study, training was measured by financial investment in training activities and also by average number of training days in one year, which is common in this kind of research. So, the lack of impact of training may also derive from our measurement of the construct. Maybe a more appropriate way would be to measure training through multiannual investments, as well as types of training programs implemented and their impacts. The theoretical arguments behind the impact of training are sufficiently strong to deserve a more detailed analysis of the issue.</figDesc></figure>
