<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Here we present an update to the FaIR model for use in probabilistic future climate and scenario exploration, integrated assessment, policy analysis, and education. In this update we have focussed on identifying a minimum level of structural complexity in the model. The result is a set of six equations, five of which correspond to the standard impulse response model used for greenhouse gas (GHG) metric calculations in the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, plus one additional physically motivated equation to represent state-dependent feedbacks on the response timescales of each greenhouse gas cycle. This additional equation is necessary to reproduce non-linearities in the carbon cycle apparent in both Earth system models and observations. These six equations are transparent and sufficiently simple that the model is able to be ported into standard tabular data analysis packages, such as Excel, increasing the potential user base considerably. However, we demonstrate that the equations are flexible enough to be tuned to emulate the behaviour of several key processes within more complex models from CMIP6. The model is exceptionally quick to run, making it ideal for integrating large probabilistic ensembles. We apply a constraint based on the current estimates of the global warming trend to a million-member ensemble, using the constrained ensemble to make scenario-dependent projections and infer ranges for properties of the climate system. Through these analyses, we reaffirm that simple climate models (unlike more com-plex models) are not themselves intrinsically biased "hot" or "cold": it is the choice of parameters and how those are selected that determines the model response, something that appears to have been misunderstood in the past. This updated FaIR model is able to reproduce the global climate system response to GHG and aerosol emissions with sufficient accuracy to be useful in a wide range of applications and therefore could be used as a lowest-common-denominator model to provide consistency in different contexts. The fact that FaIR can be written down in just six equations greatly aids transparency in such contexts.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Earth system models (ESMs) are vital tools for providing insight into the drivers behind Earth's climate system, as well as projecting impacts of future emissions. Large scale multimodel studies, such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Eyring et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2012, CMIPs)</ref>, have been used in many reports to produce projections of what the future climate may look like based on a range of different concentration scenarios, with associated emission scenarios and socio-economic narratives quantified by integrated assessment models (IAMs). In addition to simulating both the past and possible future climates, these CMIPs ex-Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.</p><p>tensively use idealized experiments to try to determine some of the key properties of the climate system, such as the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Collins et al., 2013)</ref> or the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions <ref type="bibr">(Allen et al., 2009, TCRE)</ref>.</p><p>While ESMs are integral to our current understanding of how the climate system responds to greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol emissions and provide the most comprehensive projections of what a future world might look like, they are so computationally expensive that only a limited set of experiments are able to be run during a CMIP. This constraint on the quantity of experiments necessitates the use of simpler models to provide probabilistic assessments and explore additional experiments and scenarios. These models, often referred to as simple climate models (SCMs), are typically designed to emulate the response of more complex models. In general, they are able to simulate the globally averaged emission → concentration → radiative forcing → temperature response pathway and can be tuned to emulate an individual ESM (or multi-model mean). In general, SCMs are considerably less complex than ESMs: while ESMs are three dimensional, gridded, and explicitly represent dynamical and physical processes, therefore outputting many hundreds of variables, SCMs tend to be globally averaged (or cover large regions) and parameterize many processes, resulting in many fewer output variables. This reduction in complexity means that SCMs are much quicker than ESMs in terms of runtime: most SCMs can run tens of thousands of years of simulation per minute on an "average" personal computer, whereas ESMs may take several hours to run a single year on hundreds of supercomputer processors. Most SCMs are also much smaller in terms of the number of lines of code: SCMs tend to be on the order of thousands of lines, while ESMs can be up to a million lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alexander and Easterbrook, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>There are many simple climate models <ref type="bibr">(Nicholls et al., 2020a)</ref> that have been in use by the climate science and integrated assessment modelling communities for decades. Of particular note are MAGICC <ref type="bibr">(Meinshausen et al., 2011a)</ref>, which has dominated SCM usage within integrated assessment models, and FaIR<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Smith et al., 2018)</ref>, both of which were used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on 1.5 • C warming <ref type="bibr">(IPCC, 2018, SR15)</ref>. However, while these models are "simple" in comparison to the ESMs they emulate, they are often not simple enough to allow new users to gain enough familiarity with the underlying equations to understand their behaviour without significant effort. This learning curve reduces their uptake by the wider community, and has resulted in different research groups generally using the single model that they are most familiar with <ref type="bibr">(Nicholls et al., 2020a)</ref> from the wide range of SCMs. In the past, this has led to different simple models being used by different working groups in major reports, reducing the consistency of the overall work. We believe one key step towards a transparent and coherent process in IPCC assessments would be to use at least one common SCM as widely as possible throughout all working groups, allowing results to be directly comparable. Such use would provide additional context alongside domain-specific models. For this to be realized, an SCM that is both easy to understand and adapt is required.</p><p>An important innovation of the IPCC 5th Assessment Report <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Myhre et al., 2013)</ref> was the introduction of a transparent set of equations (the AR5-IR model) for use in the calculation of GHG metrics. However, that model was not quite adequate to reproduce the evolution of the integrated impulse response to emissions over time, due to the lack of non-linearity in the carbon cycle. The Finite amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model v1.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Millar et al., 2017)</ref> introduced a state dependence to the AR5-IR carbon cycle. This state-dependent carbon cycle was better able to capture both the observed relationship between historical emission trajectories and atmospheric CO 2 burden and the behaviour of ESMs in idealized concentration increase and pulse emission experiments. FaIR v1.0 used four equations to model the atmospheric gas cycle and corresponding effective radiative forcing (ERF) impact of CO 2 and a further two (unchanged from the AR5-IR) to emulate the climate system's thermal response to changes in ERF. Subsequently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Smith et al. (2018)</ref> added a representation of other GHGs and aerosols, which necessarily increased the structural complexity of the model in FaIRv1.3. In this update, we maintain the ability to simulate the atmospheric response to a wide range of GHGs and aerosol emissions, while attempting to significantly reduce the complexity of the model structure.</p><p>In FaIRv2.0.0 we propose a set of six equations that we demonstrate are sufficient to capture the global mean climate system response to GHG and aerosol emissions. These six equations are outlined in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In this text we explain the physical reasoning behind each equation and select a default parameter set based on simple tunings to historical observations and recent literature. We compare the default response of FaIRv2.0.0 to a publicly available version of the widely used SCM, MAGICC6 <ref type="bibr">(Meinshausen et al., 2011a, b)</ref>, for a range of socioeconomic pathways <ref type="bibr">(Riahi et al., 2017, SSPs)</ref>. Further, we show that these equations can be tuned to emulate key properties of a range of CMIP6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Eyring et al., 2016)</ref> models. Finally, we constrain a large parameter ensemble inferred from more complex models and contemporary assessments with observations of the present-day warming level and rate to provide a set of observationally constrained probabilistic projections for the future climate following <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Smith et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>FaIRv2.0.0 is sufficiently simple as to be able to be used in undergraduate and high-school teaching of climate change and can illustrate some key properties of the climate system  <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Myhre et al., 2013)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides brief descriptions of each named parameter in the figure. We note that under the default parameterization, for all gases except carbon dioxide, the index i and associated sums can be removed as these gases are modelled as having a single atmospheric decay timescale only. Equations are described in full in Sect. 2.1. such as the warming impacts of different GHGs, the implications of uncertainty in ECS and transient climate response (TCR), or the importance of carbon cycle feedbacks. To allow students and other users unfamiliar with scientific programming languages (such as FaIRv2.0's native language, Python) access to the model, we also provide a version of FaIRv2.0.0 written in Excel. We hope that this may open exploration of the climate system to a large group of potential users who do not have the expertise to run presently available SCMs. The simplicity of FaIRv2.0.0 additionally means that although we provide code in a central, open-source repository, which we strongly recommend to be used for most cases, users are not forced to rely on this. In fact we expect it would be relatively quick to re-create in whatever language users are familiar with and in whatever format fits their intended usage.</p><p>Here we suggest that the major value of SCMs is in their ability to emulate more complex models, such as has been done in <ref type="bibr">Meinshausen et al. (2011b)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Tsutsui (2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Tsutsui ( , 2020))</ref>, and their ability to efficiently integrate massive parameter ensembles for probabilistic climate projection as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Smith et al. (2018)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Goodwin et al. (2019)</ref>. While default parameters must be provided to enable unfamiliar users access to the model, the response arising from these parameters is a function of how they themselves have been selected, rather than one of the model equations themselves. So long as the underlying model equations are sufficiently flexible to emulate a wide range of climate system responses to the variables of interest (for instance the inferred range of responses within the CMIP ensemble) and have a basis in known physical processes, the SCM should be considered to be valid. Although understanding why the default response of SCMs differ is important, comparisons of solely the default response as a test of how "good" a model is are unhelpful; it is likely that any SCM could be re-tuned to better perform against whatever (single) metric is being used for evaluation, whether it is another SCM, a more complex model, or something else.</p><p>In this study we first outline the history and reasoning behind the model equations used in Sect. 2, including how we selected default parameters, stepping through the concentration response to emissions, the concentration-forcing relationships, and the thermal response to forcing. We then demonstrate how several key components of FaIRv2.0.0the carbon cycle, aerosol response, and thermal response to forcing -can be tuned to emulate a set of CMIP6 models in Sect. 3. Section 4 describes the use of FaIRv2.0.0 to constrain climate sensitivities and future surface temperature projections using a large ensemble following <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Smith et al. (2018)</ref>. We then provide a discussion of previous comparisons of SCMs in Sect. 5 and suggest some ways in which FaIRv2.0.0 could be used in Sect. 6 before concluding.</p><p>As with the previous iteration, FaIRv2.0.0 is a 0D model of globally averaged variables. It models the GHG emission → concentration → effective radiative forcing (ERF), aerosol emission → ERF, and ERF → temperature responses of the climate system. Here we present the equations behind these responses, separating out the model into the key components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The gas cycle</head><p>FaIRv2.0.0 inherits the GHG gas cycle equations directly from the carbon cycle equations within FaIRv1.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Smith et al., 2018)</ref> and v1.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Millar et al., 2017)</ref>. This carbon cycle adapts the four-timescale impulse response function for carbon dioxide in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Joos et al. (2013)</ref> by introducing a statedependent timescale adjustment factor, α. This factor scales the decay timescales of atmospheric carbon, allowing for the effective carbon sink from the atmosphere to change in strength. This allows FaIRv2.0.0 to represent non-linearities in the carbon cycle in a manner similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Joos et al. (1996)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hooss et al. (2001)</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Millar et al. (2017)</ref>, α was calculated through a parameterization of the 100-year integrated impulse response function (iIRF 100 , the average airborne fraction over a period of 100 years). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Millar et al. (2017)</ref>, the iIRF 100 was parameterized by a simple linear relationship with the quantity of carbon removed since initialization G u , and the current temperature T :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">iIRF 100 = r 0 + r u G u + r T T ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where r 0 is the initial (pre-industrial) iIRF 100 and r u and r T control how the iIRF 100 changes as the cumulative carbon uptake from the atmosphere and temperature change. This parameterization was informed by the behaviour of ESMs and remains consistent with the key feedbacks involved in the carbon cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arora et al., 2020)</ref>. However, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Millar et al. (2017)</ref>, the root of an implicit non-linear equation had to be found to update α at each model time step. The solution of this equation is approximately exponential in iIRF 100 to a high degree of accuracy for a wide range of values, and thus in FaIRv2.0.0 α is calculated using the exponential form in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>). We parameterize this carbon cycle to enable it to simulate a wide range of GHGs, as discussed in Sect. 2.1.1. The equations for the carbon cycle and all other gas cycles are, in their most general form, as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">dR i (t) dt = a i E(t) - R i (t) α(t)τ i ,<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">C(t) = C 0 + n i=1 R i (t), and<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">α(t) = g 0 • exp r 0 + r u G u (t) + r T T (t) + r a G a (t) g 1 ;<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">G a (t) = n i=1 R i (t), G u (t) = t s=t 0 E(s) -G a (t);<label>(5)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">g 1 = n i=1 a i τ i 1 -(1 + 100/τ i ) e -100/τ i , g 0 = exp - n i=1 a i τ i [1 -e -100/τ i ] g 1 .</formula><p>Equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) and (3) describe a gas cycle with an atmospheric burden above the pre-industrial concentration, C 0 , formed of n reservoirs: each reservoir corresponds to a different decay timescale from the atmosphere. These reservoirs do not correspond to any physical carbon stores, but qualitative analogies for them can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Millar et al. (2017)</ref>. Each reservoir, R i , has an uptake fraction a i and decay timescale ατ i . At each time step, the state-dependent adjustment, α, is computed and the reservoir concentrations are updated and aggregated to determine the new atmospheric burden. The new atmospheric concentration is then simply the sum of the burden and the pre-industrial concentration.</p><p>Here we emphasize that although we have presented this equation set in its general form, with n reservoirs, in practice we set n = 4 for the carbon cycle following <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Joos et al. (2013)</ref> and n = 1 emissions for all other gases within FaIRv2.0.0. For the cases where n = 1, Eqs. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) and (3) can be simplified by dropping the index i entirely. α provides feedbacks to the gas lifetime(s) based on the current time step's levels of accumulated emissions (G u ), global temperature (T ), and atmospheric burden (G a ). G a is included to enable FaIRv2.0.0 to emulate the sensitivity of the CH 4 lifetime to its own atmospheric burden, as predicted by atmospheric chemistry and simulated in chemical transport models (CTMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Holmes et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Prather et al., 2015)</ref>. We also find that the emulation of the carbon cycle of a number of CMIP6 models over the 1 % CO 2 experiment is significantly improved if G a is included in the iIRF 100 parameterization; see Sect. 3.2. In the default parameterization of FaIRv2.0.0, this state dependence is only active for carbon dioxide and methane; for all other gases, α is constant. g 0 and g 1 are constants that set the value and gradient of our analytic approximation for α equal to the numerical solution of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Millar et al. (2017)</ref> iIRF 100 parameterization at α = 1 for the carbon cycle. An important point is that although we inherit the iIRF timescale of 100 years from <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Millar et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Joos et al. (2013)</ref>, this timescale does not affect the behaviour of the model, only the quantitative values of the parameters. Hence, for a given emulation target (such as the C4MIP models in Sect. 3.2) the optimal model fit is independent of the length of this timescale, but the optimal parameter values are not. Maintaining this timescale at 100 years ensures that the r coefficients found here are comparable to the previous iterations of FaIR <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Smith et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Millar et al., 2017)</ref>. In the following section, we discuss how we parameterize the gas cycle to enable FaIRv2.0.0 to simulate a wide range of GHGs using these same three equations. Qualitative analogies for each parameter are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> to aid understanding.</p><p>Here we emphasize the advantage of using this common framework to simulate the response to all the different GHG and aerosol emissions: if a user is able to understand the FaIRv2.0.0 carbon cycle, then they understand how the model will respond to emissions of any other GHG or aerosol. This is because carbon dioxide is the most complex parameterization of the above equations: being the only species with more than one atmospheric decay timescale, and alongside methane it is one of only two species to make use of the state dependence through α within the default parameterization. This structural simplicity makes gaining familiarity with the model far easier than if several different gas cycle formulations were used for different GHGs.</p></div>

Since both tropospheric air temperature and water vapour are closely related to surface air temperatures (they are often approximated by simple parameterizations of the surface air temperature, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Holmes et al., 2013)</ref>, including these two sensitivities through a single surface temperature feedback closely replicates lifetime behaviour if both are included separately.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Historical and SSP concentration trajectories</head><p>Here we compare the default parameterization gas cycle model in FaIRv2.0.0-alpha to a previous version, FaIRv1.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Smith et al., 2018)</ref>, and to MAGICC7.1.0-beta <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Meinshausen et al., 2020)</ref>, highlighting any differences. All three models are run under the fully emission-driven "esm-allGHG" RCMIP protocol <ref type="bibr">(Nicholls et al., 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nicholls and Lewis, 2021)</ref>. FaIRv2.0.0 matches trajectories from both its previous iteration and the more comprehensive MAG-ICC closely for all GHGs. We note some discrepancies in the time series for halogenated gases between FaIRv2.0.0 and MAGICC, possibly due to the incorporation of a statedependent OH abundance and representation of changes to the Brewer-Dobson circulation which modulate the lifetimes of these gases <ref type="bibr">(Meinshausen et al., 2011a)</ref>. We note that for these gases we could have matched historical concentrations closer by tuning the lifetimes to the RCMIP protocol data and historical concentration time series <ref type="bibr">(Nicholls et al., 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Meinshausen et al., 2017)</ref> but argue that taking the best-estimate lifetimes from WMO ( <ref type="formula">2018</ref>) is defensible: it is more transparent and avoids source-dependent parameters (if a different emission dataset were used, the resulting tuned lifetimes would be different). The lower CO 2 concentration projections in FaIRv2.0.0 compared to FaIRv1.5 are due to weaker temperature and cumulative carbon uptake feedbacks (lower r u and r T ) as inferred from the CMIP6 carbon cycle tunings performed in Sect. 3.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specification of natural emissions</head><p>In FaIRv2.0.0 we have chosen to formulate the gas cycle equations in terms of a perturbation above the pre-industrial (natural equilibrium) concentration. By definition, this assumes a time-independent quantity of natural emissions for each gas (which can be derived from the pre-industrial concentration and lifetime of the gas). This differs from <ref type="bibr">Meinshausen et al. (2011a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Smith et al. (2018)</ref>, who (when driving the respective models with emissions and with the exception of CO 2 ) require a quantity of natural emissions to be supplied in addition to any anthropogenic emissions by de-fault (though the models can also be run in a fully emissiondriven mode as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Over the historical period, these emissions are chosen such that they "close the budget" between total anthropogenic emissions and observed concentrations <ref type="bibr">(Meinshausen et al., 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Smith et al., 2018)</ref>. This procedure of balancing the budget over history is analogous to driving the model with concentrations up to the present day and then switching to driving the model with emissions afterwards. While this methodology has the advantage of ensuring the model simulates present-day concentrations that match observation exactly, it loses consistency between the way in which the model simulates the past and the future. If care is not taken when running these models, this loss of consistency could lead to discontinuities at the present day (when the model switches from concentration-to emissiondriven). As present-day trends are crucial for the estimation of many policy and scientifically relevant quantities such as TCR, TCRE, and remaining carbon budgets <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Leach et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Tokarska et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Jiménez-de-la Cuesta and Mauritsen, 2019)</ref>, we have chosen to enforce a consistent model (i.e. emission-driven or concentration-driven) over the entire simulation period in FaIRv2.0.0. We note that replicating this budget closing procedure is possible in FaIRv2.0.0 by inverting observed concentrations to emissions and then joining these inverse emission time series to any future scenarios manually. In this study, FaIRv2.0.0 is run in emission-driven mode unless stated otherwise.</p></div>

These overlap terms are most significant for very high concentrations of these gases, and we find that the more simple relationships used here are sufficiently accurate within the context of the uncertainties associated with such high-concentration scenarios.

Due to constraints on data availability, we have focussed on tuning the key components of the model: the carbon cycle, the thermal response, and the aerosol ERF relationships. We use the abrupt-4xCO2 and 1pctCO2 CMIP6 experiments to tune the carbon cycle and thermal response. The highly idealized nature of these experiments means that parameters arising from these tunings will not necessarily be able to emulate complex model response to more realistic scenarios due to processes that FaIRv2.0.0 cannot represent. In the near future we hope to be able to tune to the historical and SSP CMIP6 experiments in order to validate the tunings given here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Tuning the thermal response</head><p>We follow the statistically rigorous methodology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cummins et al.

( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">9</ref>) by recursively computing the likelihood via a Kalman filter; the optimal parameters are those that maximize the computed likelihood. We then transform the optimal energy balance parameters into the impulse response form used in FaIRv2.0.0. We obtain model data from the "abrupt-4xCO2", "1pctCO2" and "pi-Control" experiments for the top-of-energy imbalance and surface temperature response from ESGF <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cinquini et al., 2014)</ref>. These data are normalized as described in <ref type="bibr">Nicholls et al. (2021)</ref>. To reduce internal variability in the input time series used to fit parameters, we average over all available ensemble members for each model. The number of ensemble members per model is stated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S4</ref> in the Supplement. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cummins et al. (2020)</ref> methodology uses surface temperatures and top-of-atmosphere energy imbalances (as related by Eq. 10) from the abrupt-4xCO2 experiment to return all the parameters of the energy balance model, plus the radiative forcing arising from the quadrupling of carbon dioxide concentrations. While this would fully specify both the thermal response and the concentration-forcing relationship if concentration-forcing was a pure logarithmic relationship, several models display significant deviations from a pure logarithmic concentration-forcing relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Tsutsui, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Tsutsui, , 2017))</ref>. We account for this within the FaIRv2.0.0 framework by assuming that the concentration-forcing relationship can be reasonably approximated by the sum of a logarithmic and square-root term. Best-estimate f CO 2 1 and f CO 2 3 parameters are found by first deriving the TCR of each model using the 1pctCO2 experiment. We can use the tuned impulse response parameters and TCR to then calculate the forcing at a doubling of carbon dioxide using the relationship in Eq.

( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) and (3) to diagnose the values of α required to reproduce the C4MIP emissions from the corresponding concentrations within the FaIRv2.0.0 carbon cycle impulse response framework. We then use Eq. (4) to convert α into iIRF 100 time series. Finally, we use an ordinary least-squares estimator to calculate r parameters by regressing the C4MIP cumulative uptake, temperature, and atmospheric burden time series against the diagnosed iIRF 100 time series. r 0 is taken as the intercept of the estimator. We include the atmospheric burden as a predictor (and hence obtain non-  zero r a values) due to a significant reduction in regression residual for several models when included. We find that all the C4MIP models display an exceptionally high, rapidly decreasing initial airborne fraction. In terms of the FaIRv2.0.0 equations, this corresponds to an α value that decreases initially before reaching a minimum, representing a carbon sink that initially increases in strength when concentrations start to rise before decreasing as the concentrations and temperatures rise further. FaIRv2.0.0 is unable to fully capture this initial adjustment, and as such in our tunings we prioritize emulating the long-term behaviour and carry out the regression from year 60 onwards. It would be possible to better capture the initial adjustment by including additional terms in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>), but since it remains to be seen whether this behaviour is apparent in scenarios where concentrations do not rise suddenly and rapidly from a pre-industrial level as is the case in the 1pctCO 2 experiment (such as a historical emission scenario), we do not do so here.

Discrepancies arise since observations blend air temperatures over land and sea ice with water temperature over ocean and do not have full global coverage (they are blendedmasked), while climate model surface temperature output is globally complete and always measured as the air temperature 2 m above the surface of the Earth. It has been shown both historically and over future climate scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Richardson et al., 2018)</ref> that the blended-masked temperature definition (GMST) may be cooler than the globally complete 2 m air temperature definition (GSAT).

This has resulted in a widely held belief that FaIRv1.3 is intrinsically "cooler" than MAGICC6 in general, a belief that some of these authors have unintentionally previously contributed to <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Leach et al., 2018)</ref>. This belief is unfounded: the response of an SCM is a function of the parameters used. Although some parameters may be chosen to be consistent with geophysical observation or theory, in general SCM parameters are tuned such that they emulate or reproduce either the output of more complex models or observations of the Earth. Relating this to the models used in SR15, the FaIRv1.3 ensemble was tuned such that the model response lay within observed changes in global mean surface temperature since the pre-industrial period <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Smith et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cowtan and Way, 2014)</ref>; the MAGICC6 ensemble was constrained to observations up until 2009 <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Meinshausen et al., 2009)</ref>. The two different tuning targets naturally lead to differences in the response of FaIRv1.3 and MAGICC6.</p><p>Here we emphasize that the differences between the models' output is not systematic -it is the parameters used and how these are selected (which is often a subjective decision on the part of the modellers) that determines the model response.</p><p>6 Uses of FaIRv2.0.0</p><p>We envisage that FaIRv2.0.0 will primarily be used for similar assessments to those carried out with current SCMs. One advantage that FaIRv2.0.0 has is that it was built with performance in mind and hence is easily vectorized. It can be vectorized in a programming language designed for array operations (such as Fortran, MATLAB, or the NumPy Python module) and hence FaIRv2.0.0 is extremely quick to run. For example, using the alpha Python implementation, FaIRv2.0.0 can compute the million-member full ensemble (emission driven for 52 gases, 81 forcing components, over the period 1750-2100) in under 40 min<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">foot_4</ref> . This speed provides significant advantages when computing large probabilistic ensembles or when optimizing parameters. An important consideration for users computing probabilistic ensembles will be the memory required by FaIRv2.0.0 output, as this is more likely to be the limiting factor on a modern computer rather than the model runtime. A related point is that the minimal equation set that FaIRv2.0.0 is composed of is easily transcribed into other programming languages. Although we would recommend using the official Python FaIR release (<ref type="url" target="https://github.com/OMS-NetZero/FAIR">https://github.com/OMS-NetZero/FAIR</ref>, last access: 19 May 2021) where possible, there are many cases where it might be required for FaIRv2.0.0 to be converted into another language (such as GAMS) for use in integrated as- sessment models. We believe that the relative simplicity of FaIRv2.0.0 lends itself to this purpose. Of particular note is that FaIRv2.0.0, in its entirety, is able to be run in Excel. This opens up climate system exploration and experimentation to a large group of potential users who are familiar with spreadsheets but not programming languages. The user base of Excel is estimated to be around 100 times larger than that of Python (<ref type="url" target="https://info.cambridgespark.com/latest/">https://info.cambridgespark.com/latest/</ref> python-vs-excel, last access: 19 May 2021). To aid with implementation in alternative languages where required, we have provided a brief set of notes on our own Python implementation of the development version of FaIRv2.0.0 in the Supplement.</p><p>In terms of possible academic uses of FaIRv2.0.0, we have demonstrated two of the main ones: emulation of more complex models and probabilistic scenario projections. FaIRv2.0.0 can be used to rapidly investigate differences between ESMs by tuning FaIRv2.0.0 to emulate these complex models and comparing differences between the tuned parameter sets to identify which aspects of the models differ most, as was done with MAGICC in <ref type="bibr">Meinshausen et al. (2011a, b)</ref>. The ability to tune FaIRv2.0.0 to more complex models, as demonstrated here and in other work <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Tsutsui, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Joos et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Millar et al., 2017)</ref>, also allows for estimation of complex model response to a particular scenario or experiment without having to expend computer power to run the model itself, which could allow climate system uncertainties to be introduced more fully into integrated assessment studies by emulating the full CMIP6 ensemble within IAMs (providing some of the capability demonstrated by <ref type="bibr">Meinshausen et al. (2011a)</ref>, with a simpler model). The probabilistic scenario projection we demonstrated in Sect. 4 is a potentially more policy-relevant academic use of FaIRv2.0.0, since CMIP6 model emulations do not necessarily represent the best estimate of some key properties of the real-life Earth system when historical observations are taken into account <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Tokarska et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gillett et al., 2021)</ref>. The speed of FaIRv2.0.0 allows very large parameter ensembles to be run rapidly, enabling all regions of plausible parameter space to be explored without requiring large quantities of computing resources. Although we have performed one relatively simple methodology for the creation of an observationally constrained large ensemble here, there are many possible ways to do this, for example using the Markov chain-Monte Carlo methods employed in several other SCMs <ref type="bibr">(Nicholls et al., 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Meinshausen et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr">Meinshausen et al., , 2011b))</ref>. A third academic use of FaIRv2.0.0, which we are interested in, is its incorporation into integrated assessment models (IAMs). Its simplicity and computational efficiency may make implementation within existing IAMs relatively more straightforward than for other SCMs, even if the whole model is required to be built up from scratch in whatever format would be required by the particular IAM.</p><p>Outside of academia, we propose that FaIRv2.0.0 could be used for emission climate impact accounting in industry. The UNFCCC standard for the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions is to account for emissions of all gases as a CO 2 equivalent quantity via the 100-year global warming potential (GWP). However, GWPs do not adequately capture the behaviour of short-lived climate pollutants such as methane <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cain et al., 2019)</ref>, leading to the development of alternative metrics such as GWP*. We suggest that such warming impacts could potentially instead be simulated using a simple climate model as an improvement upon the use of any of these metrics. Although this does represent a step-up in complexity, we believe that the relative simplicity of FaIRv2.0.0, when compared to other SCMs, makes it a strong candidate for this usage. In particular, the ability of FaIRv2.0.0 to be run in Excel could encourage this particular use case. We suggest that the speed, simplicity, and transparency of FaIRv2.0.0 also lends it to use in undergraduate and highschool education. It can be used to explain (and demonstrate) important features of both the carbon (or other GHG) cycle and Earth's thermal response to radiative forcing and is simple enough to use that students could themselves carry out experiments (such as a CO 2 doubling) easily with no prior experience and only basic computing skills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper we have presented a significant update to the FaIR SCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Smith et al., 2018)</ref>, focussed on reducing the structural complexity of the model as much as possible. The updated model, FaIRv2.0.0, uses the five equations of the AR5 impulse response model <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Myhre et al., 2013)</ref> plus just one additional equation to allow the model to represent non-linearities in the carbon cycle. We demonstrate that this reduction in complexity does not come at the cost of the model's ability to reproduce globally averaged observations or output of more complex models from CMIP6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Eyring et al., 2016)</ref>. After demonstrating the ability of the model  <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S4</ref>.</p><p>in emulating more complex models, we show how the model can be used for climate projection by constraining a large parameter ensemble.</p><p>There are many potential uses for FaIRv2.0.0 as a result of its simplicity and transparency. In addition to being available for the same probabilistic scenario assessment as is carried out by SCMs in reports such as SR15 (IPCC, 2018), it could be implemented into IAMs and would likely improve computational efficiency due to its vectorization and resulting extremely rapid runtime. We encourage policymakers to use FaIRv2.0.0 in order to directly assess whether warming implications are aligned with the intended outcomes of mitigation policies, since GHG accounting metrics used at present such as GWP do not provide accurate results for targets such as net-zero CO 2 due to the short life of some GHGs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allen et al., 2018)</ref>. To aid this use of FaIRv2.0.0, we will provide an Excel file containing the model with its default parameter set, ensuring FaIRv2.0.0 is available for all interested parties, even those unfamiliar with computer programming languages. The Excel version of the model could also be used to assist teaching of climate change and climate processes and could even allow students access to an easy-tounderstand model that they could use themselves to explore future scenarios and the relative impacts of future emissions of different greenhouse gases or demonstrate the importance of climate sensitivity in an interactive manner. FaIRv2.0.0 sits at the very low end of complexity within the broad spectrum of currently available simple climate models. It is a very highly parameterized model for simulating globally averaged relationships between greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, and surface temperature response. We have shown that despite its simplicity, it is able to span the wide range of behaviours exhibited by much more complex models and those inferred from observations. In addition, we have provided some basic comparisons to both the previous version of FaIR(v1.5) and the widely used MAG-ICC SCM <ref type="bibr">(Meinshausen et al., 2011a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Meinshausen et al., , b, 2020))</ref>. More detailed comparisons are outside the remit of this paper, but RCMIP <ref type="bibr">(Nicholls et al., 2020b, a)</ref> covers this topic comprehensively. We expect that FaIRv2.0.0 is very close to as simple as an SCM could get without losing a significant proportion of this representation ability. However, it does not explicitly simulate the physical processes behind these variables, which may preclude it from some applications where other, more complex SCMs such as MAGICC would be usable. Overall, however, we hope that FaIRv2.0.0 will be an important contribution to the available set of SCMs given its wide range of potential use cases and that it will open up climate system modelling to a wide range of novel users in both industry and education. duced the figures.
