<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study examined empirical associations between employee cognitive perceptions of leader behavior (directive behavior, supportive behavior) and leader values (self-concern, other orientation), employee positive affect and negative affect, and employee work intentions indicative of (dis)passionate employees. An internetbased self-report questionnaire survey was administered to 409 employees within three private sector organizations in Australia. Structural equation modeling indicated that supportive behavior, other-orientation, and self-concern had respective indirect effects on work intentions through employee positive affect.</p><p>Employee positive affect was a stronger predictor of employee work intentions than was employee negative affect. Implications of these findings for theory and practice are discussed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Ho, Wong, &amp; Lee, 2011)</ref>. Notwithstanding, conceptualizations of work passion that explain its formulation have largely been absent from the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Kocjan, 2015)</ref>. In response, <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Zigarmi et al. (2009)</ref> proposed an operational definition of work passion: "an individual's persistent, emotionally positive, meaning-based, state of well-being, stemming from reoccurring cognitive and affective appraisals of various job and organizational situations that result in consistent and constructive work intentions" (p. 310). A unique aspect of this definition pertains to the incorporation of the concept of appraisal to explain the formulation of work passion. Additionally, examination of empirical relations between key latent constructs (cognitive, affective, behavioral) identified that affect is central to the formation of work passion <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Zigarmi, Nimon, Houson, Witt, &amp; Diehl, 2011)</ref>. Overall, research on work passion is gaining momentum, however, examination of its antecedent determinants is largely unexplored <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Egan, Blackman, &amp; Turner, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Forest et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Concomitantly, within a vast body of research spanning many decades, scholars reported that in the context of leader-follower relations, leader behavior is empirically related to numerous positive employee and organizational outcomes, for example, performance (Alimo-Metcalfe, Alban-Metcalfe, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bradley, Mariathasan, &amp; Samele, 2008)</ref>, group climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Salvaggio et al., 2007)</ref>, leader effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Morgeson, 2005)</ref>, follower motivation, follower satisfaction with leader, and leader job performance <ref type="bibr">(Judge &amp; Piccolo, 2004)</ref>, and Organizational Citizenship Behaviors (OCB; <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Piccolo &amp; Colquitt, 2006)</ref>. In addition, a growing body of research has focused on relations between leadership, follower emotions, and follower affect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Gooty, Connelly, Griffith, &amp; Gupta, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Rajah, Song, &amp; Arvey, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">To, Tse, &amp; Ashkanasy, 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Connelly and Gooty (2015)</ref> underscored that "affect-laden phenomena" are deeply intertwined with the process of leading and leader and follower outcomes. Implicit in this focus is the acknowledgement that affective experiences matter in the workplace because everyday individuals bring their whole self to work-traits, thoughts, moods, and emotions. This empirical study sought to explore the integration of work passion theory and leadership theory, a linkage that has received little research attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">| Leadership, work passion, and human resource development</head><p>The topics of leadership and work passion are especially relevant from a Human Resource Development (HRD) perspective because practitioners serve many organizational functions and balance a multitude of responsibilities.</p><p>Scholars have suggested that the mission of HRD relates to the simultaneous pursuit of learning, humanistic, and performance outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Chalofsky, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Kuchinke, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Sambrook, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Chalofsky (2007)</ref> stated that HRD is primarily concerned with how "people can strive to reach their human potential and enhance their performance through learning" (p. 437). <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Chalofsky and Cavallaro (2013)</ref> contended that HRD practitioners were challenged with creating and maintaining organizational cultures that strengthen the fit between self and work where the sense of self relates to "being able to bring the whole self to the workplace" (p. 333). We believe that integral to the fulfillment of these purposes is the development of organizational strategic and operational leadership capacity.</p><p>This study has relevance and implications for HRD practitioners inasmuch as they have a need for, and responsibility to, implement development programs (e.g., leader and organizational culture) that build leaders' knowledge and skills to support the humanistic development of the follower. Such programs must be effective in promoting forms of leadership that are humane, development centered, and facilitate performance. HRD practitioners can benefit from exploring the use of models that advocate the formation of employee work passion through effective leader behaviors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Egan et al. (2017)</ref> proposed a synthesis of leadership theory and work passion theory, two distinct but potentially related areas of research, to provide HRD practitioners with a deeper understanding of how leadership promotes (or hinders) employees' subjective experience of work passion. These authors used the Employee Work Passion Appraisal (EWPA) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Zigarmi et al., 2011)</ref> as the theoretical foundation of their hypothesized conceptual framework. A central tenet of the EWPA model is Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bandura, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)</ref>, which postulated that humans mentally connect past and present environmental experiences to their values, emotions, and expectations to form future intentions that lead to behaviors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Egan et al. (2017)</ref> proposed that employee cognitive appraisals of leader behavior and leader values have differential impacts on employee affect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">| Purpose</head><p>Resultant employee work intentions include engaging in discretionary effort, performing at higher than average levels, endorsing the organization, staying with the organization, and engaging in OCB. These authors called for empirical testing of their model. This study responds to this call.</p><p>The overall aim of this study was to conduct a partial test of the EWPA model by examining empirical relations between selected organization environmental antecedents (leader behavior and leader values), employee affect, and employee work intentions to expand understanding of the formulation of work passion. Within the context of the employee work passion appraisal process, empirical evidence suggested that employee cognitive perceptions of organization environmental antecedent variables have impacts on work intentions through employee affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Zigarmi et al., 2011)</ref>. However, investigation of such effects has been sparse <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Egan et al., 2017)</ref>. The first purpose of this study was to investigate empirical associations between employee cognitive appraisals of their leader's behaviors and values, employee affect, and employee work intentions.</p><p>The second purpose of this study relates to the need articulated by various authors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Kim, Nimon, Hoon Song, &amp; Zigarmi, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Zigarmi, Nimon, Shuck, &amp; Roberts, 2019)</ref> to extend the employee work passion research base. For instance, most of the studies that investigated the EWPA model have drawn samples from organization populations within the USA.</p><p>Given the continued globalization of the workforce, data from non-USA samples would enable the factor structure of the EWPA model to be tested in different cultures and the results may allow findings to begin to be generalized across countries. This study used an Australian organizational setting to assess empirical relations between focal constructs. This research aimed to make the following contributions to the organizational behavior literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Meyer, Gagne, and Parfyonova (2010)</ref> called for research that integrates theories and evidence from contiguous fields, for example, organizational psychology and organizational behavior, to deepen the understanding of related psychological constructs that contribute to positive employee experiences of work. By measuring employee perceptions of their interpersonal experience with leaders, employee affect, and levels of intent, this study aimed to contribute to bridging the gap between the long-standing research base relating to organizational leadership and the emergent theory of employee work passion. Also, this study aimed to contribute to the overall body of research on employee work passion by using three Australian organizations as a research setting.</p><p>In terms of implications for HRD practice, this study sought to provide greater insight relating to which leader behaviors and leader value orientations enhance or hinder the emergence of employee work passion and how this process occurs. This knowledge could assist HRD practitioners in the effective measurement of the employee work passion construct, and subsequently, enable them to leverage the organization environmental conditions that promote it. Additionally, such knowledge will assist HRD practitioners to create organizational cultures that hold that effective leadership plays a central role in assisting employees to integrate self and work, which will enable them to flourish. In this way, organizations may reap the positive individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Forest et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">McAllister, Harris, Hochwarter, Perrewe, &amp; Ferris, 2017)</ref> and organizational <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Ho et al., 2011)</ref> benefits associated with work passion.</p><p>The following section provides theoretical rationale relating to the EWPA model and support for hypothesized relations between focal constructs, that is, leader behavior, leader values, affect, and intentions. Then, the study's method and results are presented. Implications for HRD practice are discussed. Directions for future research and study limitations conclude this article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">| THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">| Employee work passion appraisal model</head><p>The EWPA model (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) is grounded in CAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bandura, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)</ref>, which contended that humans are meaning-oriented and meaning-creating creatures who continually appraise their environment (objects, events, experiences) from the perspective of their personal well-being and react emotionally to some of these evaluations. It is important to note that in the context of the EWPA model, subjective job well-being (the balance of pleasure or displeasure in an immediate work experience; <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Schimmack, Schupp, &amp; Wagner, 2008)</ref> is viewed from a process-oriented perspective. Specifically, the initial appraisal moves from description to a higher-order judgment or valuation of the environment's attributes and individuals ask of themselves "Am I in trouble or being benefited, now or in the future, and in what way?" and "How will these perceived objects or events impact my personal sense of well-being?" <ref type="bibr">(Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984, p. 31</ref>). In the second phase of the appraisal, individuals make judgements and form conscious intentions that will enable them to cope with the environmental impact <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Lazarus, 1991)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Lazarus and Folkman (1984)</ref> described secondary appraisal as: "…a complex evaluative process that takes into account which coping options are available, the likelihood that a given coping option will accomplish what it is supposed to, and the likelihood that one can apply a particular strategy or set of strategies effectively" (p. 35).</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Zigarmi et al. (2009)</ref>, the EWPA process consists of two phases. First, employees cognitively appraise organization, job, and interpersonal experiences, events, and situations. To the extent that positive or negative affect is generated from the appraisal, a positive or negative sense of employee job well-being develops. Second, employees form intentions to actively participate (or not) in work activities and behaviors, for example, engage in-role and extra-role behavior and performance, endorse the organization as a positive place to work, and be an altruistic organizational citizen. Thus, the subjective experience of work passion develops. A latent aspect of the EWPA model suggested that employee appraisals are reoccurring and thus the formulation of work passion is postulated to be a dynamic process stemming from a continuing need for employees to interpret and make sense of their ever-changing work experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">(Zigarmi et al. 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Empirical assessment of the EWPA model has focused on three areas: (a) construct reliability and validity of the latent constructs that comprise the EWPA model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Nimon &amp; Zigarmi, 2015a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">, 2015b)</ref>; (b) the influence of personal characteristics of the appraiser, for example, values, beliefs, disposition, motives, needs, and the history with the object being appraised, on the appraisal process (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Shuck, Zigarmi, &amp; Owen, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Zigarmi, Galloway, &amp; Roberts, 2018)</ref>; and (c) the influence of organization environmental determinants, that is, factors that are external to the appraiser, on the appraisal process (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Zigarmi et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Zigarmi &amp; Roberts, 2012)</ref>. Overall, research assessing the role of organization environmental antecedents within the EWPA model is underdeveloped <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Egan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Zigarmi et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Organization environmental antecedents. The concept of organizational environment emanates from research on psychological climate within the fields of industrial and organization psychology (e.g., L. R. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">James et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">L. R. James, Hater, Gent, &amp; Bruni, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">L. A. James &amp; James, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Jones &amp; James, 1979)</ref>. L. R. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">James et al. (1978)</ref> FIGURE <ref type="figure">1</ref> The employee work passion appraisal model. Source: <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Zigarmi et al. (2011)</ref>. A preliminary field test of an employee work passion model. Human Resource Development <ref type="bibr">Quarterly,</ref><ref type="bibr">22(2),</ref> discussion of psychological climate emphasized the importance of psychological meaning and significance associated with an employee's value laden perceptions of aspects of proximal organizational structures, processes, and events. Furthermore, psychological climate is associated with the individual level of analysis as it guides the behavior of individuals to fulfill organizational objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Jones &amp; James, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Schneider &amp; Reichers, 1983)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Schneider and Reichers (1983)</ref> explicated this theme when they posited that research on psychological climate had focussed on a climate "for something" within an organization, for example, innovation, service, or safety. In this study, we focussed on organization environmental antecedents that foster a psychological climate for "employee work passion" at the individual level of analysis.</p><p>In alignment with theoretical underpinnings of psychological climate research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Zigarmi et al. (2011)</ref> argued that in the context of the employee work passion appraisal process, the focus of employee cognitive and affective appraisals includes various characertistics present in the work environment such as performance expectations, meaningful work, workload balance, task variety, procedural and distributive justice, leaders, and colleagues. However, despite much research that suggested leadership is a fundamental element in the creation of workplace environments that foster psychologically healthy, and productive employees (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Hiller, DeChurch, Murase, &amp; Doty, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Lord, Day, Zaccaro, Avolio, &amp; Eagly, 2017)</ref>, few studies have investigated the antecedent role of leadership within the EWPA model <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Egan et al., 2017)</ref>. We located only two studies have examined the role of leadership within the EWPA model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Zigarmi and Roberts (2012)</ref> reported significant relations between managerial behavior, managerial values, employee affect, and work intentions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Zigarmi, Roberts, and Randolph (2015)</ref> assessed structural power at the organizational level and found empirical associations between leaders' use of power, employee affect, and work intentions. In this study, we chose a singular focus on leadership, an organization environmental antecedent variable within the work passion appraisal process, to provide HRD practitioners with insight relating to a key boundary condition to the formulation of employee work passion.</p><p>The following reasons support our decision to conduct a partial test of the EWPA model. First, <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Zigarmi et al. (2011)</ref> provided evidence supporting the overall factor stucture of the EWPA model including significant correlations between its four latent constructs (cognition, affect, job well-being, and work intentions). Second, previous research examined the influence of antecedent variables within the EWPA model, for example, personal characteristics (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Shuck et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Zigarmi et al., 2018)</ref> and various organization environmental antecedents (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Zigarmi et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Zigarmi et al., , 2015))</ref>, however, such research is in its formative stage. Third, the tenets of the broader appraisal literature assert that cognition, emotion, and coping are the three central constructs in appraisal theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Fugate, Harrison, &amp; Kinicki, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)</ref>. Hence, the focus of this study is on relations between employee cognitive appraisals of leader behavior, leader values, employee affect, and employee work intentions. In the following sections, leader behavior and leader values are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">| Perceptions of leader behavior</head><p>Within the work domain, the initial phase of employee valuation of leader behavior results from cognitive appraisals of current leaders' behaviors, compared to already formed thought patterns or mental schema of employees' past experiences of leaders' behaviors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Lazarus (1984)</ref> argued that the schematic aspects of cognitive processing are an important and necessary precondition to emotion because to experience an emotion, the appraiser must comprehend that their personal well-being is implicated for "better or worse" (p. 124). As such, the first aspect to postulated relations to which we draw the reader's attention involves employee cognitive perceptions of one-to-one leader behavior.</p><p>We agree with <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Gooty et al. (2010)</ref> who highlighted that a variety of theoretical frameworks such as transformational leadership, leader-member exchange, individualized and charismatic leadership, and contingency models could serve as a conceptual lens through which to analyze leadership, affect, and effectiveness outcomes. To measure leader behavior in this study, we chose the fundamental behavioral constructs of Consideration and Initiating Structure and rationale that supports this decision follows.</p><p>Consideration and initiating structure. Researchers at the Bureau of Business Research at Ohio State University in the 1950s and 1960s identified that leader behaviors grouped as Consideration and Initiating Structure were related to positive leader and organizational outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Fleishman, 1953;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Stogdill, 1963)</ref>. Leaders who were considerate reflected the extent to which leaders showed concern for followers, considered followers' ideas and feelings, and developed relationships characterized by mutual trust and respect <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Fleishman, 1953;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Korman, 1966)</ref>. Leaders who initiated structure-clarified leader and follower roles were focused on task and goal attainment, and were active in providing information, scheduling, and evaluating performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Fleishman, 1953;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Korman, 1966)</ref>.</p><p>Research on the behavioral approach to understanding leadership (Consideration and Initiating Structure) was prolific (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Fleishman &amp; Harris, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Fleishman &amp; Simmons, 1970)</ref> until the advent of the Contingency theories of the 1970s <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Judge, Piccolo, &amp; Ilies, 2004</ref>). In the following three decades, a paradigm shift occurred in leadership thinking and scholars investigated the symbolic and emotional aspects of leadership, for example, Charismatic Leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(House, 1977)</ref> and Transformational Leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bass, 1985)</ref> and the Ohio State dimensions fell from research favor. However, we agree with <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Rost (1991)</ref> who suggested that "when popularity waned, the theories remained in the minds and hearts of scholars and practitioners alike because they appealed to the structural-functional psyche of most practitioners" (p. 29).</p><p>Notably, research on Consideration and Initiating Structure has enjoyed a resurgence in the literature following <ref type="bibr">Judge et al. (2004)</ref> ground breaking meta-analytical study that recognized the validity of these leadership dimensions.</p><p>Subsequent research reported empirical associations between Consideration and Initiating Structure and important leader and organizational effectiveness outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Blickle et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">De Rue, Narghang, Wellman, &amp; Humphrey, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Piccolo et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Schurer-Lambert, Tepper, Carr, Holt, &amp; Barelka, 2012)</ref>. De Rue et al. ( <ref type="formula">2011</ref>) metaanalysis, consisting of 13 existing meta-analyses and 46 primary studies, assessed the predictive validity of leader behaviors and found that Consideration and Initiating Structure were correlated to leader effectiveness (0.52 and 0.39) follower job satisfaction (0.46 and 0.25), and satisfaction with leader (0.78 and 0.33). Meta-analytical results reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Piccolo et al. (2012)</ref> suggested that Consideration and Initiating Structure were consistent predictors of leader effectiveness (0.70 and 0.62) follower job satisfaction (0.38 and 0.21). Such meta-analytic evidence suggested that the Ohio State dimensions are important predictors of leadership effectiveness.</p><p>Early studies that examined the empirical orthogonality of Consideration and Initiating Structure reported inconsistent results (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Korman, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Weissenberg &amp; Kavanagh, 1972)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr">Judge et al. (2004)</ref> concluded that variations in the intercorrelations between the two constructs were attributable to the measures employed. Recent studies that have benefited from the use of contemporary meta-analytical statistical techniques <ref type="bibr">(e.g., De Rue et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Judge et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Piccolo et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">)</ref> provided evidence that Consideration and Initiating Structure were low to moderately and positively correlated but "not so large as to render the two concepts redundant" <ref type="bibr">(Judge et al., 2004, p.44)</ref>.</p><p>In terms of application for HRD practitioners, Consideration and Initiating Structure formed the conceptual foundations of subsequent contingency-based models including <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Fiedler's (1967)</ref> Contingency Model of Leadership, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">House's (1971)</ref> Path-Goal Theory, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Hersey and Blanchard's (1969)</ref> Life Cycle Theory.

For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Meirovich and Gu (2015)</ref> concluded that "unlike many fads in managerial science that came and went rather quickly, Hersey and Blanchard's model demonstrates considerable robustness and sustainability and remains popular after more than 30 years" (p. 61). <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bass (2008)</ref> stated that the "Hersey-Blanchard model has had remarkable wide-spread intuitive appeal to practicing managers" (p. 522). Overall, Consideration and Initiating Structure not only provided the basis for new theory but continue to be relevant and impactful leadership constructs in 21st century organizations.</p><p>Notwithstanding, <ref type="bibr">Judge et al. (2004)</ref> called for further examination of Consideration and Initiating Structure and a wider range of effectiveness outcomes.

However, an analysis of LBDQ-XII items revealed that some may confound leader behavior and the outcomes stemming from the behavior, for example, item 17 "My leader does little things to make it pleasant to be a member of the group". Such item wording risks blurring the descriptive cognition of organization environment behavior with resultant affect associated with exposure to the behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Schriesheim &amp; Kerr, 1977)</ref>. Also, the LBDQ-XII includes items that describe leader behavior toward employees as individuals and others describe leader behavior toward their work group. Considering the unit of analysis implicit in the EWPA model is at the individual level, failure to consider level-of-analysis issues may result in a misalignment of theory and data <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Schriesheim, Cogliser, &amp; Neider, 1990</ref>). To tap employee cognitive perceptions of leader behavior, in this study we used proxy measures of Considerarion and Initiating Structure, that is, supportive behavior and directive behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Blanchard et al., 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Blanchard et al., , 2013))</ref>. We believe that use of these measures would ensure two outcomes: (1) employee cognitive perceptions of leader behavior would remain empirically distinct from resultant affective inferences, and (2) they would reside in the one-to-one context exclusively.</p><p>Building upon the leadership dimensions of the Ohio State studies, in the late 1970s Blanchard and colleagues framed Initiating Structure as directive behavior and Consideration as supportive behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Blanchard, Zigarmi, &amp; Nelson, 1993)</ref>. Directive behaviors were defined as evaluating, setting priorities, establishing timelines, showing how, action planning, goal setting, and clarifying roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Blanchard et al., 1985)</ref>. Supportive behaviors were defined as problem solving, listening, praising, providing rationale, sharing information-organization, sharing information-self, and asking for input <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Blanchard et al., 1985)</ref>.

For leaders to be effective in using the behaviors associated with each construct, understandiing the positive intentions that underpin each is essential. Use of directive behavior does not need to be delivered harshly, insensitively, or in a patronizing manner.

These authors posited that self-concern and other-orientation drive an individual's behavior in the workplace to focus on self-serving versus group-related cues. In other words, individuals with high other-orientation stimulate the processing of social information (e.g., information from and about relevant others, joint outcomes, and collective success), and individuals with high self-concern stimulate the processing of self-relevant information (e.g., personal characteristics and qualities, individual outcomes, and successes).</p><p>De <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Dreu and Nauta (2009)</ref> argued that variations in self-concern and other-orientation may be due to temperament, socialization, and situational demands.

By extrapolation, we suggest a leader could be perceived to be high in self-concern and high in other-orientation, high on one dimension and low on the other, or low in both.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">| Participants</head><p>The study's sample was convenience based and consisted of all employees from three medium-sized (100-500 employees) Australian private sector organizations. One organization is in the pharmaceutical industry and located in the state of Western Australia. The second organization is in the healthcare industry in the state of Victoria. The third organization is in the food production industry and located in the state of New South Wales. These three organizations were selected for the following reasons. First, senior leaders and HRD leaders within each organization registered interest in better understanding the role of leader behavior in employee subjective experience of work passion due to their respective focus on creating optimal work environments. Second, the existence of a professional relationship between the research team and senior leaders of each organization and their willingness to grant permission for employees to participate in the study. Third, three diverse organizations in terms of type and location provided data source triangulation, that is, data collected on the same phenomenon from multiple sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Denzin, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>All employees from each organization were invited to complete an internet-based self-report survey distributed via email within each organization. An internet-based survey was used as the method of data collection because it provided a vehicle to reach a geographically dispersed and large population simultaneously, greater respondent anonymity, greater levels of respondent self-disclosure, and less respondent social concern and constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Dillman, Smyth, &amp; Christian, 2009)</ref>. The content of the email explained the purpose and scope of the study and assured respondents of the anonymity of their data and that participation was voluntary. The email contained a unique organizational link to the survey and ballot box stuffing controls were enacted. Given leader behavior and leader values were antecedent variables in the hypothesized model, the self-report survey required respondents to record their perceptions of leader behavior in detail. Accordingly, sample respondents needed to have a direct relationship with a supervisor/leader, have a current work email address, and have access to the internet. All employees of all three organizations met these requirements. 880 surveys were distributed and 450 were completed with the useable number being 409. The response rate for each organization was 47, 54, and 42%, approximating each organization's proportion of the original sample, and was considered adequate <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Sax, Gilmartin, &amp; Bryant, 2003)</ref>. All data were examined through SPSS (version 25.0) and AMOS (version 25.0). The sample consisted of 51% male, 49% female; 22% were under 30 years of age, 56% were between 30 and 49 years, and 22% were over 50 years; 73% were individual contributors, 27% were leaders; and in relation to years of experience with their organization, 38% had 5 or less years, 51% had between 6 and 20 years, and 11% had 21 or more years. Respondents represented approximately equal proportions of white-collar (e.g., finance, human resources, sales, operations, information technology, marketing, customer service, and research and development) and blue-collar (e.g., logistics, warehouse, manufacturing, and engineering) departments. After reviewing responses to demographic variables with each organization's study sponsor, the sample was considered representative of the organizational populations from which it originated.</p></div>

To provide respondents with a frame-ofreference when rating affect, the I-PANAS-SF items were prefaced with: "When thinking about your interactions  with your leader, to what extent do you genuinely feel...".

In addition, considering the focus of this study was to investigate leadership as a key boundary condition to the formulation of employee work passion in organizations, a field study setting, involving a sample of organizational employees, was preferred to a laboratory experiment. Consequently, a cross-sectional design was implemented in a field setting with the aim of gathering correlational data to investigate whether the pattern of covariances among measured variables was consistent with hypothesized relations. We acknowledge that other causal models could also be consistent with the same pattern of covariances identified in this study.

Examination of structural path estimates between control variables and endogenous constructs revealed out of a total of 28 estimated structural paths, seven were significant. Examination of correlations between control variables and environmental constructs revealed out of a total of 16 estimated relations, two were significant. These findings suggest that SEM 2 did an adequate, but not perfect, job in explaining the observed covariance matrix. Importantly, the inclusion of the control variables in SEM 2 did not alter the overall model fit or the significance of relations with one caveat being the relation between negative affect and intent to perform, which was significantly negatively related in SEM 1 (β = -0.145, p &lt; 0.05) but not significant (ns) in SEM 2 (β = -0.125, p = 0.058) although it was still in the expected direction. Overall, the direction of the hypothesized relations and their magnitude did not alter significantly in SEM 2. Given the presence of significant relations between control variables and endogenous work intention constructs, all four control variables were retained in the structural model. Thus, SEM 2 became the baseline model in subsequent analyses.</p><p>Step 4: SEM 3 (controlling for gender, age, organization level, and organization tenure) included all paths estimated in SEM 2 plus direct paths from each of the four environmental constructs to each of the five work intention constructs.</p><p>SEM 3 revealed an acceptable goodness-of-fit (CMIN/DF = 1.540, SRMR = 0.0351, CFI = 0.961, TLI = 0.957, and RMSEA = 0.036).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">| DISCUSSION</head><p>This study investigated correlations between employee cognitive perceptions of leader behavior and leader values, employee affect, and work intentions in Australian organizations. Out of a total of 18 hypothesized structural paths, 11 were significant and in the expected direction. Considering the size, direction, and significance of covariance and structural relations, overall, statistical results indicated that the hypothesized model did an acceptable, but not perfect, job in explaining the observed covariance matrix. Although these findings were, on the whole, consistent with the study's hypothesized model, it is not the only model that could be consistent with these results. Additionally, the EWPA model provides a basis for investigating relations among hypothesized latent constructs (cognition, affect, and work intentions) in a "statistical sense", however, our findings do not imply that the measured variables are causally related.</p><p>Results indicated that relations between environmental constructs and affect constructs were statistically significant and in the hypothesized direction with caveats for the relations between directive behavior and positive affect and directive behavior and negative affect. Employee perceptions of leaders' use of directive behavior and the positive (although not significant) association with negative affect may be explained by the "antagonistic" nature of directive behaviors when leaders fail to appropriately calibrate them in relation to employee needs, resulting in reduced employee attitudinal outcomes such as trust in leader <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Schurer-Lambert et al., 2012)</ref>. Contrastingly, when supportive behaviors (characterized as a "synergistic supply") are used in excess in relation to employee needs, employee attitudinal outcomes remain favorable <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Schurer-Lambert et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Of the four environmental constructs, the positive relation between other-orientation and positive affect was, comparatively, the strongest of all possible pairings of environmental constructs and positive affect. The negative relation between other-orientation and negative affect was, comparatively, the strongest of all possible pairings of environmental constructs and negative affect. These findings suggest that employees who perceived leaders to demonstrate other-orientated behavior were likely to report high levels of positive affect and less likely to report high levels of negative affect. Contrastingly, for those leaders who were perceived to hold self-focused values, employees were likely to report high levels of negative affect and less likely to report high levels of positive affect. These results support previous findings that suggested that employee emotional responses are linked to leader behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Dasborough, 2006)</ref>. For example, self-sacrificing leader values and other-focused leader behavior have been found</p><p>to have significant positive impacts on employee emotions, motivation, and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(De Cremer, 2006</ref>  Relations between positive affect and all five work intentions were positive, significant, and the magnitude of these relations was consistently large in effect size. Relations between negative affect and the five work intentions were non-significant. These results suggested that employee negative affective responses to leader behaviors and leader values were not related to work intentions. Results relating to the nature of relations between employee positive and negative affect and work intentions, respectively, support those reported in the employee work passion literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Zigarmi et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Zigarmi et al., , 2015;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Zigarmi &amp; Roberts, 2012)</ref>. The presence of significant specific indirect effects between supportive behavior, leader other-orientation, and leader self-concern on work intentions through positive affect, and the absence of significant direct effects in the final structural model, support the hypothesized role of affect (albeit positive affect) in completely and indirectly mediating relations between environmental constructs and work intentions (although relations between directive behavior and work intentions were exceptions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">| Implications and considerations for HRD practitioners</head><p>A first important implication from this research is that its findings support the contention that strategic and operational leaders must be sensitive to the affective dimensions of an employee's work life. It is no longer tenable to hear a manager say to an employee, "this is not personal, this is business". Emotions are part of doing business. HRD practitioners should note that employee affect, particularly positive affect, is a critical emotional state that is intertwined with perceptions of leadership and has impacts on positive organizational outcomes. When HR practitioners think about the recruitment and development of leaders, consideration should be given to attitudes and programs that help and require leaders to identify, understand, and manage their emotions and those of others. Leaders must be expected to promote thought, through emotions, in short, cultivate a sense of emotional intelligence in themselves and others.</p><p>A second take away from this study is that the expression of positive employee emotions must be legitimized and cultivated as desirable in organizations through an emphasis on leaders who put the concerns of others above their own. One of the strongest pairings in this study was between employee perceptions of leaders' value orientations and positive affect. When leaders are perceived as being concerned with the needs and agendas of others, and less so with their own, there is a high probability that positive affective connections will form between leaders and employees. Additionally, employee intent to use discretionary effort, to perform, to endorse the organization, to stay with the organization, and to be a positive organizational citizen will likely be high. Contrastingly, employees who perceived leaders to be self-concerned were more apt to report negative affect. HRD practitioners need to encourage leaders to adopt and develop other-focussed values to arouse positive emotional states in employees, which will assist in achieving desirable outcomes. For employees to be passionate about their work, they must feel that being positive about their work life is important. Being joyful is part of being passionate about ones' work.</p><p>A third implication from this research is that HRD practitioners must understand the benefits that stem from the use of "micro behaviors" that combine in leader direction and leader support <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Benson et al., 2012)</ref>. The present study found evidence that supportive behaviors are positively related to positive affect and strongly and negatively related to negative affect. HRD practitioners should implement leadership development programs based on the use of supportive behaviors such as active listening skills, facilitating problem solving, sharing information about self and the organization's operations and needs, providing rationale for decisions, and asking for input from those who will be affected by the decisions.</p><p>Leadership development programs are a viable way to increase leader effectiveness and organizational success <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Arthur, Bennett, Edens, &amp; Bell, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Collins &amp; Holton, 2004)</ref>. However, the effectiveness of such programs depends upon the inclusion of impactful behaviors. In the present study, results show that supportive behaviors (as listed here)</p><p>were empirically associated with employee affect and thus help when it comes to cultivating a sense of employee positive affect. These results provide HRD practitioners with insight into which specific leader behaviors should be included in leadership development programs so participants have opportunities to develop skills that are likely to engender positive follower emotions that contribute to and strengthen leader-follower relations, and which have implications for desirable work intentions.</p><p>In summary, HRD practitioners must work toward building healthy organizational cultures characterized by a style of leadership that has evolved from heroic models "that encourage adulation of a few gifted leaders at the top of organisations" <ref type="bibr">(Alban-Metcalfe &amp; Alimo-Metcalfe, 2007, p. 116)</ref> to a style that emphasizes sensitivity to the emotional (both positive and negative) dimensions of followers. Concurrently, HRD practitioners must insist on leaders fulfilling a service role characterized by leader respect and genuine concern for the well-being for others, and one in which both developmental and performance orientated needs of others are prioritized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">| Directions for future research</head><p>This study extended previous research on the employee work passion appraisal process by demonstrating that employee positive affective inferences relating to perceptions of leader behavior and leader values are associated with employee work intentions. Three implications for theory stem from this study. First, the finding that supportive behavior is significantly related to employee work intentions via employee affect and that directive behavior was not significantly related to employee work intentions or employee affect has implications for the ongoing study of leadership. For example, over the past three decades the full-range model of leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Avolio, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bass, 1985)</ref> has received an immense amount of research attention <ref type="bibr">(Judge &amp; Piccolo, 2004</ref>) yet, some authors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Bycio, Hackett, &amp; Allen, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Michel, Lyons, &amp; Cho, 2010)</ref> argued that other leader behaviors, particularly those relating to the transactional leadership construct, could add to the predictive efficacy of the overall full-range leadership model and, therefore, should be explored more fully. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Piccolo et al. (2012)</ref> provided empirical support that underscored respective relations between Consideration and Initiating Structure and organizational effectiveness outcomes and argued that the veracity of the full-range leadership model could be enhanced by the inclusion of Consideration and to a lesser extent, Initiating Structure. The present findings suggested that supportive leadership behavior could be an impactful addition to the taxonomy of transactional leadership behaviors within the full-range leadership model.</p><p>Second, this study found self-concern and other-orientation were separately and indirectly related to work intentions via employee positive affect. However, the methodology used in this study did not allow for the understanding of the impact of self-concern and other-orientation in combination. For example, De Dreu and Nauta (2009) contended that these constructs combine into a proself value orientation (high self-concern with low other-orientation) and a prosocial value orientation (high self-concern with high other-orientation). These social value orientations have been demonstrated to affect the ways in which individuals think and behave in relation to negotiation cognition and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(De Dreu, Beersma, Stroebe, &amp; Euwema, 2006)</ref>, interdepartmental problem solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Nauta et al., 2002)</ref>, and social settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(De Dreu &amp; McCusker, 1997)</ref>. Future research could examine the degree to which these value orientations relate to employee affect and work intentions.</p><p>Third, these results suggest that in Australian organizations, employee appraisals of supportive behavior and leader self focused and other focused value orientations are differentially linked to employee positive affect, which is related to work intentions. This observation is important as it provides preliminary evidence that relations that underpin the EWPA model can begin to be generalized across countries albeit an individualistic culture. However, further research examining the EWPA model using non-USA samples is recommended. Furthermore, the participating organizations in this study were of medium size, from the private sector, and Australian. In previous studies of the EWPA model, the participating organizations were of different size, from a variety of sectors, and from the USA. Alternative influences that could explain the differences in results relating to the mediating role of employee affect could be related but not limited to employee cultural differences, organizational size, organizational type, and organizational culture. For example, Australian employees may attach greater emotional resources when appraising leaders compared to their USA counterparts. Thus, the role of cross-cultural influences in the appraisal of leaders in the context of employee work passion warrants investigation. Relations between organizational culture, leader behavior, and performance in organizations generally are well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Denison &amp; Mishra, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Schein, 1985)</ref>, as it is in Australian organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Lok &amp; Crawford, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Wallace, Hunt, &amp; Richards, 1999)</ref>, however, these alternative influences relating to the role of affect in the EWPA model are yet to be examined.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">| CONCLUSION</head><p>This study provides organizational scholars and HRD practitioners with empirical evidence that suggested that in Australian private sector organizations, supportive behavior, leader other-orientation, and positive affect play stronger roles within in the employee work passion appraisal process than do directive behavior, leader self-concern, and negative affect.

Conclusions regarding the order of causality of focal constructs are only possible by deploying randomized experimental or longitudinal designs in which variance within individuals across time could be examined in addition to variance between individuals. Second, future employee work passion research designs could incorporate leader self-report data that could provide validation of employee perceptions of organization environmental antecedents. While there are several strengths in this study that stem from a quantitative research strategy, qualitative methods (e.g., the use of case studies, interviews, and diary studies) that are not grounded in an a priori hypothesized model could further enlighten the EWPA model or uncover contextual factors that may influence it. A third limitation relates to observations of leaders interacting with followers. Critics such as Yukl (2012) recommended using observational data to supplement survey measures of leader behavior. Fourth, this study was undertaken within the context of Australian private sector organizations. While this narrow scope enhances internal validity of the findings, it inhibits generalizability of the findings to other sectors (e.g., public, nonprofit) and collectivist cultures.</figDesc></figure>
