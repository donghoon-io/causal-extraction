In this competitive work environment, the quality of human resources is of vital importance to achieve organisational success <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Macey &amp; Schneider, 2008)</ref>. Engaged employees are willing to invest more than is expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Babcock-Roberson &amp; Strickland, 2010)</ref>, are more productive <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Harter, Schmidt &amp; Hayes, 2002)</ref>, perform better <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allesandri, Borgogni, Schaufeli, Caprara &amp; Consiglio, 2015)</ref> and show less sickness absenteeism <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Schaufeli, Bakker &amp; van Rhenen, 2009)</ref>. Not only these practical reasons make it important for managers and researchers to be concerned about work engagement, there are humanistic reasons as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(May, Gilson &amp; Harter, 2004)</ref>. Engaged employees are more satisfied with their jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Giallonardo, Wong &amp; Iwasiw, 2010)</ref>, enjoy good health <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Seppäla et al., 2012)</ref>, positive work affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Sonnentag, Mojza, Binnewies &amp; Scholl, 2008)</ref> and experience more well-being at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Rothmann, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Increasing employee engagement is a challenging and complex undertaking. Some researchers have suggested that the quality of the relationship between supervisors and employees, also known as the leader-member exchange (LMX; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995)</ref>, plays a pivotal role in fostering work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Macey &amp; Schneider, 2008)</ref>. The principle of LMX theory is that supervisors develop different types of exchange relationships with their employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bauer &amp; Green, 1996)</ref>. The quality of these relationships influences important leader and member attitudes and behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bhal, Gulati &amp; Ansari, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sparrowe &amp; Liden, 1997)</ref>. Few studies have examined the positive association between LMX and work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agarwal, Datta, Blake-Beard &amp; Bhargava, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Breevaart, Bakker, Demerouti &amp; van den Heuvel, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Li, Sanders &amp; Frenkel, 2012)</ref>. The only study that examined the mechanisms that lie beyond this association showed that a resourceful work environment provided in a high-quality LMX increased work engagement among the employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Breevaart et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Unfortunately, supervisors are not always available to support their employees, and the fast-changing competitive work environment may set other priorities for them <ref type="bibr">(Bakker, Tims &amp; Derks, 2012)</ref>. Under such conditions, it may be particularly important for employees to mobilise their own job resources to stay engaged. Pro-active work behaviours aimed at improving person-job fit and work motivation by altering job demands and job resources have been defined as job crafting <ref type="bibr">(Tims, Bakker &amp; Derks, 2012)</ref>. We assume that LMX increases work engagement not only through the creation of a resourceful work environment by supervisors but also because employees are more motivated to craft job demands and resources in accordance to their needs. This study is unique in examining the association between LMX and job crafting behaviours and proposes that a high-quality relationship with supervisors foster work engagement through pro-active job crafting behaviours. It adds to the body of research examining the importance of job demands and job resources in relation to work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Demerouti &amp; Bakker, 2011)</ref> and adds new knowledge to the field by emphasising the importance of job crafting behaviours in the association between LMX and work engagement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature review</head><p>Work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kahn (1990)</ref> introduced the concept of engagement. He proposed that personal engagement represents a state in which employees 'bring in' their personal selves and are fully physically, cognitively and emotionally connected with their work roles. This means that work engagement is fundamentally a motivational concept that represents the active allocation of personal resources towards the different work tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kanfer, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rich, LePine &amp; Crawford, 2010)</ref>. Two characteristics are noteworthy in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kahn's (1990)</ref> conceptualisation of work engagement. Firstly, work engagements should refer to the employees' experience during the performance of work tasks rather than the attitude towards work conditions. Secondly, work engagement involves the investment of personal resources in work <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Christian, Garza &amp; Slaughter, 2011)</ref>. A conceptualisation of work engagement that includes both the employees' experience and the investment of personal resources is the definition proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Schaufeli, Salanova, González-Romá and Bakker (2002)</ref>. They defined work engagement as a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind that is characterised by vigour, dedication and absorption. Vigour refers to high levels of energy and mental resilience while working and the willingness to invest effort and persist, even in the face of difficulties. Dedication means that one is enthusiastic, inspired, proud, challenged and strongly involved by work. Absorption is characterised by being fully attentive, engaged and concentrated in one's work, whereby time passes quickly <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bakker, Schaufeli, Leiter &amp; Taris, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The importance of job demands and job resources in work engagement has been emphasised by the Job Demands-Resources model (JD-R; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Demerouti &amp; Bakker, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner &amp; Schaufeli, 2001)</ref>. This model categorises job characteristics into two general categories: (1) job demands and (2) job resources. Job demands refer to the physical, social or organisational aspects of the job that require sustained mental or physical effort and deplete psychological or physiological resources. Job resources are the physical, psychological social or organisational aspects of the job that are functional in achieving goals, reduce job demands and stimulate personal growth and development <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Demerouti &amp; Bakker, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Demerouti et al., 2001)</ref>. The JD-R model assumes two psychological processes that are important in the development of job-related strain and motivation: (1) a process of health impairment in which high job demands exhaust employees' mental and physical resources, which may lead to a depletion of energy resources and strain and (2) a motivational process in which high job resources foster work engagement by playing an intrinsic motivational role, fulfilling human needs, or an extrinsic motivational role, through successful task completion and satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Demerouti &amp; Bakker, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Numerous studies in various occupations and countries show that job demands are related to strain and job resources to work engagement (for a meta-analysis, see <ref type="bibr">Crawford, LePine &amp; Rich, 2010)</ref>. A study among teachers in African countries revealed that job resources such as autonomy and feedback were positively related to work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fouché, Rothmann &amp; van der Vyver, 2017)</ref> even though teachers in African countries are facing poor job conditions and high job demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Jackson, Rothmann &amp; Van de Vijver, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Willemse &amp; Deacon, 2015)</ref>. Longitudinal research also supports the positive effect of job resources on work engagement. A study among Finnish healthcare personnel revealed that higher levels of job control in 2003 were associated with higher levels of vigour, dedication, and absorption in 2005 <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Mauno, Kinnunnen &amp; Ruokolainen, 2007)</ref>, especially job resources such as autonomy and feedback have been associated with work engagement. These job resources correlated more strongly with work engagement than did job demands such as physical demands and job complexity (for a meta-analysis, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Christian et al., 2011)</ref>. For example, vigour and dedication among managers working for a platinum mine in Africa was predicted by organisational support, and not workload <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Rothmann &amp; Joubert, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leader-member exchange</head><p>The quality of relationships between supervisors and employees, often studied via the leader-member exchange <ref type="url" target="http://www.sajip.co.za">http://www.sajip.co.za</ref> Open Access theory (LMX; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995)</ref>, is another antecedent that fosters employees' work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Macey &amp; Schneider, 2008)</ref>. A central principle of LMX theory is that supervisors form differential relationships with their subordinates that range on a continuum from lower to higher quality exchanges <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bauer &amp; Green, 1996)</ref>. This relationship evolves and grows over time as supervisors and employees learn more about each other and have new and different experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Liden, Wayne &amp; Stilwell, 1993)</ref>. Low-quality relationships with supervisors are characterised by economic exchanges, mistrust, low respect, and a lack of loyalty. High-quality relationships are based on trust, respect, obligation and loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Morrow, Suzuki, Crum, Ruben &amp; Pautsch, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Employees and organisations benefit from relationships between supervisors and employees that evolve into highquality LMX. High-quality LMX has been associated with increased citizenship behaviours, performance, creativity, job satisfaction, commitment and decreased turnover intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dulebohn, Bommer, Liden, Brouer &amp; Ferris, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ilies, Nahrgang &amp; Morgeson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Martin, Guillaume, Thomas, Lee &amp; Epitropaki, 2016)</ref>. In a study among Chinese supervisors and their employees, highquality LMX facilitated creative ideas among employees to improve performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gu, Tang &amp; Jiang, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>High-quality LMX may also enhance employees' work engagement. Supervisors in high-quality LMX give their employees more of their time, more direct information, more emotional support, more intrinsic rewards such as empowerment and praise and more extrinsic rewards such as salary raise, which results in positive attitudes towards work and higher levels of work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Epitropaki &amp; Martin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Jacobs, Renard &amp; Snelgar, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sparrowe &amp; Liden, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Stander &amp; Rothmann, 2010)</ref>. Moreover, employees in a high-quality LMX are found to be more optimistic and self-efficacious, and such self-beliefs are important predictors of work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Halbesleben, 2010)</ref>. The positive association between LMX and work engagement can also be explained by social exchange theory (SET; <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Nord, 1969)</ref>. SET suggests that unspecified obligations are created by receiving favours in a state of reciprocal independence <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gouldner, 1960)</ref>. In high-quality LMX, supervisors provide intangible and tangible resources to employees. In turn, employees feel motivated to work harder to benefit the supervisor as a means of reciprocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Liden, Sparrowe &amp; Wayne, 1997)</ref> or could repay the received favours through engagement. Those employees might also feel more psychologically safe <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Carmeli, Brueller &amp; Dutton, 2009)</ref>. Psychological safety is the belief that the work environment is safe to take interpersonal risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Edmondson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kahn, 1990)</ref>. When employees 'feel able to show and employ one's self without fear of negative consequences to self-image, status, or career' <ref type="bibr">(Kahn, 1990, p. 708)</ref>, they will take more risks to express their true selves and actively engage their interest in work tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(May et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Few studies have examined the associations between LMX and work engagement. In studies among Indian managerial employees working in the service sector and Chinese luxury hotel employees, LMX was positively associated with a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agarwal et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Li et al., 2012)</ref>. A study conducted among Dutch police officers examined the mechanisms beyond this association and revealed that high-quality LMX is associated with higher levels of work engagement through higher levels of available job resources, especially developmental opportunities and social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Breevaart et al., 2015)</ref>. However, supervisors might not always be available to give their employees the job resources that they need and employees may need to mobilise their own job resources to stay engaged. Nowadays it is widely acknowledged that employees are not passive receptacles of their work environment; instead, they actively change it <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Wrzesniewski &amp; Dutton, 2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Job crafting</head><p>The central characteristic of job crafting is that employees take personal initiative to alter their tasks or other job characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Tims et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wrzesniewski and Dutton (2001)</ref> introduced the term 'job crafting' to capture the physical, cognitive and relational actions employees take to shape, mould and redefine their jobs. Job crafting is a specific form of pro-active behaviour because it is primarily aimed at improving person-job fit and work motivation by taking a self-starting approach. It focuses on how employees alter their job designs in accordance with their own preferences, values and skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Tims et al., 2012)</ref>. Job crafting is often framed in the JD-R model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Demerouti et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Demerouti &amp; Bakker, 2011)</ref>. In this context, job crafting behaviours are the changes that employees make to balance their job demands and job resources with their personal abilities and needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Tims &amp; Bakker, 2010)</ref>. Past research has distinguished four different dimensions of job crafting: (1) increasing social job resources reflects the mobilising of feedback and advice from colleagues and supervisors, (2) increasing structural job resources reflects the professional development of the employee, (3) increasing challenging job demands reflects the search for challenges and opportunities at work and (4) decreasing hindering job demands reflects employees avoiding emotional or mental job demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Tims et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Research has shown that proactively changing job resources and job demands may improve person-job fit and increase work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bakker et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bakker, Rodríguez-Muñoz &amp; Sans Vergel, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">De Beer, Tims &amp; Bakker, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Olivier &amp; Rothmann, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Petrou, Demerouti, Peeters, Schaufeli &amp; Hetland, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Tims, Bakker &amp; Derks, 2013)</ref>. A recent study examining job crafting behaviours among African employees working in the mining sector showed that increasing challenging job demands and increasing social job resources were positively associated with work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(De Beer et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>By seeking job resources, such as asking advice or asking feedback on one's performance, employees act proactively to <ref type="url" target="http://www.sajip.co.za">http://www.sajip.co.za</ref> Open Access gain specific resources. The basic tenet of the conservation of resources theory is that humans are motivated to protect their resources and acquire new resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hobfoll, 1989)</ref>. Consequently, pro-active coping can have the goal to increase job resources, which has positive outcomes for employee motivation and engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Salanova &amp; Schaufeli, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The beneficial effects of seeking job resources have been shown by a longitudinal study among Dutch employees. In this study, increasing job resources was associated with higher levels of work engagement 1 month later <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Tims et al., 2013)</ref>. Moreover, seeking resources can also be a way to mobilise more job resources to cope with job demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Tims &amp; Bakker, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Increasing challenging job demands, such as looking for new tasks at work or taking on more responsibilities, stimulates employees to develop their knowledge and skills and to attain more difficult goals (LePine, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Podsakoff &amp; LePine, 2005)</ref>. The positive emotions and attitudes associated with task accomplishment and personal growth could enhance work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Podsakoff, LePine &amp; LePine, 2007)</ref>. Indeed, research showed that seeking challenges during the day was positively associated with daily changes in work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bakker et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Decreasing hindering job demands has been suggested as a possible 'negative' side of job crafting <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Oldham &amp; Hackman, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wrzesniewski &amp; Dutton, 2001)</ref>. Behaviours aimed at minimising the emotionally, mentally or physically demanding job aspects or reducing workload and time pressure are examples of reducing job demands. The costs experienced by addressing hindering demands may be a motive for employees to reduce them <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Tims et al., 2012)</ref>. However, by decreasing hindering job demands, employees will also reduce the triggers or necessity for action and the optimal level of job challenge may decrease <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Csikszentmihalyi, 1990)</ref>. This implies that reducing hindering job demands has no beneficial effect on work engagement or could even decrease work engagement. This was exactly the finding in a study among employees who underwent change at their work, such as new tasks or technical changes. When the employee decreased their job demands, their level of work engagement decreased too <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Petrou et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research purpose and objectives</head><p>This study will examine whether high-quality relationships with supervisors foster work engagement through pro-active job crafting behaviours and is unique in examining the association between LMX and job crafting. The literature reviewed suggests that employees in high-quality relationships with supervisors feel more psychologically safe <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Carmeli et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Edmondson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kahn, 1990)</ref> and are motivated to repay the received favours by their supervisors <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gouldner, 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Liden et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Nord, 1969)</ref>. This may cause employees to be more motivated to craft their jobs and increase social and structural job resources and increase challenging job demands, which results in higher levels of work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bakker et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Petrou et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Tims et al., 2013)</ref>. They may be less motivated to decrease hindering job demands, which is negatively associated with work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Csikszentmihalyi, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Petrou et al., 2012)</ref>.

About 1000 employees were approached for participation (response rate ± 40%). The age of the participants ranged from 19 to 64 and the average age of the sample was 45.56 (SD = 10.62) years. Of the sample, 70.4% were men and 29.6% were women.

Participants worked on average 6.03 (SD = 13.14) years at their current job.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research procedure</head><p>The study announcement, along with information assuring confidentially and voluntary participation, was distributed by the directors of the departments. Employees received an e-mail with a link to the online survey and were assured that their supervisors and organisation would not know their individual responses to the survey. It took participants 10 min -15 min to complete the survey. After participants completed the survey, they were fully debriefed about the purpose of the study, and the contact details of the researcher were provided for possible questions. The data were collected in April 2015.</p></div>

The job crafting scale reflects four underlying dimensions: (1) increasing structural job resources (five items, e.g., 'I try to develop my capacities'), ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) decreasing hindering job demands (six items, e.g., 'I make sure that my work is mentally less intense'), (3) increasing social job resources (five items, e.g. 'I ask my supervisor to coach me') and ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) increasing challenging job demands (six items, e.g. 'When an interesting project comes along, I offer myself proactively as project co-worker').

A good model fit was assessed with a non-significant χ 2 -test, a χ 2 /df ratio lower than 3:1 for satisfactory fit or below 2:1 indicating excellent fit, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) values less than 0.08 suggesting acceptable fit and values less than 0.05 suggesting good fit, and a comparative fit index (CFI) above 0.90 indicating acceptable fit and above 0.95 indicating good fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kline, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Marsh, Hau &amp; Wen, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>To examine the hypothesised model, the two-step approach recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</ref> was followed.

In addition, the reliability of the questionnaires was determined using omega.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement model</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality of relationship with supervisor</head><p>The one-factor CFA revealed a good fit (χ 2 [14]= 21.08, p = 0.10; χ 2 /df ratio = 1.51; SRMR = 0.03; RMSEA = 0.04, CFI = 0.99). However, the fourth item ('Regardless of how much formal authority he or she has built into his or her position, what are the chances that your leader would use his or her power to help you solve problems in your work?') had a factor loading &lt; 0.4 on the latent construct LMX. Therefore, this item was omitted from the analysis, which resulted in an excellent model fit (χ 2 [9]= 10.72, p = 0.29; χ 2 /df ratio = 1.19; SRMR= 0.02; RMSEA = 0.02, CFI = 1.00). The scale had a good reliability (ω = 0.91).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work engagement</head><p>The CFA with the three-factor model vigour, dedication and absorption and the higher order factor engagement had a better fit (χ 2 [24] = 94.93, p &lt; 0.001; χ 2 /df ratio = 3.96; SRMR = 0.05; RMSEA = 0.09, CFI = 0.94) than a one-factor solution (χ2[27] = 171.62, p &lt; 0.001; χ 2 /df ratio = 6.36; SRMR = 0.06; RMSEA = 0.12, CFI = 0.88). Item 6 'I am proud on the work that I do (dedication)' and item 8 'I am immersed in my work (absorption)' were independently related. Therefore, a residual correlation was added between these indicators resulting in an acceptable model fit (χ 2 [23] = 72.08, p &lt; 0.001; χ 2 /df ratio = 3.13; SRMR = 0.04; RMSEA = 0.07, CFI = 0.96).</p><p>The reliability of the scale was good (vigour: ω = 0.78; dedication: ω = 0.89, absorption: ω = 0.77; and work engagement: ω = 0.91).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Job crafting</head><p>The CFA revealed an acceptable fit for the four-factor solution (χ 2 [182] = 433.84, p &lt; 0.001; χ 2 /df ratio = 2.38; SMRS = 0.07; RMSEA = 0.06, CFI = 0.88). Four items had a factor loading &lt; 0.4 and were omitted from the analysis -item 4: 'I make sure that I use my capacities to the fullest' (increasing structural job resources); item 5: 'I decide on my own how I do things' (increasing structural job resources); item 16: 'I ask colleagues for advice' (increasing social job resources </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural model</head><p>The result of the SEM analysis revealed an acceptable fit of the structural model to the data (χ 2 [504] = 1049.87, p &lt; 0.001; χ 2 /df ratio = 2.08; SMRS = 0.08; RMSEA = 0.05, CFI = 0.89). The explained variance was significant in all latent dependent variables (Increasing social job resources: R² = 0.18, p &lt; 0.001; Increasing structural job resources: R² = 0.09, p &lt; 0.001; Increasing challenging job demands: R² = 0.13, p &lt; 0.001; decreasing hindering job demands: R² = 0.06, p = 0.04; Vigour: R² = 0.79, p &lt; 0.001; Dedication; R² = 0.91, p &lt; 0.001; Absorption : R² = 0.67, p &lt; 0.001; Work engagement: R² = 0.26, p &lt; 0.001). See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref> for an overview of the structural model.</p><p>The direct effect between LMX and work engagement was significant (β = 0.02, SE = 0.00, p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, LMX was significantly associated with increasing social job resources (β = 0.32, SE = 0.05, p &lt; 0.001) and not associated with increasing structural job resources (β = 0.01, SE = 0.06, p = 0.92). LMX was positively associated with increasing challenging job demands (β = 0.16, SE = 0.07, p = 0.02) and marginally significantly associated with decreasing hindering job demands (β = -0.11, SE = 0.06, p = 0.06). Increasing social job resources (β = 0.02, SE = 0.00, p = &lt; 0.001), increasing structural job resources (β = 0.01, SE = 0.00, p &lt; 0.001), increasing challenging job demands (β = 0.47, SE = 0.06, p &lt; 0.001) and decreasing hindering job demands (β = 0.01, SE = 0.00, p &lt; 0.001) were all positively associated with work engagement.</p><p>In support of hypothesis 1, the analysis revealed a significant indirect effect between LMX, increasing social job resources and work engagement (β = 0.01, SE = 0.00, p &lt; 0.001). Hypothesis 2 was not supported because there was no significant indirect effect between LMX, increasing structural job resources and work engagement (β = 0.00, SE = 0.00, p = 0.92). The significant indirect effect between LMX, increasing challenging job demands and work engagement (β = 0.08, SE = 0.04, p &lt; 0.05) was in support of hypothesis 3. Hypothesis 4 was not supported because there was no significant indirect effect between LMX, decreasing hindering job demands and work engagement (β = -0.00, SE = 0.00, p = 0.09).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The current study examined the associations between LMX, work engagement and job crafting among employees working for a mail and parcels company. We expected that high-quality relationships with supervisors foster work engagement because it motivates employees to employ proactive job crafting behaviours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outline of the results</head><p>Our first hypothesis was supported because increasing social job resources was a significant mediator in the association between LMX and work engagement. Employees who reported a high-quality relationship with their supervisor were more inclined to craft social job resources, which made them feel more engaged in their work. This finding is consistent with the motivational process of the JD-R model in which job resources are positively related to work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Demerouti &amp; Bakker, 2011)</ref>. Although job crafting has been defined as the self-starting and pro-active approach to work and not the passive response to the work environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Tims et al., 2012)</ref>, we cannot exclude the possibility that employees were more inclined to craft their jobs because they had more available resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Liden et al., 1997)</ref>. Past research has shown that high-quality relationships with supervisors were associated with higher levels of job resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Breevaart et al., 2015)</ref> and a longitudinal study revealed that the availability of job resources was predictive of job crafting behaviours 1 month later <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Tims et al., 2013)</ref>. Future research should measure job crafting behaviours and the presence of current job demands and resources to show that job crafting is more than a reactive response to the availability of job resources.</p><p>A high-quality relationship with supervisors was not associated with job crafting behaviours aimed at increasing structural job resources. Therefore, increasing structural job resources was no significant mediator in the association between LMX and work engagement. Structural job resources reflect the employees' motivation to develop professionally and originate from 'within' the employee. These internal job resources can be distinguished from external job resources such as job control or social support that originate from 'outside' the person <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Deci, Koestner &amp; Ryan, 1999)</ref>. The results from our study suggest that a high-quality relationship with supervisors do not necessarily motivate employees to increase internal job resources. Apparently, there is more needed. Autonomy and positive feedback are important factors that increases the employees' motivation to develop from within <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Deci et al.,1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref>. Supervisors should provide both this to their employees, especially because our results replicated earlier research in which structural job resources was the strongest predictor of work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bakker et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The results supported the third hypothesis because increasing challenging job demands was a significant mediator in the association between LMX and work engagement. This result suggests that employees in high-quality relationships with their supervisors create a challenging work environment that develops their knowledge and skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(LePine et al., 2005)</ref>, which fosters enthusiasm and absorption that are characteristic of work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bakker et al., 2012)</ref>. This finding is in line with the two-dimensional work stressor framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Podsakoff et al., 2007)</ref>. This model proposes that there are two kinds of demands: hindrance demands and challenge demands. Challenge demands are 'good' demands and are associated positively with motivational outcomes at work. In contrast, hindrance demands are 'bad' demands that may initiate health impairment. Regarding the JD-R model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Demerouti &amp; Bakker, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Demerouti et al., 2001)</ref>, our findings suggest that not all job demands exhaust employees' resources and lead to a depletion of energy. Challenge job demands might even be associated with the motivational process of the JD-R model by promoting personal growth and achievement of the employee.</p><p>The fourth hypothesis did not receive support because decreasing hindering job demands was not a significant mediator in the association between LMX and work engagement. Our study showed that a high-quality LMX with a supervisor was not associated with the employees tendency to decrease hindering job demands. Perhaps it is difficult to reduce hindering job demands. Hindering job demands could be perceived as a given and not as an alterable work characteristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hakanen, Bakker &amp; Schaufeli, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Only alterables are easily changed in the short term  <ref type="url" target="http://www.sajip.co.za">http://www.sajip.co.za</ref> Open Access <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cooley &amp; Yovanoff, 1996)</ref>. If employees felt able to reduce hindering job demands, they would feel more engaged because our study revealed a positive association between reducing hindering job demands and work engagement.</p><p>When employees perceive that their demands have become too high, they stay engaged when they proactively lower their job demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Tims et al., 2012)</ref>. This suggests that decreasing hindering job demands can increase the optimal level of job challenge. It seems that, even though job crafting has a widely accepted positive role, there is also a 'negative' side of job crafting <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Oldham &amp; Hackman, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wrzesniewski &amp; Dutton, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>It is important to note that the effects of LMX and job crafting behaviours on work engagement were small, which resulted in small indirect effects too. These small effects were significant because of the small standard error in our sample.</p><p>The standard error gives a measure of how well a sample represents the population. When the sample is representative, the standard error will be small <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Field, 2013)</ref>. This means that the effects found in our sample are representative of the effects in the population, and even though the effects were small, they were statistically significant and meaningful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and recommendations</head><p>In addition to the contributions of this study to the knowledge of LMX, job crafting and work engagement, limitations of this study should be noted as well. Firstly, the most important limitation is the cross-sectional design of this study. This means that no causal inferences concerning the associations between LMX, job crafting and work engagement can be drawn. It is possible that employees who are more engaged have better relationships with their supervisors because they are more energetic and enthusiastic <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Schaufeli et al., 2002)</ref>, which in turn increases job crafting behaviours. We cannot exclude this possibility even though previous research supported the causality of the generally accepted assumption that work engagement is an outcome of job demands and job resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Demerouti &amp; Bakker, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Demerouti et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hakanen, Perhoniemi &amp; Toppinen-Tanner, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Schaufeli et al., 2009)</ref>. Another important limitation of the cross-sectional approach to mediation is the possible generation of biased estimates of longitudinal parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Maxwell &amp; Cole, 2007)</ref>. The only longitudinal study that examined one of the paths in our theoretical model is the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Tims et al. (2013)</ref>. They found a stronger effect of increasing structural job resources on work engagement than in the current study, which suggests that our study underestimated this effect. For future research, the use of longitudinal designs is recommended to examine the causality and the estimates of the hypothesised effects.</p><p>The second limitation is the lack of knowledge about the actual supervisors of the employees. Future research could relate quality of relationships rated by the employees to specific supervisors and examine the variance in the quality of relationships per supervisor. The central principle of LMX theory is that supervisors form differential relationships with their subordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bauer &amp; Green, 1996)</ref>. The focus on the quality of the relationship distinguishes LMX theory from conceptual overlapping theories such as the transformationaltransactional leadership theory, which focuses on characteristics of the supervisor <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bass, 1991)</ref>. This theory posits that transactional supervisors get things done by rewarding employees who do well and penalising employees who do not do good work. In contrast, the transformational supervisor is charismatic and inspiring, intellectually stimulates employees and pays high attention to individual differences among employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bass, 1991)</ref>. It has been argued that transformational supervisors build and nourish highquality LMX <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Wang, Law, Hackett, Wang &amp; Chen, 2005)</ref>. This would mean that some supervisors will have more highquality relationships with their employees than other supervisors. However, according to LMX theory, there still would be a considerable variance in quality of relationships among the subordinates. Future research could examine the quality of relationships between and within supervisors to disentangle LMX theory from transformational-transactional leadership theories.</p><p>The third limitation involves the construct validity of the measures used. Even though we used validated measures to examine LMX, job crafting and work engagement, the CFAs revealed that items had to be omitted from the questionnaires measuring LMX and job crafting. Our results showed that measuring LMX with six items is preferred above the original seven-item questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Liden &amp; Graen, 1980)</ref>. Four items with a factor loading &lt; 0.4 were removed from the job crafting scale. Three of the four items, except item 18, also had the lowest factor loading in the originally developed scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Tims et al., 2012)</ref>. Future research should examine the construct validity of the questionnaires used and create shorter questionnaires when necessary.</p><p>The fourth limitation concerns the specific sample of highly educated employees working for a mail and parcels company. This raises the question to what extent the results can be generalised to other populations with, for instance, lower education levels, especially because education level has been argued to be positively correlated with opportunities for job crafting <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Tims et al., 2012)</ref>. It is important to note that education level was controlled for in the data analysis.</p><p>Because our sample was relatively heterogeneous with employees working for different departments with different professions, we believe that our main findings are not unique to this sample. Still, it would be interesting for future research to employ samples from other contexts to broaden the knowledge about LMX, job crafting and work engagement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and practical implications</head><p>Findings from this study suggest a crucial role for supervisors in fostering work engagement. Supervisors who support subordinates and give them direction and information increase willingness among subordinates to dedicate efforts, go beyond job descriptions, take a self-starting approach to <ref type="url" target="http://www.sajip.co.za">http://www.sajip.co.za</ref> Open Access work and alter their jobs in accordance with their own preferences, values and skills. The increased fit between job characteristics and the characteristics of the employee increase absorption in one's work, concentration, attentiveness, enthusiasm and involvement. It increases work engagement.</p><p>These findings show that supervisors have unique opportunities to positively influence employee behaviour. Supervisors could be more effective when they are aware of the importance of employees' reciprocity expectations and the relational requirements of a high-quality relationship, such as personal development and social bounding <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Wang et al., 2005)</ref>. The quality of exchanges between supervisors and employees could be improved through training of the supervisors. Research has shown that the quality of the relationship between supervisor and employee increases when supervisors trained their active listening skills and exchanged mutual expectations and resources with their employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Graen, Novak &amp; Sommerkamp, 1982)</ref>. It is also important that supervisors give their employees autonomy and positive feedback. Research suggests that positive feedback and autonomy enhance the motivation of the employee to develop from 'within' <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Deci et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref>. Autonomy is also a necessary precondition for job crafting to take place <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Leana, Appelbaum &amp; Shevchuk, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Petrou et al., 2012)</ref> and an important predictor of work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Demerouti &amp; Bakker, 2011)</ref>. In sum, supervisors who are capable of building high-quality relationships with their employees and who are aware of the importance of employee bounding, positive feedback and autonomy have the possibility to increase job crafting behaviours and foster work engagement.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>H1:</head><label></label><figDesc>Increasing social job resources mediates the association between LMX and work engagement H2: Increasing structural job resources mediates the association between LMX and work engagement H3: Increasing challenging job demands mediates the association between LMX and work engagement H4: Decreasing hindering job demands mediates the association between LMX and work engagement</figDesc></figure>
