<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The contribution of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is well known, but their cumulative negative contributions to the environment and the welfare of society are of concern to policy makers across the world. Extant literature reveals that SMEs are little engaged with corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices, owing to focusing on other priorities such as intense competition, increasingly demanding customers, and challenging supplier management <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Lawrence et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lee et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Dey et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Unlike larger firms, SMEs are rarely involved in CSR activities due to their lower visibility and weak financial resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Jenkins, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lee et al., 2015)</ref>. SMEs' approach to CSR is rather informal and lacks a systematic strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Lee et al., 2015)</ref> and many SMEs have neither a budget nor a department dedicated to CSR <ref type="bibr">(Pastrana and Sriramesh, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lee et al., 2015)</ref>. SMEs' managers often perceive that CSR practices are cost intensive and have no direct positive impact on their organizational performance <ref type="bibr">(Dey et al. 2020a)</ref>. Therefore, most SMEs' managers and owners believe that they should adopt CSR practices only under pressure from regulatory bodies or customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Gadenne et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tang and Tang, 2012)</ref>. The present study challenges these beliefs by positing and demonstrating that CSR practices might translate into CSR outcomes for SMEs and asserts that the relationship between CSR practices and firms' performance is not straightforward <ref type="bibr">(Gond et al, 2018)</ref>. Indeed, there are multiple underlying approaches and factors that need to be clarified for an in-depth understanding of the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Lai et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Farooq et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Extant literature on the business factors influencing the association between CSR and SME performance has showed the relevance of examining the moderating roles of several organizational variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Torugsa et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Arend, 2014)</ref> and institutional factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Jamali and Neville, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Yin and Zhang, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grimstad et al., 2020)</ref>. While extant literature has pointed out that such an association cannot be straightforward, it remains that it is characterized by (1) divergent and highly aggregated findings with regard to the role played by stakeholders' pressures and (2) omission of the role played by another critical factor, that is, business uncertainty. The latter is particularly essential for understanding the entire decision context in which CSR is practiced. It is argued that -potentially false perceptions managers have about uncertainty‖ affect their organization's decisions and actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Schmid and Kotulla, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Helm and Gritsch, 2014)</ref>, because the business environment is hard to comprehend and evaluate. Given that uncertainty conveys doubt, it is likely to affect managerial actions as well as the outcomes of such actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(McMullen and Shepherd, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Helm and Gritsch, 2014)</ref>. One can posit that managers' perceptions of uncertainty are likely to influence both the CSR practices and their consequences in terms of organizational performance.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there has been no study on the relationships of -CSR antecedents-CSR practices-SME performance‖ in light of the effects of both business uncertainty and stakeholders' pressures as moderators. Moreover, the majority of studies on CSR was often dedicated to either the relationship between CSR and its antecedents (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Banerjee et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grimstad et al., 2020)</ref> or the relationship between CSR and ‗aspects' of a firm's performance (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Luo and Bhattacharya, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lai et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Perrini and Russo, 2011)</ref>. Furthermore, the limited number of studies that looked simultaneously at both the relationships has shortcomings. These studies have one or several of the following four limitations: (1) they considered the drivers as antecedents to CSR practices and omitted the impediments (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Torugsa et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Arend, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Govindan et al., 2021)</ref>;</p><p>(2) they were restricted to only a part of the organizational context (i.e., the supply chain setting only) (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Jean et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Govindan et al., 2021)</ref> they were limited to one performance dimension or only a few, instead of all the performance dimensions <ref type="bibr">(Tang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Torugsa et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Jean et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Govindan et al., 2021)</ref>; (4) they focused on large firms to the detriment of SMEs (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Tang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Jean et al, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Govindan et al., 2021)</ref>. In addition, these studies omitted the key role of such moderating variables as business uncertainty.</p><p>To bridge the gap, the present study contributes a realistic and holistic framework to support the view that pro-CSR attitudes and beliefs might translate to responsible conscious behaviour, and, in turn, CSR practices may well translate to performance outcomes for SMEs. The study is even more relevant as the extent research on CSR practices mainly focused on developed countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Zhang and Zhu, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Worthington et al., 2006)</ref>. Although CSR was initiated and fostered by Western businesses, its understanding and practices are contingent on the institutional environment of countries all over the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Fifka and Pobizhan, 2014)</ref>. For the commentators, the limited CSR studies that have been set in emerging economies countries highlight that country differences (e.g. geographic, political, and economic settings) trigger variations in the understanding of CSR practices and their assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Griesse, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Zhu et al., 2016)</ref>. Accordingly, this study investigates whether: 1) the extent of importance SMEs place on CSR antecedents influences their involvement with CSR practices? (Study Objective One); 2) SMEs involvement with CSR practices influences their organizational performance? (Study Objective Two); and 3) the relationships of tryptic of ‗CSR antecedents-CSR practices-SME performance' could be moderated by stakeholders' pressure and /or business uncertainty (Study Objective Three).</p><p>The present study contribution to CSR literature is fourfold. First, it concurrently investigates the underlying mechanisms by which CSR antecedents translate to CSR behaviors, and those by which these behaviors in turn translate to performance outcomes; which helps in preventing from implementing a partial perspective of CSR implementation in SMEs. Indeed, a few researchers cautioned against the drawbacks of studies considering only the effects of CSR practices on performance without including CSR drivers and impediments. These studies are limited by the fact that they would result in an incomplete picture of the phenomena and even inconsistent findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Jean et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Second, this study contributes to contingency research by considering the impact of business uncertainty, which is an omitted factor in CSR research. More interestingly, this study examines this factor in conjunction with stakeholders' pressures. The latter has been considered in a number of CSR studies but never in conjunction with business uncertainty. Therefore, this study aims to show that CSR research adopting stakeholders' theory may gain from combining their theoretical approach with a contingency perspective.</p><p>Third, this study responds to suggestions by several authors to deploying a multidimensional construct for capturing organizational performance. Extant studies on CSR have seldom rarely considered the effects of CSR on the overall performance. Instead, researchers often voluntarilyor because of methodological issues -have focused on specific aspects of performance and neglected others. Therefore, by deploying a multidimensional construct of performance, the present study captures the potential outcomes of CSR practices in terms of broader dimensions of organizational performance. This research is also distinguished by integrating CSR management control tools with CSR initiatives to measure the construct of CSR practices.</p><p>Fourth, the study is expected to contribute to the discussion on the investigation of SMEs' practices in emerging countries such as the UAE. This is even more opportune, because no study has so far dealt with any questions related to CSR in UAE. UAE offers an interesting national context for study because its CSR practices are shaped by not only its specific regulatory and normative settings but also the diverse cultures and backgrounds of employees within the same organization and the rapid growth of the SMEs sector <ref type="bibr">(Al Hadhrami, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The study is presented in five sections. Section 2 presents the literature review and development of hypotheses, followed by methodology in section 3. Section 4 presents the findings and section 5 discusses the results. Section 6 presents conclusions, including implications for theory and practice, the limitations of the study, and suggestions for further research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Background</head><p>There has been a drive, in Western developed countries, for governments to engage with SMEs on the topics of CSR and the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Castka et al., 2004)</ref>. The justification is that the SMEs combined have a major impact on the environment and society and are often well placed to engage with communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Castka et al., 2004)</ref>. Literature report findings of several studies investigate CSR practices in European SMEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Gelbmann, 2010)</ref>; however, these are criticized to be neither conclusive nor convergent <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Lee et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) explored CSR among SMEs in emerging economies countries, and noted that this is shifting toward Western-style CSR through the companies' measurement and management of their environmental and social impact <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Raynard and Forstater, 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ciliberti et al. (2008)</ref> investigated the obstacles to integrating CSR in SMEs in developing countries and found several issues, such as lack of knowledge on legislation and laws, cultural differences, little interest from companies, poor communication, and corruption.</p><p>Regardless of the national setting, some SMEs have been quick to adopt environmental measures because of market opportunities to increase profits <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Masurel, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pastrana and Sriramesh, 2013)</ref>, while others do so because of legislation requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Gadenne et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lee et al., 2015)</ref>. Researchers are increasingly concluding that the greatest motivational factor for CSR practices is external pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Lawrence et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tang and</ref><ref type="bibr">Tang, 2012, Pastranaa and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Sriramesh, 2014)</ref>. Not only SMEs may not have an environmental policy or socially aware annual reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Williamson and Lynch-Wood, 2001)</ref>, but also they are often portrayed as being unaware of the benefits of CSR practices in terms of performance enhancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ciliberti et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gadenne et al., 2009)</ref>. SMEs, unlike large corporations, also often practice CSR informally <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Murillo and Lozano, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gelbmann, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Studies on CSR practices of SMEs in emerging countries are limited. Hitherto, no studies appear to have examined simultaneously the multiple facets of CSR (antecedents, practices, and outcomes) in light of SMEs' responses to business uncertainty and stakeholders' pressures.</p><p>Knowledge on this topic is particularly important because the extended value chains of several firms in Western countries are now integrated with SMEs in emerging economies countries. The rapid progress in technology and infrastructure in emerging countries such as the UAE also present an opportunity to implement best societal and environmental performance practices to sustain the organizational performance of SMEs. Furthermore, recent internationally legally binding societal and environmental targets, such as enhancing employees' well-being and reducing GHG, have increased the importance of CSR agendas in tandem with economic performance for SMEs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Hypotheses Development</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CSR antecedents and CSR practices</head><p>There is lack of empirical evidence to support the assumption that pro-social and environmental attitudes and beliefs may translate into socially and environmentally conscious behaviour. This is in part because only few studies have focused simultaneously on the drivers and outcomes of CSR initiatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Jean et al., 2016)</ref>. Scholars contend that CSR practices are conditioned by both motives for and impediments to CSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Muller and Kolk, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Zhu and Zhang, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Zhu et al, 2016)</ref>. Antecedents of CSR may or may not persuade companies to implement CSR practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Balzarova and Castka, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Surroca et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Madueno et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The review of literature shows three main philosophical approaches to antecedents of CSR.</p><p>First, CSR may be connected to a purely altruistic aspiration of the firm to be a good citizen (moral philosophy or the normative perspective of CSR) <ref type="bibr">(Jenkin, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lee, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Perry and Towers, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aguinis and Glavas, 2012)</ref>. Second, CSR may be linked to an economic profitmaximization approach (the business case or utilitarim philosophy) <ref type="bibr">(Jenkin, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Perry and Towers, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aguinis and Glavas, 2012)</ref>. Third, there has been recently a shift to reconciling strategic management goals (e.g. stakeholder management and legitimacy) with moral considerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Lee, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Perry and Towers, 2009)</ref>. This shift has been qualified as the -enlightened self-interest‖ perspective (for an extensive review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lee, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>On one hand, the extant literature points out several impediments to CSR within SMEs. It is increasingly admitted that SMEs are barely keen to get involved in CSR activities because of the lower visibility of such activities and smaller financial and human resources in comparison to large firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Jenkins, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lee et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pastrana and Sriramesh, 2013)</ref>. In addition, recent literature has revealed that SMEs often do not have a systematic strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Jenkins, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lee et al., 2015)</ref> nor even integrate CSR into their master budget <ref type="bibr">(Pastrana and Sriramesh, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lee et al., 2015)</ref>. In developing countries, it is reported that SMEs mainly deploy CSR practices for philanthropic reasons. Amongst the most frequently encountered barriers for implementing CSR within SMEs, authors highlight the lack of knowledge on legislation and laws, lack of awareness about the benefits of CSR, and the struggle of firms to consider CSR as a business priority <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ciliberti et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gadenne et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gelbmann, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tang and Tang, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Scholars have emphasized several CSR drivers, in particular top management leadership and values <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Waldman et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Duarte, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016)</ref>. Such drivers are increasingly recognized as motivating CSR practices by large firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Waldman et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Duarte, 2010)</ref> and non-large firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Jenkins, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016)</ref>. Researchers concluded that intrinsic drivers are more powerful than extrinsic ones in shaping SMEs' CSR practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Lee et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grimstad et al., 2020)</ref>. It is suggested that a key driving factor for SMEs to engage in CSR is directors' motivation to -do the right thing or to put something back into the society‖ <ref type="bibr">(Jenkins, 2004, p. 6)</ref>.</p><p>The perceptions of the top management/owners about reputation outcomes expected from deploying CSR activities are likely to influence the extent and type of such activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hemingway and Maclagan, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pastranaa and Sriramesh, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lee et al., 2015)</ref>. It is argued that when It comes to adoption of CSR practices and reports, decision makers are motivated by improving a company's image <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bhatia, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pastranaa and Sriramesh, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>On the basis of the above, hypothesis 1 can be proposed: H1. CSR antecedents contribute positively to the extent of CSR Practices in the surveyed SMEs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CSR practices and organizational performance</head><p>This study responds to call from several authors to adopt a multidimensional framework for the characterization of organizational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Kirby, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Neely, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Richard et al, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The latter is defined as a set of both financial and non-financial, internal and external indicators capable of measuring the extent to which organizational goals have been accomplished <ref type="bibr">(Kaplan and Norton, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Singh et al., 2016)</ref>. As such, the research on CSR needs to tap on the multifacets of CSR outcomes <ref type="bibr">(Marín et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Reverte et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>A key question for researchers and practitioners in CSR remains -does it pay to behave responsibly?‖ <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ambec and Lanoie, 2008)</ref>. Past literature concurs that companies can improve competitiveness and financial performance through their CSR efforts <ref type="bibr">(Tang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Madueno et al., 2016)</ref>. Empirical evidence suggests that the implementation of CSR practices is positively associated with firm performance among enterprises in both developed and developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Li et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Rodgers et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hou, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr">, Kim et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Crifo et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Jean et al. (2016)</ref> concluded that CSR in the supply chain positively influences customer satisfaction in both Chinese and Taiwanese institutional contexts and, thus, suggested that in all institutional contexts CSR matters in improving customer satisfaction.</p><p>Interestingly, the results portrayed in empirical studies seem to converge with the findings of a number of review papers. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aguinis and Glavas (2012)</ref> asserts that sustainable development has fairly positive nonfinancial consequences at the institutional, organizational, and individual level. In the same vein, Perrini and Russo (2011) review 250 contributions using stakeholder-based approaches and show that CSR activities may impact revenue and cost related performance outcomes through.</p><p>The literature review in the present study reveals four conclusions. First, while some academics affirm the existence of a positive association of CSR especially with financial performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Flammer, 2015)</ref>, several authors call for caution in accepting this assertion. Some critics highlighted that the CSR-performance relationship is either partial <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Prado-Lorenzo et al., 2008)</ref> or curvilinear <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Barnett and Salomon, 2006)</ref>; while some others denounced the failure to agree on measures of a firm's performance, the divergences in defining CSR, and the existence of measurement errors in empirical studies <ref type="bibr">(Linnenluecke and Griffiths, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Lueg and Radlach, 2016)</ref>. Interestingly, a small number of authors emphasized that the size of the positive relationship between CSR and financial performance has diminished over the past few years <ref type="bibr">(Margolis et al., 2009)</ref>. According to these authors, this could be either an objective observation or a consequence of deploying more appropriate research methods.</p><p>Second, while several studies have highlighted that it does pay to be green <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Zhu and Sarkis, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Albertini, 2013)</ref> and socially responsible <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Li et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Reverte et al., 2016)</ref>, others contend that in creating corporate performance the type of initiative <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Vachon and Klassen, 2008)</ref> does matter. For instance, for Colombian managers, the most important initiatives are the development and adoption of charities and not-for profit causes, the employee welfare and training; and the least important is corporate volunteering (Pastranaa and Sriramesh, 2014).</p><p>Interestingly, although these managers engage in some activities much more than others, they believe that the most activities engaged in are not necessarily the most beneficial ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Vachon and Klassen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pastranaa and Sriramesh, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Third, our literature review shows that academics often examined the effects of CSR practices on only one or a few dimensions of SMEs' organizational performance. Some dimensions also attracted wider interest than others. In particular, past literature has focused on financial performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cegarra-Navarro et al., 2016)</ref>, customer satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Jean et al., 2016)</ref>, and corporate reputation and image <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kucukusta et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Zhu et al, 2016)</ref>.

The contingency literature, for instance, contends that social and environmental actions are considered by managers in response to stakeholders' pressures (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Henri and Journeault 2010)</ref>. Moreover, the legitimacy theory argues that managers tend to implement managerial changes, and communicate them, to satisfy powerful stakeholders through various methods<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> . Such pressure is said to have motivated the implementation of environmental and social practices <ref type="bibr">(Schaltegger and</ref><ref type="bibr">Burritt 2000, Pondeville et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abdel-Maksoud et al., 2020)</ref>. This can be explained as a result of managers' tendency to implement managerial changes, and communicate them, to satisfy influential stakeholders <ref type="bibr">(Deegan et al. 2002, Islam and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Deegan 2010)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Islam and Deegan (2010)</ref> claimed that organizations tend to distance themselves from suppliers who are proved to be violators of community social and environmental expectations.</p><p>Interestingly, the same view is supported in environmental disclosure literature (see, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Moneva and Llena, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>However, prior literature is scarce on studies addressing the stakeholders' pressures influence on managers decision to implement CSR practices, with few past empirical studies reported a significant positive association between stakeholders' pressures and the adoption of environmental and social responsibility practices (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Doran and</ref><ref type="bibr">Ryan 2012, Pondeville et al., 2013)</ref>.

In particular, suppliers and customers as stakeholders play significant roles in the sustainability of an enterprise For example, buyers increasingly focus on the CSR practices of SMEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Baden et al., 2009)</ref>. Similar to large firms, SMEs appear to be pressurized often by customers and suppliers and thus direct their CSR responses to these stakeholders. However, unlike large firms, SMEs appear to largely heed to the government (Pastranaa and Sriramesh, 2013) and pay less attention to shareholders and employees. This is consistent with <ref type="bibr">Lee et al. (2016)</ref>, who suggested in their literature review that, compared with large corporations, SMEs perceive themselves as mainly responsible to a few and/or different stakeholders rather than several of them and to the local community rather than the overall society.</p><p>Interestingly, CSR literature is said to be scarce on empirical studies investigating how stakeholders' pressures could influence the relationship between CSR antecedents and CSR practices in SMEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Helmig et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adebanjo et al., 2016)</ref>. Previous empirical studies, in CSR literature, have focused on a stakeholder approach in examining CSR in SMEs across the world 3 . However, these studies are said to have fallen within the scope of descriptive stakeholder theory 4 , which called for more empirical studies to consider investigating how stakeholders pressures could influence management's tendency to implement relevant environmental and 3 For more details, the reader can refer to: <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Longo et al.

Accordingly, in our study, we address this gap in literature and investigate whether stakeholders' pressures could moderate the relationship between CSR antecedents and CSR practices in SMEs. By testing for moderation, we investigate whether the hypothesized direct positive relationship between level of importance SMEs place on CSR antecedents and the extent of their involvement in CSR practices (i.e. H1) changes as a function of stakeholders' pressures. The third hypothesis posed is:</p><p>H3: Stakeholders pressures moderates the relationship between CSR antecedents and CSR practices within SMEs.</p></div>

The majority of the studies that explored perceived business uncertainty concluded that it hinders a firm's performance, regardless of whether the firm is large or an SME.

More closely to <ref type="bibr">CSR, Wu (2013)</ref> shows that demand uncertainty positively moderates the association between green supply chain and green innovation.

This study posits that environmental management can be considered as a separate dimension of CSR practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Zhu and Zhang, 2015)</ref>, and thus treats it as a distinct construct.</p><p>To ensure data relevance, the sample consisted of SME owners or managers. It was verified that they all had sufficient information about the deployment of MCS and CSR initiatives.

The construct included 16 items classified into five categories: financial, operational, market, learning, and network performance. The aim was to represent SMEs' performance without neglecting dimensions that might be affected by CSR initiatives. Respondents were asked to assess their organization's performance on these 16 items.</p><p>A Likert scale was used (ranging from 1: -very poor‖ to 5: -very high‖).

Such a methodology allows for explanations of the possible causal relationships derived from the conceptual model and simultaneous analysis of the relationships of different proxies on the dependent measure(s).

Based on the results of the SEM empirical model presented earlier, the study aimed at testing if the research hypotheses H1-H5 of section 2.2 are verified by the analysis results of the collected SMEs' data.</p><p>To start with, the results fully verified research hypothesis H1 that poses the positive effect of CSR antecedents on SME CSR practices (H1: β = 0.851). The positive and statistically significant associations of CSR practices with the antecedents, which have been observed in the present study, are adding to some previous works and verify their findings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Muller and Kolk, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Zhu et al., 2016)</ref>. In particular, the study results showed that for the case of the SEM fitted model (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>), CSR Motives and Beliefs translate indeed to CSR practices in SMEs.</p><p>Moreover, the impediments are negligible as contributors of the antecedents' factors, which implies that there is no other cause that could reduce or stop CSR practices from being implemented in SMEs in UAE than the specific factors examined in this study. Our findings are partly in agreement with some studies on SMEs , highlighting the need to consider the extensive role of personal values and ethics of SMEs' managers and owners in the diffusion of CSR practices (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lee et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grimstad et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the research hypothesis H2, the findings point toward the high positive effect of CSR practices on organizational performance (comprising the aspects of financial, operational, market, learning, and network performance; hypothesis H2: β = 0.983). The results are in accordance with a growing body of research, which suggests that SMEs may improve their organizational performance through CSR practices (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Tang and Tang, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Madueno et al., 2016)</ref>. Interestingly, the present study reveals a more significant positive effect than demonstrated by the extant research conducted in developing countries. The underlying reasons could be attributed to legislation requirements or other external pressures <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Lawrence et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lee et al., 2015)</ref> or voluntary efforts by SMEs to increase their market opportunities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Masurel, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>However, this finding is contradicting those of several studies on SME which find that managers do not perceive CSR practices as positively influencing their performance <ref type="bibr">(Tang and Tang, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gadenne et al., 2009)</ref>. In addition, this study suggests that this strong positive association may be also attributed to specific country characteristics, such as the emerging UAE infrastructure or the recently adopted international social and environmental targets on standards that UAE SMEs should conform to.</p><p>The most important subconstruct for nonenvironmental CSR practices is ‗Actions and initiatives' in comparison to ‗Management control tool' highlighting that SMEs emphasize more on the implementation of CSR initiatives and on infrastructure than on control. On the other hand, UAE SMEs give equal weight to both subconstructs of environmental CSR practices, that is, ‗Management control tools' and ‗Usage' (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Finally, observing the subconstructs of the SMEs organizational performance factor, it is obvious that most emphasis is given on the aspects of ‗operational' and ‗learning' performance. This indicates that SMEs in UAE should focus on improving these aspects of organizational performance to enhance their overall performance.</p><p>The model testing also revealed a negative direct effect of Business Uncertainty on Organizational Performance, since the outcome of our analysis showed a negative coefficient (beta coefficient = -0.246). This finding of a negative effect of business uncertainty on SME performance is consistent with a few research findings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Schmid and Kotulla, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Helm and Gritsch, 2014)</ref>. With regard to the subconstructs of uncertainty and their effects on the overall Uncertainty factor, the fitted model showed that the uncertainty regarding access to finance is the less important factor for UAE SMEs, which is unsurprising because of the good and steady progress of UAE key banking indicators and lending market (refer to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). On the other hand, uncertainties associated with business technology and workforce recruiting appeared to have a higher impact on SMEs. This reflects empirical observations that hiring employees is a key HR challenge in the UAE due to the unclear role played by recruitment agencies and a high turnover rate (Hays' 2017 Report, -The DNA of an HR Leader‖).</p><p>Next, considering hypothesis H3, the study results tend to reject the hypothesis of the effect of stakeholders' pressures (considered as a moderator) on the positive association between CSR antecedents and CSR practices of SMEs. Indeed, the results based on the moderation test showed nonsignificant effects (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). In other words, the direct positive association between CSR antecedents and CSR practices, verified in H1 above, is not influenced by stakeholders' pressure.</p><p>We recall here that only a few empirical studies investigated how stakeholders' pressures could influence the relationship between CSR antecedents and CSR practices in SMEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Helmig et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adebanjo et al., 2016)</ref>. Our finding regarding H3 differs from those studies in showing a non-significant effect played by stakeholders pressures. This finding could implicate the need for further emphasis -by policy makers in Abu Dhabi -on implementation of CSR practices in SMEs operating in the Emirate. Further empirical studies will definitely help in recognising various ways stakeholders' pressure could influence SMEs management's tendency to implement such practices -for instance imposing more voluntary or compulsory regulations.</p><p>Regarding H4, a positive statistical significant effect of the moderator of business uncertainty on the relation between CSR antecedents and CSR practices was derived from the moderation test for indirect effects (H4: β = 0.512; p-value &lt; 0.05). These results confirm and extend the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Lo (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Vachon and Hajmohammad (2016)</ref>, who have found that business uncertainty positively affects particular types of environmental practices. We extend those findings to nonenvironmental (social and ethical) CSR practices as well.</p><p>Finally, the research hypothesis H5 cannot be rejected because business uncertainty was found to be a statistically significant moderator of the association between CSR practices and organizational performance in UAE SMEs (H5: β = 0.28; p-value &lt; 0.1). Interestingly, even in the context of an uncertain environment, CSR practices by SMEs can provide performance outcomes. We argue that in an uncertain environment, socially and environmentally proactive firms may have a better chance of detecting and mitigating problems, that would have been either hidden or less relevant in a stable business environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Martin-Tapia et al., 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>The research investigates empirically the concurrent effect of CSR antecedents on CSR practices and that of CSR practices on organizational performance of SMEs in an emerging economy, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The study contributes further and investigates the influence that two key variables, namely stakeholders' pressures and business uncertainties, could excerpt, as moderators, on such relationships.</p><p>The findings provide empirical evidence on positive relationships between CSR antecedents and CSR practices, on the one hand, and CSR practices and SMEs performance, on the other.</p><p>Interestingly, business uncertainty is proved to positively moderate both the relationship between CSR practices and SMEs' performance in UAE and the relationship between CSR antecedents and CSR practices. At the opposite, stakeholders' pressures do not affect the association between CSR antecedents and CSR practices.</p><p>The study findings contribute significantly to both literature and practice. The contributions made by the study to literature are fivefold: first, the simultaneous investigation of the relationship between CSR and its antecedents <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Banerjee et al., 2003)</ref> and the relationship between CSR and firm's performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Lai et al., 2010)</ref> has allowed an integrative analysis not considered hitherto in the literature. The study findings provide conclusive empirical evidence that CSR attitudes and beliefs (i.e., antecedents) translate to responsible behaviours (CSR practices) <ref type="bibr">(Grimstad et al., 2020)</ref> which in turn, translate to multiple positive performance outcomes.</p><p>Second, the study provides empirical evidence of the influence that business uncertainty exerts, as a moderator, on the relationship between CSR practices and SMEs performance. The relationships of the tryptic of -CSR antecedents-CSR practices-organizational performance‖ were found to be contingent on the extent of Business Uncertainty faced by the SMEs.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Williams and Zinkin, 2010)</ref>. This could explain the importance of the motives for CSR compared to the impediments to CSR.</p><p>Fifth, this study contributes to both contingency research and stakeholders theory. By considering the roles played by business uncertainty in conjunction with stakeholders' pressures, this study showed that CSR research adopting stakeholders theory may gain from combining their theoretical approach with a contingency perspective. No previous study has concurrently examined their effects in the CSR literature.</p><p>The study findings also provide practical implications, which are expected to enhance the awareness among SMEs' managers and government officials regarding the importance of considering business uncertainty in shaping CSR practices and organizational performance.</p><p>This finding shall also contribute to the practice, particularly in emphasizing the paths through which CSR beliefs and motives as well as CSR initiatives and management control translate to performance improvements. Moreover, studying CSR antecedents (motives and impediments) is essential for policymakers should they aim to foster the diffusion of CSR practices <ref type="bibr">(Grimstad et al., 2020)</ref>. If motives for CSR dominate its impediments, then policymakers should implement institutional reforms that focus on further improving the positive perceptions of leaders towards CSR rather than addressing barriers to CSR. At the opposite, if leaders perceive that impediments to CSR bypass its motives, then policymakers should be cautious in providing further economic support and instead focus on addressing operational difficulties encountered by SMEs.</p><p>Although the findings of the study are relevant for SMEs in the UAE only, the method for studying correlation among CSR antecedents, CSR practices, business uncertainties, external pressures, and organizational performances are applicable for any region and country. Therefore, this could be adopted anywhere across the globe to adopt CSR practices and objectively determining its impact in order to enhance organizational performance.</p><p>This study has its limitations. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1illustrates the conceptual model.</figDesc></figure>

In Abu Dhabi, a rich oil and gas Emirate, the study shows that SMEs succeed in deriving substantial performance outcomes from deploying CSR practices. It is known that SMEs in the UAE have much higher gross margin than in many developed countries. This is due to adopting high selling prices while incurring cheap labor costs and almost no taxes. Therefore, the investments costs in CSR appear to be absorbed by the high premiums of products and services. This high premium charged by SMEs can also explain why even under high business uncertainty, SMEs continue to get benefit from investing in CSR. Another characteristic of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi is that the ownership and top management of SMEs is frequently reserved to local Emirati investors. Emirati investors are often guided by Islamic values that cherish charity, morality and environment preservation</figDesc><table><row><cell>this study has clarified how CSR practices contribute to alleviate the overall performance of</cell></row><row><cell>a firm.</cell></row><row><cell>Third, the study is distinguished by developing a valid and reliable scale for measuring each of</cell></row><row><cell>CSR practices and organizational performance; in that: (1) the construct of CSR practices</cell></row><row><cell>integrates both CSR initiatives and CSR management control tools, and (2) the construct of</cell></row><row><cell>organizational performance is multidimensional encompassing financial, operational,</cell></row><row><cell>market, learning, and network facets.
