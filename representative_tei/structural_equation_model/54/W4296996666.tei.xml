<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Green entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) refers to individuals' conviction that they can contribute to solving environmental issues and shows self-assurance in their efforts to protect the environment. The present investigation attempts to determine the role of employees' green ESE in the green innovation (GI) of SMEs. It is also proposed that GI positively impacts organizational environmental, economic, and social performance. This study also evaluates the mediating role of GI and moderating role of the green knowledge-sharing culture. This study tested the hypothesis using a partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) by applying smart PLS software. A total of 289 employees from SMEs in China were targeted for data collection. The results confirmed that green ESE positively impacts GI. Additionally, the findings verified that GI positively enhances firms' environmental, economic, and social performance. The results validate the mediating role of GI. The moderating results revealed that green knowledge-sharing culture does not play a moderating role in proposed relationships. This study serves the existing body of literature by providing empirical evidence on the significance of green ESE. The study outcomes highlighted the bridging role of employees' green ESE for firms' GI. The results also offer companies a road map for how staff members' green ESE might help the businesses to improve their performance in terms of the environment, economy, and society.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>There are many varying definitions of green entrepreneurship, however, according to the most cited one green entrepreneurship is "the creation of new green enterprise" <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Arenal et al., 2020)</ref>. Given the challenges posed by climate change, there has been immense awareness about green entrepreneurship, however, there are not enough concrete actions to stop or even slow down the process of climate change. The calls for green entrepreneurship in the age of economic development are gaining weight forcing the public and private sectors to establish agencies to pave way for green entrepreneurship. Studies have attempted to find out the characteristics and personal traits to know if they have any role to play in the promotion of green entrepreneurship, however, there has not been any significant breakthrough in this regard that can help carve a prediction model <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Prodanova et al., 2021)</ref>. Nevertheless, a study found that self-efficacy is one of the factors that can have a positive association with an inclination toward green entrepreneurship. Safeguarding the climate and taking the green route is a state of mind that encourages green thinking in entrepreneurs. The purpose of green entrepreneurship is to establish the trend of different entrepreneurship ideas and their positive outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Arenal et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Self-efficacy has been associated with green entrepreneurship and it can be defined as the belief of a person about his/her entrepreneurial capabilities to achieve growth targets while at the same time considering the safety of the environment, moreover, this is also about the belief of the entrepreneur that their economic ventures can be part of a good change. Studies found a correlation between self-efficacy and starting new ventures as self-efficacy promotes positive thoughts that are pivotal to the success of business startups <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Rivai et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Prodanova et al., 2021)</ref>. Few constructs were developed by a study such as green marketing, innovation, management, risk-taking, and financial control skills. The study contended that risk-taking and innovation were the constructs that were basic cognitive capabilities that led to entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Pushkarskaya et al., 2021)</ref>. A study concluded that a high level of self-efficacy was positively associated with overcoming business hurdles. Moreover, in a relevant study self-efficacy was found to be a highly important factor in the success of setting up a new business. Self-efficacy is termed as an enabling factor in recognizing the opportunity of an entrepreneurial startup. A study concluded that self-efficacy had positive influences vis-a-vis entrepreneurial intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Morsy, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Degradation of the environment has been recognized as one of the biggest existential threats to the survival of humanity <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Zhang and Ma (2021)</ref>. The calls for protecting the environment are blaring loud and green innovation (GI) is trending as it is considered highly significant for environmental protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Yang et al., 2017)</ref>. The issue environmental degradation, for instance, has been serious in northern China that includes area such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei. The cluster of small and medium sized enterprises have endangered the environment in this part of China. Therefore, civic agencies have been trying to protect the climate while at the same time ensuring economic advance as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ge and Lin, 2021)</ref>. Importantly, this Chinese environmental dilemma underlines the purpose of this study.</p><p>Both at the community and the organizational level, the awareness regarding environmental protection is on the rise, however, there is also this deep realization that along with the environment economic growth is also important. To strike this balance GI initiatives become even more important. Organizations with regard to GI enjoy a competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kawai et al., 2018)</ref> since GI is trending, it attracts concerned people and puts one in an advantageous position. According to Schumpeter's Theory of Innovation GI does help protect the environment that respects the expectations of the customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gürlek and Tuna, 2018)</ref>. Therefore, GI can be defined as the process of achieving economic growth with an aim of protecting the environment from degradation and avoiding resource exploitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Castellacci and Lie, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Alshebami, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Innovation is of two types: product/service innovation and innovation of process. The ultimate goal of innovation is to improve the product or service while maintaining a profitable outlook. Therefore, the aim is to welcome innovation that brings cost efficiency and organizational flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(El-Kassar and Singh, 2019)</ref>. Cost efficiency and organizational flexibility entail numerous benefits for an organization such as competitive advantage, cutting down the use of hazardous products, efficient use of resources, innovating eco-friendly practices, introducing eco-friendly products/services, boosting good economic performance, encouraging recycling, mitigating pollution, and conservation of energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Burki and Dahlstrom, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Huang and Li, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">El-Kassar and Singh, 2019)</ref>. As it is obvious how GI can help organizations and communities improve and gain sustainable advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Chu et al., 2019)</ref>. However, there are quite a few obstacles in the way of an innovation to take place in an organizational setup up. The success of GI depends on knowledge sharing, acceptance of green methods, enforcement of environmental regulations, the commitment of senior management, and incorporation of green corporate culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Burki and Dahlstrom, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Chu et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are numerous challenges in the way implementation of GI innovations such as environmental hazards that ironically come with green technologies, risk of failure in the implementation process, expensive research, and development process, and issues with collection of reliable data, job dissatisfaction among employees, lack of funds, organizations not willing to take risks, not having the appropriate understanding of green initiatives, and lack of governmental support <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abbas and Saðsan, 2019)</ref>. There is no dearth of studies examining the relation between GI and performance. However, no study has examined the joint effect of GI, ESE, and knowledge sharing. However, it is important to note that some studies do acknowledge a positive relationship between environmental protection practices and knowledge sharing. Knowledge sharing is defined as the flow of knowledge from one unit, individual, or possessor to another. Keeping Guo 10. <ref type="bibr">3389/fpsyg.2022.1001867</ref> this definition in view the process of knowledge sharing in an organizational setting deeply influences the performance of all the different segments or units of an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kushnina et al., 2022)</ref>. Knowledge sharing has always been considered tremendously important for improvement, and betterment, however, the concept has mostly been examined and studied through the lens of individual progress. Nevertheless, now the importance of knowledge sharing has increased manyfold since it has been considered pivotal for advanced managerial applications and organizational theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Zhang et al., 2018)</ref>. Now the idea that knowledge sharing is tremendously urgent and important for performance has an empirical foundation <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Weidenfeld et al., 2010)</ref>. Despite the fact that many studies have been conducted in the domain of green entrepreneurship but literature gap still exists to be filled when it comes to examining the roles and relationships of green ESE, GI, firm performance, and knowledge sharing in a single study. The objective of this study is to establish a framework to study the roles and relationships of the above-mentioned variables simultaneously. The study aims to explore answers to the following research questions:</p><p>How does green ESE affect GI? How GI influences the sustainable performance of the organization? What role is played by GI between green ESE and the environmental, economic, and social performance of the organization? What role is played by green knowledge-sharing culture between green ESE and GI? After an extensive review of available relevant literature, it was found that no study has been done until now to investigate these research questions. Thus, from the available literature, the current study firstly assumes that green ESE positively impacts GI. Secondly, it is assumed that GI positively impacts environmental performance, economic performance, and social performance of the organization. Thirdly the study assumes the mediating role of GI between green ESE and environmental, economic, and social performance. Fourthly, it assumes that green knowledge-sharing culture moderates the association between green ESE and GI.</p><p>The study contributes to the research in the following potential ways: First, the study provides an extensive and comprehensive and systematic overview of the concepts of GI, green ESE, firm performance, and knowledge sharing from the previous research studies. To the best of the author's knowledge, only a few studies have been done on linking these variables in green entrepreneurship and green management. Secondly, this research contributes through its innovative and unique framework of the study, which proposes, and analyzes the relationships and moderator and mediator roles of the variables of this study. Thirdly, the study contributes by adding green knowledge sharing culture into the integrated analytical framework that studies the relationship between green ESE, GI, and organizational performance. The framework of this study explains the theoretical perspective in an innovative way. The study also has theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it extends the literature on resource-based view (RBV) theory while practically it offers guidelines for the stakeholders of green entrepreneurship.</p><p>The remaining part of the current study is outlined as follows: section "Literature review and hypotheses development" of this research study presented the overview of available literature on GI, knowledge sharing, and green selfefficacy, and green performance. Applied methods and analysis have been portrayed in section "Research methodology." Section "Results" presented statistical interpretation and empirical results. In the end, the discussion, conclusion, and theoretical and practical implications have been summarized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature review and hypotheses development Theoretical support and background</head><p>There are multiple methods to view and gauge the advantage and performance of a firm, however, according to the theory of RBV, it depends on how a firm utilized its strategic resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Barney, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jayasinghe et al., 2022)</ref>. The competitive advantage rest on the nature of the strategic resources. For instance, if the available resources are not imitable and rival firms do not have any means to carve up alternative resources of the same value and function then the competitive advantage will be long-lasting yielding superior performance in the shape of achieving targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bhandari et al., 2022)</ref>. This research argues that self-efficacy, green knowledge and employees are the strategic resources as we apply theory of RBV to ESE. The study contends that these resources fulfill the criteria of theory of RBV by enabling higher performance and competitive advantage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Green entrepreneurial self-efficacy and green innovation</head><p>Self-efficacy is referred to as one's belief in his/her abilities to achieve the expected outcomes using skills and resources. A study found that self-efficacy was a crucial prerequisite for achieving pro-social behavior. Subsequently, the same was found true for entrepreneurial behavior as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Pong et al., 2005)</ref>. Now as far as the matter of measurement of selfefficacy is concerned it depends on the problem as well as the field involved. Therefore, self-efficacy with regard to green entrepreneurship refers to one's belief about his/her abilities and confidence to solve the issue of environmental degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chu et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Though green entrepreneurship is emerging, however, it is starkly different from ordinary entrepreneurship because Guo 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1001867 of two particular aspects. Firstly, its dependence on the green market as well green consumer base is what separates it from ordinary entrepreneurship <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Lotfi et al., 2018)</ref>. The second aspect is that of policy orientation on which green entrepreneurship depends heavily. As green entrepreneurship tends to have greater environmental and social responsibilities, and simultaneously has to handle the issue of a longer payback period as well, therefore, encouraging policy regimes is highly important for green entrepreneurship encouragement <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chu et al., 2021)</ref>. The requirements in sense of responsibility are high in the case of green entrepreneurship as compared to ordinary entrepreneurship since there is not only the issue of economic requirements that need to be considered but an additional requirement of social and environmental responsibilities must also be taken care of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aghelie (2017)</ref>.</p><p>Value choices in green entrepreneurship matter the most and these value choices are determined by an individual's perspective about their attachment and relationship with not only the environment but also with society as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Yang et al., 2017)</ref>. Ecological guidelines steer one's relationship with the environment. There are two important aspects of the current ecological value research. Firstly, there are structural dimensions of ecological values and there are different opinions regarding the nature of these dimensions such as believed that these values were monodimensional and contrarily contend that these values were multidimensional <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dunlap et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Amburgey and Thoman, 2012)</ref>. The second aspect is about the factors that affect the ecological values. And there is an array of different factors ranging from demography to literacy rate, from social background to gender, etc. that shape an individual's ecological values <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Mac Lennan et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Apart from ecological values, the sense of social responsibility is another dimension that is highly crucial in green entrepreneurship. A study aptly put it that green entrepreneurship is a behavior that has multiple targets and this behavior operates in an uncertain environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Riillo, 2017)</ref>. Multiple-target implies that environmental responsibilities and entrepreneurial responsibilities are fulfilled simultaneously. Therefore, the social mission of the people at the helm is given the central position while formulating a conceptual model of green entrepreneurship <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Afsar et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Those entrepreneurs who have environmental ambitions embedded in their sense of social responsibility tend to vigorously pursue their business goals and not give up in the wake of challenges. The intensity and vigor of the green entrepreneurship intentions strongly depend on the green ESE and entrepreneurship abilities of the intention holders <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Alvarez-Risco et al., 2021)</ref>. The adaption and improvement of green products and the green process are at the core of GI. It is also included the technologies that aim at conservation and protection of the environment by consuming less energy, spreading less pollution and adopting green design regimes <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Yang et al., 2017)</ref>. Since across the board acceptability toward GI, the idea has attracted increased attention as it ensures a winwin situation that guarantees better, sustainable environmental protection as well as advancement in innovation, and progress.</p><p>H1: Green entrepreneurial self-efficacy positively impacts green innovation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Green innovation and its impact on organizational performance</head><p>The vision of a firm for sustainability crucially rests upon the role of the entrepreneurs who lead firms. The impact of entrepreneurial orientation and ESE are the two factors that have been heavily focused on by different studies that examined the factors behind sustainable performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Marshall et al., 2005)</ref>. Recently, the focus of the research has shifted to the entrepreneurial attributes that are found in a firm along with the urge for innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Wagner, 2011)</ref>. As the fate of competitive advantage more and more rests on green entrepreneurship, modern research tends to tilt toward shifting its focus on the link between entrepreneurship attributes of a firm and its environment-friendly business models. One such study examined the impact of readiness of the firms with regards to corporate entrepreneurship on its financial performance. The study found that the impact of corporate entrepreneurship significantly impacted financial as well as environmental performance. Another study revealed that green entrepreneurship was followed by positive growth in the financial development of the firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Wagner, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>A firm's bid to go beyond societal expectations in meeting its environmental responsibilities shapes its environmental performance indicators It is not only about compliance with governmental regulations, however, but it also encompasses environmental effects that the operations of a firm cast <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Dubey et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Oliva et al., 2019)</ref>. The agenda of a firm regarding environmental management highlights the extent of GI in a particular firm. GI is at the helm while it provides the stimulation for environmental performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adegbile et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, green processes, and innovation not only mitigate the negative impact on the environment but also enhances both the financial and social performances of a firm as cost-effective measure are adopted as a result of GI <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Weng et al., 2015)</ref>. Therefore, studies have argued that GI better not be termed as a reactive measure of the firms in the wake of outside regulatory pressure rather it should be considered as the voluntary innovative behavior of the firm founded on the basis of achieving competitive advantage over competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kratzer et al., 2017)</ref>. Therefore, considering RVB, the study predicts that green entrepreneurship is considered a highly valued resource by firms that have serious potential to help Guo 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1001867 a firm achieve their environmental targets and good repute <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dragomir, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The competitive advantage of a firm depends on its valuable organizational resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Barney, 1991)</ref>. From the RVB theory's perspective incorporating environmental aspects to the goals of an entrepreneurial venture strategic resources of a firm get a consolidated result in competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lannelongue et al., 2017)</ref>. Moreover, a deeper environmental management orientation places a firm in a better position to develop unique resources as compared to the firms that engage themselves superficially to the environmental cause. Studies revealed that comprehensive and holistic environmental protection policies enable firms to achieve better economic prospects <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Swalehe et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Chu et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>A deep sense of social responsibility lies at the bottom of green entrepreneurship intentions. The extent of a sense of social responsibility determines the level of commitment of an entrepreneur toward his/her green business goals. As there could be multiple challenges down the corporate road and this sense of social responsibility enables the entrepreneurs to stick to their green entrepreneurship intentions and not make a compromise in protecting the environment. Firms with environmental management outlook tend to have a close relationship with other stakeholders such as the government, environmental organizations and the target community. This closer relationship reduces the cost of risk management for the firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gürlek and Tuna, 2018)</ref>. Moreover, well-designed and innovative products cost low but have a higher value. This particular aspect enables firms to utilize their resources optimally and become even more competitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kawai et al., 2018)</ref>. Furthermore, socially responsible firms enjoy the trust of banks, financial institutions and investors which ultimately gives much-needed financial breathing space to the firms to expand both vertically and horizontally <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aghelie, 2017)</ref>. Better environmental management of the firms can also prove to be beneficial for the social image of the firm. Employees can have enhanced identification toward such a firm which translates into better prospects for the firm to both attract and retain talent and solve the problem of high labor costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Weng et al., 2015)</ref>. Studies show that green products and processes positively affect the competitive advantage of entrepreneurial ventures <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chen et al., 2021)</ref>. H2: Green innovation positively impacts environmental performance.</p><p>H3: Green innovation positively impacts economic performance.</p><p>H4: Green innovation positively impacts social performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Green innovation as a mediator between green entrepreneurial self-efficacy and environmental performance</head><p>Organizations having implemented green innovativeness tend to have a higher success rate. The overall performance of such organizations is also better than their competitors because of their readiness to adapt to the needs of their customers. This readiness adds value to the organization resultantly <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Chen et al., 2015a)</ref>. Moreover, the firms which have a genuine commitment to environmental protection seem to do well both environmentally and economically. Furthermore, green initiatives of a firm allow it to develop its products in a better way that positively affects the green developmental culture of the business <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Weng et al., 2015)</ref>. Moreover, green ESE is also found to provide impetus to the cause of environmental awareness, promote the green performance of the firm and increase green creativity. Though there has been evidence that green self-efficacy influences GI, however, the aspect of handling the regulatory pressure while having green environmental intentions still needs to be empirically supported by further studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Jia et al., 2018)</ref>. It is further suggested by multiple studies that to continue for a firm to execute its green operation green recruitment standards need to be adopted to ensure that fresh employees share the same environmental commitment as the firm itself and there is no discrepancy as far as environmental goals of a team of people are concerned <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dragomir, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The importance of having a clear vision regarding the current and future trajectory of the firm is paramount for green entrepreneurs since the nature of the market is mostly dynamic and a clear vision help navigate amidst challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dragomir, 2020)</ref>. The onus of responsibility for having a concrete and clearer vision rests on the leaders of entrepreneurial ventures, additionally, studies recommend that the concrete vision, and trajectory course should be explicitly elaborated to the entire team so that they can know the importance of the vision and be excited about achieving green targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Chen et al., 2015a)</ref>. The same study suggests that such a shared vision enables higher motivation, commitment, and better performance. Studies have shown that leaders having a favorable belief system at the core of their intellect regarding green entrepreneurship positively influences the overall operations of the firm from a better performance at all levels to talent and resource management <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Jia et al., 2018)</ref>.This is a compounding process during which GI leads to a further increase in green efficiency of the firm enhancing environmental commitment further <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Afsar et al., 2018)</ref>. Therefore, green ESE is shown to have a key role in carving out a clear vision, recruiting employees in accordance with the vision of the Guo 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1001867 leader, striving for GI, and adapting to the green policies and practices to get as close to the stated goals as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Jia et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>H5: Green innovation mediated the relationship between green entrepreneurial self-efficacy and environmental performance H6: Green innovation mediated the relationship between green entrepreneurial self-efficacy and economic performance.</p><p>H7: Green innovation mediated the relationship between green entrepreneurial self-efficacy and social performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Green knowledge sharing culture as a moderator between green entrepreneurial self-efficacy and green innovation</head><p>The process of innovation heavily depends on the knowledge pool of employees at both collective and individual levels. Furthermore, the utilization of the available knowledge is also key to the process of innovation. Moreover, employees' skills and experience in creating value in a system are also one of the main key aspects of the process of innovation. Keeping these aspects in view, the extent of knowledge sharing in a firm determines how innovative that firm can be with its ideas, policies and products/services <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(de Sousa et al., 2020)</ref>. As the process of innovation heavily depends on knowledge, therefore, the willingness, and capabilities of the employees to better share and manage the flow of knowledge determine how well-positioned an organization is to achieve its organizational goals in terms of innovation. The process of innovation required employees to utilize both explicit and implicit knowledge at hand. Therefore, the culture of knowledge sharing in a firm determines how innovative and efficient that particular firm is <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Peng, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The culture of environmental management in an organization is formed by the basic characteristics of the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fauji and Utami, 2013)</ref>. The vision of sustainability of a firm determines how the firm uses technology and manages its knowledge. The motivation for ecological improvement emanates from the culture of knowledge sharing with the subsequent counterparts. This leads to enhanced cooperation among all stakeholders and efficient attainment of the strategic vision of green entrepreneurship. Furthermore, knowledge sharing is considered the fundamental aspect of any firm's success and prosperity <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rodgers et al., 2017)</ref> A study by examined the relationship between innovation of the firm, financial and operational performance, and knowledge sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Wang and Wang, 2012)</ref>. The study concluded that tactic knowledge sharing was positively linked with both the financial as well as the operational performance of an organization. However, as far as explicit knowledge sharing was concerned it was found to have a positive link only with the financial performance of the firm. The same study contended that the speed of innovation had a positive impact on both financial and operational performance, whereas, the results of the quality of innovation were different from the speed of the innovation as it only impacted the financial performance of the firm positively and did not show any considerable positive link with the operational performance of the firm.</p><p>Another study examined the impact of knowledge sharing in the realm of joint ventures. The study concluded that knowledge sharing was a significantly key factor in the performance of entrepreneurial ventures. Furthermore, the same study also highlighted how the process of knowledge sharing eliminated drawbacks that obstruct the flow of knowledge particularly in joint ventures. A rather recent study examined the association among different factors such as knowledge sharing innovation, environmental management, and product/service quality <ref type="bibr">(Hamdoun et al., 2018)</ref>. This study also concluded that the practice of environmental management was positively associated with knowledge sharing. Furthermore, it also came to for that there was a positive link between knowledge sharing and GI. The research framework of this study is given in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Independent variable</head><p>Green entrepreneurial self-efficacy is an independent construct of the present study, measured through a three items scale. The scale was particularly designed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hockerts (2017)</ref> and then adapted and used in the context of green ESE by <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Wang et al. (2021)</ref>. The sample item included, "I believe that if I do it with my heart, I can contribute to the environment (see Appendix A)." Its Cronbach alpha value is 0.899.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediator variable</head><p>The green innovation construct is taken in this study as a mediator and measured with seven items scale Research model.</p><p>adapted from Chen et al. ( <ref type="formula">2006</ref>) and validated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Singh et al. (2020)</ref>. Four items were related to green product innovation, and three were related to green process innovation. The sample item included for green product innovation was "My company uses materials that produce the least pollution, " for green process, innovation was, "The manufacturing processes of my company effectively reduce hazardous substance or waste." The Cronbach alpha value is 0.897.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dependent variable</head><p>The sustainable performance was a dependent construct of the present study, which was measured on fifteen items scale including three performances such as environmental, economic, and social. Each performance has five items. This scale is taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Khan and Quaddus (2015)</ref>. This scale was also validated by <ref type="bibr">Iqbal et al. (2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Iqbal et al. ( , 2020))</ref>. The sample item included for environmental performance was "My organization uses utilities (e.g., energy and water) in an environmentally friendly manner, " for economic performance was "Economic Performance of my organization is at an acceptable level in terms of sales growth, " and for social performance was "My organization enhances your social recognition in the society." The Cronbach alpha value of environmental, economic, and social performance was 0.922, 0.898, and 0.883, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderator variable</head><p>The present study uses the green knowledge-sharing culture as a moderator construct. This construct was measured based on a five items scale adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Wong, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Rubel et al., 2021)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p>China is facing a severe threat of environmental problems. The China Northern district is called as Bohai Bay economic circle. This district includes Beijing, Tianjing, and Hebei Province. Hence, due to the large scale of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in this district, China is facing high pollution in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Zeng et al., 2011)</ref>. Undoubtedly, SMEs have significantly played a role in social and economic development, but unfortunately, they also created severe environmental problems. Hence, the present study targeted the manufacturing sector of SMEs for data collection for empirical analyses of green self-efficacy and its impact on sustainable performance. The present study randomly selected 50 SMEs and contacted them through email and phone. The reminder email was also sent to get permission from all SMEs after 1 week. But most of them did not give a positive response. Hence, the present study approached those SMEs who positively responded and agreed to corporate in our research work data collection. Upon the permission of seventeen SMEs managers, the author visited personally and distributed 450 questionnaires among employees. In addition, the surveys were translated into two languages: English and Chinese. A native Chinese speaker performed the translation. A panel of senior researchers approved the final questionnaires before they were used in the datagathering process. A letter explaining the purpose of the research was delivered to the participants along with the Guo 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1001867 detail of their data privacy and usage. The participants were also confident about the right or wrong answers. This step boosted their confidence and helped in gathering natural responses. Out of 450 responses, the present study received 328 questionnaires from the participants. After scrutinizing the verified missing and incomplete filling of the questionnaires, the present study finalized the 289 complete and valid responses for conducting empirical analyses. The response rate of the present study is 64.22% confirming that a good response such as, according to the prior study, 35.5% response was considered satisfactory for empirical analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Baruch and Holtom, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Statistical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hair et al. (2019)</ref> point out that structural equation modeling (SEM) is one of the most suitable statistical methods for data analysis. Covariance-based (CB-SEM) and variancebased partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) are the two main methods of SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. PLS-SEM was used in this investigation to analyze the data statistically. The main justification for this choice is PLS-SEM's applicability to confirmatory and exploratory investigations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hair et al., 2016)</ref>. With no explicit requirements for data normality, PLS-SEM is a suitable method for complicated and multi-order models. PLS-SEM is also appropriate for analyzing small data sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bashir et al., 2021)</ref>. Therefore, the PLS-SEM approach is taken into account in the current study while utilizing Smart PLS software to analyze empirical data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model measurement</head><p>The model's reliability is validated by using the values of Cronbach's alpha, roh-A, composite reliability (CR), and average variance extract (AVE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. According to the threshold level set by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hair et al. (2011)</ref>, the values for Cronbach's alpha, roh-A, CR, and AVE should be greater or equal to 0.7. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> depicts that all values meet the necessary standards. The AVE values are used to determine the convergent validity of constructs. The acceptable criterion for AVE is that the values must fulfill the set standard, which is 0.5 or above. The AVE values are bigger than 0.5, as seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. Therefore, the convergence validity of the variables is thus established.</p><p>Each item's outer loading value is considered to weigh the constructs' reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hair et al., 2013)</ref>. Values must be greater than or equal to 0.7 to meet the threshold for factor loading. According to Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, all outer loading values are in accordance with the threshold level (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The VIF results are analyzed to confirm the model's collinearity. The model is deemed to be free of collinearity issues if the VIF values are smaller than 0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hair et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bashir et al., 2021)</ref>. According to information depicted in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, the maximum VIF value is (GESE-3) 3.369, meaning that all values are below 0.5. Thus, it is demonstrated that the model has no collinearity problems.</p><p>The validity of the constructs was assessed in this study using the heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratios and the Fornell-Larcker criterion. By finding the square roots of the AVE values for the model constructs, the Fornell-Larcker criterion is established <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hair et al., 2016)</ref>. The data satisfy the Fornell-Larcker criterion if the first value on each column's upper side is greater than the values on its bottom side. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> reveals that all Fornell-Larcker criteria values meet the predetermined standards. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hair et al. (2019)</ref> note that in order to confirm the specifications of HTMT ratios, all values of HTMT must be smaller than 0. 85. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>'s findings reveal that the constructs' HTMT values are smaller than 0.85, which suggests that the model used for the current analysis has demonstrated discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>According to the evaluation of the R square values, latent variable values more than or near 0.5 indicate the model's moderate strength, while values closer to 0.25 indicate its weak strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hair et al., 2019)</ref>. The Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> describes the R 2 value for GI (0.230) shows weak model strength, while the R 2 values for ENVRP (0.397), ECNOP (0.577), and SP (0.446) show moderate model strengths. Cross-validated redundancy (Q 2 ) values for the model are deemed significant if they are more than zero <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. This study's latent variables all had Q 2 values greater than zero, which is another encouraging sign of a robust model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural model evaluation</head><p>The bootstrapping technique with 5,000 samples is utilized to conduct the empirical analysis for this study. In the present study, the focus was given to the statistical "t" and "p" values for accepting and rejecting hypotheses. Table <ref type="table">5</ref> displays the results for direct connections. The findings of the first hypothesis (t = 7.011, p = 0.000) certified that green ESE positively impacts GI. The path value informed that green ESE caused 0.312 variations in GI. The H1 is accepted on the basis of statistics described in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. The results of H2 (t = 8.046, p = 0.000) verified that GI positively impacts environmental performance, which authenticates that H2 is accepted. The beta value of H2 is 0.630. The outcomes of the third hypothesis  show that (t = 12.987, p = 0.000) GI enhances economic performance. The H3 is accepted with a path value of 0.760. According to results Table <ref type="table">5</ref> (t = 8.150, p = 0.000), H4 is accepted, which confirms that GI positively impacts social performance.

For empirical investigation of moderating role of green knowledge-sharing culture, this study proposed that green knowledge-sharing culture positively moderates the association between green ESE and GI. However, the findings of H8 t statistics (5.787), and p statistics (0.000) with a negative path value (-0.327) revealed that green knowledge-sharing culture does not moderate the association between green ESE and GI. Therefore, H8 is rejected. The moderation slope is given in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p></div>

Based on resource-based review theory, this study aims to determine the importance of employees' green ESE for firms' environmental, economic, and social performance. The current investigation also evaluates the mediating role of GI and the moderating role of green knowledge-sharing culture. This study proposed eight hypotheses to test the relationships empirically. According to the first hypothesis, green ESE positively impacts GI. The second, third, and fourth hypotheses stated that GI positively relates to environmental, economic, and social performance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>The theoretical implications of this study introduce an advancement in the theoretical framework itself. The study advances and validates RBV <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Barney, 1991)</ref> with the assistance of an empirical explanation of why entrepreneurial ventures take the route of GI recognizing the bigger environmental scenario and still successfully carrying out financial operations. The study based on its empirical results suggests that green ESE be considered as the strategic resource that can help firms design, implement green policies, and practices. Furthermore, we suggest, while applying RVB, in the light of the results of this study that green ESE, as well as green knowledge, should be treated as valuable resources so that they may not be imitated by competitors to gain strategic advantage. It is further suggested by this study that green practices have to be innovated to the extent that they can attract green employees who later can be trained and retained by ensuring that all the units in the firm remain strictly aware of the green goals and entrepreneurial significance of those goals. This study also reveals the mediating and moderating roles of knowledge sharing and GI.</p><p>Our study suggests that to examine the environmental performance of an entrepreneurial venture, the nature of the green process, and the quality of GI are the key factors. Therefore, it is suggested that both these factors are to be implemented not under pressure from the stakeholders, but rather in a proactive manner to aim at the strategic goal of maintaining competitive advantage while at the same time protecting the environment as well. Innovation is suggested as an intangible asset that can bring the aforementioned competitive advantage and enhance the performance of the company <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gürlek and Tuna, 2018)</ref>. Therefore, GI also works on the same principles with all the potential to create prospects for a firm. Furthermore, it is suggested that innovation be systematically improved to cut the production cost and make the products/services efficient and costeffective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Although the present study serves the literature in multiple ways by providing a unique body of knowledge; however, there are still some limitations. These limitations may provide opportunities and directions to future researchers. First, this study assumes the employees' green ESE as an antecedent of GI and firms' environmental, economic, and social performance. In the future, researchers may use other antecedents like green entrepreneurial motivation and green entrepreneurial intentions. Second, this study determines the role of green ESE on organizational environmental, economic, and social performance; future studies may research the impact of employees' green ESE on firms' energy efficiency. Third, the current study assesses the moderating role of green knowledge-sharing culture in the correlation between green ESE and GI. Future studies may consider entrepreneurial orientation as a moderator to validate the study results. Fourth, the current study's findings were only inferred from 289 employees' replies, which is a small sample size. This model can eventually be validated using large comparative data. Finally, the structured questionnaire approach was utilized in this study to gather data; however, other data collection methods, such as interview techniques, may be used in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The employees' characteristics of ESE are seen to be important among the managerial characteristics of the company. Self-efficacy of employees as green entrepreneurs helps companies to develop creative corporate environments, strengthen relationships with stakeholders, support important company goals, and overcome environmental challenges. This study aims to investigate the influence of green ESE on GI using the RBV theory. This study further proposed that GI positively affects firms' environmental, economic, and social performance. The present investigation also evaluates the mediating role of GI and moderating role of the green knowledge-sharing culture. The results illustrated that green ESE positively correlates with GI. The results demonstrated a strong correlation between GI and an organization's performance in terms of the environment, economy, and society. The findings show that GI is a mediator between green ESE and environmental, economic, and social performance. The results also showed that the relationship between GI and green ESE does not moderate by green knowledge-sharing culture. This investigation revealed the importance of employees' green ESE for firms' GI.</p><p>The results also assist firms in boosting their employees' green ESE to improve their environmental, economic, and social performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>FIGURE 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>FIGURE 2Path model.</figDesc><graphic coords="10,70.30,102.92,452.88,301.84" type="bitmap" /></figure>
