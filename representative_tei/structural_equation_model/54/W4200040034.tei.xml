<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This research was carried out to determine the effect of instructional leadership and creative teaching as the main aspects in maximizing student input and potential, in order to achieve learning satisfaction and self-actualization for the educational success of students. The research examines the effect of principal instructional leadership and teaching creativity on self-actualization and its impact on student satisfaction. Across sectional study was used to determine the relationship between exogenous and endogenous variables. Respondents were 307 students on Madrasah Aliyah and Al-Kamal Kebumen Islamic Vocational High Schools, Indonesia. Data was collected using a questionnaire consisting of 4 indicators representing each variable. The research data was analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) with the AMOS application. Out of 5 proposed hypotheses, 1 was rejected because of not fulfilling the Critical Ratio (CR) value &gt; 1.96 and the p-value &lt;0.05 criteria. The results showed that this model fulfilled the Goodness of Fit requirements in SEM analysis. It was evident that principal's instructional leadership and creative teaching affects student learning satisfaction. The results also showed that the principal's instructional leadership affects student self-actualization, while creative teaching has no direct effect unless it is mediated by learning satisfaction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Education is a planned effort to create a meaningful climate and learning process for students to develop self-potential, knowledge, attitudes, and skills. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Maslow (1971)</ref>, self-actualization is the highest level of human development where one's full potential is realized. Education is one of the best ways of achieving self-actualization. Students with self-actualization optimize their abilities to work beyond expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akcay &amp; Akyol, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Farimani &amp; Shahri, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Neto, 2015)</ref>. Therefore, selfactualization is an achievement towards students' understanding of their full potential and this stage is only achievable when schools maintain quality education. The main factor in realizing student self-actualization success is to maximize existing inputs by providing optimal services to create quality outcomes. This also improves student satisfaction, which is an indicator of the educational institution's quality and potential development. Several research results showed that student satisfaction is an effective method of monitoring the quality of education and academic development <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Razinkina et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kammur, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Letcher &amp; Neves (2010)</ref> stated that student satisfaction affects one's self-confidence to develop skills, gain knowledge and achievement, and build pleasant relationships with friends and teachers.</p><p>Individuals satisfied with the surrounding environment develops self-actualization abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Arslan, 2017)</ref>. Self-satisfaction created by fulfilling four basic needs, including physiological, security, love, and appreciation, triggers self-actualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Maslow, 1971)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jena and Dorji (2016)</ref>, job satisfaction also contributes to selfactualization. Efforts to fulfill self-satisfaction mean striving to realize self-actualization. Therefore, when students are satisfied with the learning process, they grow their ability to self-actualize. Achieving student satisfaction and self-actualization requires external motivation and support from parents, school principals, teachers, and peers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jena and Dorji (2016)</ref> stated that teaching wholeheartedly helps students achieve selfactualization through creative and meaningful learning. Furthermore, the principal facilitate quality learning processes for student satisfaction and self-actualization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tuan (2012)</ref> stated that optimal service from school principals impacted student learning satisfaction extensively. Instructional leadership is an intermediary factor in school management that impacts student learning satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arif et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kammur, 2017)</ref>. Moreover, this form of leadership contributes to teacher professionalism and student achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Liu &amp; Hallinger, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Heaven &amp; Bourne, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hallinger, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Instructional leadership is has an influence on various factors that affect student learning satisfaction, such as (a) the formation of a pleasant learning climate in schools <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Clifford et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sahney, 2016)</ref>, (b) improving the quality of cooperation, and communication between schools, teachers, students and parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Halverson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Park, 2012)</ref>, and (c) student discipline <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gulcan, 2001)</ref>. This influence is in line with by the results of other studies which conclude that instructional leadership contributes to the main aspects of learning satisfaction, performance and student achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Heaven &amp; Bourne, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sahney, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mitchell &amp; Tschannen-moran, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Shatzer, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bartlett, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Moffitt, 2007)</ref>. On the other hand, teachers' professionalism and pedagogical abilities are also closely related to student learning satisfaction. Teachers International Journal of <ref type="bibr">Instruction, January 2022 • Vol.15, No.1</ref> that carry out creative teaching have the ability to create an innovative and fun learning environment for students, which triggers learning satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kangas et al. (2017)</ref> stated that learning satisfaction depends on teachers involvement and creativity in teaching. Teachers with the ability to creatively and effectively inspire, motivate and simulate children's learning development are proven to be more able to influence learning satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adhikary, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hemsley-Brown et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rivero, 2002)</ref>. This research examined the effects of principal instructional leadership and creative teaching towards student self-actualization mediated by learning satisfaction. Existing research analyzed the relationship between the learning process and students' selfactualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Farimani &amp; Shahri 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aljaser, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Velieva et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dmitrienko et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Neto 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Wadaani 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Akcay &amp; Akyol, 2012)</ref>. However, realizing students' self-actualization is also the principal's responsibility as the school leader and manager. Therefore, these results can be a reference for principals, teachers, practitioners, and educational officers in developing self-actualization in students.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instructional leadership</head><p>Instructional leadership refers to the principal's ability to manage the curriculum and learning to ensure effectiveness and success of the overall educational process.The focus is on involving teachers in curriculum preparation, strategies, and assessment processes to improve the learning quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Horng &amp; Loeb, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lunenbrug, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Marks &amp; Printy, 2003)</ref>. Instructional leadership has three aspects, including mission communication, which ensures teachers and staff work based on the school's objective. Furthermore, instructional program management, which includes evaluation, curriculum coordination, and monitoring student progress. The last aspect of instruction leadership is cultivating a positive school climate through teachers' professional development, incentive provision and motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hallinger, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hallinger, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Blase and Blase (2000)</ref> stated that effective instructional leadership has two factors, including communicating with teachers to deepen learning reflection and facilitating professional development. These factors improve teacher performance and professionalism inside and outside the classroom. The principal's instructional leadership contributes to competence quality and teacher performance because of good planning and learning management. This leadership also affects teacher professionalism and job satisfaction, influencing the student's effectiveness and achievements <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Liu &amp; Hallinger, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Boyce &amp; Bowers, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Liu et al., 2020)</ref>. Additionally, instructional leadership influences various students' aspects, including the effective learning environment, cooperation, communication and discipline <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Clifford et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sahney, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Park, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Halverson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gulcan, 2001)</ref>. Therefore, the principal's instructional leadership is closely related to student achievements and learning satisfaction. This is in line with the research <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Heaven &amp; Bourne, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sahney, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mitchell &amp; Tschannen-moran, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Shatzer, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bartlett, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Moffitt, 2007)</ref> which stated that instructional leadership contributes to learning performance and student achievement. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Creative teaching</head><p>Creative teaching help students learn new material and practically apply it to life situations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mayer (1989)</ref> stated that learning material provides meaning, heterogeneous abilities, learning methods that stimulate student's creativity, and appropriate learning evaluations to measure student creativity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Horng et al. (2005)</ref> reported that learning creativity is influenced by teacher personality, family support, educational experience, belief, hard work, motivation, and school management conditions. Creative teaching is highly influenced by the leadership and management characteristics of school principals. Schools' leadership strategy affects teachers' creativity performance and commitment. Furthermore, the principal's leadership determines school infrastructure development and a work climate that supports teacher creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cachia et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Selkrig &amp; Keamy, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>There are several characteristics of creative teaching namely collaboration, improvisation, and innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Sawyer, 2004)</ref>. Collaboration between teachers and students and amongst students need to be properly developed. For example during class discussions, teachers' improvisation and innovation should be able to facilitate students to build their knowledge. The character of creative teaching is also seen in the teaching selection strategy, namely (a) student-centered learning, (b) varied teaching strategies, (c) classroom management that facilitates diversity and potential of students, (d) teaching that is contextual to everyday life, and (e) accustom students to think critically through question and answer as well as discussion <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Horng et al., 2005)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Jeffrey (2006)</ref> creative teaching is also characterized by the relevance of teaching content to the needs and potential of students, including innovation in the presentation of the learning content.</p><p>Creative teaching refers to the strategy to foster inventive, effective, and interesting learning, increase students' courage and critical thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Corner, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wood &amp; Ashfield, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Gibson, 2010)</ref>. This shows that creative teaching closely relates to learning that develops students' potential. Teachers have the skills to plan, manage, and evaluate appropriate learning to develop student potential in creativity and critical thinking. Habits that can be implemented to foster creative teaching include openness to student thinking, building confidence and safety, stimulating critical thinking, tolerating errors, promoting collaborations, and giving students opportunities to build concepts and solve problems and think across disciplines <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Sawyer, 2015)</ref>. Many studies have concluded that creative teaching affects aspects such as performance, motivation and creativity, cognitive development, experience and learning satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Schacter et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jankowska &amp; Atlay, 200;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Freund &amp; Holling, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Strean, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rivero, 2002)</ref>.</p></div>

(2018)</ref> stated that student satisfaction measures academic development, service levels, and education quality in schools. It also shows the quality of the cooperative relationship between schools and parents, which influences student's International Journal of Instruction, January 2022 • Vol.15, No.1 learning satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Schertzer &amp; Schertzer, 2004)</ref>. Several factors affect student learning satisfaction, including innovation, school service quality and principal's instructional leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arif et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Elliot &amp; Healiy, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kangas et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hemsley-Brown et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Teeroovengadum et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tuan, 2012)</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bolliger and Martindale (2004)</ref> stated that student satisfaction is influenced by factors such as teacher quality, communication with school members, availability of learning technology, and collaboration. Comparably, student satisfaction influences motivation and learning performance, confidence, skill development and self-potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Letcher &amp; Neves, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mihanović et al., 2016)</ref>. Indicators of student learning satisfaction are seen from several aspects, including (a) improving performance and communication in class <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hahessy et al., 2014)</ref>, (b) increasing positive feelings and emotions towards the learning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cheng et al., 2016)</ref>, and (c) increasing student response and enthusiasm during learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adhikary, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Self-potential development influenced by student satisfaction is closely related to selfactualization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Maslow (1971)</ref> stated that self-actualization is triggered by selfsatisfaction obtained from fulfilling four basic needs, including physiological, security, love, and appreciation. Generally, self-actualization is a prime need in the basic human hierarchy and causes intrinsic motivation to increase self-competence to the highest level. Through education, actualization can be achieved by students gaining learning satisfaction and understanding life goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Farimani &amp; Shahri, 2020)</ref>. Therefore, principals and teachers need skills and proficiency for students to gain learning satisfaction and understanding of their life's purpose. Schools that conduct learning programs to meet student satisfaction, positively influences self-actualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akcay &amp; Akyol, 2012)</ref>. This is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Arslan (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jena and Dorji (2016)</ref>, which concluded that students who are satisfied with learning experience increased selfconfidence to develop their potential through self-actualization. Well-being and enthusiasm from self-confidence positively influence self-actualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ordun &amp; Akün, 2017)</ref>. Students that have reached the self-actualization stage show increased responsibility, learning orientation and motivation, with the ability to control their emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Velieva et al. 2018)</ref>. Furthermore, students 'self-actualization are also seen in their abilities, potentials, and achievements to achieve the learning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bulut, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jena &amp; Dorji, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the research hypothesis developed based on these descriptions. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research design and data collection</head><p>This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the direct or indirect relationship between exogenous and endogenous variables using the SEM, specifically the AMOS analysis model. Respondents were 307 students of Madrasah Aliyah and Al-Kamal Kebumen Islamic vocational high schools, as shown in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Data was collected using 4 types of questionnaires representing each variable, including principal instructional leadership, teacher creativity, learning satisfaction and selfactualization. The questionnaire was made using a Likert scale from a score of 1 to 4, representing strongly disagree, disagree, agree and strongly agree with data collected in intervals. The score is different for negative statements, with 4 for "strongly disagree," 3 for "disagree," 2 for "agree," and 1 for "strongly agree."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Instruments</head><p>The study used 2 exogenous variables, including principal instructional leadership and teacher creative learning. Also, there was 1 mediating and endogenous variable represented by student learning satisfaction, and student learning actualization, respectively. The four variables were developed based on the theory described in the previous section. The instrument draft was guided by experts with relevant scientific fields, revised and empirically tested. Study results showed that the instruments had fulfilled the validity and reliability standards. Variables achievements were measured using a questionnaire, where each was categorized in several indicators, as shown in table <ref type="table">2</ref>. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">International</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Data was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with AMOS applications. SEM was used to determine the relationship between instructional leadership, creative learning as exogenous variables with student learning satisfaction as an intervening variable and student self-actualization as an endogenous variable. The advantages of using AMOS and SEM software were image tools, accuracy, speed, and ease of the path analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Byrne, 2001)</ref>. SEM analysis was divided into two categories, including the measurement model, which explains the relationship between variables and their indicators. The second category or the structural model, measures the relationship between different variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gerbing &amp; Anderson, 1988)</ref>. Also, regression weight output was obtained to determine the acceptable level of the proposed hypothesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS</head><p>The data analysis results were divided into three categories, including measurement and structural models, and hypothesis testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model</head><p>The measurement model provided the relationship between instrument values (observed indicator variables) and designed constructs (unobservable latent variables). Furthermore, the model was analyzed using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to   <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> show that each indicator fulfilled the validity requirements to represent a variables. Furthermore, the validity test was also conducted to determine the value of standardized loading estimate or loading factor &gt; 0.05, as shown in table 4. The results showed that each variable has exceeded the required loading factor value. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model</head><p>The structural model described the relationship between all latent variables, including exogenous, intervening, or endogenous. Its validity was measured using the GOF (Goodness of Fit) value or the model's feasibility test, by determining the index suitability criteria achievement and the cut off value. The indices were GFI, AGFI, CMIN/DF, TLI, CFI, and RMSEA. GFI and AGFI described the model suitability level with a value ranging from 0 (poor fit) to 1.0 (perfect fit). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arbuckle (2014)</ref>, GFI &gt; 0.90 and AGFI &gt; 0.90 values indicated that the tested model had a good fit. The study obtained a GFI of 0.934 and AGFI of 0.903, proving that the model was a good fit. Furthermore, CMIN/DF and TLI indicators measured the fit level of the research model with the criteria of CMIN/DF ≤ 2.0 and TLI ≥ 0.95 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Byrne et al., 1989)</ref>. This study's results indicated that the CMIN/DF value was 2.056 and TLI was 0.968, which shows the model fulfilled the acceptable requirements. Other measurement criteria included CFI, whereby a value closer to 1 provided higher acceptance chances for the model, and RMSEA ≤ 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arbuckle, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cudeck &amp; Browne, 1983)</ref>. These results showed a CFI of 0, 975 and RMSEA of 0.059 which proved a high acceptance level.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis test</head><p>Hypothesis testing in SEM AMOS was determined by Critical Ration (CR) and p-value in the regression weights output. CR &gt; 1.96 and p &lt;0.05 values proved that this research's hypothesis was acceptable, as shown in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>. The magnitude effect strength between the variables was determined from an existing estimate value. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>This research model met the criteria for a good fit model to determine the effects between variables. Table <ref type="table">6</ref> shows that out of the 5 proposed hypotheses, only 1 was rejected. The description of the hypothesis test can be described as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principal instructional leadership (IL) has a significant direct effect on student learning satisfaction (SS) and student self-actualization (SSA)</head><p>The hypothesis of the IL effect on SS was accepted because it met the CR value&gt; 1.96 and p &lt;0.05 criteria.

Furthermore, the principal leadership in learning management improves student performance that leads to satisfaction. This is in line with previous research results <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bartlett, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Heaven &amp; Bourne, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mitchell &amp; Tschannen-moran, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Moffitt, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sahney, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Shatzer, 2009)</ref>. Students appreciate and enjoy good performance and achievement which improves their satisfaction levels. Moreover, instructional leadership influences various aspects related to students, including the formation of a pleasant learning environment, improved communication and student discipline <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Clifford et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sahney, 2016)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Halverson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Park, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gulcan, 2001)</ref>. This aspect shows that IL is closely related to the supporting factors of student learning satisfaction. Quality collaboration and school communication with students correlates with their learning satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arif et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bangert 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Elliot &amp; Healiy, 2001)</ref>. Other studies showed that the principal's instructional leadership improves the quality of educational services which tends to impact on student learning satisfaction. The higher the quality of service, the higher the student's learning satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hasan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kammur, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tuan, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Involving students in various work programs and school activities creates a sense of pride and satisfaction because they feel appreciated and important.</p><p>Instructional leadership influenced students' self-actualization because its effect on SSA was acceptable and met CR value&gt; 1.96 and p &lt;0.05 criteria. IL is the key to success in managing the learning process because it provides excellent service for students' potential development. Several student potentials are affected by IL, including creativity, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit making them highly competitive. The development of students' self-potential through instructional leadership is an effective step to self-actualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Sharma, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Yavgildina et al. 2019)</ref>. Through IL, schools can develop modern and innovative strategies, services, and learning environments to keep up with students' needs.

According to preliminary studies, instructional leadership contributes to improving learning performance and student achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Heaven &amp; Bourne, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sahney, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mitchell &amp; Tschannen-moran, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Shatzer, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bartlett, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Moffitt, 2007)</ref>. This is because improved learning performance and student achievement is an indicator of the self-actualization stage. Several studies stated that the indicators of realizing students' self-actualization is seen from the increase in their ability, potential, and achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bulut, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jena &amp; Dorji, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Creative teaching (CT) has a direct effect on student learning satisfaction (SS) but has no direct effect on student self-actualization (SSA)</head><p>The hypothesis of the CT effect on SS was accepted because it met the CR value&gt; 1.96 and p &lt;0.05 criteria. Therefore, creative teaching directly affects student learning satisfaction. Creative teaching refers to a teaching strategy to foster inventive, effective, and interesting learning as well as increasing students' courage and critical thinking skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Corner, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Gibson, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wood &amp; Ashfield, 2008)</ref>. It gives students the freedom to explore and build a meaningful learning process. Therefore, students easily achieve their goals, which influence learning satisfaction. The achievement of learning objectives is also supported by a fun and dynamic climate in creative teaching. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bangert (2005)</ref> stated that creative teaching provides climate and student learning flexibility, which impacts satisfaction. Several studies conclude that creative teaching affects learning satisfaction by improving student achievement, motivation and creativity, cognitive development and experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Freund &amp; Holling, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Jankowska &amp; Atlay, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Schacter et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Trean, 2011)</ref>. Creative teaching helps students realize their potential to solve learning and life problems independently. Students' self-potential and independence are the successes of creative teaching and learning satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lee (2011)</ref> stated that creative and innovative teaching significantly affects student learning satisfaction. Moreover, it affects the school environment and makes learning enjoyable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kangas et al. (2017)</ref> stated that a fun learning process determines the level of learning satisfaction. Teachers with the ability to creatively and effectively inspire, motivate and simulate children's learning development are proven to be more able to influence learning satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adhikary, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hemsley-Brown et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rivero, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>This study proved that creative teaching does not directly affect students' selfactualization based on the hypothesis test of the CT effect on SSA which was rejected. However, creative teaching affected students' self-actualization when mediated by learning satisfaction. Student self-actualization was determined by learning satisfaction influenced by the creative teaching and principal instructional leadership. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rivero (2002)</ref>, creative teaching affects student learning satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bolliger and Martindale (2004)</ref> stated that the teaching quality and creative use of technology correlates to student learning satisfaction. Therefore, creative teaching influencing students 'self-actualization when inventive potential is well developed. This is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Velieva et al. (2018)</ref>, which stated that students' self-actualization is realized when learning needs are successfully understood and developed. Learning needs awareness motivates students to develop their potential, increase creativity, and independence to self-actualize <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Neto, 2015)</ref>. The teaching process is the only supporting factor for the formation of this awareness. Students' self-actualization requires a complete change in the education system at school and at home for its realization. The alignment of the education system at school and at home affects their ability to reach the selfactualization stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dmitrienko et al., 2017)</ref>. Furthermore, this stage cannot be achieved assuming there are many psychological obstacles that students get from the social environment, especially their families. Therefore, it is difficult to be able to realize student self-actualization despite the provision of a creative teaching process to overcome these obstacles <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bulut, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instructional leadership (IL) and creative teaching (CT) influence student selfactualization (SSA) mediated by student learning satisfaction (SS)</head><p>Instructional leadership and creative teaching affect self-actualization mediated by student satisfaction. This hypothesis had a CR value of 2.024 and p 0.043, which</p><p>International Journal of <ref type="bibr">Instruction, January 2022 • Vol.15, No.1</ref> acceptable based on CR value&gt; 1.96 and p &lt;0.05 requirements. Instructional leadership and creative teaching provide opportunities for students to develop their knowledge, skills, and potential. The two factors also make the learning process enjoyable by involving students in designing optimal educational services. Therefore, instructional leadership and creative teaching develop students' skills and potential, making them happy which grows their learning satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Maslow (1971)</ref> stated that selfsatisfaction obtained from fulfilling four basic needs, including physiological, security, love, and appreciation, triggers self-actualization growth. Because learning satisfaction is a basic psychological need, achievements help students self-actualize. <ref type="bibr">Akcay and Akyol's research (2012)</ref> proved that schools that implement learning programs to meet student satisfaction help them fulfill self-actualization needs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Arslan (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jena and Dorji (2016)</ref> concluded that students satisfied with the learning experience increased self-confidence to develop their potential through self-actualization. Moreover, through self-confidence, students grow enthusiasm for self-actualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ordun &amp; Akün, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Generally, principal's leadership oriented towards quality learning and teacher creativity influences student satisfaction. Because self-actualization is a prime goal in the learning process, principals need to focus on instructional leadership and improving teacher creativity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>This research achieved suitability and conformity demands because the model met the good fit test requirements. The study results proved a relationship between exogenous, intervening, and endogenous, such that the principal's instructional leadership and creative teaching affect student learning satisfaction. Furthermore, the principal's instructional leadership influences students' self-actualization, while creative teaching has no direct effect. The principal instructional leadership and creative teaching influence self-actualization mediated by student learning satisfaction. Therefore, educational policymakers and curriculum designers need quality learning-oriented leadership for students' satisfaction and potential actualization. </p></div>
