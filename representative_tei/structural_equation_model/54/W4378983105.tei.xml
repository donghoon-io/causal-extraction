<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose: Given the complicated service delivery process of online food delivery service, this study drew on the mSERVQUAL model and spillover theory to examine the mechanism through which food-ordering mobile app service quality influences users' mobile app satisfaction, food satisfaction, and repurchase intentions.</p><p>Design/methodology/approach: Online surveys were completed by 1,000 customers who used a foodordering mobile app to order fast food on the day they completed the online survey.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A recent article from Food Navigator titled "Online food delivery 'one of the only winners' in coronavirus outbreak" captures how the COVID-19 pandemic has boosted the online food delivery sector in terms of both revenue and user numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Southey, 2020)</ref>. For example, Deliveroo reported that sales had doubled and that the company's number of catering service co-operators jumped by 25% in the first quarter of 2020. Despite the online food delivery sector's exponential growth during the pandemic, scholars have contemplated whether its success will endure in a post-pandemic world <ref type="bibr">(Zhao &amp; Bacao, 2020)</ref>. Some researchers have suggested that customers might 'binge' on outside dining to (over-)compensate for having been unable to do so during the height of the pandemic <ref type="bibr">(Miao et al., 2021)</ref>. With an uncertain future <ref type="bibr">(Shroff et al., 2022)</ref>, online food delivery has generated intense academic interest with respect to service quality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Suhartanto et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhao &amp; Bacao, 2020)</ref>, because service quality has long been paramount to competitive advantages in the crowded catering market <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cheng et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kim et al., 2009)</ref>. Following the research path in other delivery service sectors, most studies in the online food delivery sector have assessed service quality based on service outcomes and the service delivery process.</p><p>Different from traditional food delivery services that restaurants operate themselves, the online food delivery sector has represented a popular online-to-offline mobile technology by combining an online ordering system with offline delivery services <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Southey, 2020)</ref>. In addition to the two common stakeholders (i.e., service providers and consumers) in the service industry, there are third-party intermediary platforms developing mobile applications that display menu items, supply delivery persons, and receive payments. Consumers can filter available options by parameters such as the restaurant, cuisine type, and rating. They can also track their orders online while waiting for a worker to deliver their food-all without actually interacting with the restaurant. Hence, understating the roles of mobile apps in the online food delivery sector has failed to fully capture the multi-service characteristics of online food delivery industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cheng et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ray et al., 2019)</ref>, because the online food delivery service begins once customers log in to the mobile app and search for restaurant-related information <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Suhartanto et al., 2019)</ref>. In other words, consumers are unlikely to evaluate the service performance of the online food delivery sector based exclusively on the food delivery process and the food items themselves, but also on the mobile app.</p><p>The mobile app environment in the pre-consumption stage is influential to the physical environment in the consumption stage <ref type="bibr">(Sabiote Oritz, et al., 2017)</ref>, because the pre-consumption stage forms consumers' expectations over the overall dining experiences to determine their satisfaction (e.g., food satisfaction) in the during-consumption stage and behavioural intentions (e.g., repurchase intention) in the post-consumption stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Wijaya et al., 2013)</ref>. This argument also supported by the Associative Network Theory that recognizes an individual's attitudes as formations of nodes (e.g., pre-, during-, and post-consumption stage) and links between nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Collins &amp; Loftus, 1975)</ref>. The link between pre-consumption stage and post-consumption stage could therefore be recognized as the spillover effect under which consumers' attitudes towards their consumptions in the during-and post-consumption stage (e.g., food satisfaction and behavioural intention)</p><p>Service quality of online food delivery mobile application are influenced by their interaction with the channel they used to purchase the products in the pre-consumption stage (e.g., mobile app satisfaction) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Simonin &amp; Ruth, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>However, the existing studies on food satisfaction and behavioural intention have been dominated by the investigations of factors, such as food image and food novelty, in the during-consumption stage, overlooking the spillover effects of factors in the pre-consumption stage on diners' evaluations in the post-consumption stage. To bridge the aforementioned research gaps, this study proposes an integrated model grounded in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Huang et al.'s (2015)</ref> mSERVQUAL model to achieve a pair of objectives: 1) to examine the mobile app quality of the online food delivery sector and (2) to investigate the spillover effects of mobile app quality in the preconsumption stage on food satisfaction in the during-consumption stage and repurchase intention in the postconsumption stage. This work provides an in-depth understanding of food-ordering mobile app service quality, enriching the literature on technological and catering service quality. Results also benefit online food delivery service providers, restaurateurs, and mobile payment companies in terms of service development.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Online food delivery service quality</head><p>Investigations of service quality in the catering context are not new. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Stevens et al. (1995)</ref> initially referred to the SERVQUAL model in establishing a measure of restaurant service quality, the DINESERV model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Liu and Jang (2009)</ref> later adopted the DINESERV model to perform an importance-performance analysis of service quality in Chinese restaurants. In light of diverse service quality viewpoints, some scholars have endeavored to construct a stronger theoretical background by integrating several models <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Luoh &amp; Tsaur, 2011)</ref>. This standpoint stems from <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Marković et al.'s (2010)</ref> belief that service quality in catering activities includes assessments of service outcomes and service delivery processes.</p><p>The formation of service quality in catering activities has become complicated when online food delivery flourished in the global catering market since the pandemic, because consumers and catering service providers are physically separated by a mobile app in the pre-consumption stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Ahn &amp; Kwon, 2021)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Collier and Bienstock (2006)</ref> asserted that this separation has a significant impact on the criteria used to determine consumers' perceptions of overall service quality in the during-consumption stage and to evaluate service outcomes in the post-consumption stage. While there have been several attempts to measuring food delivery service quality, they mainly framed mobile app as a service product to determine overall service quality by incorporating it with other service outcomes or processes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chan &amp; Gao, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng et al., 2021)</ref> but overlooked the separable role of the mobile app in the service delivery process.</p><p>Compared to the quality of food items and food delivery service providers, the quality of mobile app has consistently been proven to have relatively low factor loadings on overall food delivery service quality, because the construal level theory, a socio-psychological theory common in the study field of marketing, Service quality of online food delivery mobile application suggests that individual attitudes (e.g., perceptions of food delivery service quality) are more influenced by events close to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991)</ref>. While the construal level theory explains why the quality of mobile app constituted a relatively small part of overall food delivery service quality, it did not challenge its important role in determining one's positive psychological and behavioral responses. Specifically, many scholars have recognized food service consumption as a three-stage experience in which consumers' perceptions in the pre-consumption stage spillovers to form their perceptions in the during-consumption stage and then in the post-consumption stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lin et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wijaya &amp; King, 2013)</ref>. This spillover effect of the pre-consumption stage on the during-consumption stage and the post-consumption stage was observed in the online food delivery context by <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Zhuang et al. (2021)</ref> who discovered that the technical aspects of a food delivery mobile app significantly influenced diners' perceptions of overall food delivery service quality and their satisfaction. While <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ray et al. (2019)</ref> focused on the service quality of mobile apps and discovered its significant effect on consumer's intentions to use online food delivery services, they overlooked the possible mediating role of the service aspects in the during-consumption stage as discovered in other e-marketing contexts, such as hotel booking <ref type="bibr">(Sabiote Oritz et al., 2017)</ref> and social media marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Pop et al., 2022)</ref>. In other words, much insight remains to be uncovered in this respect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Mobile app service quality</head><p>Advances in mobile telecommunications have supported the rapid development of mobile commerce by encouraging businesses to sell products or services via mobile devices. Scholars have generally suggested that mobile services are distinct from traditional physical services and online services <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Choi et al., 2008)</ref>. As a popular form of mobile commerce, the online food delivery sector relies on a mobile app to start the whole service delivery process <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Southey, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Suhartanto et al., 2019)</ref>. Since the pre-consumption stage has been recognized to play an important role in determining consumers' attitudes in the during-consumption stage and the post-consumption stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ha &amp; Jang, 2010)</ref>, how the service quality of the online food delivery mobile app in the pre-consumption stage induces spillover effects on diners' attitudes (i.e., food satisfaction and repurchase intention) in the during-and post-consumption stage must be better understood.</p><p>Many conceptualizations of service quality stem from <ref type="bibr">Parasuraman et al.'s (1988)</ref> SERVQUAL model to recognize its multi-dimensional nature. Given the rapid growth of e-commerce, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Parasuraman et al. (2005)</ref> advanced their original framework to develop an electronic service quality measurement scale (E-S-QUAL).</p><p>While mobile commerce is frequently characterized as an extension of e-commerce, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Balasubraman et al. (2002)</ref> suggested viewing it as a distinct marketing concept that constitutes a major revolution in what we expect of an e-commerce platform, thus calling for new measurements of its service quality. Initial attempts had focused on addressing the technical quality of mobile apps rather than service quality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Choi et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">) until Lu et al. (2009)</ref> proposed three mobile service quality factors: interaction quality, environment quality, and outcome quality to capture the service orientation of mobile commerce. However, as agreed by the authors, Service quality of online food delivery mobile application <ref type="bibr">Lu et al.'s (2009)</ref> scale was limited to the mobile brokerage context that was classified as a person-interactive experiential mobile service process by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nysveen et al. (2005)</ref>.</p><p>Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nysveen et al. (2005)</ref> proposed a mobile service classification framework along two axes: interactivity (person interactive versus machine interactive) and process (goal-directed process versus experiential process), <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Huang et al. (2015)</ref> criticized <ref type="bibr">Lu et al.'s (2009)</ref> scale for its limited generalizability to capture the machineinteractive goal-oriented service process (e.g., online food delivery) and thus extended the SERVQUAL and eSERVQUAL models by creating mSERVQUAL, a model containing nine dimensions of mobile app service quality-efficiency, system availability, content, privacy, fulfilment, responsiveness, compensation, contact, and billing. The mSERVQUAL model has been broadly applied to online-to-offline mobile services, because it captures customers' consumption experiences in online and offline settings, providing a strong theoretical foundation to explore food-ordering mobile app service quality (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Relationship between mobile app service quality and satisfaction</head><p>As suggested by <ref type="bibr">Parasuraman et al. (1988)</ref>, service quality represents the gap between customers' expectations and actual outcomes; that is, it encapsulates the constant evaluation of one's consumption experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Grönroos, 1984)</ref>. As a similar concept with satisfaction to reflect the differences between expectations and perceptions, service quality has sometimes been used interchangeably with satisfaction in the marketing study field, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kim et al. (2021)</ref> criticized this interchangeable perspective for its ignorance of their time sequence. This time sequence was also reflected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Parasuraman et al. (1985)</ref> who proposed the gap model to argue that consumers will be more satisfied in the post-consumption stage when service quality exceeds their expectations in the during-consumption stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Service quality of online food delivery mobile application</head><p>Mobile app satisfaction has widely been studied in the mobile commerce context. While many existing studies have consistently discovered that the impacts of mobile app quality on mobile app satisfaction were weaker than the impacts of staff's service quality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Sharma &amp; Sharma, 2019)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Jun and Palacios (2015)</ref> drew on the causal asymmetry principle of satisfaction/dissatisfaction to conclude that mobile application quality served more a satisfier inducing satisfaction, but staff's service quality was more likely basic requirements generating limited satisfaction. One of the possible explanations of this inconsistent finding is that scholars mainly focused on the technical aspects, such as perceived ease of use and perceived playfulness, of a mobile app <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Rejman Petrović et al., 2022)</ref> to determine mobile app quality but overlooked the service orientation of the mobile commerce as emphasized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Huang et al. (2015)</ref>. Hence, drawing on the mSERVQUAL model, we hypothesize that:</p><p>H1. Mobile app service quality positively influences consumers' mobile app satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Relationship between mobile app satisfaction and food satisfaction</head><p>Mobile app satisfaction and product satisfaction (i.e., food satisfaction in this study) were independent constructs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Su et al., 2022)</ref> until <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collins and Loftus (1975)</ref> proposed the Associate Network Theory to recognize individual's attitudes as a combination of nodes and links between nodes. Specifically, the Associate Network Theory highlights the spillover effect between two mentally associated entities (e.g., mobile app satisfaction and product satisfaction). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahluwalia et al. (2001)</ref> defined spillover effect as any change in perceptions of one entity (e.g., food satisfaction) due to an evaluation of another mentally associated entity (e.g., mobile app satisfaction) that does not necessarily feature a causal link. In a service setting, a consumption experience in one stage of the consumption process (e.g., mobile app service satisfaction in the preconsumption stage) can influence experiences in later stages (e.g., food satisfaction in the during-consumption stage).</p><p>While <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Mittal et al. (1999)</ref> highlighted that it is difficult to determine whether service quality has a spillover effect on product quality or vice versa for their possible correlation, studies have adopted a longitudinal point of view to recognize the consumption process of a service setting as an appropriate indicator for the direction of the spillover effect. In the mobile commerce context, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Slotegraaf and Inman (2004)</ref> suggested that preconsumption satisfaction can translate to product satisfaction in the during-consumption stage and the postconsumption stage, although this effect weakens over time. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Oh et al. (2008)</ref> indicated that a webbased store with beautiful design features could evoke satisfaction with store merchandise. Sabiote Ortiz et al.</p><p>(2017) demonstrated that tourists' satisfaction with the online hotel booking website in the pre-consumption stage ultimately led to their satisfaction in the during-consumption stage at hotels.</p><p>Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Herhausen et al. (2020)</ref> called for more investigations on how different technological distribution channels (e.g., online food delivery mobile app) execute spillover effects on experiences in the duringconsumption stage, we propose that mobile app satisfaction in the pre-consumption stage (i.e., service quality)</p><p>Service quality of online food delivery mobile application demonstrates a spillover effect on food satisfaction in the during-consumption stage (i.e., product quality), while the mobile app satisfaction is not causally linked to actual food satisfaction.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Relationship between satisfaction and repurchase intention</head><p>Satisfaction has been identified as a key predictor of customers' repurchase intentions in hospitality contexts;</p><p>prior purchase experiences shape one's subsequent decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Oh, 1999)</ref>. Drawing on expectancydisconfirmation theory, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chiu et al. (2013)</ref> reported a significant positive impact of satisfaction on online repurchase intention. While online reservation involves various transaction, studies have reported that once customers are satisfied with one transaction in the pre-consumption stage, there is a high probability to develop a repurchase intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sun et al., 2022)</ref>. The direct effect of mobile app service satisfaction on repurchase intention was also revealed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Yeo et al. (2021)</ref> who proposed the concept of mobile app servitization to argue that consumers who are satisfied with four different aspects (i.e., effort expectancy, perceived usefulness, information quality, and security) of an online food delivery mobile app are more likely to develop a repurchase intention. Given the apparent positive association between satisfaction and repurchase intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ladhari et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019)</ref>, we propose the following hypothesis:</p><p>H3. Consumers' mobile app service satisfaction positively influences their repurchase intentions.</p><p>Food has always been a key factor in any dining activities, not only because it represents a physiological need, but also because food consumption is driven by a complex interplay of motivations to satisfy diners' emotional needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Tikkanen, 2007)</ref>. In other words, the role of foods must not be neglected when examining consumers' psychological and behavioral responses towards online food delivery services.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Study context</head><p>This study was conducted in Hong Kong for two reasons. First, China is the most prominent country of online food delivery service usage, reaching more than 470 million users and generating 40 billion U.S. dollars in 2019. The optimistic future of the online food delivery market in Hong Kong was also reflected by the business development plan of Meituan, an online food delivery service giant, who is planning to expand their business to Hong Kong <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Jiang, 2022)</ref>. Second, while the epidemic situation has improved globally, the Hong Kong government maintains relatively strict social distancing policies that build citizens' habit of consuming online food delivery services <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Liu, 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Data collection</head><p>We developed a cross-sectional online survey to collect information from consumers aged 18 or above who had used online food delivery services to order fast foods (e.g., burgers, pizzas, fried chickens, and soft drinks) in the day they completed this survey. The criterion of fast foods was imposed to reduce the confounding effects of food types, because the food quality of fast foods is expected to have a relatively low variance due to the food standardized strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Tien, 2019)</ref>. Specifically, a screening question (i.e., "Which of the following foods have you ordered through online food delivery apps today?") was asked to screen out invalid responses. The online survey consisted of 57 questions across four sections. Before beginning the online Before data were gathered through the main survey, the instrument was piloted with 20 experienced online food delivery users (10 native English speakers and 10 native Chinese speakers). Items' phrasing and formatting were modified slightly in accordance with the pilot respondents' feedback. For instance, a question about respondents' consumption patterns was changed to refer to consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic because pilot respondents expressed that their ordering experiences were limited before then.</p><p>Actual data collection took place over a two-week period in February 2022 (i.e., the fifth wave of the pandemic in Hong Kong) using the Qualtrics platform for survey development. With the help of Rakuten Insight, a Hong Kong-based survey company that distributed the survey to their panel members, a quota sampling technique was implemented to achieve gender-balanced participation. Since gender has been recognized to have significant confounding effects on consumer's attitudes towards online food delivery service <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Francioni et al., 2022)</ref>, the gender quota was specifically applied to eliminate possible confounding effects in model testing.</p><p>The online survey resulted in 1,000 valid responses after 82 invalid responses were eliminated based on the following criteria: 1) gender quota exceeded (i.e., 500 men and 500 women) (n=61); 2) survey completed within 2.5 minutes (n=7); 3) relatively low standard deviation across all scale items (i.e., less than .25) (n=3);</p><p>and 4) failed the attention check (n=11) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lin et al., 2020)</ref>. Respondents ranged from 18 to 75 years old, with an average age of 42. With an undergraduate degree or above (58.4%), most respondents earned between HKD$15,000 (around GBP£1,382) and HKD$45,000 (around GBP£2,764) monthly (32.5%). Since they consumed online food delivery service almost five times per week and spent HKD$99 (around GBP£11) per order, the sample was deemed as experienced online food delivery users who are familiar with the online food delivery mobile app service quality.</p><p>Service quality of online food delivery mobile application 3.2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Effect of mobile app service quality on mobile app satisfaction</head><p>Grounded on <ref type="bibr">Parasuraman et al.'s (1985)</ref> gap model, the positive relationship between mobile app service quality and mobile app satisfaction seems straightforward. Many scholars have empirically validated their positive relationship in contexts such as mobile banking <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Trabelsi-Zoghlami et al., 2020)</ref>, mobile shopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kim et al., 2021</ref><ref type="bibr">), mobile communication (Wang et al., 2019)</ref>, and online food delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Suhartanto et al., 2019)</ref>. However, by adopting the mSERVQUAL model to conceptualize mobile app service quality as a multidimensional construct, our results advanced this straightforward relationship by demonstrating that the effects of mobile app service quality on mobile app satisfaction vary across service quality dimensions.</p><p>Four dimensions of service quality (i.e., efficiency, fulfilment, contact, and billing) significantly elevated users' mobile app satisfaction. Contradictory to <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kim et al. (2021)</ref>, who noted that mobile shoppers favoured accessible service quality over convenience, our significant service quality dimensions were convenienceoriented: they generally reflected whether online food delivery service users could access mobile apps to place food orders efficiently. This particular finding somewhat highlighted the convenient nature of online-tooffline services, because online food delivery service serves as an alternative dining option, at least during the pandemic when many restaurants were forced to close and social gatherings were prohibited.</p><p>Five service quality dimensions (i.e., system availability, content, privacy, compensation, and responsiveness) had insignificant impacts on users' mobile app satisfaction. The non-significant roles of system availability and content contradicted research on mobile app design <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berraies et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Trabelsi-Zoghlami et al. (2020)</ref> suggested that system design (i.e., system availability) and information quality (i.e., content) did not significantly affect e-trust in terms of mobile banking because customers place less emphasis on the aesthetic features of functional mobile apps (e.g., online food delivery mobile app). <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ray et al. (2019)</ref> also observed that how online food delivery mobile apps list restaurants could significantly reduce customers' repurchase intentions. The insignificant role of privacy insinuates that online food delivery service usage entails fewer</p><p>Service quality of online food delivery mobile application risks than mobile banking <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Trabelsi-Zoghlami et al., 2020)</ref> and mobile shopping services <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kim et al., 2021)</ref>, as online food delivery involves far less sensitive data collection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Effect of mobile app service quality on food satisfaction</head><p>Mobile app satisfaction fully mediated the effects of (a) efficiency and (b) billing on food satisfaction, implying a spillover effect of convenience-oriented service quality attributes on food satisfaction. In other words, if customers believe that an online food delivery mobile app offers a smooth ordering process, they are more likely to be satisfied with their meal. Customers expecting an efficient ordering process are usually rushed. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jensen and Drozdenko (2008)</ref> pointed out that customers who were in a hurry assigned 37% more value to a product. In other words, time pressure can therefore explain these significant mediating relationships; such pressure has been acknowledged as a scarcity appeal that conveys exclusivity and improves customers' product evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gierl et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>A complementary mediation relationship manifested in this study regarding the effect of fulfilment on food satisfaction. Fulfilment describes the extent to which a mobile app fulfils one's perceptions of service promises, mirroring customers' emotional responses. Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ladhari et al. (2017)</ref>, this significant relationship indicates that customers are more likely to be satisfied with product offerings (i.e., food) if their emotional states are fulfilled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Effect of mobile app service quality on repurchase intention</head><p>Similar to the mediating role of mobile app service satisfaction on food satisfaction, mediation relationships were observed for the respective effects of efficiency, fulfilment, and billing on repurchase intention. As discussed above, efficiency and billing reflect customers' perceived time pressure to fulfil dining needs.</p><p>Perceived time pressure, as a situational variable affecting consumers' decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Vermeir &amp; Van Kenhove, 2005)</ref>, is widely thought to persuade customers in the hospitality industry <ref type="bibr">(Huang et al., 2020)</ref>. Ray et al.</p><p>(2019) reported a direct impact of fulfilment (i.e., consumer experience) on online food delivery service repurchase intention. Our findings conversely align with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ladhari et al. (2017)</ref> with respect to a full mediation relationship. Put simply, emotional fulfilment can spark customers' behavioural intentions in a shopping context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Contributions, limitations, and future research directions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Theoretical contributions</head><p>This study makes four main contributions to the knowledge base around mobile commerce, online food delivery services, and mobile app service quality. First, this study is the first of its kind in hospitality to evaluate online food delivery services' mobile app service quality. Despite several investigations into online food delivery service quality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng et al., 2021)</ref>, most have focused either on service outcomes or</p><p>Service quality of online food delivery mobile application service delivery processes while overlooking mobile apps' service quality. This perspective is important not only because <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ray et al. (2019)</ref> asserted that the suboptimal design of food-ordering mobile apps has cast doubt on their future in a post-pandemic world, but also because online food delivery service is an online-to-offline service that starts once customers login to the mobile app. In other words, the online food delivery mobile app presents customers with the first image of the overall service quality in the pre-consumption stage, determining their perceptions in the during-consumption stage.</p><p>Second, while mobile app quality has generated extensive scholarly attentions in m-commerce studies, many conceptualizations of mobile app quality stemmed from frameworks emerged from e-commerce to focus more on the technical quality than the service quality of mobile apps (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Choi et al., 2008)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Balasubraman et al. (2002)</ref> asserted that e-commerce and m-commerce are two distinct marketing concepts, with the later emphasizing service orientation of an electronic platform. Specifically, online food delivery mobile apps are far more than an information source or a transaction platform, they are more likely visual service providers to deliver services on behalf of practitioners. Drawing on the conceptualization of mobile app service quality proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Huang et al. (2015)</ref>, this study complemented the one-sided discussion on the technical quality of a mobile app in m-commerce by capturing the service orientation in the online food delivery context.</p><p>Third, unlike hospitality studies framing service quality as a second-order construct, this work expanded the global multidimensional conceptualization of mobile app service quality: we built a model to compare the effects of service quality dimensions on online food delivery users' mobile app satisfaction, food satisfaction, and repurchase intentions. High service quality is believed to engender greater satisfaction (i.e., mobile app satisfaction and food satisfaction) and repurchase intention. However, the impacts of service quality appear to differ dimensionally. Considering service quality dimensions as first-order constructs can highlight distinct interrelationships. Specifically, five (i.e., system availability, content, privacy, responsiveness, and compensation) out of nine service dimensions were found insignificantly influence mobile app satisfaction in the online food delivery context. Since only a multidimensional conceptualization can identify such distinct relationships among different components of mobile app service quality, scholars should hence be cognizant of the confounding effects induced by specific dimensions.</p><p>Lastly, drawing on the Associate Network Theory, this study reaffirmed the spillover effects of mobile app satisfaction on food satisfaction and repurchase intention in the online food delivery setting. While spillover effects between service satisfaction (e.g., mobile app satisfaction) and product satisfaction (e.g., food satisfaction) have widely been recognized in the hospitality contexts, whether service satisfaction has a spillover effect on product satisfaction or vice versa remains doubtful. However, since the consumption process of online food delivery services starts when customers log in to the mobile app, search for restaurant information, and place an order via the app <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Suhartanto et al., 2019)</ref>, we adopted a longitudinal perspective to conceptualize mobile app satisfaction (i.e., service satisfaction) as consumers' attitudinal response in the preconsumption stage and food satisfaction (i.e., product satisfaction) as attitudinal response in the during-Service quality of online food delivery mobile application consumption stage, arguing that mobile app satisfaction in the pre-consumption stage can translate to food satisfaction in the during-consumption stage due to its spillover effect across different consumption stages.</p><p>Specifically, the study findings confirmed the spillover effect of mobile app satisfaction on food satisfaction, providing a novel theoretical foundation with which to interpret customers' food satisfaction in the online food delivery context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Practical contributions</head><p>This study also bears practical value for three major stakeholders in the online food delivery sector: online food delivery service providers, restaurateurs, and mobile payment companies. First, while the online food delivery sector has experienced rapid growth during the pandemic, service providers may find our results useful for enhancing the service quality of food-ordering mobile apps. Investments in mobile app service quality can cultivate competitive advantages in the catering industry, especially as the online food delivery sector's potential for post-pandemic survival seems unclear. Online food delivery service providers are encouraged to enhance their mobile apps' efficiency, fulfilment, and billing procedures by designing an intuitive ordering process that addresses consumers' needs. These three service quality dimensions exerted significant direct and indirect impacts on repurchase intention. For example, service providers may consider offering pre-order options (e.g., allowing customers to place orders a day in advance) to render the ordering process more efficient.</p><p>Second, in addition to of primarily focusing on food quality, restaurateurs should partner with online food delivery service providers to improve mobile app service quality. Unique from on-site food consumption, customers' online food consumption experiences do not begin with the meal; instead, this process unfolds when they log in to a mobile app to search for restaurant information. As this study confirmed the spillover effects of mobile app satisfaction on food satisfaction and repurchase intention, restaurateurs could offer customized dining packages (i.e., fulfilment) and deliver comprehensive restaurant/food information (i.e., content) to help enhance the mobile apps' service quality, which may result in higher food satisfaction and repurchase intention in return.</p><p>Lastly, our findings could serve as guidance for mobile payment companies seeking to grow their market share in the online food delivery sector. Societal attitudes toward mobile technology adoption have shifted amid the pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Polizzi et al., 2020)</ref>: the mobile payment industry has become much more competitive, and many mobile payment companies have launched incentive programs to attract customers to online food delivery.</p><p>Rather than only encouraging short-term usage, mobile payment companies may foster long-term patronage by implementing a smooth ordering process. We noted that billing significantly influenced users' mobile app satisfaction and repurchase intentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Limitations and future research directions</head><p>Service quality of online food delivery mobile application</p><p>Although this study was rigorously performed, four limitations can inspire future work. First, a Hong Kongbased survey company administered our survey. The sample was thus expected to mainly consist of Hong Kong residents. Additional research is needed to determine whether our results can be generalized, particularly because consumers' dining behaviour varies culturally <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lin et al., 2021)</ref>. Second, consumers' evaluations of mobile app services may differ with demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age group, and nationality) and situational factors (e.g., online food delivery service providers, cuisine types, and phone operating systems), none of which were taken into account in this study. Third, this research was carried out during the pandemic -a time when online food delivery services were growing exponentially. Subsequent work should compare consumers' perceived mobile app service quality before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic to reinforce the model's validity. Fourth, while the study sample consisted of experienced online food delivery users who are familiar most mobile app features identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Huang et al.'s (2015)</ref> mSERVQUAL model, some respondents may not have enough experiences on some specific features (e.g., compensation) of an online food delivery mobile app. Lastly, to maintain the study focus on the spillover effect of mobile app service quality, this study stemmed from a unidimensional conceptualization of satisfaction to measure mobile app satisfaction food satisfaction with two single items. Specifically, while the face validity was checked in the pilot test, the interpretation of the measurement items may be different across different cultural backgrounds. Taking the cultural differences into consideration, future scholars are encouraged to consider the multidimensional nature of satisfaction and develop more robust measures in the online food delivery context.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Liang et al. (2018)</ref> argued that there are two different types of satisfaction: 1) transaction-based satisfaction and 2) product-based satisfaction driving individual's repurchase intention of booking peer-to-peer accommodations online. In the same perspective in the online food delivery context, transaction-based satisfaction may refer to mobile app satisfaction in the pre-consumption stage, whereas product-based satisfaction may refer to food satisfaction in the during consumption stage. Given the widely-proven positive association between food satisfaction and repurchase intention in dining contexts, we propose the following hypothesis to develop a research model (Figure1): H4. Consumers' food satisfaction positively influences their repurchase intentions.</figDesc></figure>
