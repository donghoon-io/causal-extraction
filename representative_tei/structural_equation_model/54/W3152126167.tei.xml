<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose -This empirical study aims to determine factors that influence an individual's intention to use mobile payment (MP) systems. The study investigates direct, indirect and total effects as well as factors that mediate or moderate effects on intention.</p><p>Design/methodology/approach -A theoretical model is derived from previous studies and combines factors from technology acceptance model and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, facilitating conditions, behavioral intention) with factors relevant to MP (perceived security, uncertainty avoidance, trust, network externalities and self-efficacy). Gender, age, MP experience and income are included as moderators of direct effects on behavioral intention. The sample includes 736 participants from the four large cities in Indonesia. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze and develop the theoretical model. Findings -Self-efficacy has the greatest total effect on behavioral intention, followed in decreasing order of importance by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, trust, network externalities and uncertainty Avoidance. only gender and MP experience have significant moderating effects whereby the direct effects of self-efficacy and network externalities on behavioral intention are influenced by gender and MP experience, respectively. Trust, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have important mediation effects.</p><p>Originality/value -This study fills the gap in the limited theoretical understanding of MP adoption in Indonesia. New theoretical findings related to mediating and moderating effects, direct, indirect, and total effects are used to discuss important practical implications of the findings.</p></div>

MP is efficient and convenient for consumers avoiding the need to carry debit or credit cards or cash. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Rolfe (2019)</ref> reported that in 2019 there were 2.07 billion MP consumers worldwide, representing an increase of 30% from 2017. The value of the global MP system market reached US$1139.43bn in 2019 and was estimated to increase to US$4690.65bn by 2025 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(MarketWatch, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In 2019, there were 355.5 million mobile subscriptions in Indonesia, and the number of mobile internet connections was higher than the total population <ref type="bibr">(Tomato Digital Indonesia, 2020)</ref>. By 2025, the number of Indonesian smartphone users is predicted to be 410 million,</p><p>The author is grateful to the University of Surabaya, Indonesia, for funding this research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adoption of mobile payment systems</head><p>with Indonesia having the third-largest number of smartphone users in the world <ref type="bibr">(The Jakarta Post, 2019a)</ref>. Despite global growth in MP systems, Indonesia is still at an early stage of MP adoption and the 47% of consumers using MP in 2019 represented an increase of only 11% from 2018 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Rolfe, 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">In 2019, MDI and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mandiri Sekuritas (2019)</ref> reported that the value of MP transactions in Indonesia was US$16.4bn which is equivalent to only 2% of Indonesia's GDP (US$888.6bn), and they estimated that by 2020, this volume would increase to US$30bn, 3% of Indonesia's GDP. Nevertheless, due to a large population and the rapid growth of smartphones and mobile internet technologies, Indonesia has a huge potential for developing the use of MP systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Marginingsih et al. (2019)</ref> reported that about 43% of the organizations investing in financial technology in Indonesia were focused on significant increases in MP systems for 2020. The Central Bank of Indonesia officially registered about 38 e-wallet mobile applications in 2019 <ref type="bibr">(The Jakarta Post, 2019b)</ref>. The top four were GO-PAY, <ref type="bibr">OVO, DANA and LINKAJA (CNBC Indonesia, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Many studies of MP are based on the technology acceptance model (TAM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Davis, 1989</ref>) and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. However, TAM and UTAUT may not fully address the unique features of MP systems. There are a limited number of studies on the adoption of MP in Indonesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Rosnidah, 2019)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Al-Saedi et al. (2019)</ref> claimed that from 2008 to 2017, only one study of MP in Indonesia had been published in a reputable journal. This study aims to address this gap in the literature. Particular contributions of the study include the following: an evaluation of not only direct effects but also indirect effects and total effects among constructs in the model; an investigation of the moderating effects of gender, age, income and MP experience on direct influences on a user's intentions to use MP; and discussion of the practical implications of the findings.</p><p>These are important aspects that have not been adequately addressed in previous studies. For example: if indirect and total effects are not analyzed then the analysis is incomplete and mediation effects are not detected; and only a few prior studies have considered moderating factors that influence the relationships between a user's intention to adopt MP and its antecedents <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Giovanis et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sobti, 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Handarkho and Harjoseputro (2019)</ref> appears to be the only study of MP in Indonesia that has considered moderating factors. Thus, the following research questions are proposed:</p><p>Q1. Which factors have significant direct, indirect or total effects on an individual's intention to use MP?</p><p>Q2. Does an individual's age, experience with MP, gender or income have a significant moderating effect on intentions?</p><p>Q3. What are the theoretical and practical implications of the results for these two questions?</p><p>The findings are expected to contribute to the still limited theoretical understanding of MP adoption in Indonesia. The MP providers may use the findings to better understand the important factors for consumers who intend to adopt MP systems as new innovative</p></div>

(2019)</ref> found that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived security, trust, social influence and facilitating condition were in the list of the top ten factors used most often to describe the adoption of MP systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Shankar and Datta (2018)</ref> argued that self-efficacy has a significant positive impact on consumer intention toward a MP. They also validated a strong relationship between selfefficacy and perceived ease of use. This finding is consistent with a study from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bailey et al. (2017)</ref> which concluded that self-efficacy has strong effects on both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Qasim and Abu-Shanab (2016)</ref> argued strongly to include network externalities in future research on MP adoption. In addition, the main dimension of culture, uncertainty avoidance, was found to have a strong correlation with trust in the limited number of MP acceptance studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xin et al., 2015)</ref>. Also, there were limited prior studies of MP that used moderating factors such as those introduced in the general UTAUT theoretical model of technology adoption, especially experience with MP and Income. Thus, this study includes all of these factors as the nine determinants of behavioral intention to use MP systems. Gender, age, experience with MP and income are introduced as the moderating factors that influence the direct effects of the nine determinants on behavioral intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Model variables and hypotheses</head><p>The following important variables and hypotheses were derived from a review of studies of MP.</p><p>Behavioral intention is defined as a measure of the strength of an individual's intention to perform a specified behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref> or to use products or services <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(de Sena Abrahão et al., 2016)</ref>. Behavioral intention predicts actual usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anggraini and Rachmawati, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> Adoption of mobile payment systems <ref type="bibr">Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2018a)</ref>. In this study, behavioral intention measures the strength of an individual's intention to continue to use MP <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Musa et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Perceived security is the degree to which individuals believe that their property and information privacy is secure when using MP <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fan et al., 2018)</ref>. Perceived security also refers to the perception of security against risks associated with new technologies, especially the risk of losing confidential data, which may lead to financial losses <ref type="bibr">(Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2018a)</ref>. Consumers must feel secure in order to enhance the use of new technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Oliveira et al., 2016)</ref>. Perceived security is a significant predictor of MP usage intention <ref type="bibr">(Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Oliveira et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Musa et al., 2015)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fan et al. (2018)</ref>, Perceived security has a significant impact on trust and this has been confirmed in literature reviews by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dahlberg et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Karsen et al. (2019)</ref>. The following hypotheses are proposed:</p><p>H1. Perceived security has a significant positive direct effect on behavioral intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2</head><p>. Perceived security has a significant positive direct effect on trust.</p><p>Trust refers to one's belief that all the stakeholders in MP systems (service providers, banks, vendors and other users) will behave appropriately to improve the security of MP <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fan et al., 2018)</ref>. A consumer will not use a system, especially a payment system, unless it can be trusted and providers have to be proactive in minimizing uncertainty about trusting electronic transactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2015a)</ref>. Trust is an essential determinant of the adoption of systems, especially MP systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chauhan, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arvidsson, 2014)</ref>. In MP studies Trust is a significant predictor of behavioral intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anggraini and Rachmawati, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Shankar and Datta, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Phonthanukitithaworn et al., 2016)</ref>. The following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>H3. Trust has a significant positive direct effect on behavioral intention.</p><p>Uncertainty avoidance is one of the six dimensions of national culture proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hofstede (1984)</ref>, which refers to the extent to which individuals minimize anxiety through formal rules and regulations. Not all of the dimensions are related to MP, but Uncertainty avoidance is a significant determinant of Trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xin et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Xin et al. (2015)</ref> defined uncertainty avoidance as the level of risk accepted by individuals when they are in uncertain situations. This study defines it as the extent to which MP users are willing to follow formal rules and regulations designed to minimize uncertainty on MP platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fan et al., 2018)</ref>. Consumers from societies having high uncertainty avoidance will use new technology only if it can be trusted. Indonesia is a developing country with a low Hofstede score of 48 on uncertainty avoidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hofstede-insights, 2020)</ref>. The following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>H4. Uncertainty avoidance has a significant positive direct effect on trust.</p><p>Network externalities refers to the degree to which the perceived value of MP increases as the number of users increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Qasim and Abu-Shanab, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Song et al. (2009)</ref> showed that the number of users who adopted a new technology is positively associated with behavioral intention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Nejad et al. (2016)</ref> argued that network externalities could be an obstacle to the adoption of services such as smart payment cards, e-banking and MP. The role of network externalities in MP is under-investigated. The following hypothesis is proposed: H5. Network externalities has a significant positive direct effect on behavioral intention.</p><p>IJWIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Shankar and Datta (2018)</ref> referred to self-efficacy as the degree to which an individual believes that they have the skills needed to perform MP activities. They concluded that selfefficacy has a significant positive impact on behavioral intention. They also reported a strong relationship between self-efficacy and perceived ease of use. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bailey et al. (2017)</ref> showed that self-efficacy has a strong effect on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. The following hypotheses are proposed:</p><p>H6. Self-efficacy has a significant positive direct effect on behavioral intention.</p><p>H7. Self-efficacy has a significant positive direct effect on perceived usefulness.</p><p>H8. Self-efficacy has a significant positive direct effect on perceived ease of use.</p><p>Social influence is defined as the degree to which people close to users influence their intention to use MP <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Qasim and Abu-Shanab, 2016)</ref>. Many studies of MP found that the social influence had a significant influence on behavioral intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anggraini and Rachmawati, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lee et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sobti, 2019)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Shankar and Datta (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Teo et al. (2015)</ref> reported that the influence on behavioral intention was not significant. Furthermore, contradictory results for the influence of social influence on the perceived usefulness in MP have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Shankar and Datta, 2018)</ref>. The following hypotheses are proposed:</p><p>H9. Social influence has a significant positive direct effect on behavioral intention.</p><p>H10. Social influence has a significant positive direct effect on perceived usefulness.</p><p>Perceived usefulness is a TAM variable defined as the degree to which MP is useful for paying for a purchase <ref type="bibr">(Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2018a)</ref>. In UTAUT, it is equivalent to performance expectancy. If users perceive that MP provides unique benefits then it is likely that they will use it <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Aslam et al., 2017)</ref>. In MP studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Lee et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sobti, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019)</ref>, perceived usefulness has a significant effect on behavioral intention. However, in other MP studies this effect was not significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anggraini and Rachmawati, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Phonthanukitithaworn et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Teo et al., 2015)</ref>. The following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>H11. Perceived usefulness has a significant positive direct effect on behavioral intention.</p><p>Facilitating conditions is the degree to which an individual believes that organizational and technical infrastructure exists to support the use of MP <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Oliveira et al., 2016)</ref>. In UTAUT, it is a direct determinant of behavioral intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. For MP it has been found to have a significant effect on behavioral intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sobti, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Phonthanukitithaworn et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Teo et al., 2015)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lee et al. (2019)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Oliveira et al. (2016)</ref> found that this effect was not significant. In addition, Wang et al. (2019) and Liébana-Cabanillas et al. (2015b) reported that facilitating conditions had a significant effect on perceived usefulness while <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kim et al. (2010)</ref> found that this effect was not significant. The following hypotheses are proposed:</p><p>H12. Facilitating conditions has a significant positive direct effect on behavioral intention.</p><p>H13. Facilitating conditions has a significant positive direct effect on perceived usefulness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adoption of mobile payment systems</head><p>Perceived ease of use is a TAM variable defined as the degree of belief that using a MP system will be effortless <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chandra et al., 2018)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref> it is similar to effort expectancy (UTAUT). For MP, studies have shown that perceived ease of use has a significant effect on behavioral intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sobti, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019)</ref>. However, other studies found that this effect is not significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anggraini and Rachmawati, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lee et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Oliveira et al., 2016)</ref>. After reviewing 87 MP studies published in the period 2007 to 2014, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dahlberg et al. (2015)</ref> found that perceived ease of use was the factor used most often and the same result was found in a similar review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Karsen et al. (2019)</ref> of 54 studies published from 2014 to 2018. Some studies showed that perceived ease of use has a significant effect on perceived usefulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anggraini and Rachmawati, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chauhan (2015)</ref> found that this effect was not significant. The following hypotheses are proposed:</p><p>H14. Perceived ease of use has a significant positive direct effect on behavioral intention.</p><p>H15. Perceived ease of use has a significant positive direct effect on perceived usefulness.</p><p>Moderating factors (gender, age, experience and income): Although UTAUT includes moderating effects, there has not been an adequate investigation of moderating effects in models of MP. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> identifies previous studies that motivated 32 hypotheses associated with the 4 moderators (gender, age, experience and income). Each of the four moderators is hypothesized to have a significant effect on the direct effects on behavioral intention due to the eight model variables shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. It is noted that there are 11 hypotheses for which there was no theoretical support among previous studies of MP. Consequently, these 11 hypotheses are considered to be exploratory in nature.</p></div>

The first iteration showed that the indicators for trust and perceived security loaded onto the same component. Also, the indicators for selfefficacy and facilitating conditions loaded onto the same component. To resolve these problems, perceived security and facilitating conditions were removed from the theoretical model while trust and self-efficacy were retained.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>The characteristics of the participants (Section 4.2) showed that they were suited to the requirements of the study and well placed to provide valid and reliable responses to the questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Direct effects</head><p>From the final model (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>), there is support for 10 of the 11 hypotheses about significant direct effects. Among these 11 hypotheses, six referred to significant direct effects on Behavioral Intention. Five of these were supported, and in decreasing order of importance, these effects were due to perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, social influence and trust. The direct effect of network externalities on behavioral intention (H5) was not supported. Compared to other constructs, Indonesian consumers place less importance on network externalities as a motivation for using MP technology. This finding is supported by a prior study in Sweden conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arvidsson (2014)</ref>. On the contrary, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Qasim and Abu-Shanab (2016)</ref> reported that this effect was significant in Jordan. However, as mentioned in their study's limitation, they used a small sample size (only 253 participants) that may cause some biases. Network externalities was also significantly positively correlated with behavioral intentions (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>). Thus, the effect of network externalities on behavioral intention still needs to be explored in future studies.</p><p>As seen in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, perceived usefulness was the strongest direct effect on behavioral intention, with medium magnitude. This finding is consistent with research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lee et al. (2019)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sobti (2019)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Wang et al. (2019)</ref>. This possibly happened since the data collection was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic, so that the Indonesian people's interest in using cashless transactions has increased to avoid being infected with the virus. Therefore, using the MP to perform their daily transaction is considered very useful for them.</p><p>Self-efficacy was the second biggest direct effect on behavioral intention, with medium magnitude, followed in decreasing order of importance by perceived ease of use, social influence, trust and network externalities. This result is in line with several prior studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anggraini and Rachmawati, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lee et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Phonthanukitithaworn et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Qasim and Abu-Shanab, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Shankar and Datta, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sobti, 2019)</ref>. This finding is possible since the percentage of mobile internet users in Indonesia is 133% of Indonesian people <ref type="bibr">(Tomato Digital Indonesia, 2020)</ref>. They are accustomed to mobile devices and feel capable and confident in using MP.  <ref type="table">7</ref>, all of the indirect effects on behavioral intention are positive and significant. Except for perceived usefulness every variable has at least one indirect effect on behavioral intention and all of these indirect effects are small with the exception of the following two indirect effects which are medium:</p><p>(1) Self-efficacy ! Perceived ease of use ! Behavioral intention is almost as influential as the direct effect of self-efficacy on behavioral intention. This finding emphasizes the importance of the impact of self-efficacy on behavioral intention both directly, as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Shankar and Datta (2018)</ref>, and indirectly though the mediator perceived ease of use;</p><p>(2) Perceived ease of use ! Perceived usefulness ! Behavioral intention is almost as influential as the direct effect of perceived ease of use on behavioral intention. This indirect effect supports the important direct influence of perceived ease of use on behavioral intention, reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sobti (2019)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Wang et al. (2019)</ref>, and contrary to results from other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anggraini and Rachmawati, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lee et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Oliveira et al., 2016)</ref>. The finding highlights the mediation role of perceived usefulness Each of the six totals of indirect effects on behavioral intention is significant. Three are small (due to trust, network externalities and uncertainty avoidance) while three are medium (due to self-efficacy, social influence and perceived ease of use). The total of indirect effects on behavioral intention is greatest for self-efficacy. The total exceeds the significant direct effect on behavioral intention mainly due to the important mediator perceived ease of use. This finding supplements the importance of the direct effect as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Shankar and Datta (2018)</ref> and again highlights the importance of an individual feeling confident in their abilities to use MP.</p><p>The greatest total effect on behavioral intention is due to self-efficacy followed in decreasing order of importance by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, trust, network externalities and uncertainty avoidance. This order contrasts with the order when only direct effects are analyzed (i.e. perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, social influence and trust). Using total effects is more informative especially regarding perceived usefulness and self-efficacy as well as network externalities and uncertainty avoidance. The direct effect of network externalities on behavioral intention is small and not significant but its total effect on behavioral intention is significant and medium. Despite having no direct effect on behavioral intention, uncertainty avoidance has a significant total effect. These results confirm the importance of analyzing indirect and total effects instead of only direct effects.</p><p>Apart from influences on behavioral intention, other results in the final model indicate the importance of analyzing indirect and total effects. Based on total effects the greatest influence on: Perceived usefulness is self-efficacy followed in decreasing order of importance by perceived ease of use, social influence, trust, network externalities and uncertainty avoidance. However, using only direct effects the order is perceived ease of use, social influence, self-efficacy and trust. considering only direct effects conceals the important mediating roles of trust and perceived ease of use in indirect effects due to network externalities, uncertainty avoidance and self-efficacy; Perceived ease of use is self-efficacy followed by trust, network externalities, uncertainty avoidance and social influence. Consider only direct effects the order is Adoption of mobile payment systems self-efficacy followed by trust which conceals the important mediating role of trust in indirect effects on perceived ease of use due to network externalities, uncertainty avoidance and social influence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Moderator effects</head><p>Among the 24 hypotheses concerning significant moderator effects in the modified theoretical model (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) only two significant moderator effects were found (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">8</ref>). In both cases, these moderator effects involving gender and experience were exploratory in nature:</p><p>For males, the direct effect of self-efficacy on behavioral intention was significant, positive, medium and significantly greater than the not significant and small effect for females.</p><p>For the group with MP usage ten times or less per month, the direct effect of network externalities on behavioral intention was significant, positive, medium and significantly greater than the not significant and small effect for the group with greater MP experience.</p><p>These findings enhance understanding of the direct effects of self-efficacy and network externalities on behavioral intention described in Section 6.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Contributions</head><p>The findings represent theoretical and practical contributions to understanding MP, especially in Indonesia.</p><p>Theoretical Contributions: Some of the findings are new, while others are reported in only a few studies or evidence in other studies is contradictory. Starting with the study's new findings, both social influence and network externalities have significant positive direct effects on trust. One of Hofstede's culture dimensions, uncertainty avoidance, does not have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention. All of the indirect effects and corresponding totals of effects presented in Table <ref type="table">7</ref> are also considered as new findings. Further, three variables (trust, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use) are found to be the important mediators in indirect effects. All of the results related to moderator effects of gender, age, experience and income are also categorized as new findings. Only a few studies have reported that trust has a significant positive direct effect on perceived usefulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anggraini and Rachmawati, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chauhan, 2015)</ref> and perceived ease of use <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chandra et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2018a)</ref>.</p><p>This study also produces some contrary results compared to previous research. Social influence was found to have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention and perceived usefulness, which is not in line with the studies conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Shankar and Datta (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Teo et al. (2015)</ref>. Another finding that perceived usefulness has a significant direct effect on behavioral intention is not supported by the result from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anggraini and Rachmawati (2019)</ref>. Several prior studies also did not agree with the finding that perceived ease of use has a significant direct effect on Behavioral Intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anggraini and Rachmawati, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lee et al., 2019)</ref>. Finally, a study from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chauhan (2015)</ref> did not support the finding that perceived ease of use has a significant direct effect on perceived usefulness.</p><p>Practical Contribution: The following discussions are based on the total effects from each factor that influences the intention to adopt MP, as listed in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>. By understanding the IJWIS factors influencing a customer's acceptance of MP, the MP service providers can develop strategic decisions to achieve success in increasing the number of individuals who adopt MP. As self-efficacy was found to be the strongest factor that influences the consumer's intention to use MP (Table <ref type="table">7</ref>), MP providers need to develop the technical knowledge that consumers need to use MP. Reducing the need for any complicated technical skills would be desirable as well as providing in-situ help for using MP and demonstrating MP payment transactions. The result of the moderating effect of gender (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">8</ref>) suggests that female consumers would hopefully benefit the most from these actions.</p><p>The other influential determinants of MP acceptance are perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, trust and network externalities. Consequently, MP service providers should provide useful MP features to maximize consumer benefits by continuously upgrading the MP system to enhance the performance (perceived usefulness). Moreover, MP providers need to take specific activities to ensure that consumers can easily perform a transaction by building kiosks in public services to help consumers use MP and designing MP systems and apps that are simple and follow standard rules (perceived ease of use). The providers should create a positive social awareness of MP by promoting MP on social media networks and encouraging as well as rewarding the consumers who promote MP among their contacts (social influence). Ensuring that MP systems are secure and safe should be paid attention to by the providers through investment in both hardware and software security and development responsive help support for consumers (trust). Lastly, MP providers need to inform potential users of the strong acceptance and growth of MP by offering incentives and rewards for consumers at well-known merchants and promoting the MP system as much as possible (network externalities). The result of the moderating effect of experience (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">8</ref>) suggested that consumers who frequently use MP would benefit the most from these actions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>The study aimed to address: gap in the literature related to MP systems in Indonesia; analyses of direct, indirect and total effects among constructs in a theoretical model derived from previous studies; moderating effects of gender, age, income and MP experience on direct influences on a user's intentions to use MP; and practical implications of the theoretical findings.</p><p>Section 6 presents a detailed discussion of the findings, which include support for findings from previous studies, new findings and additional evidence where previous findings have been contradictory or not commonly reported.</p><p>There are limitations to the findings. It was not possible to obtain valid measures for perceived security and facilitating conditions separately from trust and self-efficacy, respectively.
