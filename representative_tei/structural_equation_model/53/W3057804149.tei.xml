			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this study, we examined associations between university lecturers' perceived autonomy support (PAS), adaptability, organisational commitment, and psychological wellbeing. A sample of university lecturers (N = 102) from a single ex-polytechnic higher education institution in the United Kingdom completed validated scales for each construct in the spring term. Inspired by prior work in pre-tertiary education with schoolteachers, a conceptual model of predicted relations was developed and tested using structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings showed that PAS was positively associated with lecturers' adaptability, organisational commitment, and psychological wellbeing; however, adaptability was unable to influence these outcomes independently of its association with PAS. The findings extend prior work with schoolteachers suggesting that, while adaptability is of importance, its influence may be more salient at pre-tertiary level-where there is typically heightened regulation and lower autonomy-and less salient when autonomy options are wider, as is the case in higher education.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Over the last decade, the higher education (university) sector has experienced significant and wide-ranging change <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kinman &amp; Johnson, 2019)</ref>. This has likely impacted upon the mental health and wellbeing of teaching staff (referred to as 'university lecturers' from this point forward), which is reportedly of international concern <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Morrish, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Research is warranted therefore, that investigates factors that may influence healthy and effective workplace functioning in this ever-changing environment. In a recent study with high school mathematics teachers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collie and Martin (2017)</ref> found that being able to adjust ones' thoughts, emotions, and behaviours effectively under these conditions (referred to as adaptability; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Martin et al., 2012)</ref> and feeling that those in positions of authority (i.e., the school principal in this case) are autonomy-supportive (referred to as perceived autonomy support, PAS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1987</ref>) has a positive influence on organisational commitment (i.e., the loyalty an employee feels towards the institution that they work for; <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">McInerney et al., 2015)</ref> and psychological wellbeing. However, it remains to be tested whether these patterns of association would be replicated in higher education, where there are different occupational demands and where autonomy options are wider (that is, where there are greater actual/perceived options and fewer structural constraints). To fill this gap, the present study uses <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collie and Martin's (2017)</ref> model (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>)-that proved effective for pre-tertiary teachers-to examine the predictive roles of adaptability and PAS on the organisational commitment and psychological wellbeing of university lecturers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Changing Higher Education Environment</head><p>The higher education (university) sector has changed significantly over recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kinman &amp; Johnson, 2019)</ref>. For example, there has been a rapid rise in student numbers, increased internationalization and the adoption of new learning technologies and alternative teaching methods (e.g., online and blended study), excessive workloads, increased auditing and metrics (e.g., the Research Excellence Framework, REF, and introduction of the Teaching Excellence Framework, TEF), and more uncertain (precarious) contracts, to name just a few. Such is the magnitude of change, that university lecturers have often felt overloaded and under-resourced <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kinman &amp; Wray, 2019)</ref>, which has had mostly negative consequences. For example, in a recent report by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Morrish (2019)</ref>, involving 59 higher education institutions in the United Kingdom from 2009 to 2016, it was found that there were rising stress levels, occupational health referrals, and counselling visits, and declining levels of mental health and wellbeing, among university lecturers (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Morrish, 2019)</ref>. It would seem timely then, to investigate the interplay between the 'resources' available to university lecturers and the influence these may have on their psychological functioning at work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Job Demands-Resources Model</head><p>The job demands-resources model (JD-R model; <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Schaufeli &amp; Bakker, 2004)</ref> was developed to elucidate the relationship between work-related stress and negative outcomes such as job strain (e.g., burnout) and poor motivation (e.g., lack of engagement). Research adopting the JD-R model has been found useful in predicting a range of personal and organisational outcomes across different cultures and occupations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bakker et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bakker et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brough et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Huynh et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Schaufeli &amp; Bakker, 2004)</ref>. It has also helped to explain teachers' experiences of coping with demands at work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bakker et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collie &amp; Martin, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Desrumaux et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hakanen et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>According to the JD-R model, there are two major components (resources) which can influence the capacity for university lecturers to positively function (and cope with demand) at work; that of job resources and personal resources. Job resources (e.g., performance feedback, participation in decision making, social support; <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Schaufeli &amp; Bakker, 2004)</ref> refer to support (psychological, physical, social, or organisational) that stimulates personal and professional growth, enabling one to meet the demands of the job. Personal resources refer to personal capacities (or aspects of the self) that enable individuals to have a sense of control and successfully contribute to their work environment (e.g., hope, optimism, self-efficacy, resilience; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Grover et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The JD-R model proposes two key processes that help explain occupational outcomes (e.g., wellbeing, organisational commitment) from job and personal resources. First, job resources have a positive influence on an individual's personal resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Van den Broeck et al., 2013)</ref>. For example, research has consistently shown that high levels of perceived principal support (i.e., a job resource) is associated with an increase in teachers' personal resources such as optimism, work motivation, and emotion regulation ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brackett et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Desrumaux et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dicke et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fernet et al., 2016)</ref>. Second, both job and personal resources have been found to act as a buffer against health impairment such that chances of experiencing burnout are reduced. Such protective processes help enable positive outcomes to equip employees (e.g., university lecturers) in addressing their work demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Van den Broeck et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>It should be acknowledged at this point that there is a limited, but expanding literature focused on the impact of personal resources (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Van den Broeck et al., 2013)</ref>. Indeed, several personal resources have been recently investigated (e.g., self-efficacy, optimism, resilience; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Grover et al., 2018)</ref>. However, only one study to date has examined the influence of a relatively novel personal resource, that of adaptability (which will be elaborated on in due course). Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collie and Martin (2017)</ref> reported that PAS was positively related to teacher's adaptability, and in turn, promote positive workplace outcomes <ref type="bibr">(i.e., wellbeing, organisational commitment)</ref>. With respect to the JD-R model-and partially replicating the model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collie and Martin (2017)</ref>-we positioned PAS as a job resource, adaptability as a personal resource, and well-being and organisational commitment as university lecturers' outcomes. We introduce these constructs below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived Autonomy Support</head><p>Autonomy support is a social-contextual factor assumed to have an important role in enabling employee motivation, wellbeing, and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baard et al., 2004)</ref>. Autonomy support occurs when an authority figure (e.g., principal, manager) respects and acknowledges the perspective of their subordinate (e.g., teacher, university lecturers), as well as promoting choice and encouraging decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baard et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ware &amp; Kitsantas, 2011)</ref>. For example, PAS might manifest in practice where a university lecturer feels their manager is listening to and conveying confidence in their ideas regarding course development. Research has consistently demonstrated that when teachers experience high levels of PAS, this helps to foster increased motivation, engagement, and feelings of trust towards their organisation (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Collie et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collie &amp; Martin, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fernet et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Klassen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lee &amp; Nie, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Leithwood et al., 2008)</ref>. Indeed, when teachers have a greater sense of trust in their organisation, this is considered to be a significant predictor of their organisation commitment, and in-turn, their turnover intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Deci et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Somech &amp; Bogler, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>It is crucial that the role of PAS is considered as teachers' personal strengths (e.g., competence, motivation) may still not lead to effective teaching if their work environment is dysfunctional (e.g., over-controlling leadership; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Leithwood &amp; Jantzi, 2006)</ref>. Indeed, when teachers experience lower levels of PAS this has been associated with lower levels of wellbeing and may leave them vulnerable to burnout <ref type="bibr">(Fernet et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Nie et al., 2015)</ref>. In the current study, we examined university lecturers' PAS. In accordance with the JD-R model, PAS was considered a job resource because it helps university lecturers successfully achieve work targets, navigate challenging work demands, and enables personal and professional development (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Schaufeli &amp; Taris, 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adaptability</head><p>According to the tripartite model, adaptability refers to an individual's capacity to use strategies to adjust and modify (manage) cognitive (thoughts), behavioural (actions) and emotional (affective) functioning in order to respond to changing, novel and uncertain circumstances, situations or events <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Martin et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Martin et al., , 2013))</ref>. For instance, imagine a university lecturer is required to teach a new class (e.g., leading a qualitative research methods module when their experience is exclusively teaching quantitative research methods), which may cause them some initial anxiety. Adaptability may involve: regulating cognitions such as thinking about how one can modify their pedagogical approach, regulating behaviour, by seeking advice from colleagues who have taught such classes, and regulating emotions such as potential anxiety to avoid procrastination, plan effectively, and deliver teaching content successfully <ref type="bibr">(Collie &amp; Martin, 2016)</ref>. Although related to other constructs involving emotional regulation (e.g., resilience, buoyancy, and coping), adaptability is considered sufficiently distinct due to the focus on navigating change, novelty, and uncertainty, rather than adjusting from adversity or trauma per se <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Martin et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>We focused on adaptability as, noted earlier, the higher education (university) sector has changed significantly over recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kinman &amp; Johnson, 2019)</ref>. Indeed, as job demands are increasing for lecturers (e.g., excessive workloads, learning new teaching software, adjusting to a higher volume of student numbers; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kinman &amp; Wray, 2019)</ref>, this provides a timely and pressing need to examine the extent to which university lecturers can effectively adapt to such conditions. Indeed, adaptability has been linked with a range of positive teacher and student outcomes. For example, researchers have demonstrated that more adaptable teachers tend to be motivated <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Martin et al., 2019)</ref>, engaged <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Collie et al., 2018)</ref>, and adjust their practices to meet the needs of their students <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Loughland &amp; Alonzo, 2019)</ref>. Of relevance to the current study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collie and Martin (2017)</ref> reported that when teachers were more adaptable, they also tended to report higher levels of psychological wellbeing and organisational commitment. Moreover, the authors also found that PAS and adaptability were positively interrelated. Thus, in accordance with the JD-R model, when teachers felt autonomy from their principals (i.e., a job resource) this was linked to greater levels of adaptability (i.e., personal resource). Further, the authors reported that PAS was significantly related and indirectly related (through adaptability) to the teacher outcomes.</p><p>The current study provided the opportunity to replicate the findings observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collie and Martin (2017)</ref> whilst utilising the JD-R model (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Specifically, although adaptability was demonstrated to be an important personal resource in a school context, it is unclear as to the extent to which such a resource will extend to university lecturers. Indeed, there are some key differences between pre-tertiary and tertiary education.</p><p>For example, high school teachers often have less autonomy in following a strict curriculum; but are also required to be more reactive to student needs, thus demonstrating a heightened need for adaptability. In contrast, however, university lecturers arguably have wider autonomy options and therefore, the need for adaptability may be less crucial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>&lt;&lt;FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE&gt;&gt;</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The present study</head><p>To address this gap, and to examine the replicability of the findings reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collie &amp; Martin (2017)</ref>, we set out to investigate whether two resources-PAS (job) and adaptability (personal)-impact upon university lecturers' workplace functioning. Specifically, we examined whether PAS was predictive of adaptability, and whether both constructs were predictive of university lecturers' organisational commitment and psychological wellbeing. There were two principal research questions: Psychometric and descriptive statistics for core measures are shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and further elaborated on in Results. All participating lecturers were provided with a participant information sheet and gave informed consent prior to completing the survey. Participants were also given a debrief sheet after data collection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Lecturers' perceived autonomy support (PAS). We used <ref type="bibr">Klassen et al.'s (2012)</ref> adapted version of the Work Climate Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baard et al., 2004)</ref> to measure lecturers' perceived autonomy support. The scale comprised six items and was scored on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Subtle amendments were made to items to make them more relevant to our sample; for example, the word 'principal' ("I feel understood by my principal") was changed to 'management' ("I feel understood by management"). Cronbach's alpha in this study, was .95 indicating adequate levels of internal consistency.</p><p>Adaptability. We used <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Martin et al.'s. (2013)</ref> Adaptability Scale to measure lecturers' cognitive (e.g., "I am able to think through a number of possible options to assist me in a new situation"), behavioural (e.g., "I am able to seek out new information, helpful people, or useful resources to effectively deal with new situations"), and emotional adaptability (e.g., "I am able to reduce negative emotions [e.g., fear] to help me deal with uncertain situations"). The scale comprised nine items and was scored on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Previous psychometric work has demonstrated the reliability and validity of the scale, which has also been shown to function well when the three types of adaptability are combined into a global adaptability factor given their high interrelation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Martin et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Martin et al., , 2013</ref>). Cronbach's alpha in this study, was .94 indicating adequate levels of internal consistency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lecturers' organisational commitment. We used four items from Collie et al.'s (2016) adapted version of Vandenberghe and Bentein's (2009) revised Affective</head><p>Commitment Scale, which focused on the school environment rather than the workplace. The scale was scored on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Subtle amendments were made to items to make them more relevant to our sample; for example, the word 'school' ("I am proud to belong to this school community") was changed to 'university' ("I am proud to belong to this university community"). Cronbach's alpha in this study, was .87 indicating adequate levels of internal consistency.</p><p>Lecturers' psychological wellbeing. We used four items from <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Parker and Martin's (2009)</ref> scale to measure lecturers' psychological wellbeing (e.g., "I enjoy my work"). The scale was scored on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).</p><p>Previous psychometric work has confirmed the reliability and validity of the measure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collie &amp; Martin, 2017</ref>). Cronbach's alpha in this study, was .91 indicating adequate levels of internal consistency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>For preliminary analyses, reliability coefficients, means, standard deviations, skewness, and kurtosis were computed using SPSS Version 22. For the main analyses, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) were conducted using Mplus 8.4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2017)</ref> with maximum likelihood (MLR) for estimation.</p><p>The CFA comprised all substantive factors (PAS, adaptability, organisational commitment, and psychological wellbeing) and covariates (gender, age, and years' teaching experience).</p><p>SEM was then employed to assess the latent correlations among factors.</p><p>Several fit indices were consulted to ascertain model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>. We report the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA); however, due to concerns about computing RMSEA with smaller samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kenny et al., 2015)</ref>, we also report the comparative fit index (CFI) and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), which account for a smaller sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Byrne, 1998)</ref>. We also provide the <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Swain (1975)</ref> corrected RMSEA and CFI indices, which account for bias in fit when estimating complex models with relatively small samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Boomsma &amp; Herzog, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Herzog &amp; Boomsma, 2009)</ref>. Models were considered acceptable at ≤.10 for RMSEA (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">MacCallum et al., 1996)</ref>, ≥.90 for CFI, and ≤.08 for SRMR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Reliability coefficients, means, standard deviations, skewness, and kurtosis statistics for all variables are shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Reliability coefficients for all variables were acceptable, with all αs ≥.85. Factor loadings were also sound (ranging from .78 to .99).</p><p>Skewness and kurtosis values were occasionally high; but this was dealt with using the MLR estimator, which accounts well for nonnormality of distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>&lt;&lt;TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE&gt;&gt;</head><p>The CFA yielded adequate fit: χ 2 (36) = 73.46, p &lt; .001, Swain-corrected RMSEA = .096 (original RMSEA = .10), Swain-corrected CFI = .952 (original CFI = .947), and SRMR = .041. Latent correlations taken from the CFA are shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>&lt;&lt;TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE&gt;&gt;</head><p>For the substantive factors, PAS was positively associated with adaptability (r = .42, p &lt; .001), organisational commitment (r = .60, p &lt; .001), and psychological wellbeing (r = .51, p &lt; .001). Adaptability was found to be positively associated with organisational commitment (r = .32, p &lt; .01), but not psychological wellbeing (r = .32, p = .08). Organisational commitment and psychological wellbeing were also significantly associated (r = .55, p &lt; .01).</p><p>Turning to the covariates, the only significant association with a substantive factor, was between years' teaching experience and PAS (r = -.23, p &lt; .05) where, perhaps unsurprisingly, greater autonomy support was perceived for lecturers with less teaching experience.</p><p>Being a fully forward model (i.e., with the same number of parameters), the SEM fit was identical to the CFA: χ 2 (36) = 73.46, p &lt; .001, Swain-corrected RMSEA = .096 (original RMSEA = .10), Swain-corrected CFI = .952 (original CFI = .947), and SRMR = .041. The standard beta estimates for substantive parameters are depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. For completeness, the standard beta estimates for all parameters are shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. &lt;&lt;FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE&gt;&gt; Results showed that PAS predicted greater adaptability (β = .43, p &lt; .001), organisational commitment (β = .62, p &lt; .001), and psychological wellbeing (β = .47, p &lt; .001). Adaptability, however, was unable to influence organisational commitment and psychological wellbeing independently of its association with perceived autonomy support.</p><p>The covariates were also unable to make a significant independent contribution to the other variables in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we examined the influence of PAS (job resource) on adaptability (personal resource), and the influence of PAS and adaptability on organisational commitment and psychological wellbeing among university lecturers. We found that PAS was positively associated with lecturers' adaptability and was also predictive of organisational commitment and psychological wellbeing independently of its association with adaptability. Adaptability, however, was unable to influence organisational commitment and psychological wellbeing independently of its association with PAS. These findings will be discussed in turn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The importance of PAS</head><p>The first key finding was consistent with JD-R theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Schaufeli &amp; Bakker, 2004)</ref>, which proposes that job resources-examined here via university lecturers' PAS-support and stimulate personal and professional growth, enabling one to more effectively meet the demands of the job. University lecturers reporting greater (higher) job resources were also found to have more positive personal resources (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brackett et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Desrumaux et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dicke et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fernet et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Van den Broeck et al., 2013)</ref>; specifically, in this study, when university lecturers perceived those in authority (management) to be autonomy supportive, this had a positive influence on their perceived ability to adjust effectively (cognitively, behaviourally, and emotionally) in situations of novelty and uncertainty (thus, their adaptability; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Martin et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Martin et al., , 2013))</ref>. This supports prior work with pre-tertiary schoolteachers (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collie &amp; Martin, 2017)</ref>, and may imply that higher education institutions, and management therein (i.e., those with authority), would do well to recognize the importance of the role they play (job resources) in supporting the individual competencies of their employees. Specifically, providing conditions for greater PAS, perhaps in the form of greater flexibility of working patterns and workloads, autonomy over staff appraisals and increased assertiveness, would be beneficial for the lecturers themselves and, in turn, the organisation (via organisational commitment and wellbeing), and their students (the latter association with student attainment found in prior work-see Collie &amp; Martin, 2017-but not investigated here).</p><p>Moreover, given the direct effects observed between PAS and both organisational commitment and psychological wellbeing, it would seem that PAS may act as a buffer against health impairment and burnout and potentially supports positive psychological functioning in the workplace <ref type="bibr">(Fernet et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Nie et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Van den Broeck et al., 2013)</ref>. It could also be reasonably assumed that PAS enhances ones motivation, engagement, and feelings of trust towards their organisation (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Collie et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Collie &amp; Martin, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fernet et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Klassen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lee &amp; Nie, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Leithwood et al., 2008)</ref> which, in turn, may positively influence their organisation commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Deci et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Somech &amp; Bogler, 2002)</ref>. This key finding-that PAS directly influences adaptability, organisational commitment, and psychological wellbeing-replicates that observed with pretertiary schoolteachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Collie &amp; Martin, 2017)</ref>, and shows that this pattern of relations extends beyond pre-tertiary schoolteachers to university lecturers operating in the tertiary education sector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The 'Less Salient' Role of Adaptability</head><p>As a great number of changes have occurred over recent years in the higher education (university) sector (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kinman &amp; Johnson, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kinman &amp; Wray, 2019)</ref>, it was reasoned that ones' ability to personally adapt effectively to these ever-changing conditions may impact upon their organisational commitment and psychological wellbeing; although, this</p><p>had not yet been empirically examined in the existing literature. Indeed, this was theorized in the JD-R model <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Schaufeli &amp; Bakker, 2004)</ref> and demonstrated empirically in a sample of pretertiary schoolteachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Collie &amp; Martin, 2017)</ref>. However, this was not supported by the data in the present study, where adaptability was unable to influence these outcomes independently of its association with PAS. To explain this, it could be that adaptability is less salient in tertiary (university) education as, relative to pre-tertiary education, university lecturers typically have more autonomy, less strict curriculum adherence, and less need to be reactive (e.g., dealing with unexpected behaviour issues in classrooms). It could be then, that with wider autonomy options, there is less need for adaptability in the context of teaching at university. This null finding should, however, be treated with a degree of caution, as the association between adaptability and psychological wellbeing was medium in effect size (β ≥ .10; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Keith, 1999)</ref> and only marginally non-significant (p = .08). Alternatively, as the measure of adaptability in the present study was domain general (and the others domain specific), it may have failed to fully capture the nuances associated with adjustment to change in the context of one's place of work (university). Further empirical research is warranted to examine the replicability of these novel findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>In the study reported here, there are some limitations that will now be acknowledged.</p><p>First, there was scope to include a more comprehensive battery of assessments for the different components in the JD-R model. For instance, to measure job resources, in addition to PAS, we might have included a measure of performance feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Schaufeli &amp; Bakker, 2004)</ref>, and to measure personal resources, in addition to adaptability, we might have included a measure of optimism or resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Grover et al., 2018)</ref>. Second, all substantive constructs in this study were measured via self-report scales; therefore, there is the risk of potential inaccurate or biased responding <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Podsakoff et al., 2012)</ref>; although, this could conceivably be levelled at most other studies in this area. Moreover, as this research adopted quantitative methodology, there remains scope for more in-depth qualitative research, to help understand the complexities, trends, and nuances for individuals. Such research, may help uncover how and when PAS and adaptability operate, in relation to organisational commitment and psychological wellbeing among university lecturers. Finally, as the study reported here used a concurrent, correlational design, it is not possible to make causal inferences (these can only be conceptually inferred). Future research might therefore consider embracing mixedmethodology and using longitudinal designs, incorporating a more comprehensive assessment battery, to help establish the pathways of influence and elucidate the nuances that may be at play for individuals in this context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we examined whether two resources from the JD-R model <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Schaufeli &amp; Bakker, 2004</ref>)-PAS (job) and adaptability (personal)-are predictive of each other, and organisational commitment and psychological wellbeing among a sample of university lecturers. Findings showed PAS was predictive of adaptability, organisational commitment, and psychological wellbeing among university lecturers. However, while adaptability yielded a medium effect on psychological wellbeing, it was unable to predict organisational commitment or psychological wellbeing significantly, beyond its association with PAS.</p><p>Together, these findings extend prior work (e.g., in the pre-tertiary sector with schoolteachers) suggesting that, while adaptability is of importance, its influence may be more salient at pre-tertiary level-where there is typically heightened regulation and lower autonomy-and less salient when autonomy options are wider, as is the case in higher education. Moreover, there is a strong case here, for organisations, managers, and others in positions of authority, to attend more to job resources, such as PAS, as this resource is associated with important outcomes, such as organisational commitment and psychological wellbeing. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1.</head><label></label><figDesc>To what extent is PAS positively associated with university lecturers' adaptability, and are PAS and adaptability positively associated with university lecturers' organisational commitment and psychological wellbeing? 2. To what extent is PAS indirectly associated with university lecturers' organisational commitment and psychological wellbeing via adaptability? (RQ2) Method Sample and Procedures A sample of 102 university lecturers were recruited from a single ex-polytechnic higher education institution in the West Midlands, United Kingdom. All participating lecturers were based in the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences: 2% were from the School of Nursing and Midwifery; 29.4% were from the School of Psychological and Behavioural Sciences; 2% were from the School of Life Sciences; 3.9% were from the School of Health; and 62.7% of respondents did not report their School. Lecturers were 68% female and aged between 27-64 years (M = 45.29, SD = 8.49). The number of years' lecturing experience ranged from 0-37 years (M = 12.28, SD = 7.74). An email containing a link to the survey was distributed to all eligible lecturers within the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences by their respective Heads of School. A self-selective sample of university lectures then completed an online or paper-based survey comprising items on PAS, adaptability, organisational commitment, and psychological wellbeing.Demographic (i.e., age and gender) and other employment characteristics (i.e., years' lecturing experience and Faculty/School in which they are based) were also recorded.</figDesc></figure>
