<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The objective of this research was to analyze the effect of lifestyle, perception, satisfaction, and preference on the online re-purchase intention. The data are collected from 218 women consumers who have bought Muslim clothing through e-commerce (Hijup) and social network (Instagram) at least two times in the last three months. The data are analyzed using t-test and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The result of this research indicates that lifestyle has a significant effect on perception, perception has an effect on satisfaction, satisfaction has an effect on preference, and preference has an effect on re-purchase intention. Meanwhile, satisfaction has no significant effect on re-purchase intention in both models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>A rapidly growing human civilization is also followed by a rapid development of information technology. The current rapid technological development is caused by the presence of internet. Based on Directorate General of Tax (2014) Indonesia is the world's largest market of e-commerce. Indonesia is also the world's largest contributor of internet attack accounting for 38 percent, followed by China with 33 percent, USA with 6,9 percent, Taiwan with 2,5 percent, Turkey 2,4 percent, and other countries. One of the many products sold online is clothing product. Based on the Statistics Indonesia or BPS <ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref>, the Muslim population in 2010 is recorded amounting to 207,2 million people (87,18 percent). That percentage figure is the highest in terms of religion embraced in Indonesia. Accordingly, Muslim clothing has a big market potential in Indonesia. <ref type="bibr">Hijup.com, Hijabenka, and Fashion Valet</ref>  Along with the rapid development of information technology, currently there is a change of trend in shopping due to the lifestyle change and the increasing online activities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mowen and Minor (2002)</ref> state that lifestyle is associated with how people spend their money and how they allocate time upon the products they consume.</p><p>Lifestyle can be categorized into price oriented, network oriented, and time oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(KIM et al, 2000)</ref>.

The evaluation on the choice is based on the shopping experience.   This research consisted of two types of variable, namely latent variable and indicator variable. There were 5 latent variables which were measured using an instrument of questionnaire containing questions about indicators of those variables, in order to examine the hypotheses. The exogenous latent variables of this research were lifestyle (X1), while the endogenous latent variables were perception (X2), customer satisfaction (X3), preference (X4), and re-purchase intention (Y1). The instrument used in this research was the modification of the instruments used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jiang et al, (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mohamed et al, (2014)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULT AND DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Profile Respondent</head><p>Respondents of this research are dominated by women aged 25 to 34 years old with the percentage of 64.7 percent. The age of 25 to 34 year-old indicates that the respondents have been having a job and are probably married. Based on the consumer's age distribution, online shopping is mostly done by the consumer aged 25 to 34 years old who are called as Generation Y which according to <ref type="bibr">Stiady (2011)</ref> is the largest group of social media user. Generation Y or millennial generation is the generation born between 1980s to early 2000s. The older the consumer's age, the less they do online shopping.</p><p>The ones ages 45 to 54 years old rarely do online shopping probably due to the lack of information regarding online shopping media or their tendency of liking offline shopping by coming directly to the stores. Most of the respondents have the income of more than Rp 3.000.000. It shows that the respondents with such level of income have the ability (money) to do online shopping. It can be concluded that most of the respondents are upper middle or capable consumer..</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Online Shopping Behaviour</head><p>This research also observed online shopping behavior of consumer shopping in hijup.com and Instagram-based online shops. The online shopping behavior includes monthly online shopping expenditure, the last expenditure of online shopping, the last time of online shopping, time used to go online in a day, and products that are usually bought online. The data are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>.</p><p>Based on this research, the majority of the respondents, with the percentage of 43,6 percent, spend less than Rp 500.000 per month for online shopping. Meanwhile, the ones who spend between Rp 500.000 and Rp 1.000.000 per month for online shopping are 38,9 percent of total respondents. The remaining are respondents who spend between Rp 1.000.001 -Rp 2.000.000 per month for online shopping (7,8 percent), between Rp 2.000.001 and Rp 3.000.000 per month for online shopping (4,1 percent), and between Rp 3.000.001 and Rp 5.000.000 per month for online shopping (0,5 percent). The other 4,1 percent spend more than Rp 5.000.000 per month for online shopping.  In this research, 39 percent of the respondents have the last expenditure of online shopping of between Rp 100.001 and Rp 300.000 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). Judging from the last expenditure of online shopping, nearly most of the consumers spend more than Rp 100.000 the last time they did online shopping. Most of the respondents, which is 54,6 percent, have the last time of online shopping of less than the last week. The last time of online shopping for 25,2 percent of the respondents is between the last 1 to 2 week(s) from the time of questionnaire filling. Meanwhile, 12,4 percent and 6,4 percent of the respondents have the last time of online shopping of between the last 2 to 4 weeks and between the lasr 1 to 2 month(s) respectively. The res tof the respondents (1,4 percent) have the last time of online shopping of between the last 2 to 3 months.</p><p>Based on this research, the time used by most of the respondents to do online routine in a day is quite varied. There is no domination in the length of time use for daily online routine because the busyness of the respondents studied is quite diverse. Most of the respondents do online shopping to buy blouse and veil.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">T-Test Analysis Based on Shopping Media</head><p>The test of H1 to H6 hypotheses made use of independent t-test in which all dimension scores and variable scores were transformed into the scale of 0 to 100 to see the index comparison between dimension and variable. It is carried out because the number of question for each dimension and variable is different. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> reveals that the dimension of price-oriented lifestyle has p &lt; 0,05. It indicates that there is a difference in the dimension of price-oriented lifestyle. The average value of Instagram (4,65) is higher than hijup.com <ref type="bibr">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr">36)</ref>. It means that the respondents consider that the price offered by the Instagram-based online shop is better than the price offered by hijup.com.</p><p>In terms of perception variable, there is a real difference in dimension between hijup.com and Instagram, namely evaluation, transaction, delivery, and after-purchase dimension due to the value of p &lt; 0,05. Perception in terms of evaluation shows the information provided by hijup.com and Instagram. Based on the average value, the evaluation in hijup.com has a higher value than Instagram. It shows that the respondents regard that the information provided by hijup.com is better than the information provided by Instagram.</p><p>Transaction in hijup.com is considered to be more convenient than in Instagram according to the average value of transaction dimension of hijup.com (4,79) which is higher than the value of <ref type="bibr">Instagram (4,</ref><ref type="bibr">51)</ref>. The delivery done by hijup.com is considered to be better than the delivery done by Instagram-based online shops, based on the average value of delivery dimension. The delivery encompasses the aspect of suitability, quality of goods, and delivery timeliness. It proves that hijup.com always maintain its good quality control and stock availability.</p><p>In terms of re-purchase aspect, respondents think that Instagram is more flexible than hijup.com. In terms of satisfaction variable, the dimension of shopping experience satisfaction in hijup.com is better than in Instagram. It is probably because of the products sold by hijup.com are of good quality and are as advertised. The average values of dimensions of preference variable are higher in Instagram compared to the values in hijup.com. It indicates that respondents favor online shopping in Instagram more than in hijup.com. There is a real difference in re-purchase intention variable, namely in the three dimensions. Based on the average value, respondents think they intend to do re-purchase in Instagram rather than in hijup.com. On the other hand, there is no real difference in the access and search dimension.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Overall Model Fit</head><p>One of the weaknesses of SEM model is that it is sensitive to the large number of sample which will tend to generate a high chi-square value which causes the model to not having goodness of fit. Therefore, SEM provides the alternative use explain the data variance. Based on the analysis result, the value of GFI obtained is 0,90. It follows the good-fit criteria because of the value of GFI ≥ 0,90 so that the model is categorized as fit model. The Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI) is similar to the GFI but it adjusts the effect of degree of freedom on the model. The measurement of AGFI in both models can be considered as marginal fit because of the value of 0,8 &lt; AGFI &lt; 0,90. The values of AGFI acquired are 0,85 (hijup.com) and 0,86 (Instagram).</p><p>The use of other criteria of Goodness of Fit, namely GFI, CFI, NFI, NNFI, IFI and RFI, generates the value of &gt; 0,90 which means that the model generated is a good fit. The other measurement criteria of Goodness of Fit called RMR also generates the value of ≤ 0,1 which means that the model is a good fit. Because most of the criteria give a conclusion that the model is a good fit, therefore the hypothesis testing can be conducted. It also signifies that the data obtained from the questionnaire have been able to answer the developed theories. The measurement model fit indexes can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Measurement Model Fit</head><p>Measurement model fit criteria is measured based on the validity of each indicator variable on its latent variable.

It indicates that respondents feel comfortable when the goods the bought have a little possibility of damage or defect, are according to their expectation, and delivered in a timely manner. It is possible because hijup.com has a stringent quality control and an updated stocks according to its website. The products delivered must be declared to be not damaged and according to the online shop's website (MISHRA; MATHEW, 2013).</p><p>In the SEM model of Instagram, the search indicator has the top contribution.</p><p>It indicates that the respondents feel comfortable when they search the products they desire. Instagram owns hashtag facility so that it facilitates consumers to look for products from various sellers and they can choose the products as desired. The convenience in searching holds the largest portion of total variance, centralized on the user-friendly website, various choice of search, and the fast process of finding the desired product <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(JIANG et al, 2012)</ref>.</p></div>

The value of Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) is used to show how capable a model is to [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/] Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 United States License 553 INDEPENDENT JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT &amp; PRODUCTION (IJM&amp;P) http://www.ijmp.jor.br v. 9, n. 2, April -June 2018 ISSN: 2236-269X DOI: 10.14807/ijmp.v9i2.690    </figDesc></figure>

It is different with the SEM model of Instagram in which price-oriented lifestyle owns the highest contribution on the lifestyle variable. The respondents feel that in shopping in Instagram, price is the first priority. It is possible because the price in Instagram are cheaper and more diverse from various sellers. Such price-oriented lifestyle refers to the cheaper price of products offered in internet (MOHAMED et al, 2014).</figDesc></figure>

It indicates that the respondents prefer Instagram because Instagram is chosen as the main choice in online shopping. It also indicates that respondents prefer Instagram to hijup.com to buy Muslim clothing's. In the SEM model of hijup.com, the indicator of intend to continue purchase is the highest of all indicators of re-purchase intention. It shows that consumers only have the intention to re-purchase someday. Meanwhile, in the SEM model of Instagram, the indicator of keep making purchases is the highest of all indicators of re-purchase intention. It indicates that the re-purchase intention to keep making purchases exists in Instagram. Based on that comparison, Instagram is more favored than hijup.com to do a re-purchase.</figDesc></figure>

It is in accordance with the study carried out by Jiang et al, (2012) and Chao et al, (2008). It indicates that the more positive the view on Instagram, the more increased the intention to buy in Instagram is. On the contrary with the measurement result of the SEM model of Instagram, perception has no significant effect on re-purchase intention in the SEM model of hijup.com, which is aligned with the research conducted by Liat and Wuan (2014) in the University of Malaysia which reveals that convenience perception has no significant effect on online re-purchase [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/] Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 United States License 558 INDEPENDENT JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT &amp; PRODUCTION (IJM&amp;P) http://www.ijmp.jor.br v. 9, n. 2, April -June 2018 ISSN: 2236-269X DOI: 10.14807/ijmp.v9i2.690 intention. The respondent's view regarding convenience on Instagram and hijup.com is different. It perhaps due to the feedback from Instagram which is usually faster than hijup.com or web-based e-commerce. In addition, in terms of transaction of order, payment, and complaint, online shops utilize messenger (chatting) applications, such as Whatsapp and Line which enables an immediate response from the sellers. Such convenience felt by the customers towards the online shops generates the re-purchase intention.</figDesc></figure>
