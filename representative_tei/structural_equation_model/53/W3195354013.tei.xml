<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The interactive role of the ecological, architectural, biophilic, and sensory qualities of outdoor and indoor spaces in the restorative experiences of urban inhabitants is little known. We analyzed the restorative influence on mood states and situational stress related to exposure to vegetation proportion, spatial extension, landmark salience, biophilic architecture, people density, street visual access, olfactory pleasantness, and noise of 65 public spaces in a Mexican city. The environmental qualities of these places were analyzed with multidimensional scaling (MDS), leading to eight space categories (e.g., historic squares with biophilic architecture, large parks, street scenes, and interiors with non-biophilic architecture). Ratings of the restorative potential, mood states, situational stress, olfactory pleasantness, and noise annoyance were evaluated on such places and modeled through a structural equation modeling (SEM). The model shows that the restorative influence of the environmental qualities on moods and stress was related to a decrease in experiences of negative moods and perceived stress, and an increase of positive mood states. Based on our findings, we discuss design guidelines, emphasizing the relevance of including vegetation and built elements with biophilic qualities to create restorative environments.</p></div>

In contrast, recent studies have documented consistent dose-response positive effects of nature exposure and time experiences on indicators of physical and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hazer et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">White et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Jones et al., 2021)</ref>. Several studies have also provided additional evidence of the potential benefits of nature and nature-like infrastructure in common outdoor and indoor spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bower et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Martínez-Soto, 2019)</ref>. The latter encompasses studies on psychological restoration and restorative environments, which have a long tradition of validating the psychological, physiological, and social benefits of contact with nature-like settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Menardo et al., 2019)</ref>. However, there are some limitations on capturing the diversity of restorative places and the specific qualities linked to restorative outcomes in such areas. The studies on the impact of the biophilic elements that extend the restorative effects of outdoor and indoor spaces are not fully developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Shen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Marte et al., 2020)</ref>. We focus on a study conducted through mobile crowdsourcing to explore the quantitative relationships between environmental variables (which include biophilic variables) and their associations with restorative features of 65 exterior and interior spaces in a city located in central Mexico.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological Restoration and Restorative Environments</head><p>Psychological restoration is the renewal of individual depleted resources caused by adaptation of ordinary demands, such as stressors and challenging tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Honold et al., 2016)</ref>. Restoration involves short-term, mood-like outcomes related to physiological, affective, and cognitive states <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989)</ref>. A restorative environment is one whose qualities promote psychological restoration <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Hartig, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The psychophysiological stress recovery theory (PSRT) and Kaplan's attention restoration theory (ART) are the two dominant theories on restorative environments. Based on the biophilia hypothesis, the PSRT suggests that human beings have a predisposition for unthreatening natural settings because an innate preference for natural environments is an advantage for early humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Ulrich, 1983)</ref>. The theory argues that exposure to nature can automatically reduce stress of people <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Ulrich, 1983)</ref>. Nature post-stress recovery includes psychological, affective, and cognitive changes related to the recovery from excessive physiological arousal, reduced negative emotions, and an increase of positive feelings <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Ulrich et al., 1991)</ref>. Psychophysiological stress recovery theory relies on successful studies where active or passive transactions with natural settings show affective results measured through self-reported mood scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Huang et al., 2020)</ref>. The ART conceptualizes restoration as a process that returns cognitively fatigued people or a person with a high negative affect to a mental state wherein these affectations are reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Rydstedt and Johnsen, 2019)</ref>. This theory suggests that exposure to an environment with restorative attributes helps restore directed attention fatigue. Qualities linked with experiences of being away, fascination, compatibility, and extent are essential to restoration <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989)</ref>. These components quantifying the restorative potential are mediators between the physical environmental attributes and restorative outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hartig et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Lindal and Hartig, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Martínez-Soto et al., 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Marselle et al., 2016)</ref>. Recent approaches to evaluate the restorative capacity of urban environments have explored various experimental settings at acute and long cumulative mental fatigue or stress levels, considering brief or repeated transactions with restorative periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Pasanen et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Hunter et al., 2019)</ref>. These include contrasting nature vs. stressful and controlled environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Pasanen et al., 2018a)</ref>. Evaluation of the restorative capacity of urban environments has been conducted in need for restoration conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Jiang et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Stigsdotter et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Subiza-Pérez et al., 2021)</ref> and without the need for restoration <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cheon et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Kang and Kim, 2019)</ref>. The need for restoration is commonly induced by causing a psychological deficit of acute mental fatigue or psychological stress. The studies concluded that exposure to restorative built environments relates to psychophysiological changes associated with the restorative potential of a place. Namely, psychophysiological outcomes are related to an improved sense of relaxation and revitalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Johansson et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Van den Berg et al., 2014)</ref>, a decrease in negative and clinically relevant mood states, reduction in perceived stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Brooks et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Hazer et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bielinis et al., 2021)</ref>, and an increase in attentional performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Subiza-Pérez et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Research trends in restorative environments group into four categories: (a) comparative studies on advantages of restoration of natural vs. urban built settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Ulrich et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Pasanen et al., 2018a)</ref>, (b) studies on the exposure to multiple green space typologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Matsuoka and Kaplan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Honold et al., 2016)</ref>, (c) studies relating to the dichotomy nature vs. architectonic/historic built environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Karmanov and Hamel, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Scopelliti et al., 2019), and (d)</ref> studies in which architectural qualities of indoor and outdoor scenarios result in restorativeness beyond greenness <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Lindal and Hartig, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Subiza-Pérez et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>

These attributes have been consistently studied as predictors of restorative experiences. However, other environmental qualities beyond nature traits significantly contribute to the restorative potential of a place. The levels of exteriority and visibility, which promote visual and locomotive permeability, relate to the perceived restorativeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hauru et al., 2012)</ref>, the restoration likelihood <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Lindal and Hartig, 2013)</ref>, environmental preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Herzog, 1992)</ref>, the attentional performance, and mood states <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Huang et al., 2020)</ref>.

The presence of landmarks in urban spaces (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bala, 2016)</ref> facilitates wayfinding, promoting restorative outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Gatersleben and Andrews, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Pasanen et al., 2018a)</ref>. Human-made buildings that sustain various social and historic meanings could reach similar restorative potential as natural areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Xu et al., 2018)</ref>. Psychological or physiological impairment has not been observed in these spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Stigsdotter et al., 2017)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biophilic Design</head><p>Wilson (1984) borrowed the term "biophilia" from Erich <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Fromm (1984)</ref> to suggest that human beings possess an innate tendency to seek connections with nature and other forms of life. Such tendency refers to "focus upon life and lifelike forms, and, in some instances, to affiliate with them emotionally" <ref type="bibr">(Wilson, 2002, p. 134)</ref>. The concept of affiliation is equivalent to a trait measure related to the experiential sense of oneness with the natural world <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Wilson, 1993)</ref>. These sets of experiences are used to describe the deep sensations of exploring the natural and the cognitive and affective manifestations that arise while inhabiting such environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Appleton, 1975)</ref>. From the early conceptions of biophilia to the biophilia hypothesis, how greenery in built environments affects the human connection with nature has been the main topic of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Söderlund and Newman, 2015)</ref>. Biophilic design is an approach that attempts to connect people with nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Kellert, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Browning et al., 2014)</ref>. Several elements and attributes of biophilic design have been elaborated through the intuition of the designer (for a review of such attributes, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Kellert, 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Kellert, , 2018;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Browning et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Ryan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Sturgeon, 2017)</ref>, thus supporting the human needs of affiliation with nature through the design of indoor and outdoor built spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Söderlund, 2019)</ref>. Some psycho-environmental measures of biophilic design are included in the biophilic quality index by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Berto and Barbiero (2017)</ref>. Large-scale application of biophilia can also be found in the biophilic cities movement (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Beatley, 2016)</ref> and in the field of cultural ecosystem services <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chang et al., 2020)</ref>. Biophilic designers incorporate biophilic qualities (e.g., the imitation and use of patterns and shapes that relate to natural elements; <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Söderlund and Newman, 2015)</ref> to promote similar psychological benefits to those obtained with authentic natural experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Salingaros, 2007)</ref>. Recent work on biophilic design has investigated the psychological impact of nature-like features in built environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Gillis and Gatersleben, 2015)</ref>. These include mood and cognitive functioning improvement, increased positive emotions and creativity, and life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Ortegón-Cortázar and Royo-Vela, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Roskams and Haynes, 2020)</ref>. Experimental studies have also observed low skin conductance and decreased blood pressure and heart rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Yin et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Shen et al., 2019)</ref>. These findings indicate that an individual connection with nature could determine the ability of people to positively evaluate the restorative potential of a natural environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Berto et al., 2018)</ref>. The latter findings agree with the notion that while the biophilic affinity is focused on individual preferences linked with connectivity with nature, the restorativeness of the place is an environmental quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Berto et al., 2018)</ref>. Our research points out the role of several environmental biophilic qualities in the promotion of the cognitive, emotional, and physiological components of the recovery and restoration processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Rydstedt and Johnsen, 2019)</ref>. The latter suggests that PSRT and ART support the biophilic design practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(McSweeney et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Shen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Yin et al., 2020)</ref>. However, despite advances in understanding the physical and physiological effects of biophilic features in built environments, several researchers agree that further evidence is required to characterize such effects quantitatively. Existing studies have focused on measurements of the impact of biophilic qualities on the restorative responses and the overall benefits of biophilic spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Yin et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(Yin et al., , 2020;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Coburn et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Shen et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Aims and Objectives</head><p>This article identifies the biophilic design features and other environmental qualities in a sample of 65 interior and exterior spaces in a city of a middle-income country (Leon Guanajuato, Mexico). We examine the restorative influence of a set of environmental qualities that cross the barriers between the ecological, spatial, urban, architectural, psychosocial, and sensory aspects of places. A further step of this study is to establish an appropriate characterization of such scenarios according to these qualities. Along with the latter attributes, the study includes the evaluation of the places regarding their restorative quality, preference, mood states, and situational stress. A structural equation model summarizes the statistical links between the included covariates.</p><p>The research questions of this study are as follows:</p><p>Q1. How can interior and exterior spaces be categorized according to their environmental qualities? Q2. Do the categories of place make a difference in the restorative potential, stress, and mood states as perceived by people? Q3. How can statistical dependencies between the environmental qualities, the restorative potential, stress, and mood states be quantified through a structural equations model? Q4. What design guidelines may be proposed on the basis of the findings of this study?</p><p>As for Q3, we have proposed a conceptual model of the restorative influence of the environmental qualities of the places on mood and stress (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Our model departs from a social ecology theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Stokols, 1996)</ref>, which considers the categorical and dynamical inquiry about the people-environment relations based on three elements: the physical setting, the psychological process, and the psychological outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Stokols, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Werner et al., 2002)</ref>. From a theoretical point of view, the model considers the basic assumptions of ART <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989)</ref> and PSRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Ulrich, 1983)</ref> to explain the restorative effects of the proposed environmental qualities on mood states and psychological stress related to the exposure with indoor and outdoor built settings. The model considers several environmental qualities, such as vegetation proportion, landmark salience, and the biophilic qualities of the built elements. Olfactory pleasantness was included as an observed dimension of the environmental qualities. The model considers the components associated with the restorative potential of a place as those that indirectly influence the relations between the environmental qualities and psychological outcomes. This consideration is supported by evidence, suggesting that the link between the environmental attributes and the restorative effects is mediated by the perception of the restorative qualities of the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Hartig et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Lindal and Hartig, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Martínez-Soto et al., 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Marselle et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">McAllister et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Masoudinejad and Hartig, 2020)</ref>. We also hypothesized that the restorative influence of environmental qualities on moods and stress was related to decreased negative moods and perceived stress, and with higher feelings of positive mood states <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(McSweeney et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Huang et al., 2020)</ref>. Our proposed model implemented structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate how the model fits empirical data and infer the nature and characteristics of the causal associations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p>A total of 470 participants (out of 508 recruited volunteers) completed the whole activity by answering a survey and taking photographs of a place (262 females; M age = 30.95, SD age = 12.62; range, 16-68; 41.5% had university degree studies). Most of them were residents in the city where the study was developed (95.5%).</p><p>On average, the participants had lived in the city for 20.89 years (SD = 16.39). Twenty-three percent of the participants were circumstantial or occasional visitors. In contrast, 77% were noncircumstantial visitors that regularly performed activities in the nearby areas of the places. Inclusion criteria comprised selfdeclared health and normal sensory functions. The participation was voluntary, and all the participants provided signed informed consent. The Comité Institucional de Bioética en la Investigación de la Universidad de Guanajuato (CIBIUG) provided the ethical approval for the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the Setting</head><p>With around 1.6 million inhabitants (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía, 2015), Leon is the most populous city in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico, and it is the seventh most populous metropolitan zone of the country (Secretaría de Desarrollo Agrario Territorial y Urbano, Consejo Nacional de Población, and Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía, 2018). The town was founded in 1575 (Arias Padilla, 2020).</p><p>Looking for the representativeness of the settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">(Winkel et al., 2009)</ref>, data were collected in 65 exterior and interior spaces in Leon. These spaces were selected to include interior and exterior places, whether contemporary or historic, with varying proportions of vegetation, different uses, and located in quite distinct areas of the city. The spaces were selected using the methodology described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Medina (2019)</ref>. Most of the chosen sites are commonly used by people for leisure, shopping, and social interaction, but the study also included spaces like waiting rooms in hospitals and bus stations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of the Environmental Qualities of the Places</head><p>The present study subjects freely visited the place, answered different psychological scales, and took photographs of their surroundings. Pictures of the spaces taken by the participant volunteers enabled a panel of expert architects and psychologists to rate a set of 12 environmental qualities (three levels for each dimension). A study in which the raters evaluated specific psycho-environmental characteristics of places in situ (e.g., tree density, orientation, enclosure) is San <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Juan et al. (2017)</ref>. The environmental qualities were evaluated based on the multiple photographs of the places taken by the participants from standing or sitting points of view (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Google Street View and aerial photographs were used when the photographs of the participants did not allow for assessing any of the 12 dimensions of a place. The selected 12 dimensions measure the physical and social qualities of places that may have restorative potential and a positive impact on the health and well-being of people. These dimensions are defined in the following paragraphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vegetation Proportion</head><p>This dimension is the amount of greenery present in the environment relative to everything found in such an environment. This quantitative aspect of vegetation ranges from a primarily vegetation-covered environment (a high level) to a mostly built one (a low level). The intermediate level of vegetation proportion corresponds to places not surrounded by vegetation as in the high level but presenting a considerable amount of vegetation accompanying the built elements. The use of photographs to calculate vegetation proportion in places is an effective method that has been widely used. Green appearance percentages or GPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Li et al., 2020)</ref> and urban greenery <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Li et al., 2015)</ref> were measured through photographs. The latter research utilized a series of street-level images of a place obtained through Google Street View. In other studies, raters evaluated the vegetation proportion in situ <ref type="bibr">(vegetation cover, Otero Pastor et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">density of natural elements, San Juan et al., 2017)</ref>. A similar three-level evaluation of the proportion of vegetation is found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Chiang et al. (2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exteriority</head><p>The level of contact that a place has with the open air space. A place that is not limited by walls or a ceiling would be the best example of an exterior space (a high level of exteriority).</p><p>Contrarily, an environment surrounded by walls and a ceiling is considered as an interior space (a low level). The intermediate level of exteriority corresponds to the spaces possessing a ceiling but lacking walls, or the other way round. A dimension related to exteriority is that of openness: "how wide open the space in the setting appears to be" <ref type="bibr">(Herzog et al., 2003, p. 161)</ref>.</p><p>The term exteriority was used here besides openness since the latter is related to the visibility dimension also included in this study. Meanwhile, an inversely related dimension to exteriority is enclosure. In a study about streets, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Choe et al. (2020)</ref> suggest that enclosure goes from room-like to wide open. The percentage of an image covered by surfaces that block both human vision and motion (i.e., walls) is the physical attribute with the highest effect on enclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Stamps, 2005)</ref>. Enclosure is also influenced by the proportion of sky <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ewing and Handy, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visibility</head><p>This environmental dimension is the extent of the visible space limited by visual barriers that the observers encounter in a place.</p><p>It is related to the isovist area <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Benedikt, 1979)</ref>, the quantity of space visible from a point in space. Similar to isovists, the visibility dimension considers the extension of visible space in the horizontal plane. Because the isovist area is challenging to calculate through images, the approximate length of the sight lines (the distance to the visual barriers) was used to evaluate visibility. Places with mean distances to visual barriers of &lt;10 m correspond to the low level of visibility; those between 10 and 50 m are in the intermediate level, and places with distances of more than 50 m are in the high level of visibility. While evaluating the visibility of the places, multiple points in space were considered regarding the distances to visual barriers. The visibility of a space is evaluated separately from exteriority since an interior space may allow high visibility, as in some commercial spaces, while an exterior space like a park may have limited visibility, owing to the number of trees. Visibility relates to the dimension of visual access or visual permeability of the boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Stamps, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Stamps, , 2010))</ref>. A higher visual permeability relates to lower feelings of enclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Stamps, 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Herzog et al. (2003, p. 161</ref>) defined the visual access of an environment as: "how well one can see into all parts of the setting without having one's view locked."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Walkable Surface</head><p>The amount of horizontal or a nearly horizontal ground plane at people's disposal for their displacement through space. Following the concept of affordances by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Gibson (1968)</ref>, a place with an extensive horizontal area affords unrestricted and comfortable movement in multiple directions through a vast amount of space. A place presenting an extensive ground surface without barriers to movement is included in the high level of a walkable surface. The intermediate level presents environments with moderate extensions of ground and a moderate quantity of elements restricting the movement of people. Highly restricted environments regarding the ground surface in which people find barriers to movement in close distances correspond to the low level of the walkable surface dimension. Similar concepts related to a walkable surface are unobstructed pedestrian movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ayataç et al., 2020)</ref>, locomotive access or locomotive permeability <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Stamps, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Chiang et al., 2014)</ref>, horizontal area <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Stamps, 2010)</ref>, and built surfaces for movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Hunter and Askarinejad, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Landmark Salience</head><p>This dimension corresponds to the noticeability of an architectural or sculptural element observable in a place. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Lynch (1960)</ref>, a landmark is an external physical element, a point of reference in which the observer does not enter. In this study, such built elements acting as reference points may be exterior (e.g., a church, a bridge, a fountain) or interior (e.g., a stair, a distinctive wall or a roof). The perceptual salience of a built element is a required characteristic of a landmark, whether it be visual or semantic salience <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Caduff and Timpf, 2008)</ref>. The latter authors indicate that a landmark may contrast with the surrounding environment in its attributes or due to its spatial location. Landmark salience is related to the dimension of focality <ref type="bibr">(Ulrich, 1983, p. 99</ref>): "the degree to which a scene contains a focal point, or an area that attracts the observer's attention." Focality in scenes correlates with preference, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Ulrich (1977)</ref>. In this study, high landmark salience is possessed by places presenting a building or an element with a large scale or height, which is visible from most of the locations inside of a place. Intermediate landmark salience corresponds to places possessing a built element that is not so large in scale or is not so visible from the different locations in a place. The absence of a built element that differentiates from its surroundings corresponds to the low level of landmark salience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age of the Built Elements in the Place</head><p>The approximate time period in which such elements may be categorized, owing to their antique or contemporary style. The dimension of the age of the built elements relates to one of the biophilic design attributes described by <ref type="bibr">Kellert (2008, p. 12)</ref>, i.e., the historic connection to a place: "Buildings and landscapes that elicit this continuity with the past encourage the belief that the present and the future are meaningfully linked to the history of a place." Existing studies considering the age of buildings in an environment distinguish between old and contemporary buildings <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Herzog and Gale, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Herzog and Shier, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Ng, 2020)</ref>. Nevertheless, in the present study, the age of built elements has three levels. When a place includes buildings or monuments with old styles, materials, and construction systems, it is categorized in the high level of this dimension. Old-style buildings, in most cases, are previous to the modern architecture era, which, in Mexico, began in 1925, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Noelle (1993)</ref>. The low level of the age dimension corresponds to contemporary buildings, which are of relatively recent construction of around 20 years or less. Buildings that do not possess old styles and are not of recent construction belong to the intermediate level. Most modern architecture buildings pertain to this level. These buildings often present concrete, steel, and glass, and simple shapes devoid of ornament. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Coeterier (2002)</ref> found that laypeople judge the value of old buildings based on their formal attributes, while experts focus on historic data related to the buildings to determine their value. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Ledrut (1970)</ref>, laypeople do not have precise knowledge of the historic data related to the main monuments of their city; they are important buildings simply because they are antique. Following the results of these studies, the levels of age of the built elements in the present research consider the details and ornament of the buildings, i.e., their "historic" appearance, and do not take into account the precise data on the construction year and the corresponding historical facts accompanying the buildings. Therefore, the dimension of age of the built elements was evaluated, considering the point of view of laypeople.</p><p>Regarding the biophilic level of the built elements, four specific dimensions are proposed. Two of them are related to the materials of the built elements in a place, while the other two are related to their shapes. The presence of greenery may be included as a dimension of biophilic design, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Purani and Kumar (2018)</ref> did. Nevertheless, to assess the effects that the built elements have on restoration, the proposed biophilic dimensions consider the built elements of the places exclusively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proportion of Built Elements with Biophilic Materials</head><p>This dimension (shortened in the following lines as biophilic materials) quantifies the built elements in a place possessing natural or natural-like materials, which present color variations, irregularities, and tactile textures. This dimension quantifies the built elements in a place possessing natural or naturallike materials, which present color variations, irregularities, and tactile textures. One of the most studied natural materials in interior spaces is wood, which reduces stress, tension, and fatigue, while increasing comfort and positive emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Burnard and Kutnar, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Zhang et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Zhang et al., , 2017))</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Kellert (2008, p. 7)</ref> emphasizes that people prefer authentic natural materials over artificial ones. <ref type="bibr">Coeterier (2002, p. 115)</ref> indicates that while evaluating the beauty of a historical site, natural materials like brick and wood had a positive contribution: "They were experienced as living, warm, intimate, cosy and attractive; while modern materials like glass, steel and concrete were often called cold, dead, repellent or barren." The high level of the biophilic materials dimension corresponds to places with many elements built with these types of materials. The intermediate level includes places in which some of their elements are made of biophilic materials. Environments in which there are no built elements presenting biophilic materials, or there is a small amount of them, pertain to the low level of this dimension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proportion of Built Elements with Non-biophilic Materials</head><p>The quantification of elements in a place with human-made materials lacking color variations and texture, such as the glass and steel mentioned above. Places with multiple built elements that do not present biophilic materials are included in the high level of this dimension. The intermediate level corresponds to the places with some non-biophilic built elements. The low level presents environments devoid of built elements with nonbiophilic materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proportion of Built Elements with Biophilic Shapes</head><p>This dimension (shortened as biophilic shapes) is the quantity of elements present in a place with curvilinear composite shapes with different scales of detail. The biophilic design element called "natural shapes and forms" by <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Kellert (2008)</ref> includes multiple qualities of the built elements that resemble the natural ones. Examples of those qualities are botanical and animal motifs, shapes lacking straight lines and right angles, shapes similar to shells, spirals, eggs, trees, etc. The latter attributes have been used to evaluate the biophilic qualities of built shapes in the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Asim and Shree (2019)</ref>. Evidence regarding human preference for curvilinear lines and shapes has been reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Gómez-Puerto et al. (2016)</ref>. Meanwhile, empirical research inquiring about beauty evaluations for curved and rectilinear interior spaces may be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Vartanian et al. (2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Vartanian et al. ( , 2019))</ref>. Besides curvilinearity, another characteristic that biophilic shapes may present is fractality: "ordered details arranged in a nested scaling hierarchy" <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Salingaros and Masden, 2008)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Taylor (2006)</ref>, fractal shapes, whether those of natural elements, abstract paintings, or architecture, may reduce physiological stress. The three levels of the biophilic shapes in the present study relate to the varying degree of presence of the built elements with these specific characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proportion of Built Elements with Non-biophilic Shapes</head><p>The quantity of elements in an environment that are simple cuboid volumes lacking details. Modern architecture buildings often possess non-biophilic shapes. In the words of <ref type="bibr">Nia and Rahbarianyazd (2020, p. 66)</ref>: "modern architecture is characterized by simple rectilinear shapes, plain undecorated walls, bald facades and, oftentimes, dull colors, using simple elementary shapes, lines, and forms as a basis for design." Many existing modern buildings present those simple shapes. Nevertheless, modern buildings with curvilinear and more complex configurations also exist. The levels of the dimension of non-biophilic shapes correspond to the degree of presence of built elements lacking biophilic shapes in a place. As may be noticed, besides having one dimension for the biophilic level of the shapes of the built elements in the place and another for the materials, two separate dimensions for them are proposed. The latter allows a better evaluation of composite places such as those that present both elements with biophilic materials and elements with non-biophilic materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>People Density</head><p>This dimension refers to the quantity of people present during the survey in relation to the extension of the place. The three levels correspond to crowded environments, places with a moderate amount of people, and places where no people or very few people were present. The photographs taken by the participants are the only evidence utilized for the evaluation of this dimension. High and low levels of people density in a place are found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Cozby (1973)</ref>. Square meters per person and the number of people in the image are measured in <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Stamps (2015)</ref>. Meanwhile, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Hunter and Askarinejad (2015)</ref> do not measure people density but present four distinct categories related to people proximity in relation to the viewer (near, far, near and far, and no people present).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Street Visual Access</head><p>The degree to which the non-pedestrian roads visible in a place are close to the people who inhabit it. Environments in which visible streets are a few meters from the visited place correspond to the high level. This level of street visual access conveys the highest noticeability of parked and moving vehicles in the place. In the intermediate level, visible streets are around 50 m of distance or more. While the low level of this dimension is found in places where there are not streets close by and in places in which streets are not visible. It is a common practice in existing studies to compare natural scenes with "busy street" urban environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Staats et al., 2016)</ref>. There resides the importance of including environments with varying levels of street visual access in the present study.</p><p>Meanwhile, the environmental dimensions are specific and restrained evaluations of one attribute of a place (e.g., nonbiophilic materials proportion), the psychological scales allow to obtain the impressions of the place as a whole (e.g., how preferred it is). It is hypothesized that if the subjects evaluated the places regarding the 12 dimensions, similar results to those of the experts could be obtained. The olfactory pleasantness and noise annoyance evaluated by the participants are also considered environmental qualities, as are the other 12 dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological Measures</head><p>Three outcome measures were considered in our study. These are the Mexican adaptation to the revised perceived restorativeness scale (RPRS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Hartig et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Martínez-Soto and Montero, 2008)</ref>, the Spanish version of the profile of mood states (POMS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arce et al., 2000)</ref>, and the stress and arousal adjectives checklist (SAACH) <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(King et al., 1983</ref>). We assessed restorative potential of the place, using RPRS. The scale components are derived from the theory of Kaplan of restorative environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989)</ref>. The RPRS is a 25-item scale that contains five subscales: being away (five items; e.g., "This place is a refuge from unwanted distractions"; α = 0.76), fascination (five items; e.g., "This place is fascinating"; α = 0.81), compatibility (five items; e.g., "It is easy to do what I want here"; α = 0.75), coherence (four items; e.g., "It is easy to see how things here are organized"; α = 0.75), and scope (four items; e.g., "I experience this place as very spacious"; α = 0.81) and two indicators of environmental preference (e.g., "I like this place"). The participants responded on an 11-point scale from 0 (Nothing, does not apply to the experience described) to 10 (Completely, it does apply to the experience). Ratings for 23 items (excluding environmental preference) were averaged to measure the perceived restorativeness of an individual (denominated as global restorative potential, GRP; <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Martínez-Soto et al., 2014a)</ref>. Previous studies have shown that the RPRS is sensitive at the subscale level <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Korpela and Hartig, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Tenngart Ivarsson and Hagerhall, 2008)</ref>. Similar to other studies, our research considers scalar scores of 0-4 (low), 5-7 (moderated), and 8-10 (high) to describe the restorative potential of the place <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Berto, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Martínez-Soto et al., 2014a)</ref>. The mood states were measured, using the Spanish version of POMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arce et al., 2000)</ref>, for which the participants rated 63 adjectives expressing mood states on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The POMS consist of seven subscales, including vigor (eight items; α = 0.85), friendliness (seven items; α = 0.70), depression (14 items; α = 0.95), anger (12 items; α = 0.87), fatigue (seven items; α = 0.90), tension (eight items; α = 0.82), and confusion (seven items; α = 0.70). There are two options for assessing mood: the past week or now. In this study, the participants were asked to choose the right-now option. The SAACH instrument was used to measure situational stress. The Spanish version adapted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Ortega (2002)</ref> in Mexican population is an 18-item scale referring to the constructs of stress (seven items; α = 0.84), arousal (four items; α = 0.77), and exhaustion (four items; α = 0.72). The three subscales are rated, using a four-option response format: 1 (yes definitely) to 4 (definitely not). The odors of the city environment were measured through the sensory component of olfactory pleasantness and were rated using a single item "How pleasurable is the odor in this place?" 1 (very unpleasant) to 3 (very pleasant) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Baron and Kalsher, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Hedblom et al., 2019)</ref>. Finally, noise annoyance was evaluated through the item "How annoying is the noise in this place?" with the response options 1 (nothing) to 3 (very much). A description of the psychological measures used in our study and the corresponding rating scales are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mobile Crowdsourcing Tools</head><p>A mobile crowdsourcing platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Ruiz-Correa et al., 2017)</ref>, which includes a mobile application (called "UrBis"), enabled the administration of psychometric instruments in the field. UrBis allows app users to collect geolocalized multimedia data (photos, videos, audios, and text). UrBis users had to read and agree to the consent form to activate the app. The GPS location where each user completed the psychometric instruments was the only personal information collected. All mobile data collected remain in a Tier 3 data center at the National Supercomputer Center, sponsored by the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT). Data storing procedures followed a strict protocol that complies with the Mexican law concerning the security and privacy of contributions of users. Data minimization procedures enabled quantitative analysis requiring the safe use of GPS data. Minimization procedures include the use of GPS data with limited accuracy to prevent personal information disclosure. The UrBis app was developed for the Android platform (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). At the beginning of the survey, the participants were asked to complete a brief battery of demographic information (i.e., sex, age, the highest level of completed education, zip code for the location where they have lived for the longest, years of residence in the city, etc.). Correct completion of these data was required to proceed to the administration of the psychological scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection Procedures</head><p>Two trained researchers visited the 65 spaces. Upon arriving at the places, they approached the site visitors, explained the study objectives, and invited them to participate. Two eligibility criteria were considered: (a) participants older than 16 years, and (b) city residents and visitants that are frequent users of the place (tourists were excluded from the study). All the participants first signed the informed consent and received instructions in collecting data, using UrBis mobile app. Then the investigator asked the participants to respond to a survey on sociodemographic information. Before answering the scales, the participants were asked to realize a 3-min free exploratory itinerary of the place to allow them to observe and appreciate the place without any constraint (de la Fuente Suárez, 2020, in press). During this experience, the participants were instructed to take photographs of the place. Then the participants were asked to answer the digitized versions of the RPRS, SAACH, and POMS to report the olfactory pleasantness of the place, noise annoyance, restorative potential, situational stress, and mood states they experienced when physically present in the explored setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Jiang et al., 2019)</ref>. The average response time was 20 min. Data were collected between January 2018 and July 2019, either during the week or the weekend and mainly on sunny days (M = 24.6 • C; SD = 3.66). The surveys were conducted between 8-13 h and 18-20:30 h.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DATA ANALYSIS Categorization of the Places</head><p>A multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique was used to categorize the 65 spaces based on 12 environmental qualities.</p><p>The MDS is an exploratory data analysis that has been used in several studies relating environmental qualities and perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Green, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Coburn et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">de la Fuente Suárez, in press</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survey Data Processing</head><p>Data from 470 collected surveys were included for analysis. Cronbach's alpha was computed for each scale and measure to verify their reliability. Statistical associations between the categories of the place and the psychological measures (restorative potential, moods, and stress) were conducted through non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA) analysis of variance due to deviations of sampled data from the Gaussian distribution. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons, using the Dunn-Bonferroni approach, were automatically conducted for any dependent variables for which the Kruskal-Wallis test was significant. The significance level was set to α = 0.05.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Categorization of the Places According to Their Environmental Qualities</head><p>By performing a MDS analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), the 65 locations were grouped in eight categories of places, considering their similarity regarding the 12 environmental dimensions evaluated by the group of experts (Euclidean distances between data of the locations). The circles representing places in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> are closer to each other when they present more similarities regarding the 12 environmental dimensions. The resulting categories are (a) historic squares with biophilic architecture, (b) historic interiors and courtyards with biophilic architecture, (c) large parks, (d) small parks and other green areas, (e) street scenes, (f) exteriors with non-biophilic architecture and vegetation, (g) exteriors with non-biophilic architecture without vegetation, and (h) interiors with non-biophilic architecture. The utilization of MDS analysis allowed grouping the places in categories that emerged from the diagram on the basis of a set of environmental dimensions. The latter prevented that the categories of places were defined a priori and allowed for the discovery of categories that were more related to the particular nature of the studied places. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> may be noticed that six of the eight categories of places mainly correspond to exterior spaces (high level of exteriority).

In the same manner, large parks were perceived as less noisy than the historic squares (mean rank = 259.31; adjusted p &lt; 0.00) and interiors with non-biophilic architecture (mean rank = 296.38; adjusted p &lt; 0.00).

Therefore, biophilic architecture corresponds to the sum of the values of age of the built elements, biophilic materials, biophilic shapes, non-biophilic materials (inverted), and nonbiophilic shapes (inverted). All dimensions included in this composite variable are statistically correlated.

The positive mood states variable has an average effect (0.24) and 6% of the explained variance with a moderate effect size. The environmental qualities latent variable directly enhances (with a path coefficient of 0.73) the restorative potential (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>), which, in turn, has negative path coefficients with stress (-0.63), negative mood states (-0.34), and a positive path coefficient with positive mood states (0.24). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows an indirect negative association between the environmental quality variable, the situational stress (-0.46), and negative mood states (-0.25) through restorative potential. Likewise, the SEM also shows that the positive mood states involve the indirect linear effects of environmental qualities through restorative potential (0.18) (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref>). In summary, an increase in the environmental qualities values increases the restorative potential and the positive mood states (with a combined path coefficient of 0.17). It decreases the situational stress and negative mood states.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>This study investigated the restorative impact of biophilic designbased features and other environmental and sensory qualities of exterior and interior spaces on mood states and psychological stress in Leon, Mexico. This section discusses the findings of our study and future directions in the context of our research questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q1. How Can Interior and Exterior Spaces</head><p>Be Categorized According to Their Environmental Qualities?</p><p>A MDS technique was used to categorize the 65 spaces based on 12 environmental qualities rated by a panel of experts. The use of MDS analysis based on such evaluations allowed for generating specific categories of real places found in a Mexican city. The present study focused on the significant differences regarding the restorative qualities of the categories of place having different magnitudes of the environmental dimensions as they naturally occur. The holistic selection of the categories of place played a role in the significant differences between the categories regarding their restorative potential. Other environmental dimensions, e.g., related to the use or function of the spaces, should be inquired in future studies. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Restorative Potential and Environment</head><p>Comparative analysis shows that the type of categorized places affects the perceptions of people of restorative (global) potential, negative mood states (fatigue, tension, and confusion), and situational stress (stress and exhaustion). The category of large parks, which has the highest amount of vegetation of all categories, is also the one with the highest scores of restorative potential, being consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Giuseppe et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Lorenzo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Pasanen et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Cheon et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Kang and Kim, 2019)</ref>. Meanwhile, small parks present moderate levels of restorative potential, suggesting that the spatial extension and the higher vegetation proportion of large parks play a vital role in promoting a higher restoration. In addition, our data confirm that street scenes with moderate vegetation levels are related to restorative experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Masoudinejad and Hartig, 2020)</ref>. According to the results, environments with lower scores of restorative potential (e.g., interiors with non-biophilic architecture) do not present the positive attributes labeled here as environmental dimensions. The latter situation limits the opportunities to evoque restorative experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Evans and McCoy, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Lindal and Hartig, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Masoudinejad and Hartig, 2020)</ref>. Historic squares and small parks are categories of places with moderate restorative potentials. In the historic squares, the physical design attributes, such as landmark salience and biophilic architecture, could be working together with the cultural aspects related to the place (i.e., its historical value) to contribute to their restorative potential. In this study, historic squares are touristic places where social and leisure activities are present, adding a situational and social value that positively impacts their restorative potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Scopelliti and Giuliani, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Nordh et al., 2011)</ref>. The findings agree with the notion that both the biophilic qualities of the buildings and the leisure and culture possibilities offered by the spaces contribute to the restorative value of a place <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Herzog and Shier, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Herzog et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Weber and Trojan, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Coburn et al., 2019)</ref>. The typical dichotomy between the commonly low restorative built environments and the high restorative natural environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Verlade et al., 2007)</ref> needs a further re-examination when considering the biophilic, cultural, and social aspects of places that also promote restorative outcomes. It is remarkable that historic interiors and courtyards with biophilic architecture are the second category of settings with the highest restorative potential. The cultural and biophilic character of the latter spaces makes a difference in the restorative potential compared to those interior scenarios lacking these qualities. Our findings agree with other studies in which the restorative potential of cultural environments is similar to that of natural environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Xu et al., 2018)</ref>. In the future studies, the categories of place should be analyzed, considering the distinct dimensions that compose the restorative potential, i.e., being away, extent, fascination, and compatibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mood States, Situational Stress, and Environment</head><p>Assuming that the restorativeness scores may explain the mood changes in the studied environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Van den Berg et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Stigsdotter et al., 2017)</ref>, the outcomes showed that exposure to high and moderate restorative environments is associated with mood influences related to lower levels of fatigue, tension, and confusion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Lee et al., 2017)</ref>. The scores reveal that exposure to large parks and street scenes reduced some negative moods (with lower magnitude effects) but had little impact on positive feelings. These smaller effects could be related to negative attitudes toward the city <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Félonneau, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Galindo and Hidalgo, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Gidlow et al., 2016)</ref>. Regarding stress, large and small parks are less stressful than interiors and exterior spaces with non-biophilic architecture without vegetation. Concerning exhaustion, large parks and historic squares were less exhausting than the interiors with non-biophilic architecture. There were no influences of the environmental categories on psychological arousal states. Our results support the empirical findings on affective restoration outcomes related to vegetal cover <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Huang et al., 2020)</ref> in large recreational parks <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Kajosaari and Pasanen, 2021)</ref> and in studies without experimental interference <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hazer et al., 2018)</ref> related to lower perceived stress on such spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Hunter et al., 2019)</ref>. Based on the preceding observations, the following question arises: Are there other architectural or environmental qualities or other place categories that present stronger relations with particular mood states and situational stress? All the places studied here correspond to environments inhabited or visited by people on a quotidian basis, whether for leisure or other purposes. Those spaces possess a moderate to low-noise level and people density and are considered safe spaces. Nevertheless, several types of environments present in contemporary cities were not included in the study, such as the spaces around and inside metro stations, bus stops, or multistory car parks. In the future studies, including the latter spaces may increase the chances that the categories of places result in more significant differences in mood states and situational stress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensory Qualities and Environment</head><p>The results suggest that the spaces with nature: large parks, exteriors with non-biophilic architecture and vegetation, and small parks were perceived with higher levels of olfactory pleasantness compared with the rest of the categories. Our data indicate that the olfactory experiences with green spaces are as meaningful as the visual contact with nature to promote restorative experiences. Further field studies need to be developed to clarify these results (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Henshaw, 2014)</ref>. The results show that green spaces present lower scores on noise annoyance within the set of environmental categories. Our data indicate that lower noise annoyance scores in green areas (e.g., large parks) are related to higher scores of perceived restorativeness, which is in line with other studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Shaw et al., 2015)</ref>. A limitation of our study that should be inquired further is that it only considered the negative facet of environmental sound that presumably constrains the restorative experiences, leaving aside the role of nature sounds that enhance the restorativeness of the place and its psychological effects. Meanwhile, the participants were fully immersed in the places while answering the scales; the panel of experts depended on the photographs of the places to evaluate the environmental dimensions. The latter is a limitation of the present study to overcome in the future studies.</p></div>

How Can Statistical Dependencies</head><p>Between the Environmental Qualities, the Restorative Potential, Stress, and Mood States Be Quantified Through a Structural Equations Model?</p><p>As expected, the environmental qualities had an indirect path through the restorative potential.

Further studies of replication with direct and indirect measures of the studied environmental qualities are needed to confirm its restorative influences, considering more robust measures of restorative outcomes (e.g., cognitive and physiological restoration indexes).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q4. What Design Guidelines May Be</head><p>Proposed on the Basis of the Findings of This Study?</p><p>Planning a space by paying attention to the spatial extension, biophilic materials and shapes, vegetation, and pleasant smells guarantees the restoration. Following results of this study, it may seem that architects and urban planners should confront the unsolvable problem of designing built environments for people that inherently prefer the natural and despise the non-biophilic built environments. Not all environments are in contact with nature or permit the maintenance of vegetation. There resides the importance of the inclusion of architectural elements being designed with biophilic principles since they solve the aversion to the non-biophilic built elements and allow environmental restoration. It is important to remark that, in this study, the places with higher proportions of biophilic materials and shapes are those with old-style architecture (higher age of the built elements). Other studies could consider the inclusion of historic places without biophilic architecture (e.g., simple antique buildings) and contemporary places with biophilic architecture (e.g., parametric architecture works). In that manner, it would be clearer if what makes a place restorative is its historic value, independently of its biophilic qualities, or if the biophilic materials and shapes are what make a place restorative, independently of its historic value. Four dimensions related to biophilic shapes and materials were presented. More research is needed in which even more specific dimensions are inquired. The dimension of biophilic shapes could be divided into naturalness, curvilinearity, and complexity. Meanwhile, the dimension of biophilic materials could be subdivided into the naturalness of the material and the distinct tactile qualities of the texture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONTRIBUTIONS</head><p>This study makes important contributions to both the theory and practice of restorative and biophilic design. This research extends the empirical, methodological, and practical knowledge about the issues related to the psychological benefits of the built restorative spaces. Most of the research on restorative built environments has been focused on outdoor spaces, while research on biophilic spaces focuses on indoor spaces. The importance of the present study resides in examining a diversity of places with different environmental characteristics (including those with biophilic design) and restorative outcomes, expanding thus the knowledge of the psychological benefits of built restorative spaces. Likewise, this investigation incorporates both visual and non-visual sensory dimensions on restorative experiences, which resulted significantly relevant. To our knowledge, this is the first study where the place perceived restorativeness is linked with its olfactory pleasantness. Furthermore, an ecological criterion of validity was guaranteed by the method of place categorization developed in our study, which emphasizes the singular and natural characteristics of the places. Lastly, our study added practical recommendations since the psychological and environmental data that consider the ecological, spatial, architectural, cultural, and social traits immersed in real places will be of utility in designing and reconfiguring healthy environments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1 | The model of the restorative influence of environmental qualities of the place on mood and stress.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,48.50,69.99,238.08,223.68" type="bitmap" /></figure>
