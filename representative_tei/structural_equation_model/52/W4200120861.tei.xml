<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The stratification of the upper oligotrophic ocean has a direct impact on biogeochemistry by regulating the components of the upper-ocean environment that are critical to biological productivity, such as light availability for photosynthesis and nutrient supply from the deep ocean. We investigated the spatial distribution pattern and diversity of phytoplankton communities in the western Pacific Ocean (WPO) in the autumn of 2016, 2017, and 2018. Our results showed the phytoplankton community structure mainly consisted of cyanobacteria, diatoms, and dinoflagellates, while the abundance of Chrysophyceae was negligible. Phytoplankton abundance was high from the equatorial region to 10 • N and decreased with increasing latitude in spatial distribution. Phytoplankton also showed a strong variation in the vertical distribution. The potential influences of physicochemical parameters on phytoplankton abundance were analyzed by a structural equation model (SEM) to determine nutrient ratios driven by vertical stratification to regulate phytoplankton community structure in the typical oligotrophic ocean. Regions with strong vertical stratification were more favorable for cyanobacteria, whereas weak vertical stratification was more conducive to diatoms and dinoflagellates.</p><p>Our study shows that stratification is a major determinant of phytoplankton community structure and highlights that physical processes in the ocean control phytoplankton community structure by driving the balance of chemical elements, providing a database to better predict models of changes in phytoplankton community structure under future ocean scenarios.</p></div>

Previous studies have shown that net primary production (NPP) shows a stronger linear decrease with stronger vertical stratification and a significant decrease in surface nitrate and phosphate concentrations.

The purpose of this study is to determine the community composition mechanisms that drive phytoplankton in the oligotrophic region. These mechanisms are related to vertical stratification and nutrient ratios. We explored how vertical stratification affects the composition of phytoplankton communities.

In general, the temperature increased with decreasing latitude, and the stations near the Equator exhibited the highest temperature; in contrast, the salinity showed an opposite trend to that of temperature, with a high value from 15 to 20 • N. The surface temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) of the surveyed area in 2016 ranged from 28.58  The distribution of the VSI in latitude for the three cruises is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Overall, the VSI showed a similar distribution pattern in the three cruises, with the highest value occurring at 7-8 • N and a decreasing trend with increasing latitude. In the 2016 cruise (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>), the minimum value of VSI (2.54) appeared in the station at 20 • N (station 16-B4), and the maximum value (4.94) appeared in the station at 7 • N (station 16-A11), with an average of 3.90 ± 0.76. In the 2017 cruise (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>), a minimum value of VSI (2.85) appeared in the station at 18 • N (station 17-B4), and the maximum value (5.54) appeared in the station at 7 • N (station 17-A14), with an average of 4.30 ± 0.82. In the 2018 cruise (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>), the minimum value of VSI (2.50) occurred in the station at 18 • N (station 18-B1), and the maximum value (5.48) oc-curred in the station at 8 • N (station 18-A14), with an average of 4.01 ± 0.95. Interestingly, the VSI varied significantly across latitudinal regions; the VSI was high from the Equator to 10 • N, while it was low at 10-20 • N.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Interannual variation of phytoplankton communities</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>, b, and c show the horizontal distribution of surface phytoplankton abundance from 2016 to 2018. The interannual variation in phytoplankton was relatively stable, and the sampling area and sampling time from 2016 to 2018 were generally consistent. Most phytoplankton species varied little from year to year in their distribution. Phytoplankton distribution showed a trend of decreasing abundance from the Equator to the north with a minor abundance peak at about 10 • N. This abundance peak was associated with the predominance of Trichodesmium. However, affected by coastal currents, high-abundance patches dominated by diatoms were also observed in the Luzon Strait area south of Taiwan, which were carried to the surface by upwelling currents and accounted for more than 67.76 % of the abundance at this station. Relatively high abundances were observed at stations in the Kuroshio Current extension region, consisting mainly of cosmopolitan and warm-water species. Phytoplankton abundance was the lowest in the high-latitude region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Vertical distribution of phytoplankton abundance</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the vertical distribution of the phytoplankton. The overall trend in the WPO was consistent across the three cruises in 2016 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>), 2017 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>), and 2018 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>), with the phytoplankton distribution showing variations with latitude and differences in vertical distribution at depth. In terms of latitude, high-phytoplankton-value areas were concentrated near the Equator (0-8 • E). Vertical distribution of phytoplankton indicated that the plankton-abundant areas occurred from 0-50 m, and the phytoplankton abundance gradually decreased with the increase in depth. Vertical distribution of phytoplankton abundance differed significantly across different areas. In the areas near the Equator affected by the Halmahera Eddy (HE) and Mindanao Eddy (ME), phytoplankton abundance was mainly concentrated in the upper water column (0-50 m) and consisted mainly of cyanobacteria. In the northern area affected by the Kuroshio Current, the lower phytoplankton abundance was mostly dominated by the equatorial stations, while the phytoplankton species composition was mostly dominated by diatoms and dinoflagellates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Phytoplankton community structure</head><p>Since there was little interannual difference between species, we clustered all species based on Bray-Curtis similarity distance for stations, and the results showed four distinct regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). Cluster analysis divided the phytoplankton  communities at the sampling sites over 3 years into four groups. Cyanobacteria (&gt; 90 %) were the dominant species in Groups A and B. The species ratio of diatoms to dinoflagellates in Group A (dias: dinos = 4.8) was higher than that in Group B (dias: dinos = 1.4). Cyanobacteria were the dominant (66 %) phytoplankton at the stations of Group C, while diatoms (18 %) and dinoflagellates (14 %) constituted 32 % of the population in this group. Diatoms (43 %) and dinoflagellates (49 %) dominated the stations in Group D, accounting for approximately 92 % of the total phytoplankton. The proportion of Chrysophyceae was low in all four groups (Table 1). The dendrogram showed that these populations were grouped into four groups that were essentially identical to those determined by PCoA analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Relationships between phytoplankton and environmental factors</head><p>The relationship between phytoplankton and environmental factors was analyzed using RDA. We obtained a twodimensional distribution map of the species, sample distribution, and environmental factors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>). The results showed that different phytoplankton classes were correlated differently with environmental factors. Cyanobacteria showed negative correlations with temperature and salinity and positive correlations with VSI and nutrient concentration, indicating that waters with high VSI are suitable for the growth of cyanobacteria (mostly Trichodesmium). Diatoms and dinoflagellates exhibited positive correlations with temperature and salinity and negative correlations with VSI and nutrient concentration, indicating that diatoms and dinoflagellates prefer waters with low VSI. There were four distinct phytoplankton communities in the WPO: Group A was distributed in the equatorial region with clear vertical stratification. This community is characterized by high abundance and is dominated by Trichodesmium species such as T. thiebautii, T. hildebrandtii, and T. erythraeum, which are positively correlated with high concentrations of DIN, phosphate, and silicate. Group B was located near 8 • N and is mainly influenced by the NECC and mesoscale eddies; the phytoplankton community was represented by warm-water species, similar to that of Group A. Group C was mainly distributed in the 15 • N region and was strongly influenced by the NEC. Group D was mainly distributed in the 20 • N region, where it was directly influenced by the Kuroshio Current; here, the phytoplankton community was positively correlated with temperature and salinity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Temperature, salinity, and vertical stratification index</head><p>The temperature, salinity, and VSI of the four groups are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. The temperature and salinity (T -S) box diagram depicts the four main water masses in the WPO.    age 34.4) were high (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9a</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> shows clear variation in T -S, and we also calculated the vertical stratification index of the four groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9b</ref>). Compared with Groups C (average 3.86) and D (average 3.54), the values of VSI in Groups A (average 4.69) and B (average 4.86) were markedly higher, and Group A had the highest VSI. The stratification of the first two groups was more pronounced (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). The vertical stratification index was related to temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9a</ref>) and salinity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9b</ref>). Temperature is positively correlated with the vertical stratification index. The VSI of all groups was negatively correlated with salinity. The changes in temperature and salinity were most pronounced in the vertical direction. In Groups A and B with a high stratification index, the changes in temperature and salinity within the group were small. However, the temperature and salinity changed significantly within Groups C and D, with a small stratification index.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Direct vs. indirect effects of environmental parameters on phytoplankton abundance</head><p>The causal relationships between measured phytoplankton abundance and relevant physical and chemical parameters were examined using SEM, focusing on interactions between temperature, salinity, VSI, DIN, and DIP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>) as theoretical and experimental data indicated the importance of these variables. The model results showed that temperature, DIP, and DIN had a direct effect on phytoplankton abundance, with temperature having the largest direct effect on phytoplankton abundance (0.38), followed by DIN (0.28) and DIP (0.24). Temperature, salinity, and VSI had indirect effects on phytoplankton abundance, with temperature and salinity having negative indirect effects on phytoplankton abundance (-0.17 and -0.30) and VSI having positive indirect effects (0.31) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>). From the results of the total effect, only salinity had a negative effect on phytoplankton abundance (-0.30), while both temperature and VSI had positive effects on phytoplankton abundance (0.20 and 0.31), with VSI having the largest total effect. Although the direct effect of temperature on phytoplankton abundance was significant, it was partially offset by the indirect negative effect, while VSI had no direct effect on phytoplankton abundance, but its larger indirect effect resulted in the largest total effect. Both DIN and DIP had positive effects on phytoplankton abundance, but the effect of DIN was greater. Since the vertical distribution of DIN and DIP exhibited stronger variability, more specific analyses of DIN and DIP will be conducted later. We analyzed the N : P ratio of the surface layer, the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) layer, and at 200 m.</p><p>The N : P ratio in the surface layer (N : P &gt; 16 : 1) indicates phosphorus limitation, which is consistent with the SEM analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>). The trophic structure of the SCM layer changed, N : P &lt; 16 : 1 indicated nitrogen limitation, and the depth continued to increase to the bottom of the euphotic layer and stabilized around N :P = 16 : 1, indicating that at the bottom of the euphotic layer, as phytoplankton abundance decreased and interspecific competition decreased, the trophic ratio approached the Redfield ratio and growth may have become increasingly limited by light.</p></div>

Previous surveys have provided less knowledge of the phytoplankton community structure in this study area (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Previously, samples were collected by net, and net-collected samples reduced phytoplankton abundance in small volumes, thereby underestimating the phytoplankton abundance in the ocean under investigation. In the present study, phytoplankton samples were collected from water samples, which better reflected the phytoplankton community structure and abundance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sun et al. (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Liu et al. (2000)</ref> further investigated the species composition and abundance distribution of phytoplankton diatoms and dinoflagellates in the Ryukyu Islands and nearby waters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Li et al.

Previous studies have mostly focused on vertical hauls and the horizontal distribution of phytoplankton throughout the water column while ignoring the effect of vertical stratification on phytoplankton.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Relationship between N : P ratio and vertical distribution of phytoplankton</head><p>Research into the factors that control the structure of the phytoplankton community has been carried out for decades, but the hypothesis of nutrient concentration limits and ratios has not been fully explained in terms of affecting the structure of the phytoplankton community <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gao et al., 2019)</ref>. As diatoms and dinoflagellates show great differences in cell morphology, structure, and nutrition mode, they differ greatly in their nutrient acquisition strategies. Several studies have revealed that dinoflagellates use mixotrophy, engulfing prey and feeding using peduncles and pallia, while phosphorus limitation is a common factor stimulating dinoflagellates to ingest particulate nutrients <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Huang et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Smayda, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Stoecker, 1999)</ref>. The variation in phytoplankton community structure is always correlated with fluctuations in physicochemical environmental parameters.</p><p>In the four groups we studied, surface seawater N : P &gt; 16 : 1 indicated that phosphorus in surface seawater was limited but that Trichodesmium relied on its own nitrogen fixation function and was highly abundant in oligotrophic waters (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). The relationship between Tri- chodesmium and nitrogen fixation has already been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Grosskopf et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Luo et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Zehr, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The virtual absence nitrogen limitation in surface seawater in Group D was consistent with the low abundance of Trichodesmium, which was consistent with studies on the abundance of Trichodesmium in the region <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chen et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Sohm et al., 2011)</ref>. In the WPO, the most oligotrophic ocean in the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hansell and Feely, 2000)</ref>, nutrients have become an important factor that determines the distribution of phytoplankton. Under nutrition-limited conditions, diatoms and dinoflagellates are more affected, especially under phosphorus limitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Egge, 1998)</ref>, which corresponds to the high abundance of Group D diatoms and dinoflagellates. In the present study, the vertical pattern of N : P ratios indicated differences in nutrient composition along the vertical gradient. The N : P ratio of the surface layer (N : P &gt; 16 : 1) indicates phosphorus limitation. The structure of nutrients in the SCM layer changed, and (N : P &lt; 16 : 1) indicates nitrogen limitation. The depth continued to increase to the bottom of the euphotic layer and was stable near (N : P = 16 : 1), indicating that at the bottom of the euphotic layer, where there is decreasing phytoplankton abundance, interspecific competition is reduced as light limitation kicks in, and the nutrient ratio approaches the Redfield ratio. The differences in nutrient ratios thus affect the vertical distribution patterns of phytoplankton abundance. Diatoms have higher phosphorus requirements than other phytoplankton groups, which may be reflected by the lower N : P ratio in diatoms than in other groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hillebrand et al., 2013)</ref>. Iron is essential for the synthesis of nitrogen-fixing enzymes in Trichodesmium, and Trichodesmium has a higher demand for iron than other planktonic organisms. The main source of iron in the open ocean is atmospheric deposition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Duce and Tindale (1991)</ref> showed that the flux of iron deposition is higher in the WPO, and thus iron is an important environmental limiting factor for the growth of Trichodesmium in addition to temperature. We suggest that some of the sampled phytoplankton may have recently sunk from the upper layers and therefore represents nutrient rationing and T -S in the water layers. Directly sinking phytoplankton cells are major contributors to surface carbon export and an important component of ocean carbon sink <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Boyd and Newton, 1999)</ref>. The phytoplankton cells can regulate their sinking rates in a variety of ways, such as via their physiological state <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Eppley et al., 1967)</ref>, morphology <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Pitcher et al., 1989)</ref>, interaction with light <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bienfang, 1981)</ref>, and interaction with environmental factors such as temperature and nutrients <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Titman and Kilham, 1976)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Vertical stratification determined the vertical distribution of phytoplankton</head><p>The WPO is a oligotrophic area with strong stratification. We found that the interannual variation of phytoplankton was not significant. It remained stably oligotrophic, and the vertical stratification structure determined that of environmental resources such as nutrients, thus forming four contrasting environments, each with its characteristic phytoplankton community structure. Comparative analysis of the phytoplankton community composition of the four groups showed that the phytoplankton was mainly strongly affected by the vertical stratification, which corresponds to previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bouman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hidalgo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Mojica et al., 2015)</ref>. Vertical stratification limits the replenishment of nutrients from the deep layer below the thermocline, which affects the N : P ratio and restricts vertical migration in addition to physiologically affecting the vertical structure of phytoplankton growth and mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gupta et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In the present study, Trichodesmium was the dominant cyanobacterial species. Marine Trichodesmium is considered the most critical autotrophic nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dugdale et al., 1961)</ref>. Trichodesmium can be divided into two forms: clusters and free filaments. Trichodesmium thrives in waters above 20 • C and has a special cellular air sac structure that allows it to move vertically within the upper 100 m of the ocean water column <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Laroche and Breitbarth, 2005)</ref>. In the process of water blooms formed by Trichodesmium, a large amount of nitrogen is often fixed in a relatively short period of time. Therefore, the study of the nitrogen fixation rate of Trichodesmium is crucial for estimating the rate of nitrogen fixation in the ocean <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Karl et al., 2002)</ref>. Previous studies have not clarified which factors are the main causes of Trichodesmium growth (possibly temperature, wind, iron, phosphorus, etc.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Capone et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chang et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Sañudo-Wilhelmy et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Karl and Tien, 1997)</ref>. Many researchers have proposed that temperature is the most important factor affecting the growth of Trichodesmium <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Capone and Carpente, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kustka et al., 2002)</ref>. However, we suggest that there is no single positive correlation between temperature and Trichodesmium growth, which also is consistent with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chang et al. (2000)</ref>. In the tropical WPO, where the surface temperatures all exceeded 20 • C, the abundance of Trichodesmium in areas with higher temperatures (Groups A and B) was higher than in those with lower temperatures (Groups C and D). Temperature not only directly affected phytoplankton growth but also indirectly affected phytoplankton growth and abundance by regulating VSI to drive the nutrient ratio (N : P) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>).</p><p>Previous models and field experiments have shown that the species composition of phytoplankton communities is significantly affected by vertical turbulent mixing changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Huisman et al., 2004)</ref>. A strong coupling exists among the nutrient supply rate, the photosynthetic performance of phytoplankton <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bouman et al., 2006)</ref>, and the phytoplankton biomass and primary production, particularly in eutrophic areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Richardson and Bendtsen, 2019)</ref>. The vertical stratification index reflects the potential effects of vertical stratification on various physical and chemical processes, such as regulating the utilization of light and nutrients in the ocean, which in turn affects phytoplankton dynamics. The results of the present study showed that from the Equator to the north, the VSI decreases as the latitude increases and that the phytoplankton community structure changes from cyanobacteria to diatoms. Phytoplankton abundance was significantly different in the water layer above the SCM. The water layer below the SCM tended to be stable. The surface phytoplankton abundance was usually greater than that of the SCM layer and was related to the surface layer of Trichodesmium. Our results demonstrate that the highly stratified region was more suitable for the growth of Trichodesmium, while the region with low vertical stratification seems to be more conducive to diatoms and dinoflagellates (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>). Due to their low mobility and high potential growth rate, diatoms can reproduce rapidly in mixed water with high nutrient content <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Tilman et al., 1986)</ref>. The weak vertical stratification of the Group C and D regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9b</ref>) leads to relative homogeneity of temperature, salinity, density, and nutrients in the upper layer of 200 m in the vertical direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Pérez et al., 2006)</ref>. The vertical distribution of zooplankton has shown that vertical stratification can hinder the migration of small zooplankton populations and indicate different grazing pressures <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Mitra and Flynn, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Long et al., 2021)</ref>. Further research should consider the difference in predation pressure of different zooplankton predators on the composition of the phytoplankton community in different regions. Phytoplankton stratification may cause thin-layer algal blooms and other phenomena, and the influence of phytoplankton stratification can be investigated in further studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>This study investigated the phytoplankton community structure of the WPO in the autumn of 2016, 2017, and 2018. The WPO is a oligotrophic ocean with a weak water exchange capacity owing to the thermocline and severe stratification in the upper seawater layer. The phytoplankton community structure mainly consisted of cyanobacteria, diatoms, and dinoflagellates, while the abundance of Chrysophyceae was low. In terms of spatial distribution, phytoplankton abundance was high from the equatorial region to 10 • N and decreased with increasing latitude. Phytoplankton showed a high variation in the vertical distribution. The potential influences of physicochemical parameters on phytoplankton abundance were analyzed by a structural equation model (SEM) to determine nutrient ratios driven by vertical stratification to regulate phytoplankton community structure in a typical oligotrophic sea area. Regions with strong vertical stratification (Groups A and B) were more favorable for Z. Chen et al.: Vertical stratification indirectly regulates phytoplankton cyanobacteria, whereas weak vertical stratification (Groups C and D) was more conducive to diatoms and dinoflagellates.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
