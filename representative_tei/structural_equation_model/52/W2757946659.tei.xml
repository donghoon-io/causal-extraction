<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This research set out to test the mediating of employee attitudes on the relationship between SHRM (Society for Human Resource Management) practices and organizational effectiveness in Palestinian banking sector. Using structural equation modeling (SEM) it is investigated a random sample of 357 Palestinian banks' employees selected in a random manner in 16 Palestinian governorates. The partial least square approach has been used depending on SMART-PLS software. Results show the existence of direct and indirect significant path between SHRM practices and organizational effectiveness. However, the indirect relationship through the mediating role of employee attitudes was stronger than the direct one. To sum up, results indicate that employee attitudes partially mediate the relationship between SHRM practices and organizational effectiveness.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>At the beginning of 1980s, academics and researchers started to recognize HR management as an important tool which leads to major improvements within the organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jackson, Schuler, &amp; Jiang, 2014)</ref>. This importance actually comes from the role that HR management can play as a competitive advantage for achieving better organizational effectiveness, by understanding individuals' needs and behaviors as one of the main organizational resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Schuler &amp; Jackson, 1987)</ref>. Most of literature studies displayed that SHRM (Society for Human Resource Management) management practices guide to better performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Katou &amp; Budhwar, 2006)</ref>. Hence, organizations which adopt the best SHRM management practices in selecting and recruiting, training, performance appraisal and rewards systems can attain better organizational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aycan, Al-Hamadi, Davis, &amp; Budhwar, 2007)</ref>. Thus, within a quick environmental change, unstable political situation, hypercompetition and globalization, it is become obligatory for organizations nowadays to enhance their SHRM practices so as to compete effectively. Additionally, literature studies suggested for follower researches to mediate the relationship between SHRM management practices and organizational effectiveness through employee attitudes, which gives an opportunity to according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rugimbana &amp; Akong'o Dimba (2010)</ref> study which categorized SHRM in appropriate and consistent manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The mediating role of employee attitudes in the relationship between SHRM and organizational effectiveness</head><p>In spite of the fact that, the main relationship between the independent and the dependent variables in this research have been explored over the past years, actually this relationship still ambiguous and it is still difficult to explain the nature of the causality relationship between these variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Katou, 2012)</ref>. Thereby, after exploring literature studies about the impact of SHRM on organizational effectiveness, a critical gap still remains <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Wright &amp; Gardner, 2003)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Purcell (2003)</ref>, in order to vanish this gap it is necessary for researchers to examine "how" this impact happened instead of "what" is the impact made.</p><p>In order to answer the question "how" would SHRM lead to enhance organizational effectiveness? Literature studies have been examined the effects of several related variables on the main relationship between SHRM and organizational effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Huselid &amp; Becker, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wright &amp; Gardner, 2003)</ref>. Hence, several studies have been admitted that investigating the relationship between SHRM and organizational effectiveness directly will be inaccurate; this is actually due to excluding the role of the mediating variable. So, for better understanding of this relationship, these studies proposed that follower researchers need to include the intervening variables and to analyze the relationship between SHRM and organizational effectiveness as sequential forward causality steps rather than the just direct relationship between the independent and the dependent variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Becker &amp; Gerhart, 1996)</ref>. Depends on this debate, several mediating variables have been proposed in literature. For instance, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Becker &amp; Gerhart, (1996)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wright &amp; Snell (1998)</ref> employee attitudes mediate the relationship between SHRM and organizational effectiveness and it will be helpful to predict how appropriate practices can affect organizational effectiveness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Purcell &amp; Hutchinson (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Youndt, Snell, Dean, &amp; Lepak (1996)</ref> argued that employee attitudes and behaviors are the complementary variables which influence the relationship between SHRM and organizational effectiveness. To sum up, after reviewing literature studies about the same subject, several studies have been suggested to include employee attitudes as a mediator variable which mediates the relationship between SHRM and organizational effectiveness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Katou (2012)</ref> suggested for further research to examine the same relationship through the mediating role of employee attitudes which may contribute to understanding that SHRM could enhance organizational effectiveness. According to all these results and suggestions, the researcher developed hypotheses number 4, 5 and 6 as follow:</p><p>Hypothesis 2: H0: Employee attitudes doesn't mediate the relationship between SHRM practices and organizational effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research methodology</head><p>The main aim of this research is to examine the impact of SHRM practices on organizational effectiveness through the mediating role of the employee attitudes within the Palestinian banking sector. Count on this aim, the positivism approach is considered as the most suitable way that is able to attain researches aims because it explains researches' causal relationships or the impact/s of one factor/s on another factor/s  <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Malhotra, Birks, &amp; Inc., 2000)</ref>. Consequently, deductive and quantitative approaches were used to gather research data; this means the questionnaire is the primary instrument that is used to collect research data <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Johnson &amp; Clark, 2006)</ref>. Thus, suitable statistical measurements were used to test research hypothesis in order to generalize the results. For this research the simple random sampling is used to determine the sample size. By using this type of sample, each element within research population possesses a similar opportunity of being chosen to be represented in the sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Saunders, 2011)</ref>. For business management studies and researches, researchers usually use 95% confidence level and 3% to 5% error of margin <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lewis, Thornhill, &amp; Saunders, 2007)</ref>. As study population is considered a small population of 5300 employees in number, the needed sampling size is 357 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(De Vaus, 2013)</ref>. A special questionnaire was adapted to measure research variables, by distributing those questions for several respondents and asking them to answer these questions from their point of view to collect research data. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lewis et al. (2007)</ref> achieving an accepted level of reliability and validity for social science researches isn't easy and for overcoming this obstacles, researchers can depend on ready and widely accepted questionnaires, for this reason, final form of research instrument contained seven three types of variables has been adapted to attain research objectives. This questionnaire contains 34 items that measure research variables. To insure research reliability, pilot test has been measured using SPSS v23 program. reliability test and if-item-deleted test on them. While reliability test clarifies how questionnaire paragraphs are closely related as a group. If-item-deleted test give the researcher the opportunity to exclude any questions which has a negative impact on instrument reliability. After performing Cronbach's alpha test for each group of variables and for the instrument as whole. All of results is more than the lowest level of accepted for Cronbach's alpha test which is 0.70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Collis &amp; Hussey, 2013)</ref>. This means the internal consistency of research tool is accepted for the instrument in total and for each group of questions that are related to one variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>SMART PLS software has been chosen as one of the most popular research for structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis. Business research in recent years have shown a greater dependency on structural equation modeling (SEM) as one of the best mainstream methods to analyze topics of business management field <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sarstedt, Ringle, Smith, Reams, &amp; Hair, 2014)</ref>. For using SEM, there are pair of methods; the first one is the covariancebased techniques (CB-SEM) while the other is the variance-based partial least squares (PLS-SEM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hair, Sarstedt, Ringle, &amp; Mena, 2012)</ref>. Nowadays, (PLS-SEM) is considered as one of the best new alternative to (CB-SEM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Henseler, Ringle, &amp; Sinkovics, 2009)</ref>. Moreover, (PLS-SEM) has received several improvements recently such as; confirmatory analysis, impact-performance matrix analysis, non-linear effects, and moderating and mediating effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hair et al., 2012)</ref>. Structural equation modeling contains two different models which are the inner model and the outer model; the inner model or structural model identifies the dependent and independent latent variables relationships while the outer model identifies the latent variables relationships with their observed indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sarstedt et al., 2014)</ref>. (Note: latent variables are the variables that are known as factors or constructs and also they aren't able to be observed directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Wong, 2013)</ref>. Depending on SEM assumptions, latent variables are either exogenous or endogenous. Latent variables are called exogenous when they have one or more headed arrows that moving out of them only, in this situation; latent variables are representing independent variables. For this research, SHRM practices and employee attitudes represent the exogenous latent variables. Meanwhile, latent variables are called endogenous when they have leastwise headed arrows that moving into them, in this situation, latent variables are dependent variables which represent organizational effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Astrachan, Klein, &amp; Smyrnios, 2002)</ref>. Lately, SEM has two measurement indicators; the formative and the reflective indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Edwards &amp; Bagozzi, 2000)</ref>. To observe the whole picture; it is necessary to highlight the difference between these two indicators. Formative indicator is considered as a function of the indicators of a latent variable, his means that changing in construct (latent) variables can be determined depending on the changes on their indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sarstedt et al., 2014)</ref>. However, reflective indicator is considered as a function of latent variable. This means that changing in construct (latent) variables can determine the changes in the values of its indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hair et al., 2012)</ref>. As a result, all research indicators are reflective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory factor analysis (initial test)</head><p>An initial test needed to be applied using SMART-PLS software to exclude any reflective indicator with low loadings with their corresponding construct. Based on research questionnaire, there are (34) reflective indicators. The software has been illustrated that adjusted to 300 maximum iterations with stop criterion of 7. As it can be seen from figour 1 below, the result of the initial test revealed that (1) out of ( <ref type="formula">34</ref>) model indicators which is (SHR.PA3) has recorded low loadings on their corresponding construct. In the aim of achieving better validity and reliability for the model all of these indicators will be excluded from the final form of the structural model.  Large value of communality (closer to one) indicates variables to be better fitted with the factor solution and vice versa, loadings of 0.40 or more are acceptable and means that there is a suitable fit. By looking for table 1 above, all of the values inside the table are over the cut-off point (0.4), this means there is no problem with these data according to communality test. So, no one of these items has high probability to load a particularly on other variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hulland &amp; of Business, 1999)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internal consistency reliability</head><p>In partial least square approach for structure equation model (PLS-SEM) composite reliability value will be addressed to examine the internal consistency for the reflective constructs, by which the outer loadings for the interchangeable reflective indicators will be considered what made it more appropriate to test the internal consistency in the reflective measurement models comparing to the Cronbach's Alpha test which assumes that the indicators loadings in the population are identical adding to its sensitivity to the number of the interchangeable indicators for one construct. Table <ref type="table">below</ref> clarifies values of composite reliability for each construct. As all of these values are more than 0.7, an accepted level of internal consistency reliability have been recorded <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hair et al., 2012)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sarstedt et al. (2014)</ref> the cut-off point here is 0.5 for the average variance extracted. So, values equal or higher than 0.5 are accepted statistically and this means that the construct has the ability to explain more than 0.5 of the variance of related items. As it can be seen from table <ref type="table">3</ref> above, all AVE values are within the acceptable level of convergent validity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discriminant validity</head><p>This test considered as the second sub-type for construct validity. Discriminate validity used usually to examine the amount of relatedness between research variables through calculating the whole possible correlations values between research variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Henseler, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2015)</ref>.  In order to confirm the discriminant validity, an appropriate pattern for the indicators' loadings should be observed in which the interchangeable indicators are relatively highly loaded on their corresponding construct and weakly loaded on the other constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Voorhees, Brady, Calantone, &amp; Ramirez, 2016)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> above demonstrates the Cross-Loading matrix giving a discriminate evidence among the constructs.</p><p>Fornell-Larcker criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fornell-Larcker (1981)</ref> criterion is considered one of the best tests to measure discriminant validity depending on cross loadings values. The idea here is to compare square root value of the average variance extracted (AVE) for each construct with its correlation values with other constructs in the structural mode. The favorable result can be achieved when value of the average variance extracted (AVE) for each construct is greater than its correlation values with other constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hair, Sarstedt, Hopkins, &amp; Kuppelwieser, 2014)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> above shows that AVE values for each construct is higher than its correlated values with other constructs, so discriminant validity has been accepted depending on Fornell-Larcker Criterion. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural model assessment</head><p>Structural model assessment is the second step for ensuring that the quality of research model is satisfactory. PLS-SEM technique is somehow different from CB-SEM, while CB-SEM has a standard goodness-of-fit statistic, and efforts to establishing a corresponding statistic have proven highly problematic, PLS-SEM hasn't <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Henseler &amp; Sarstedt, 2013)</ref>, and instead of that, for accessing structural model it is necessary to depend on model ability to predict the endogenous constructs using; and the path coefficients, coefficient of determination (R 2 ), and cross-validated redundancy (Q 2 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Henseler &amp; Sarstedt, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coefficient of determination (R 2 )</head><p>Values of R 2 for each endogenous construct represents measure of the model's predictive accuracy and also the variance explained in each of the endogenous constructs <ref type="bibr">(Sarstedt et al., 2014)</ref>. This value is ranging from zero to one, as the value of R 2 going up, this means more predictive accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hair, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2011)</ref>. For business management researchers, researchers must consider R² values of endogenous latent variables in research structural model as follow; 0.75 as high, 0.50 as moderate <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>, or 0.25 as low. As the idea of using PLS-SEM approach is to reveals the endogenous latent variables' variance, the key target constructs' level of R² should be high. By looking figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the coefficient of determination R 2 is (0.572) for the endogenous latent variable (OE). This result means that 57.2% of total variance of OE can be explained by three exogenous variables which are (SHRM, and EA). Moreover, the coefficient of determination R 2 is (0.564) for the exogenous latent variable (EA). This result means that 56.4% of total variance of EA can be explained by (SHRM) exogenous variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect size</head><p>This test in fact is used to evaluate the amount of contribution that each exogenous latent variable has over an endogenous latent variable's (R 2 ) value. To put it differently, effect size is a test used to evaluate latent variables relationship strength or magnitude.  The value of (Q 2 ) is used to indicate the model's predictive relevance. Which suppose that the model must be able to adequately predict each endogenous latent construct's indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>. this value can be measured by using a blindfolding procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Wong, 2013)</ref>. To measure (Q 2 ) value, there are two different ways, the first one is crossvalidated redundancy while the second one is cross-validated communality. A study was made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sarstedt et al., 2014)</ref> recommended the first approach as the preferable one. The cut-off point for cross-validated redundancy (Q 2 ) values is zero, the path model's predictive accuracy is reasonable for that certain construct when cross-validated redundancy (Q 2 ) values are more than zero for that particular endogenous latent variable. And vice-versa <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sarstedt et al., 2014)</ref>. The result of Blindfolding test shows that (Q 2 ) value for (EA, and OE) are 0.205 and 0.252 respectively. Since (Q 2 ) values for all endogenous latent variables are greater than zero, the path model has a favorable predictive relevance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model fit test</head><p>The partial least squares approach for structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) has no global goodness of fit index, so far, the threshold cut-off of the model fit criterion values have not been adequately understood, because of that the bootstrapping and blindfolding techniques are employed to overcome these issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hair, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>As well the reliability and validity test for the measurement models are conducted as first step <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hair et al., 2013)</ref>. Usually the goodness of fit index is not reported, however, some researchers recommend considering SRMR and Normed Fit Index NFI as an indicators to examine model fit, which ensure the absence of misspecification in the model, as it compares between the actual correlation matrix that based on the real observations and the predicted one using the model, the value of SRMR should not exceed 0.08 while NFI value is ranging from 0 to 1, the closer the NFI to 1 means better fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hair et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The SRMR value for the study model is 0.074 less than 0.08 which indicates a good of fit.</p><p>Moreover, NFI value is approximately 0.8 which represents acceptable fit for research model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural equation modeling results</head><p>After accessing reliability and validity criteria for all reflective measurement of research model and ensuring the integrity of research data, SMART-PLS Algorithm has been run after determining 300 maximum iterations with stop criterion of 7 using path weighting scheme to maximize the R 2 value for the model endogenous Latent variables i.e. organizational effectiveness (OE).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FIGURE 2. THE STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING (FINAL)</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path coefficients interpretation</head><p>This part clarifies the values of path coefficients using PLS-SEM. in this case, path coefficients represents standardized regression coefficients. To make a valuable comparison between the direct effect of exogenous latent variables on the endogenous latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hair et al., 2013)</ref>. Moreover, this test depends on the values of standard deviation for each explanatory variable (Joe F <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hair et al., 2012)</ref>. Path coefficient values ranging from (+1) to (-1), closer value to (+1) means stronger positive relationship between the constructs while closer value to (-1) indicates stronger negative relationship. Consequently, zero value signifies that there is no relationship. For this research, the interpretation for the path coefficients would be as follow:</p><p>-SHRM &gt; OE: according to this result, when SHRM increases one standard deviation from its mean that will lead to an increase in OE standard deviations by 0.257 from its It is a resampling method by which numbers of subsamples (literature have recommended 5000 subsamples) are generated; the bootstrapping procedures involve random droppings and replacing for sets of observations from the original data in order to obtain the subsamples, then each of the subsamples is used to estimate the model and obtain the PLS-SEM results (i.e. Path coefficients, indirect effects, outer loadings, outer weight, etc.), and later these estimations will be used to derive the entire distributions (the means and standard deviations for the PLS-SEM results) and enabling the significance tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Henseler, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2015)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">8</ref> shows the T-statistics for the Path Coefficients using Bootstrapping methods. As all P-Values for path coefficients between exogenous variables (SHEM, and EA) and endogenous variable (EA) are less than (0.05). So, depending on the significance level of α &lt; 5% and as T-Statistics values are greater than 1.96 for all these relationships excluding (BS) and (OE), path coefficients of the structural equation modeling is statistically significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The mediation test</head><p>To investigate the mediation effect of employee attitudes on the relationship between the SHRM practices (exogenous) and organizational effectiveness (endogenous), Bootstrapping analysis was applied using 95% of confidence interval and 5000 subsamples in order to find out PLS-SEM means and standard deviations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hair et al., 2013)</ref>. The result of mediating effect of one variable over the relationship between the exogenous and endogenous latent variable can take three different options (no mediating, full mediating, and partial mediating) depending on p-values and t-statistics. The result of this table indicates that there are a direct and indirect effects significant relationships between SHRM and OE depending on P-values and T-Statistics. To sum up, there is a partial mediating effect between SHRM and OE through EA. Depending on this result, (for hypothesis number 2) the null hypothesis has been rejected while the alternative hypothesis has been supported. Moreover, this test reveals that employee attitude has standardized indirect effect between SHRM and OE of 41.3% while (p = 0.00). This means that if SHRM effect on OE through EA increases one standard deviation from its mean that will lead to an increase in OE standard deviations by 0. 413 from its mean holding all other model variables are constant.  According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hair, Black, Babin, &amp; Anderson (2009)</ref> the values of variance inflation factor (VIF) shouldn't exceed 10. Moreover, the values between 5 and 10 are considered high and unfavorable. By looking again to thetable 12, all of variance inflation factor (VIF) values for all for the independent latent variables are less than (5). As a result, there is no problem with research data according to the multicollinearity test. The previous analytical and statistical outcomes gave adequate answers for research questions and to test research hypotheses. Multiple regressions have been utilized to detect the impact of SHRM practices on organizational effectiveness within Palestinian banking sector. Lastly, SMART PLS software has been used to demonstrate the truth of research structural equation modeling. The theoretical and managerial implications of the results of the previous analysis will be discussed in the following chapter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SHRM practices and organizational effectiveness</head><p>The third hypothesis in this research investigate existence of significant positive relationship between SHRM practices (i.e. recruitment and hiring, training and development, performance appraisal, development and promotion and pay and compensation system) and organizational effectiveness. Multiple regression test result revealed that SHRM practices which represents the independent variable has signified positive relationship with organizational effectiveness (dependent variable). Moreover, value of adjusted R 2 was (0.572), this indicates that SHRM practices and EA explains 57.2% of the variability of organizational effectiveness. Moreover, SHRM has a positive direct relationship with OE of 0.257. This result in fact support most of literature about the same objects, several studies previously linked SHRM practices as a superior force to enhance organizational effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mathis &amp; Jackson, 2011)</ref>. According to Michael Porter on his competitive strategy approach, he argued that organization could improve overall effectiveness through understanding individual behaviors and their needs in order to link them with SHRM, so this mean SHRM practices could be as a competitive advantage with a suitable design <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Porter, 1980)</ref> for instance, SHRM has an important effect on organizational performance and accordingly, a special effect on organizational effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Wang et al., 2005)</ref>. As a result, it is clear that SHRM practices can represent the magic stick that able to attain the optimal level of organizational effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The moderating role of employee attitudes on the relationship between SHRM practices and organizational effectiveness</head><p>Research result clarifies that there is an indirect significant path between SHRM practices and organizational effectiveness through employee attitudes, and there is direct significant path between SHRM practices and organizational effectiveness. This indicates that employee attitudes partially mediate the relationship between SHRM practices and organizational effectiveness. But an important result here as follow: the indirect effect of SHRM on OE through employee attitudes is greater than the direct effect. This means that it is not enough for bank management to focus on SHRM and forgetting employee attitudes because its role toward completing the total affect over OW.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SHRM practices and employee attitudes</head><p>To examine this hypothesis, multiple regression analysis has been performed to explore the relationship between SHRM practices and employee attitudes within Palestinian banking sector. The result indicated that SHRM practices had signifies positive relationship with employee attitudes. Moreover, the result approved that SHRM practices has a direct effect over EA of 0.751. Moreover, value of adjusted R 2 was (0.564), this indicates that SHRM practices explains 56.4% of the variability of EA. The result of this hypothesis has been widely supported literature studies about the same assumption. For instance, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Becker &amp; Gerhart (1996)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wright &amp; Snell (1998)</ref> employee attitudes mediates the relationship between SHRM and organizational effectiveness and it will be helpful to predict how appropriate practices can affect organizational effectiveness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Purcell &amp; Hutchinson (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Youndt et al. (1996)</ref> argued that employee attitudes and behaviors is the complementary variables which influence the relationship between SHRM and organizational effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Employee attitudes and organizational effectiveness</head><p>To verify the last hypothesis, again multiple regression has been applied to test the impact of employee attitudes on organizational effectiveness. Employee attitudes showed strong signifies positive relationship with organizational effectiveness, the direct effect was (0.543). The idea for this hypothesis came from several literatures that suggest for follower researchers to include the intervening variables and to analyze the relationship between SHRM practices and organizational effectiveness as sequential forward causality steps rather than just direct relationship between the independent and the dependent variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Becker &amp; Gerhart, 1996)</ref>. Despite this weak positive relationship between these two variables, the result of this hypothesis has been supported literature studies about the same relationship between employee attitudes and organizational effectiveness. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Purcell &amp; Hutchinson (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Youndt et al. (1996)</ref> argued that employee  Hypothesis 1 H0: There is no significant impact of SHRM practices on organizational effectiveness.</p><p>Rejected H1: There is a significant impact of SHRM practices on organizational effectiveness.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research contributions and significance knowledge</head><p>This research gives a share to the existing knowledge regarding to SHRM and its relationship with organizational effectiveness by exploring the main SHRM practices and the other related variables, and how all these variables can affect organizational effectiveness. Nevertheless, SHRM and organizational effectiveness relationship have not been explored in the same mechanism in literature researches. On the other hand, no any study has been discussed the same relationships which are motioned above in Palestinian state. To sum up, this research will contribute the following:</p><p>-This research would be the first research which considers the impact of business strategies on SHRM and organizational effectiveness and carries out SHRM and organizational effectiveness relationship in term of the mediating role of employee attitudes.</p><p>-The benefits of this research exceed the Palestinian banking sector and it will be beneficial for other Middle East countries which are somehow similar to Palestine according to their culture and economic situations. Moreover, this research will be beneficial for researcher and academics as the new conceptual model will give practical implications for further research to measure SHRM practices and organizational effectiveness in such countries. -This research indicates an important point as follow, the indirect effect of SHRM practices on OE through the moderating role of EA is greater than the direct one. This give an important note for top management to focus more on EA toward achieving better organizational effectiveness.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE</head><label></label><figDesc>FIGURE 1.
