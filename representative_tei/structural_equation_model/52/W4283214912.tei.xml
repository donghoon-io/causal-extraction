<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Economic sustainability involves the development of an organisation that meets its future needs through an integrated policy, planning, and social learning process. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mediating role of competitive advantage in the relationship between strategic orientation and economic sustainability under unpredictable circumstances. This study collected quantitative data from a total of 284 halal small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from Indonesia through structured interviews. Data were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Moreover, this study adopted artificial neural network (ANN) analysis for a model-free estimation using non-linear, multilayer, and parallel regression. The results revealed statistically significant and positive effect of strategic orientation on economic sustainability. Additionally, this study found that competitive advantage expanded the effect of strategic orientation on economic sustainability. Findings of ANN analysis confirm high prediction accuracy of the model. Findings of the sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of innovation, network and technological orientation, and the positive effect of competitive advantage on halal SMEs economic sustainability. In order to achieve long-term economic sustainability, halal SMEs should therefore focus on innovation capacity, vertical and horizontal networking and adoption of the latest technologies. The uniqueness of this study focused on the strategic orientation and value of competitive advantage of halal SMEs towards economic sustainability. Additionally, this study was the first to develop hybrid SEM-neural network analysis to apply sensitivity analysis for the evaluation of the contribution of each exogenous predictor towards the endogenous construct.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The environmental system of an economy is the central factor to gain business opportunities for sustainable development. The concept of sustainability and the interdependence of the economy and environment are increasingly important for policymakers. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play essential roles of contributing to the economic growth of developing countries and creating income and job creation; however, numerous small business entrepreneurs face failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Hyder &amp; Lussier, 2016)</ref>. The government and authorities support SMEs during their prestart-up line by raising adequate capital and calculating their business costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Rachapaettayakom et al., 2020)</ref>. Indonesia Advances (Indonesia Maju) is one of the government's initiatives to support sustainability development. Shariah economy and finance (herein refers to as "halal economy") have been identified as key contributors considering that the vast global opportunity of $1.9 trillion in 2020 and domestic opportunity of $184 billion in the related consumer spending market have not been fully tapped. Indonesia is the largest domestic halal economy market, by 87.0% of the total population or about 236.53 million people. This amount is equivalent to 12.7% of the entire Muslim population in the world. The halal economy has remained more unscathed by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic than the national economy, with a contraction of -1.70%, as compared to -2.07% for the national economy in 2020 <ref type="bibr">(Halal Economy and Finance Report, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Indonesia did not occupy a position in the top 10 countries of the halal food industry since <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">-2017</ref><ref type="bibr">(Halal Institution, 2021)</ref>. Therefore, in the end of 2021, the Indonesian government proposed the "Proudly Made in Indonesia National Movement" (Gernas BBI) to support the expansion of halal products through ASEAN Online Sale Day (AOSD). Sustainable development of halal SMEs must meet the needs of customers. Sustainable business strategy is necessary for an organisation to remain competitive, improve brand reputation, gain higher attractiveness and competitive advantage, and to reduce costs and business risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Dyllick &amp; Muff, 2016)</ref>. Profitability, cost reduction, competitiveness, and finance need to be considered to gain economic sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ferro et al., 2019)</ref>. In a broader sense, the term of business sustainability focuses on how an organisation achieves profitability and wider social and environmental impacts in the marketplace. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Dyllick and Muff (2016)</ref>, an economy truly becomes sustainable when organisations start to consider and act on addressing business challenges. Economic sustainability is feasible for commercial businesses when such strategies offer satisfactory economic values to the shareholders. These strategies fall into the domain of share-value creation. In this highly competitive environment, successful halal SMEs utilise strategic orientation to achieve goals, establish direction for future sustainability, and assist in the allocation of resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kamboj &amp; Rahman, 2017)</ref>. Strategic orientation correlates with self-learning, innovation, capabilities, and network of halal SMEs towards transforming external information to new knowledge for higher competitiveness. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lee et al. (2019)</ref> stated that strategic orientation boosts different levels of competitive advantage, and different types of strategic orientation potentially improve the performance of halal SMEs. Halal SMEs play a crucial role in the economic growth and sustainability of developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Daengs et al., 2019)</ref>. The strategic development of halal SMEs is economically vital for developing countries to expand their halal brand products. Therefore, strategic orientation is essential for halal SMEs to increase their brand and profit in a hyper-competitive setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Mu et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Technology orientation is required to increase profits and improve the efficiency of managing a business unit <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Al-Idrus et al., 2020)</ref>. Moreover, technology enables an organisation to achieve economic sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Samsir, 2018)</ref>. Technology adoption is vital to achieve value in business and to gain specialisation and capability to attain economic growth and competitive advantage. Furthermore, quality halal products increase customer satisfaction, which then leads to product sustainability. Improving the strategic orientation to understand customers' needs can enhance competitive advantage. Apart from that, halal SMEs can gain cost leadership-based advantage by reducing other costs, such as material costs. Similarly, an organisation needs product differentiation to obtain competitive advantage. Competitive advantage is crucial in the operation of halal SMEs, especially in this emerging market, in order to achieve halal brand sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anwar et al., 2018)</ref>. Therefore, customer orientation, technology orientation, network orientation, and innovation orientation are critical for businesses like SMEs to gain economic sustainability. However, inconsistent findings have been reported, indicating that strategic orientation does not directly influence performance outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Gunawan et al., 2016)</ref>. The possible explanation for this contradiction is that entrepreneurship context often undergoes turbulent changes in regard to technology, market, and institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Zhou, Ayegba, et al., Zhou, Ayegba, et al., 2021)</ref>. However, only a few studies assessed strategic orientation regarding organisational economic and environmental sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahashan et al., 2021)</ref>. From the overall halal entrepreneurship perspective on the implementation of strategic orientation concerning economic sustainability, lack of both theoretical and practical literature are evident.</p><p>Resource-based view (RBV), which was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Penrose (1959)</ref>, is the most suitable theory to determine the relationship of strategic orientation, competitive advantage, and economic sustainability. RBV focuses on human capabilities and external capabilities, such as network and technology, to achieve competitive advantage-this is reflected in the literature on strategic management. Moreover, the diffusion of RBV in strategic management and related disciplines has involved considerable theoretical development and empirical testing. RBV has become one of the most influential and cited theories in the history of management theorising. A prior study explained the internal sources of a firm's sustained competitive advantage (SCA). The central of this theory proposition is increasing a firm's performance to achieve SCA by acquiring and controlling valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable (VRIN) resources and capabilities that can absorb and apply them <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Barney, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>This study argued that strategic orientation enhances halal SMEs' competitive advantage in a hyper-competitive environment. Thus, this study attempted to explore and develop a framework of developing hybrid SEM-neural network analysis on how customer orientation, competitor orientation, technology orientation, network orientation, and innovation orientation affect the economic sustainability of halal SMEs through competitive advantage in Indonesia. The above problem statements and the lack of sufficient findings on the related areas prompted the current study to contribute to the existing body of knowledge and address other gaps, such as the inconsistent findings on the relationship between strategic orientation and economic sustainability in related literature.</p><p>In this study, RBV was captured with respect to strategic decision-making orientation and competitive advantage towards the economic sustainability of halal SMEs in Indonesia. This study designed, developed, and validated an instrument to measure the dimensions of strategic orientation, competitive advantage, and economic sustainability using the hybrid SEM-neural network analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature review and hypotheses development</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical background</head><p>RBV (a bona fide theory), which was introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Penrose (1959)</ref>, emphasised the integration position between internal factor (capability) and external environment (competitors). According to <ref type="bibr">Wenerfelt (1984)</ref>, an organisation's resources include those tangible (e.g., building, chairs, desks, papers, etc.) and intangible (employees' capability) assets, which are tied semi-permanently. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Barney (2000)</ref> classified a firm's resources into three categories, namely (1) physical capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Williamson, 1975)</ref>, which are used to assess raw materials, technology use, and equipment; (2) human capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Becker, 1964)</ref>, such as intelligence, relationships, training, and working experience of individuals in the firm, and (3) organisational capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Tomer, 1987)</ref>, which is a system made to control and coordinate one's work among the groups and in the firm's environment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barney (1991)</ref> observed the important role of RBV in management information systems. Information and communication technologies have changed and played position in power and availability to gain market competition. This has also led to increased academic attention on the issue of deploying ICTs. Instead, firms often must deploy the most recent ICTs to simply keep pace with their competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Powell &amp; Dent-Micallef, 1997)</ref>. From the perspective of the RBV, ICT has seen as one of the vital tools to create high competition in this digital era. The interface between skilled users and ICTs may prove to be inimitable, such as the context of halal SMEs. Furthermore, halal SMEs expand their resources by assessing resources, assets, and skills as value <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Popli et al., 2017)</ref>. Resources and capabilities offer substantial gain for halal SMEs with lower transaction costs and access to external resources and capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Hitt et al., 2016)</ref>. As a result, according to the RBV, strategic orientation and competitive advantage positively influence the sustainability of SMEs. Furthermore, both resources and quality strategies appear to benefit halal the sustainability and performance of SMEs.</p><p>Moreover, with respect to emerging markets, studies on RBV have suggested that local firms are interested in using foreign alliances to acquire advantages over their domestic rivals, in emphasising the importance of network ties as an intangible resource for entrepreneurial start-ups, and in understanding the changing benefits of unrelated diversification as economic institutions develop <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barney, 1991)</ref>. The global competitive innovation in this era of high technology has pushed firms to make longservice relationship and software to demonstrate their competency by exploring new knowledge and capability required to gain competitive advantage, which is known as dynamic capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Teece et al., 1997)</ref> (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>Valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable, and non-substituted capability (VRIN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barney (1991)</ref> stressed that an organisation can gain competitive advantage through four criteria, namely valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable, and non-substituted capability. Valuable resource must enable the organisation to behave in ways that lead to high sales, low costs, high margins, and low risks for higher profits. Moreover, the study stated that valuable resource plays critical factor for an organisation to implement a strategy that improves its efficiency and effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Lopes et al., 2018)</ref>. In contrast, RVB provides practical and critical guidance to researchers and managers to understand whether a given resource, in a context, does (or does not) create economic value by creating VRIN <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Barney &amp; Mackey, 2016)</ref>. Through value, rarity, imitation, and implementation in the organisation, RBV can lead to sustainable advantage for SMEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Barney &amp; Hesterly, 2007)</ref>. The framework of VRIN stresses one's capability to create strategy value prior to the implementation in their activities as a resource. Both resource and capability to change and be distinctive from other organisations increase the revenue and create a lower net cost. If a firm's resources or capabilities do not have these effects, they cannot be a source of competitive parity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Barney &amp; Mackey, 2016)</ref>. As for the application of the VRIN model, after defining a resource as valuable, the next question deals with rarity. Subsequently, this focuses on the inimitability feature by comparing it with competitors. When a resource is identified as rare, then the resource becomes a source of "temporary" competitive advantage. When the resource is not rare, it becomes a source of competitive parity. Resources that are considered rare receive greater weighting in regard to inimitability in terms of defining the likely duration of competitive advantage. High-cost resources that competitors buy or replace represent sources of sustained competitive</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The quadruple and quintuple innovation helix concepts</head><p>The concept of the triple helix model was originally proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (1995)</ref>. Theoretically, it draws on evolutional economics, sociology, and public policy. The unique contribution of the triple helix model to innovation studies lies in its attention to the heightened role of the university in the transition towards a knowledge-based society. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (2000)</ref> further expounded the triple helix model into a model of innovation and entrepreneurship to study knowledge-based economies. The triple helix model of knowledge stresses three helices that are intertwined and, by this, generate a national innovation system, namely universities, industries, and governments. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Quartey and Oguntoye (2021)</ref>, understanding and achieving sustainable industrialisation based on strategic orientation, innovation, knowledge, and competitive advantage are possible through the triple helix approach (THA). THA enables innovation and knowledge as important collaborative interactions among universities, governments, and industries. However, THA in innovation and knowledge management research has received less theoretical and empirical applications, resulting in the lack of understanding on industrial sustainability, especially in developing countries. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Carayannis and Campbell (2011)</ref> added a fourth quadruple helix that is identified as media-based and culture-based public, as well as the civil society. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Carayannis and Campbell (2011)</ref>, this emphasises that the public requires a broader understanding of knowledge production and innovation application to become more integrated into advanced innovation systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Carayannis, Campbell, et al. (2021)</ref> emphasised that understanding of the concept of the quadruple and quintuple helix can be derived from democracy and ecology. They added that innovation development and knowledge require focus on knowledge democracy and ecological sensitivity. The ecosystem would benefit from greater spillover effects, deriving from a synergistic boost to innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Carayannis, Dezi, et al., 2021)</ref>. The public uses and applies knowledge; so, public users are also part of the innovation system. In an advanced knowledge society and knowledge economy, knowledge flows out into all spheres of society. Quadruple helix refers to the structures and processes of the global and local knowledge economy and society, whereas quintuple helix brings in the perspective of the natural environments. Furthermore, the innovation ecosystem, combining and integrating social and natural systems and environments, stresses the importance of pluralism for a diversity of agents, actors, organisations, universities (universities of sciences and arts), SMEs, and major corporations, along the matrix of fluid and heterogeneous innovation networks and knowledge clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Carayannis &amp; Rakhmatullin, 2014)</ref>. This may result in a democracy of knowledge, driven by pluralism of knowledge and innovation and pluralism of paradigms of knowledge modes. The democracy of knowledge, as a concept and metaphor, is carried by an understanding that it operates (at least potentially) a coevolution between the processes of advancing democracy and processes of advancing knowledge and innovation. There is a certain congruence in the processes and structures of advanced knowledge democracy, knowledge society, and knowledge economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Carayannis &amp; Campbell, 2010)</ref>. The concepts of democracy (moving from electoral to liberal and high-quality democracies), and of knowledge and innovation (for example, refocusing from triple helix to quadruple and quintuple helices), are becoming broader, which increase their complexities considerably. The democracy ranking conceptually asserted a link between the quality of democracy and sustainable development from a mid-or long-term perspective. Furthermore, with the specific selection of dimensions for their model of democracy and the quality of democracy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Carayannis and Campbell (2011)</ref> pointed out that the democracy ranking emphasises knowledge and innovation and the natural environments of society.</p><p>The current study focused on balancing development and sustainability by addressing both innovation and sustainability by modifying the original triple helix model. This study considered the triple helix concept within the context of halal SMEs, specifically in terms of their economic sustainability, towards achieving innovation and sustainability in a hyper-competition setting. There is an increasing awareness that a knowledge-based society operates according to a different set of dynamics, as compared to an industrial society, with an emphasis on SMEs. Knowledge-based innovations are more closely linked to sources of new knowledge and human resources. Fostering a continuous process of the formation of halal SMEs based on advanced technologies moves to the heart of strategy orientation.</p><p>Additionally, this study supported the quadruple and quintuple innovation helix to change its spin as the production of new knowledge and technology, which has become an increasingly important element for the performance of halal SMEs. This can also drive the sustainability of halal SMEs towards meeting the global and local knowledge economy and society through strategy, democracy of knowledge, and innovation. At this level of the quadruple and quintuple innovation helix, the enhancement of the performance of SMEs and other knowledge-producing institutions often becomes the key issue. The concept of democracy of knowledge, ecology, and society is crucial for halal SMEs to obtain innovation. Sustainable development, progress, and performance across different dimensions of halal SMEs explain the success of quadruple helix.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Customer orientation</head><p>Competitive advantage can be sustained by generating innovative ideas, quick response to customers' needs, and development of new beneficial products for customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Parente et al., 2018</ref>). An organisation can gain higher market share by providing highquality products and improving its brand image. Economic sustainability can be derived from continuous improvement and competitive advantage through uniqueness and new information of the market <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Na et al., 2019)</ref>. By addressing customers' needs, SMEs can gain more knowledge and understanding of the current and future customers' preferences and expectations for higher competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Zhang et al., 2018)</ref>. Furthermore, for sustainability, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Wang et al. (2016)</ref> highlighted the importance of resources, such as knowledge and capability, in converting customers' needs and requirements into innovative products or services. Halal SMEs need to rely more on meeting customers' demands to improve their opportunity to expand more products and gain competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Feng et al., 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Handa &amp; Manuel (2021)</ref> stated that customer orientation is a strategy which focuses on customer information efficiently to meets their needs. However, it does not mean that the company' strategy will be influenced by customers desire and preference to reach company' sustainability. Moreover, SMEs should also be encouraged to emphasise customer-focused business strategies and SMEs with smaller customers over a long-term period should provide revenue and customer's needs stability of the firm. Additionally, strategies are needed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the processes included building customer loyalty and stronger relationships. Focusing on improving the performance of halal SMEs, there is a need to integrate strategies to enhance better services and products for greater customer satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(D'souza et al., 2021)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Zang et al. (2021)</ref> found that understanding the role of customers in business increases the sustainability and performance of SMEs for long-time revenues. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Fan et al. (2021)</ref> focused on promoting Industry 4.0 and stated that the most crucial innovation that affects organisational sustainability is influenced by customer orientation. Therefore, based on the findings of prior studies, this study proposed the following hypotheses:</p><p>Hypothesis 1 (H1a) Customer orientation has a positive effect on halal SMEs' competitive advantage.</p><p>Hypothesis 1 (H1b) Customer orientation has a positive effect on the halal SMEs' economic sustainability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Competitor orientation</head><p>Competitor orientation can improve a company's standing in the market if the company is willing to learn from the more successful players in that market <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Mudanganyi et al., 2020)</ref>. A firm's competitor orientation can help in developing a superior experience for its customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Crick et al., 2019)</ref>. Hence, competitor orientation is necessary for analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the competitors and the dissemination and sharing of information inside the halal SMEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Mamman, 2020)</ref>. Moreover, halal SMEs need to understand how their competitors improve their strategy to gain their products, marketing strategy, and achieve competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Jamilah et al., 2020)</ref>. Therefore, competitor orientation could change their strategy by improving products quality, services and human capability to create new opportunity by gaining competitor orientation could either force SMEs to improve existing products, services, processes, and people by offering training or compel them to introduce the cutting-edge competitive advantage of products to the market with innovative production processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Seilov, 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Otieno and Juma (2022)</ref> found that a significant relationship between competitor orientation, customer orientation and inter-functional coordination with organisational performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Corrinne et al. (2019)</ref> stresses the importance of applying strategy planning with sustainability and a longer time horizon. The study stated that long-term strategy is crucial for SMEs to survive and gain profits in a highly competitive environment and achieve sustainable business performance. Competitor orientation, customer orientation, and innovation orientation are crucial for strategic implementation. Competitor orientation and innovation orientation enable SMEs to collect intelligence about their competitors. Therefore, competitor orientation enables SMEs to acquire information required for long-term strategies and environmental management approaches that are preferred by customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Tseng et al., 2021)</ref>. Thus, this study proposed the following hypotheses for testing:</p><p>Hypothesis 2 (H2a) Competitor orientation has a positive effect on the halal SMEs' competitive advantage.</p><p>Hypothesis 2 (H2b) Competitor orientation has a positive effect on halal SMEs' economic sustainability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technology orientation</head><p>Technology can drive product innovation more effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Yousaf et al., 2020)</ref>. Moreover, technology orientation determine new products and ideas of innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ardito &amp; Dangelico, 2018)</ref>. Technology orientation enables halal SMEs to gain current information and challenges quickly towards business strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Chakraborty et al., 2019)</ref>. Business units with technology orientation will obtain competitive advantages, and via this technology, they can offer more innovative products for consumers to choose from such as products that use the latest technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Al-Idrus et al., 2020)</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Mandal (2017)</ref> has indicated that technology orientation enhances competitive advantage and the sustainability of a firm in the event of disruptions. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Tsao et al. (2022)</ref>, the perceptions and consciousness of the participants regarding fifth-generation technology affect sustainability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Klumpp and Loske (2021)</ref> noted the important roles of gaining competitive advantage and sustainability. Thus, the following hypotheses were proposed for testing: Hypothesis 3 (H3a) Technology orientation has a positive effect on the halal SMEs' competitive advantage.</p><p>Hypothesis 3 (H3b) Technology orientation has a positive effect on the halal SMEs' economic sustainability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Network orientation</head><p>Network orientation is a way of thinking, developing, and utilisation of network value. Additionally, network can be used to identify new opportunities and demands in the potential market for businesses to introduce products <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Zhang et al., 2018)</ref>. Besides that, network orientation is an important requirement for halal SMEs to acquire knowledge and access to valuable resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ferro et al., 2019)</ref>. Through network capability, businesses obtain valuable and diverse information and resources to discover and create new opportunities, which subsequently increase their competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Dong, et al., 2020)</ref>. Networks directly affect the growth of halal SMEs, with positive causal effects, and networks can provide business information, advices, and solutions to solve customers' problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Martins, 2016)</ref>. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Haffar et al. (2022)</ref> confirmed the positive influence of network capabilities on sustainability. Thus, this study proposed the following hypotheses for testing: Hypothesis 4 (H4a) Network orientation has a positive effect on the halal SMEs' competitive advantage.</p><p>Hypothesis 4 (H4b) Network orientation has a positive effect on the halal SMEs' economic sustainability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Innovation orientation</head><p>Innovation is one of the key strategic alternatives for businesses to attain competitive advantage by identifying demands of the market, product substitution, and economic stability (Anning-Dorson, 2018). Thus, an organisation has to pay attention on reformulating and implementing innovation in order to compete with its competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andonova and Otálora, 2020)</ref>. Additionally, innovation is considered as a strategy for halal SMEs to gain profits and opportunities in this highly competitive market <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Colclough et al., 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Fidel et al. (2018)</ref> noted the importance of innovation for SMEs, as an organisation requires innovation of mindset, products, and human capabilities to compete with its competitors. Digital innovation also tends to have positive influence on competitive advantage and sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cosimato &amp; Vona, 2021)</ref>. Furthermore, innovation and capabilities play significant influence of internal and ecosystem factors on sustainability, which have been proved to be extremely beneficial <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Desiana et al., 2022)</ref>. Therefore, this study proposed the following hypotheses for testing:</p><p>Hypothesis 5 (H5a) Innovation orientation has a positive effect on halal SMEs' competitive advantage.</p><p>Hypothesis 5 (H5b) Innovation orientation has a positive effect on halal SMEs' economic sustainability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Competitive advantage</head><p>As an organisation expands its products in the market, its competitive advantage and sustainability are somehow related. Price, quality, and the position of products from the perspectives of customers can be influenced by the economic stability of developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kwarteng et al., 2016)</ref>. Both sustainability and competitive advantage are considered as the core criteria of success (or failure) for halal SMEs in this highly turbulent global economy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Kwarteng et al. (2016)</ref> also highlighted the need for halal SMEs to develop dynamic capability in order to address the paradoxical nature of resource environment. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Fiori and Foroni (2019)</ref>, competitive advantage is one of key factors for halal SMEs to attain economic sustainability. Organisations that are willing to invest specific resources, such as technology adoption, to create business value are likely to gain competitive advantage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Sidek et al. (2020)</ref> stated that the strategy of meeting customers' needs helps halal SMEs to gain competitive advantage and subsequently, economic sustainability. This particular result was found similar with the result reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Mukhsin and Suryanto (2022)</ref> on the positive influence of competitive advantage on sustainability. As such, the following hypothesis was proposed for testing:</p><p>Hypothesis 6 (H6) Competitive advantage has a positive effect on the halal SMEs' economic sustainability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediating effect</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Syapsan (2019)</ref>, competitive advantage is derived from two types of resources, namely tangible resources (which include physical assets) and intangible resources (e.g., human capability). Human capability is part of an organisation's valuable assets to gain competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kamboj &amp; Rahman, 2017)</ref>. Most importantly, the capability to strategically meet customers' needs ensures customer satisfaction, which is important for halal SMEs in their efforts to gain competitive advantage and sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Sihite, 2018)</ref>. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Correia et al. (2020)</ref> confirmed the mediating role of competitive advantage in the relationship between dynamic capability and business sustainability. Prior studies reported that the mediation effect of competitive advantage enhances the influence of other predictors on sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anwar et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Yang et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Mukhsin and Suryanto (2022)</ref> found that competitive advantage mediates the statistically significant influence of supply chain management on company performance. Therefore, this study proposed the following hypothesis:</p><p>Hypothesis 7 (H7) Competitive advantage mediates the relationship between the economic sustainability of halal SMEs and customers orientation, competitor orientation, technology orientation, network orientation and innovation orientation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research design</head><p>This section critically clarifies the approaches that were adopted in this study to achieve its objectives. This study employed a quantitative approach in the form of survey design to explore the observable fact and present robust explanations to the identified problems. The survey design and the quantitative nature were deemed essential for this study. A closed-ended type was employed for the developed questionnaire. The most popular form of survey design used in social research is cross-sectional survey design <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Rindfleisch et al., 2008)</ref>. In a cross-sectional survey design, the study collected data at one point in time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Sedgwick (2014)</ref> stated that this design has the advantage of measuring current attitudes or practices. It also provides valuable information within a short amount of time, such as the time required to administer the survey and collect the information. However, the timing of the cross-sectional snapshot may be unrepresentative of the behaviour of the group as a whole <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Sedgwick, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Yang et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population and sample</head><p>Questionnaires were distributed to halal SMEs in Indonesia via Google Form link from 24 November 2020 to 20 December 2020. Convenience sampling technique was employed to collect data from the respondents because many SME owners in Indonesia are not registered in SME associations; therefore, this study encountered difficulty in using a probability sampling technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Riyanti et al., 2022)</ref>. Although respondents were recruited through a non-probability approach, the selection was conducted carefully <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Zhou, Su, et al., 2021)</ref>. The sample size was calculated using the G-Power software. With the power of 0.95 (greater than 0.80 as a requirement in social and behavioural science research) and an effect size of 0.15, a sample size of 111 was required to analyse a model with six constructs. A total of 284 respondents were sampled. This study also conducted a pre-test to examine the reliability and validity of each indicator before the distribution of questionnaires. Apart from survey, this study conducted structural interviews to acquire more detailed information on the competitive advantage and economic sustainability of halal SMEs in Indonesia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments</head><p>Focusing on the influence of strategic orientation on economic sustainability, partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed in this study to assess the complex cause-effect relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Carrion et al., 2019)</ref>. Customer orientation in this study focused on how halal SMEs understand customers' needs through the collection of information, dissemination of customer-focused strategies, and responsiveness to the potential market <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Jeong et al., 2006)</ref>. The indicators of customer orientation (six items) were derived from <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Jeong et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Tseng (2019)</ref>. Furthermore, the indicators of competitor orientation (five items) were adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Jeong et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Sorensen et al. (2008)</ref>. Next, the indicators of technology orientation (six items) were adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Jeong et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Masa'deh et al. (2018)</ref>. For the measurement of network orientation, this study adopted indicators (five items) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Borgatti and Foster (2003)</ref>. Meanwhile, the indicators of innovation orientation (six items) were derived from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bouncken and Koch (2007)</ref>. Competitive advantage refers to differentiation strategy to obtain customers' attention, cost reduction, and exploitation of market opportunities for improved performance. The indicators of competitive advantage (seven items) in this study were extracted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Kuo et al. (2017)</ref>. Lastly, economic sustainability (five items) in this study focused on the financial perspective, such as profitability, cost reduction, and management needed to focus on sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ferro et al., 2019)</ref>. All above items were measured using a five-point Likert scale, which ranged from "strongly disagree" (1) to "strongly agree" (5). These items were included in the initial questionnaire. The study focused on data collection procedures, such as the purpose of the study, administration of questionnaires, and ethical issues. Confidentiality of all respondents was noted. Participation in the study was strictly on a voluntary basis, and respondents were able to withdraw at any time during the study without any fear of victimisation or discrimination. The obtained data were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis, validity and reliability testing, SEM, and neural network analysis.</p></div>

Considering that this study employed confirmatory research design, the considered criterion was that the critical ratio of a construct should be greater than 0.07, indicating adequate reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. As depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, the Cronbach's alpha values of all constructs exceeded 0.07, confirming adequate reliability. Meanwhile, the indicator reliability was assessed using composite reliability, whereby the criterion was that the recorded value of a construct must exceed 0.06. The results revealed the acceptability of composite reliability for all factors. Next, the convergent validity of constructs was assessed using average variance extracted (AVE). The criterion was that the AVE value must exceed 0.50. The results revealed substantial AVE for all constructs, confirming their convergent validity.</p><p>Apart from the convergent validity test, the construct validity assessment in PLS-SEM was conducted by evaluating the discriminant validity of the constructs. Discriminant validity ensures that latent variable constructs are different from one another. The results of cross-loadings were referred in this study to assess the discriminant validity of the constructs. The initial discriminant validity of the constructs was tested using another method of assessing the cross-loadings of the indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> presents the results of cross-loadings. This study confirmed the discriminant validity of all constructs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Testing of hypotheses</head><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, the results demonstrated the causal relationship between customer orientation and competitive advantage (H1a). The results showed the significant and positive relationship between customer orientation and competitive advantage (t = 2.032, p = 0.021). Thus, H1a was supported. The present study supported the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lee et al. (2019)</ref>, which reported the positive influence of customer orientation on economic sustainability. Similarly, the results of the current study revealed the significant and positive influence of customer orientation on  economic sustainability (t = 2.038, p = 0.022), which supported H1b. Besides that, competitor orientation was found to exhibit significant and positive influence on competitive advantage (H2a) (t = 1.917, p = 0.028) and economic sustainability (H2b) (t = 1.905, p = 0.029). These findings were found to be consistent with the findings reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Tseng et al. (2021)</ref> on the important role of the RBV in describing the capabilities to understand consumers' needs towards achieving competitive advantage and sustainability. Based on the results of the current study, both H2a and H2b were accepted. Meanwhile, technology orientation was found to exhibit significant and positive effects on competitive advantage (H3a) (t = 4.217, p = 0.000) and economic sustainability (H3b) (t = 4.107, p = 0.000). In other words, H3a and H3b were accepted. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Park and Zhang (2022)</ref> stated that implementing new technologies of halal SMEs can enable businesses to gain competitive advantage and economic sustainability, as well as long-term profits. Likewise, network orientation was found to exhibit significant and positive effects on competitive advantage (H4a) (t = 2.000, p = 0.023) and economic sustainability (H4b) (t = 1.979, p = 0.024). These results supported both H4a and H4b. This study also demonstrated the significant and positive influence of innovation orientation on both competitive advantage (H5a) (t = 5.110, p = 0.000) and economic sustainability (H5b) (t = 4.904, p = 0.000). This present study supported the study of performance. Therefore, all exogenous variables exhibited small level of predictive relevance with the respective endogenous variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediation effect</head><p>The obtained results of this study revealed the mediation effect of competitive advantage on the relationship between customer orientation and economic sustainability ( β = 0.103 , p = 0.021). Moreover, competitive advantage mediated the relationship between competitor orientation and economic sustainability (β = 0.094, p = 0.029). Similarly, competitive advantage mediated the relationship between technology orientation and economic sustainability (β = 0.173, p = 0.000) and the relationship between network orientation and economic sustainability (β = 0.111, p = 0.024). Finally, this study also demonstrated the mediation effect of competitive advantage on the relationship between innovation orientation and economic sustainability (β = 0.327, p = 0.000).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The purpose of this study was to examine the mediation effects of competitive advantage on the relationship between strategic orientation (customer orientation, competitor orientation, technology orientation, network orientation, and innovation orientation) and economic sustainability of halal SMEs. This study proposed RBV to explain the roles of halal SME owners' capabilities of implementing strategic orientation and competitive advantage towards economic sustainability in this highly competitive market <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barney, 1991)</ref>.

Therefore, this study proposed the significance of innovation, strategic orientation, and knowledge for economic sustainability.</p><p>This study demonstrated the significant influence of strategic orientation on economic sustainability of halal SMEs. The results of this study confirmed the significant mediating role of competitive advantage in increasing the performance and promoting economic sustainability among halal SMEs. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Deyganto (2022)</ref> found that SMEs strategic orientation has a significant effect on the economic sustainability and growth among others. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Daengs et al. (2019)</ref> argued that competitive advantage is a consequence of the existing value of potential competitors with strategic differentiation to win this intense competition. The current study showed the significant contributions of customer orientation and competitive advantage on economic sustainability. The present study supported the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lee et al. (2019)</ref>, which stressed the significance of customer orientation in creating long-term profit and economic sustainability for halal SMEs to avoid falling into the trap of adopting short-term approaches. Apart from that, this study emphasised the significant contribution of competitor orientation on economic sustainability of halal SMEs through the adoption of competitive advantage. This study also found the significant relationship of competitor orientation with competitive advantage and sustainability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Tseng et al. (2021)</ref> reported similar findings on how the RBV can explain the relationship between competitor orientation, as external resource, and competitive advantage. Through competitor orientation and innovation, SMEs obtain information to apply long-term strategies and intelligence for approaches to environmental benefits that are preferred by customers. Competitor orientation is crucial for competitive activities and strategies. Through competitor orientation, halal SMEs focus on increasing their strategy and diversifying their products and services.</p><p>Besides that, this study found the positive and significant influence of technology orientation on competitive advantage and sustainability. Technological and innovative  This study demonstrated the significant and positive influence of innovation orientation on competitive advantage and economic sustainability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Desiana et al. (2022)</ref> showed that enterprises should increase and gain innovation capability to capture what is happening in the ecosystem and combine it with internal resources to innovate. Moreover, the collaboration between innovation and capabilities can achieve competitive advantage and sustainability. Therefore, this study focused on the dynamic capability perspective of a greater insight on how strategic orientation influences economic sustainability. Focusing on exploring external and internal resources, halal SMEs can ensure resource complementary for competitive advantage and economic sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Mu et al., 2017)</ref>. The current study's findings on the significant influence of innovation orientation on economic sustainability contributed to the strategic literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Samsir (2018)</ref> stated that entrepreneurs must have an open mindset, such as gaining new ideas and improving learning capability in order to implement the ideas to achieve strategic differentiation.</p><p>Furthermore, this study argued that competitive advantage is a crucial factor in the relationship between strategic orientation and economic sustainability. Theoretically, the integration of competitive advantage as a mediator in this study extended the RBV theory and literature on dynamic capability. This study concluded the significant role of competitive advantage in mediating the relationship between strategic orientation and economic sustainability. Additionally, the current study extended the halal entrepreneurship literature through human network, network capability, and competitive advantage in the digitalisation era. Besides that, this study demonstrated the mediating role of competitive advantage. Halal SMEs need to recognise the importance of competitive advantage by transforming new systems in manufacturing, product delivery system, and online sales platform of halal products in order to accomplish strategic diversification and innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Mukhsin &amp; Suryanto, 2022)</ref>. SMEs should also consider using technology, innovation, and network (internal resources) as well as customer orientation and competitor orientation (external resources) as support systems to reinforce the willingness of customers to purchase halal products. Competitive advantage stimulates creative and innovative thoughts to experiment with new strategies among entrepreneurs. Hence, SMEs can unlock their learning potential in new halal product development and subsequently, achieve economic sustainability. Therefore, SMEs offer the best solutions to the country's gross domestic development, reduction of unemployment, and creating smooth economic environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kassa, 2021)</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kostis (2021)</ref> stated that SMEs and society are not ready to accept policy change, which would result in policy failure as well as ineffective policy responses, innovation outcomes, and economic development, affecting the sustainability of the overall economic system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Halal SME entrepreneurs need to be competent and continue improving their technological skills and implementing strategies and innovations. The local, global and competitive landscapes have been transformed by the influence of knowledge, innovation, and strategy. The government, ecological democracy, and society also play a major role in creating an environment that supports strategy and innovation for halal SMEs to achieve economy sustainability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical implications</head><p>This study contributed to the existing literature on strategic management and identified resource-based approach (owners' capabilities). The quadruple and quintuple innovation helix concepts (democracy of knowledge, ecosystem, innovation, and knowledge) are two important basic theories that explain strategic orientation, competitive advantage, and economic sustainability of halal SMEs. This study developed RBV through competitive advantage as a mediator, and this study found that all constructs increase the economy sustainability of halal entrepreneurship. Competitive orientation, customer orientation, competitor orientation, network orientation, innovation orientation, and technological turbulence can adequately improve the survival and sustenance of halal enterprises into an unforeseeable future. Resource capability and competitive advantage can improve the efficiency of enterprises. Strategic orientation is an attribute that can adequately improve the competitive advantage of halal enterprises. Moreover, the quadruple and quintuple innovation helix concepts explain the significant roles of environment, policy, and knowledge for SMEs to gain sustainability. The democracy of innovation, knowledge, and strategy help halal SMEs to expand their market and position in hyper-competitive market.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical implications</head><p>This study offered several recommendations for halal small businesses to remain sustainable or competitive through strategy orientation. The study also presented relevant recommendations for policymakers and other concerned bodies. Based on the findings of this study, innovation, customer, competitor, network, innovation, and competitive intensity are critical in determining the robustness of resource capability. These aspects adequately improve the growth of sales and the survival and sustenance of halal enterprises into an unforeseeable future, as well as the efficiency of enterprises and competitive advantage of halal enterprises, particularly in trying to be different from other competitors. Additionally, decisions on the survival of enterprises into an unforeseeable future, resource capability of competitive advantage and environmental turbulence should be prioritised. Finally, when it comes to the decisions on economic sustainability, resource capability of strategic orientation should be the main focus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social, policy, and science implications</head><p>This present study's findings also contribute to the social environment. Halal SMEs should focus on strategic orientation by combining internal resources (innovation and network) and external resources (customer orientation and competitor orientation) to gain competitiveness and sustainability. Secondly, customers have been increasingly aware with healthy consumption and habit of purchasing halal products. Consuming halal products can create an eco-friendly system that creates positive life circumstances.</p><p>Additionally, this study suggested a few policies. Firstly, the regulation maker of halal certification (Islamic Council of Indonesia) serves as an important strategic institution for sustainability by proposing and educating customers to consume healthy and halal products. Secondly, education is a central plot for new start-ups to obtain entrepreneurial knowledge and training. Thirdly, the government should provide infrastructure development and policies of halal products, which focus on innovation, competition, and growth of SMEs, for halal enterprises to make significant contributions towards economic sustainability. Additionally, the government can support halal SMEs to invest in modern production facilities (processes, equipment, and technologies) in order to have capabilities and capacities of local industries that meet international quality standards, resulting in more halal SMEs that are able to enter new export markets. Moreover, the government, society, and SMEs should increase knowledge, innovation, and culture change to gain their market share locally and globally and expand the performance and economic sustainability of SMEs.</p><p>This study also recommended that science and halal SMEs focus on implementing strategies, as these strategies facilitate SME managers or owners to design, develop, and enhance resource-based approach and capabilities. With respect to the quadruple and quintuple innovation helix concepts, establishing science and knowledge in universities can be helpful for quicker exchanges or interactions of strategies and capabilities among universities, industries, the government, and actors of SMEs. Last but not the least, the developed questionnaire in this study served as a tool to discover shortcomings and deficiencies in the path of promoting sustainability in science and SMEs.</p><p>Overall, policy, education and training, and infrastructure development should focus on halal SME innovation, competition, and sustainability for halal enterprises to make significant contributions towards social implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of study and recommendations for future research</head><p>This study encountered a few limitations. Cross-sectional data were obtained from 284 halal SMEs in Indonesia. Thus, a larger sample is recommended for future research to generalise and better understand the implementation of strategic orientation and policy decision-making for halal SMEs. Secondly, competitive orientation, customer orientation, competitor orientation, network orientation, innovation orientation, and technological orientation were employed in this study to explore the role of strategic orientation as well as the mediating role of competitive advantage. Additionally, the profitability and cost reduction were employed in this study to represent economic sustainability. Therefore, other indicators of economic sustainability can be implemented to achieve various outcomes. Lastly, the dynamic capability approach can be explored in relation to the economic sustainability of halal enterprises in developing and developed countries.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><graphic coords="20,127.54,524.02,340.20,183.72" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_6"><head>Table 7</head><label>7</label><figDesc>Sensitivity analysis Research frameworkactivities and the potential for both radical and incremental changes are central for the sustainability of halal SMEs. This study also found the significant influence of technology orientation on economic sustainability, such as technological superiority to differentiate new products. This study supported the findings of<ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Park and Zhang (2022)</ref> on technology as a strong attribute of social elements and new information and communication. Technologies provide positive benefits for businesses to increase their acceptability and sustainability. Moreover, the adoption of new technologies helps halal SMEs to gain competitive advantage and economic sustainability. Adding to that, this study pointed out the significant effect of network and competitive advantage and sustainability. The information exchange between halal SMEs and network actors, such as capabilities, devices, and other materials, is essential in building economic sustainability. Network orientation can be successfully implemented to achieve a strategy when an organisation is able to combine networking capability and human networking. This finding was found to be in line with the finding of<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Haffar et al. (2022)</ref> on the necessity of network orientation for knowledge transfer, helping SMEs to innovate and move towards what strategies needed to implement in a hyper-market competition. The study also found that organisations require information about market conditions and customers' needs, suggesting the importance of network

This procedure can only be applied to endogenous constructs with reflective indicators. The predictive relevance of a model in this study was collectively calculated using the predictive relevance (Q 2 ) of all factors at the individual level (single factor).
