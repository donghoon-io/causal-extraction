<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This article investigates grocery store format patronage behaviour of elderly shoppers. The aim is to identify specific antecedents of this consumer group and investigate heterogeneity between segments in terms of their patronage behaviour. Based on a literature review we set up a conceptual model that proposes effects between the perception of store attributes, satisfaction, patronage intention and the share of visits. We test the model using a survey of more than 400 supermarket patrons aged 60 and over who live in a highly concentrated urban retail environment. Variance based structural equation modelling reveals that the product range and the price-value ratio have the most considerable impact on patronage behaviour of supermarkets. Nevertheless, response based segmentation identifies unobserved heterogeneity in the overall modelling results. Unlike demographic characteristics of the respondents the variables 'availability of a car' and 'problems in walking longer distances' explain the heterogeneity of the results between segments where significantly different impacts of accessibility and price-value ratio on patronage behaviour can be identified.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Heterogeneity</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Older shoppers have become an important and growing segment due to the 'greying of market places' <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Zeithaml and Gilly 1987)</ref> and being a challenged and disadvantaged consumer group. For that reason <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pan and Zinkhan (2006)</ref> call for a stronger research focus on the question 'Why do older people shop where they do?' A deeper understanding of the store format patronage behaviour of this particular consumer segment would ultimately enable retailers to take the specific needs of elderly consumers into account in their operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mason and Bearden 1979)</ref>. This is particularly true for grocery shopping -a frequent and challenging task in older consumers' lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Whelan et al. 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The phenomenon of store patronage behaviour in general has received extensive attention in the marketing, retailing and consumer behaviour literature for more than seventy years (see the meta-analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pan and Zinkhan (2006)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Reutterer and Teller (2009)</ref>). Therefore, grocery stores -due to their number and importance for consumers' daily life -have traditionally been of primary interest for researchers. Nevertheless, the grocery store patronage behaviour and its antecedents of older consumer cohorts have received only limited explicit attention (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The major critique towards existing findings is that they neglect an explicit aggregated view on a store format level. This is surprising because before consumers choosing a specific store they first decide on the store format, e.g. supermarkets, hypermarkets, convenience stores or discounters <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(González-Benito, Muñoz-Gallego and Kopalle 2005)</ref>. Thus store patronage is embedded in store format patronage.</p><p>Since the shopping behaviour of older consumers is found to be distinctive, further research with respect to store format patronage is seen to require stronger consideration by researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Yoon et al. 2005)</ref>. The only study considering grocery store format patronage was conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Keillor, Parker and Erffmeyer (1996)</ref>. They revealed that the process of choosing store formats in terms of older consumers in the United States does not vary between age cohorts only between formats. Overall the shortcomings of existing studies dealing with either grocery store patronage can be summarised as follows:</p><p>-There is no explicit view towards store format choice and patronage with respect to the specific needs and shopping behaviour of older consumers.</p><p>-The multi-dimensional character of store (format) attributes has not been taken into account to a satisfactory degree.</p><p>-The relationship between the perception of format attributes, satisfaction, patronage intention and actual store format patronage behaviour, e.g. share of visits or spending, has been neglected <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Orth and Green 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Grace and O'Cass 2005)</ref>.</p><p>-The segmentation of older shoppers was conducted 'a priori' by usually using either a demographic or a psychographic variable. A response based segmentation using the actual patronage behaviour and its antecedents has not been applied.</p><p>Research also fails to investigate (the determinants of) heterogeneity of older consumers based on their grocery store (format) patronage behaviour. Based on this research gap the aim of this paper is (1) to investigate the antecedents of store (format) patronage behaviour of older cohorts, (2) to identify segments of older consumers based on their store format patronage behaviour and (3) consequently to characterise these segments. Thus, the contribution of this paper is to reveal variables that directly impact and moderate patronage behaviour of older consumers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[Table 1 near here]</head><p>The paper has the following structure: after these introductory remarks we present a conceptual model that comprises the major hypotheses derived from literature. The next section characterises the empirical research design and explains the analysis approach.</p><p>Consequently, the modelling results are presented and discussed with respect to the literature.</p><p>A limitation and outlook section concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual model and hypotheses</head><p>The phenomenon of store patronage behaviour has received extensive attention in the marketing and retailing literature for more than seventy years (see e.g. the seminal works from <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Reilly (1931)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Huff (1964)</ref>. To understand the antecedents of store patronage studies have been grounded in the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mazursky and Jacoby 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Finn and Louviere 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sherman, Mathur and Smith 1997)</ref>. This framework is rooted in the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mehrabian and Russel (1974)</ref> whereby a stimulus is posited to lead to an evaluation and emotional reaction which subsequently informs consumer behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Donovan and Rossiter 1982)</ref>.</p><p>Within this framework and based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sheth's (1999)</ref> integrated theory of patronage behaviour we built upon the models of patronage behaviour of elderly grocery shoppers <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sirohi, McLaughlin and Wittink 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Szymanski and Henard 2001)</ref>. The model proposes direct effects between store attributes (stimuli or antecedents) and the satisfaction (response or shopping predisposition). Furthermore, satisfaction is proposed to result in repatronage intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Oliver 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Szymanski and Henard 2001)</ref>; such repatronage intentions lead to patronage behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fornell 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sirohi, McLaughlin and Wittink 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sheth 1999)</ref>. In terms of the selection of relevant store attributes we follow the notions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pan and Zinkhan (2006)</ref> and take the special needs and preferences of older consumers into account. The seven hypotheses setting up the conceptual model are as follows (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</p><p>For older consumers the physical access is a crucial determinant of store patronage behaviour in particularly in the case of grocery shopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Whelan et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hare 2003)</ref>. Since the personal mobility deteriorates with increasing age accessibility of stores becomes more important for older consumer cohorts <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Moschis, Curasi and Bellenger 2004)</ref>. Therefore we propose a significant impact of accessibility on satisfaction in hypothesis H 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Clark, Long and Schiffman 1999)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H 1 :</formula><p>The accessibility of a store has a significant impact on satisfaction.</p><p>The manoeuvrability within the outlet is another antecedent of store patronage behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Meneely, Strugnell and Burns 2009)</ref>. Due to their physical, biological and cognitive abilities older consumers find it more problematic to navigate their way round a store and target the products they look for <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hare, Kirk and Lang 2001)</ref>. From this we derive the second hypothesis H 2 :</p><p>H 2 : The manoeuvrability within a store has a significant impact on satisfaction.</p><p>The presentation and promotion of products on shelves (i.e. shelf management) enables consumers to find and compare products and thus facilitate the shopping process in-store. The whole picking process is more challenging for older consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Goodwin and Mcelwee 1999)</ref>. They have difficulties reading labels and finding the products they look for due to deteriorating eye-sight <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hare 2003)</ref>. Older consumers also have problems reaching products in top or bottom shelf levels. Since older consumers cope with theses challenges worse than younger consumers we propose H 3 : H 3 : The shelf management has a significant impact on satisfaction.</p><p>Besides accessibility the two other most frequently investigated determinants are the pricevalue ratio and the product range of a store <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Radford-Lewis and Nimbs 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pan and Zinkhan 2006)</ref>. Older consumer cohorts are characterised as being price and quality sensitive or savvy and spending more time in comparing prices and quality of products in store <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Keillor, Parker and Erffmeyer 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Goodwin and Mcelwee 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Moschis, Curasi and Bellenger 2004)</ref>. The next two hypotheses are:</p><p>H 4 : The price-value ratio of products offered in grocery store has a significant impact on satisfaction.</p><p>H 5 : The product range in a grocery store has a significant impact on satisfaction.</p><p>[Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> near here] According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sheth's (1999)</ref> theory, satisfaction results into behavioural intentions and consequently behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Szymanski and Henard 2001)</ref>. Although older consumers -due to their diminishing cognitive and intellectual abilities show a weaker link between these three constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Yoon et al. 2005)</ref> we propose:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">H 6 :</formula><p>The satisfaction with a grocery store has a significant impact on repatronage intentions of consumers.</p><p>H 7 : The repatronage intentions with respect to a store have significant impact on patronage behaviour.</p><p>We now turn to the empirical investigation of our conceptual model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirical study</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research design</head><p>To test the conceptual model we use the data from a survey that focused on the grocery shopping behaviour of older consumer cohorts in a typical European urban retail environment, i.e. high store density, high standardisation of outlets, high price and quality based competition. The sampling approach consisted of two stages. Firstly, in order to target the most appropriate informants in terms of store patronage behaviour of older shoppers within households we first drew a purposive sample and included only those consumers older than sixty who did not have any disabilities that substantially constrained them in their daily life and who were able carry out their grocery shopping themselves. Secondly, we applied quota sampling and used age, gender and district of residence as quota controls. Out of a sample of 800 senior grocery shoppers we selected those 404 who patronise supermarkets.</p><p>This store format comprises stores with a floor space of 800 square metres offering around 7,000 stock keeping units. Supermarkets are the dominant store format in this urban market whereas -due to the high concentration -the outlets are much standardised in terms of the layout, the product range and retail marketing strategy in general. Our professional interviewers administered the standardised questionnaire and interviewed the senior shoppers in their homes. The questionnaire contained questions of grocery shopping habits, store patronage behaviour, store attributes, shopping orientation and demo-/ psychographics.</p><p>The sample predominantly consists of female consumers (69.7%; n, 404). About 44 per cent are married or live in a partnership; the rest are single, divorced or widowed. The respondents are highly educated, every fifth has an A-level equivalent qualification (26%) and every eighth (14.3%) has a university degree. On average they live in households together with another person (µ, (mean value), 1.66; σ (standard deviation), .88) whereas the number of persons under 18 years is 0.11 on average per household (σ, 0.31). Three out of five respondents are retired. The average chronological age of the sample is 69. <ref type="bibr">89 (σ, 8.19)</ref>.</p><p>Overall, the sample reflects the demographic structure of the urban population older than 60 in terms of gender, chronological age, marital status, educational level and household size (Χ 2 -test; p&gt;.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>The conceptual model includes reflective constructs, thus the indicators representing manifestations of the constructs. The scales standing behind the latent construct were taken from the literature and slightly adapted based on the result from three preliminary focus group discussions (see Appendix). We applied variance-based structural equation modelling (Partial-Least-Square (PLS)) to test the proposed effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chin 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Tenenhaus et al. 2005)</ref>, and used the software SmartPLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ringle, Wende and Will 2005)</ref>. To test for unobserved heterogeneity in the PLS path modelling results and consequently identify segments within our sample we utilised the Finite Mixture Partial Least Square Approach (FIMIX-PLS) as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sarstedt and Ringle (2010)</ref>. For the post hoc analysis we followed the notions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ramaswamy et al. (1993) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hahn et al. (2002)</ref>.</p><p>The PLS and the FIMIX-PLS approach conveys a number of advantages in terms level of measurement and multinormality compared to a co-variance based SEM-approaches.</p><p>Nevertheless, the primary motivation of applying PLS was to estimate structural models for identified segments (subsamples) of smaller sample sizes.</p><p>To investigate the moderating effect of those variables that are identified in the post hoc analysis we tested for invariances of the structural effects by using the formula as presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Keil et al. (2000)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">‫ݐ‬ = ߚ ଵ -ߚ ଶ ට ሺ݊ ଵ -1ሻ ଶ ݊ ଵ + ݊ ଶ -2 * ‫݁ݏ‬ ఉ భ ଶ + ሺ݊ ଶ -1ሻ ଶ ݊ ଵ + ݊ ଶ -2 * ‫݁ݏ‬ ఉ మ ଶ * ට 1 ݊ ଵ + 1 ݊ ଶ</formula><p>Where β 1 (β 2 ) is the path coefficient of group 1 (group 2) to be compared, n 1 (n 2 ) is the number of observations in group 1 (group 2) and se 1 (se 2 ) standard error of β 1 (β 2 ). In the case of a significant empirical t-value invariance of path coefficients can be assumed.</p><p>Finally, we present the (global) modelling results based on the whole sample of 404 and consequently turn to the FIMIX-PLS segmentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural effects -aggregate results</head><p>In a first step we applied the standard PLS path modelling algorithm to the data from the whole sample and evaluated the measurement (outer) model and consequently the coefficients from the structural (inner) model. By testing the local fit of the outer-or measurement model (i.e. the sets of constructs with the observable items standing behind them) we see that all t-values of the factor loadings prove to be highly significant (p&lt;0.001) and all loadings exceed the suggested size of 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hulland 1999)</ref>. The internal consistency is also considered to be satisfactory for all factors with Cronbach Alphas exceeding 0.7 <ref type="bibr">(Nunnally, 1978)</ref> and the composite reliability of all factors greater than 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fornell and Larcker 1981)</ref>. The degree of convergent validity of each of the constructs is acceptable with average variances extracted (AVE) in the range of 0.5 or higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bagozzi and Yi 1988)</ref>. With regard to the constructs' discriminant validity, the AVE is larger than the highest squared intercorrelation with every other factor in the measurement models; i.e. the Fornell-Larcker-Ratio (FLR) is less than 1.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fornell and Larcker 1981)</ref>. It can be concluded that there is a sufficient local fit of the data.</p><p>To evaluate the overall fit of the model with the empirical data we calculated the goodness of fit criterion proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Tenenhaus et al. (2005)</ref> in the form of the geometric mean of the average communality and average r 2 . The data from the whole sample provides a reasonable fit to the proposed model being slightly below the recommended threshold of 0.5 (GoF (global) ,</p><p>.444).</p><p>Next we focus on the structural effects. By following <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chin (1998)</ref> we evaluated the structural models by using the coefficients of determination (r 2 ), the size, signs and significance of the single path coefficients (γ n ) and the effect sizes (f 2 ). The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>. The results based on the total sample of supermarket patrons show that all hypotheses can be confirmed except H 1 and H 3 . Thus both accessibility and shelf management have no impact on satisfaction. Therefore, the t-values of the path coefficients are below the threshold of 1.965 which indicated that the structural effects are not significant on a 5% level. By interpreting the f-values we see that the product range has the strongest positive effect on satisfaction followed by the price-value ratio. The orientation within the store has a comparably weak effect on the dependent construct. The effect between satisfaction and repatronage intention turns out to be both highly significant and strong. Despite this, the significant impact of the construct of behavioural intention and actual behaviour in terms of the share of visits is low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response based segmentation</head><p>The latent variable scores for each observation obtained from utilising the standard PLS path modelling on the aggregated data feed into the FIMIX-PLS (for more detail on the four analysis steps see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sarstedt and Ringle (2010)</ref>). Since the number of segments was not known we ran the procedure for two to six segments. Due to the fact that it is not clear whether the FIMIX-PLS stops at a local instead of an overall optimum solution the algorithm was started the procedure 20 times for each predefined number of segments and selected those segmentation result that showed the lowest heuristic measures in terms of Akaike's information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criteria (BIC) and Consistent AIC (CAIC)</p><p>as suggested by e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hahn et al. (2002)</ref>. These criteria are derived from the goodness-of-fit of models and the number of parameters used to achieve that fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ringle, Sarstedt and Schlittgen 2010)</ref>. A combination of all three criteria was used to examine the competing models with different numbers of segments. From that it is clear that the two segment solution shows the lowest values of each alternative number of classes (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). The normed entropy statistics are above the recommended threshold of 0.5 and thus indicate a satisfactory degree of separation between the two segments <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Wedel and Kamakura 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sarstedt and Ringle 2010)</ref>.</p><p>[Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> near here]</p><p>The unambiguousness of the segmentation can also be seen from the probabilities indicating the segment membership of each observation. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> shows the distribution of probabilities for each solution in terms of different numbers of predefined segments. In the case of the two segment solution almost 90% of all observations are assigned a segment with a probability higher than 0.7. This share decreases for solutions with more predefined segments (K&gt;2).</p><p>[Table <ref type="table">3</ref> near here] Thus, we can conclude that the two segment solution is to be favoured showing a split between a big segment containing 86% (K I ) and a small segment including 14% (K II ) of all observations.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4</ref> depicts the path coefficients of the two segments. Unsurprisingly the path coefficients of K I are quite similar to the modelling results that are based on the aggregate data. An exception is the role of accessibility which now shows a positive impact on satisfaction.</p><p>Furthermore the effect of patronage intentions on patronage behaviour is considerably smaller. By interpreting the r 2 -values it can be seen that both satisfaction and patronage intention show a higher share of explained variance whereas this share is very low for patronage behaviour, i.e. intention does not reflect behaviour. The structural effects in the smaller segment K II vary from the overall results considerably. Therefore, satisfactionhaving a remarkably high r 2 -value -is strongly affected by shelf management and the product range. Remarkably, repatronage intentions show a very high impact on patronage behaviour.</p><p>The high explanatory power of behaviour intension is consequently reflected in a high r 2value of the behavioural constructs.</p><p>From this finding it becomes clear that an interpretation of the modelling results from the aggregate data can be misleading and unobserved heterogeneity can be observed. In order to characterise (the differences between) the two segments and to enrich the interpretation of the variances between the effects we now turn to the results of the post hoc analysis.</p><p>[Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4</ref> near here]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post hoc analysis</head><p>In line with the suggested FIMIX PLS approach from Hahn et al. ( <ref type="formula">2002</ref>) we analysed the (posterior) probabilities of memberships based on the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ramaswamy et al. (1993)</ref>.</p><p>The demographic and psychographic variables that we propose to explain the probabilities are based on the notions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Radford-Lewis (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Radford-Lewis and Nimbs (2005)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Goodwin and Mcelwee (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Sudbury and Simcock (2009b)</ref>. We distinguish between personal characteristics (sex, chronological age, cognitive age, marital status, professional status, health condition, activity level), household characteristics (household size, dependent children/teenager in the household, availability of a car) and personal shopping-related issues.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">5</ref> depicts the impact coefficients and their t-values. We see that only two variables have a significant impact (p&lt;.05) and are consequently interpreted as descriptors of the two segments, i.e. the availability of a car and issues with walking more than 500 metres. By interpreting the sign of the (beta) coefficient (β uk ) it can be concluded that the availability of a car for the respondent indicates that he/she is more likely to belong to the smaller segment.</p><p>[Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">5</ref> near here]</p><p>The less a respondent indicates that he/she has problems with walking longer distances the more he/she is likely to be a member of the smaller group. Apart from these two variables no other variable shows significant impact on the probabilities.</p><p>By conducting the last step in the FIMIX PLS procedure we use the two descriptors as a priori grouping and accordingly estimate our model based on appropriate splits. The results can be retrieved from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">6</ref>. By comparing the structural effects between the groups differentiated by the availability of a car we see significant different effects in terms of accessibility, manoeuvrability and shelf management on satisfaction and in terms of satisfaction on repatronage intention. All four differences reflect the FIMIX PLS results (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4</ref>).</p><p>[Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">6</ref> near here]</p><p>Comparing the results between the groups based on whether the respondents have problems when walking longer distances again the impacts of accessibility and shelf management turn out to be significantly different. Additionally, the price-value ratio plays a different role for the two groups which again is in line with the FIMIX PLS results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>This study investigates the patronage behaviour of older shoppers of supermarkets, viz. a store format that exclusively includes highly standardised outlets. The modelling results of the aggregate sample confirm the importance of several store format attributes for the satisfaction of our respondents in line with findings from literature. Furthermore, satisfaction impacts the repatronage intentions significantly and the repatronage intentions affect the share of visits. Therefore, we can conclude that significant attributes represent antecedents of store format patronage behaviour. More specifically, the most important determinant attributes are the product range and price-value ratio. This is consistent with the findings of most studies dealing with store patronage and choice behaviour of older shoppers <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Tantiwong and Wilton 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Keillor, Parker and Erffmeyer 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Radford-Lewis 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Radford-Lewis and Nimbs 2005)</ref>. Both antecedents have also been identified by various studies on store format patronage behaviour which do not exclusively focus on the older consumer segment (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Reutterer and Teller 2009)</ref>. In line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lumpkin, Greenberg and Goldstucker (1985)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Goodwin and Mcelwee (1999)</ref> the manoeuvrability within the supermarkets proves to be of additional importance for the shopper segment investigated here. This finding proves to be more typical for the older consumer segment since they are more challenged in finding their way around the store <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hare 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Meneely, Strugnell and Burns 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Shelf management cannot be seen as a major antecedent of satisfaction and consequently on behavioural intentions and the patronage behaviour. This result contradicts the findings of Johnson-Hillery and Kang (1997) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Goodwin and Mcelwee (1999)</ref> and indicates that our respondents do not seem that challenged in reading labels, reaching and finding products on shelves <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hare 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The only unexpected result is the lack of significance and homogeneity of coefficients with respect to the effect of accessibility on satisfaction. This contradicts work dealing with older grocery shoppers -in particular that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Whelan et al. (2002)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hare (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Moschis and Mathur (2006)</ref> (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Nevertheless, the specific characteristics of the investigated retail market have to be taken into account, in particular its high store density. This finding can also be a consequence of the purposive sampling approach. We only targeted those older consumers who are still capable of carrying out the grocery shopping task for themselves and their households.</p><p>Our results confirm the strong link between satisfaction and behavioural intensions as proposed by e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sheth (1983)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Szymanski and Henard (2001)</ref> for older consumers.</p><p>Nevertheless, we must confirm the notions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Glasman and Albarracín (2006)</ref> in terms of repatronage intentions being a poor reflection of actual behaviour -a phenomenon that can be identified with various shopper segments -not exclusively old ones.</p><p>Another core finding of our study is that we found heterogeneity within the global results and thus between different segments. This contradicts the findings from e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Keillor, Parker and Erffmeyer (1996)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Radford-Lewis, (2003)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Radford-Lewis and Nimbs (2005)</ref> that are based on a priori segmentation procedures. In our case we identified two sub segments whose store format patronage behaviour -as proposed in our conceptual model -is distinctive from each other. The two groups are not different based on their demographic characteristics rather than their availability of a car within their household and their ability to overcome longer spatial distances by foot. The modelling results of these segments show a distinctive impact of the price-value ratio and the factors that can be understood as store-and product-related accessibility (accessibility, manoeuvrability, shelf management). These findings call for rethinking traditional (a priori) segmentation of older consumers based on demographic variables and a stronger awareness of latent heterogeneity behind global results of models explaining store (format) patronage behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Wedel and Kamakura 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Outlook</head><p>In order to keep the model parsimonious we included only a limited number of store attributes which are proposed to be of considerable relevance for older consumers. In future research the model could be amended or extended by factors like such as atmosphere, convenience or infrastructural services.</p><p>We find that the focus on supermarket patrons is another limitation. The presented study could be replicated for consumers patronising other store formats in other retail industries (e.g. hypermarkets, category killers, shopping centres).</p><p>The number of tested descriptors included in the post hoc analysis was also limited to the most important ones mentioned in literature. In particular psychographic variables such as shopping orientation should be considered in future research endeavours.       <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chin 1998)</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Like every empirical investigation in consumer research our results are influences by the specific retail and research environment of our study.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix</head><p>[Appendix near here] The authors investigate the importance of store attributes -such as store size, accessibility, service level and price -on store choice. They find price and accessibility as being most determinant for the store choice of older consumers. Additionally, benefit segments -based on the attributes' role for store choice -are identified. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lumpkin et al. 1985</ref> Postal survey Self explicated weights and multi discriminant analysis (MDA)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3009">consumers (United States)</head><p>The authors had their respondents evaluated different sets of attributes with respect to stores. These sets included convenience-store location and mobility, instore convenience and physical environment, price and quality aspects, social needs of the elderly. The most determinant attributes for consumers' patronage decision were related to the price/quality relationship and finding satisfactory products. The authors reveal the shift of importance of specific store attributes for store choice along with increasing age. Differences between cohorts (55-64, 65-74 und 75+) could be identified for discounts, close by parking spaces, assistance for finding products in store, specific checkouts, well known brands, product quality and price-value ratio. The core findings of this study are that the most important factors when shopping groceries for consumers 65+ are the price-value ration and the product range. Store layout-related attributes, e.g. wide aisles, shelf management, are of inferior importance for this cohort. These findings do not vary between older consumer cohorts having a different chronological age, self-perceived activity level, mobility or health state. The authors identified 14 factors that are relevant for older consumers when shopping for groceries. Among others they include accessibility, proximity to their homes, availability of well-known brands, fast checkout and discounts. Four homogenous sub segments were identified based on these factors. This study shows that older supermarket patrons prefer competent and friendly sales personnel, good quality products and an appealing store design. The web-presence, home delivery services and extended opening hours are of minor importance. Close proximity to their homes are of more importance to older consumers compared to younger ones.</p></div>
