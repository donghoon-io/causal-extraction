<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>For plant-pollinator interactions to occur, the flowering of plants and the flying period of pollinators (i.e. their phenologies) have to overlap. Yet, few models make use of this principle to predict interactions and fewer still are able to compare interaction networks of different sizes. Here, we tackled both challenges using Bayesian Structural Equation Models (SEM), incorporating the effect of phenological overlap in six plant-hoverfly networks. Insect and plant abundances were strong determinants of the number of visits, while phenology overlap alone was not sufficient, but significantly improved model fit. Phenology overlap was a stronger determinant of plant-pollinator interactions in sites where the average overlap was longer and network compartmentalization was weaker, i.e. at higher latitudes. Our approach highlights the advantages of using Bayesian SEMs to compare interaction networks of different sizes along environmental gradients and articulates the various steps needed to do so.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Understanding how phenology determines species interactions is a central question in the case of mutualistic networks. In plant-pollinator networks, phenology shapes their temporal and spatial limits, thus defining the area and the period along the season in which interactions preferably occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Olesen et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ogilvie &amp; Forrest 2017)</ref>. Since plant and pollinator phenologies are not equally affected by changes in environmental cues, partial or total phenological mismatches can occur as a result of environmental changes such as climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Parmesan 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rafferty 2017)</ref>. Phenological advances indeed increase at higher latitudes, as a response to the acceleration of warming temperature along the same gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Post et al. 2018)</ref>, increase phenological mismatch, and have the potential to threaten the synchrony needed for effective pollination <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hutchings et al. 2018)</ref>. Such environmental changes can thus drastically alter pollinator interactions through modified temporal overlap between pollinators and their floral resources leading, in extreme cases, to local extinctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Memmott et al. 2007</ref>) and the ensuing absence of the partner species at the location and/or time at which the interaction should have taken place <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Willmer 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Miller-Struttmann et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Rafferty et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hutchings et al. 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Because phenological match is crucial to plant-pollinator interactions, and thus ultimately to pollinators' fitness, pollinators have to adapt to phenological shifts either through interaction with other plant species <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Rafferty et al. 2015)</ref> or through changes of their own phenology <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bartomeus et al. 2011)</ref>. Phenology can then influence dynamical network properties, such as the stability and the coexistence of species, through changes in network topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Encinas-Viso et al. 2012)</ref>. Moreover, phenology predictably affects network compartmentalization as different phenophases likely correspond to different compartments when networks are considered on an annual scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Martín González et al. 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Despite considerable theoretical advances, there are few models available to predict the probability of interaction in plant-pollinator networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Staniczenko et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cirtwill et al. 2019)</ref> and fewer still able to make comparisons between networks. Due to their complexity and variation among years <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chacoff et al. 2017)</ref>, most studies of mutualistic networks have focused on predicting and comparing classic network metrics <ref type="bibr">(nestedness, connectance, modularity, etc.)</ref> which are all influenced by network size, i.e. the number of plant and insect species <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fortuna et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Staniczenko et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Poisot &amp; Gravel 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Astegiano et al. 2015)</ref>. Moreover, few studies have compared interaction networks along environmental gradients <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Devoto et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Schleuning et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sebastián-González et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Pellissier et al. 2017)</ref>. In order to compare networks of different sizes, a better alternative is to switch from network-derived metrics to the comparison of the probability of interaction given by regression models, which can consider multiple factors and latent variables and assume that the sampled data are just part of a larger unobserved dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Grace et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Calcareous grasslands are characterized by highly diverse plant communities with a high proportion of entomophilous species <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baude et al. 2016)</ref>, thus they are a convenient model for such studies. Most plant-insect pollinator networks involve bee species (Anthophila), but recent studies have also pointed out the importance of hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae), which pollinate a large spectrum of wild flowering species <ref type="bibr">(Klecka et al. 2018a</ref>) and crops <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Jauker &amp; Wolters 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Rader et al. 2011)</ref>. They usually behave opportunistically, i.e. from being pollen generalists to specialists, only limited by morphological constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Iler et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Klecka et al. 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lucas et al. 2018)</ref>. Indeed, their generalist behaviour, at the species level, could be the result of individually specialized diets, since most pollen retrieved on hoverfly individuals usually comes from a single plant taxon <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lucas et al. 2018</ref>) and depends on flower availability and phenology <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cowgill et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Colley &amp; Luna 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lucas et al. 2018)</ref>. Moreover, some hoverflies have preferences regarding plant colour, morphology and inflorescence height <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Branquart &amp; Hemptinne 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Colley &amp; Luna 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lunau 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Klecka et al. 2018b, a)</ref>.</p><p>Here we study the consequences of environmental gradients on plant-pollinator interactions, focusing on how phenology overlap affects interactions between plants and insects in six calcareous grassland sites distributed along a latitudinal gradient. We obtained plant and insect phenologies, abundances, and interactions in all sites from April to October 2016. We modelled plant-pollinator interaction networks following a Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling approach (SEM) using latent variables, i.e. unobserved variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Grace et al. 2010)</ref>. SEM is a multivariate technique used to test several hypotheses in ecological studies. SEM analysis involves cause-effect equations to evaluate multiple causal relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Grace 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Eisenhauer et al. 2015)</ref> using observed and latent variables to explain some other observed variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Grace 2006)</ref>. SEM can be used to choose among competing models <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Grace &amp; Bollen 2008)</ref>. Thus, SEM are well suited for studying the complexity of ecological networks. To test whether phenology affects network compartmentalization, we looked for species subgroups using a latent block model (LBM) which is among the best clustering methods for weighted networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Leger et al. 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The comparison of 16 SEMs and the analysis of LBMs of sampled networks evinced that phenology overlap is an important determinant of plant-pollinator interactions, but is less informative than species abundances and performs heterogeneously among sites. Our results suggest that the use of SEMs to compare networks of different sizes along an environmental gradient is an innovative approach which can help understand the structure of plant-pollinator networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study sites</head><p>We sampled plant and hoverfly species in six areas (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>) of 1 hectare each in different French regions: two sites in Hauts-de-France (Les Larris de Grouches-Luchuel, thereafter noted LAR, 50°11'22.5"N 2°22'02.9"E and Regional natural reserve Riez de Noeux les Auxi, noted R, 50°14'51.85"N 2°12'05.56"E, in départements Pas-de-Calais and Somme), two sites in Normandie <ref type="bibr">noted CG,</ref><ref type="bibr">49°14'7.782"N 1°24'16.445"E and les Falaises d'Orival,</ref><ref type="bibr">noted FAL,</ref><ref type="bibr">49°04'40.08"N 1°33'07.</ref>254"E, départements: Eure and Seine Maritime) and two sites in Occitanie (Fourches, noted F, 43°56'07.00"N 3°30'46.1"E and Bois de Fontaret, noted BF, 43°55'17.71"N 3°30'06.06"E, départment: Gard). The six sites are included in the European NATURA 2000 network, a network of preserved areas designated to protect a number of habitats and species representative of European biodiversity. The four sites in Hauts-de-France and Normandie are managed by the Conservatoire d'espaces naturels of Normandie, Picardie and Nord -Pas-de-Calais and the sites in Occitanie by the CPIE Causses méridionaux. We sampled each site once a month from April to October 2016, except for the site of Riez that was sampled from May to October.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plant-hoverfly observations and sampling</head><p>To collect information at the community level, in each site and at each session we realized: (i) a botanic inventory of the flowering species, recorded their abundances and the total flower covering in the area and (ii) a pollinator sampling using a hand net along a variable transect walk.</p><p>Flowering plants were identified at the species level. We recorded the abundances of all flowering species. At first, we estimated the total percentage of surface covered by all flowering species in the selected area. We then estimated the relative abundance of each flowering species. We used Braun-Blanquet coefficients of abundancedominance, ranked from i to 5 (most abundant coefficient class) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(van der Maarel 1975</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(van der Maarel , 1979;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mucina et al. 2000)</ref>, to rank flowering species. We converted the coefficients to percentage intervals and then in mean values of percentage cover classes (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>): coefficient 5 = 75-100%, coeff 4 = 50-75%, coeff 3=25-50%, coeff 2 = 10-25%, coeff 1 = 1-10%, coeff + = few individuals less than &lt; 1%, coeff i = 1 individual. All inventories were realized by the same surveyors to avoid biases.</p><p>Pollinator observations were performed by the same team of 3-5 persons each day. The surveyors walked slowly around any potential attractive resource patch included in the selected 1-hectare area for 4h each day. We split the sampling period into 2 hours in the morning (about 10-12h) and 2 hours in the afternoon (about 14-16h) to cover the daily variability of both pollinator (bees and hoverflies, which are more active in the morning than in the afternoon; D'Amen et al. 2013) and flower communities. Sampling took place when we had suitable weather conditions for pollinators (following <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Westphal et al. 2008)</ref>. We sampled all flower-visiting insects and we recorded observed interactions. All sampled insects were immediately put individually in a killing vial with ethyl acetate and were later prepared and pinned in the laboratory and identified at the species level by expert taxonomists. Even if we collected both bees and hoverflies, in this study we focus on hoverflies only (since at the moment of the study bees were not identified at the species level yet). Overall, we sampled for 41 days, equivalent to about 164 hours in the field (all the surveyors collected at the same time). For all analyses described here, we only used the list of visited herbaceous plant species and hoverflies which were found visiting a plant. Despite their rarity and even if hoverflies are known to prefer open flowers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Branquart &amp; Hemptinne 2000)</ref>, we also considered the interactions between hoverflies and plant species of the Fabaceae family because we observed in the field that they visited Fabaceae species that were already opened by other insects, e.g. by large bee species, such as Eucera sp. (de Manincor, personal observation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plant -hoverfly networks</head><p>For each site, we constructed an interaction network consisting of all pairs of interacting plant and insect species, pooling data from all months. A pair of species (i,j) was connected with intensity vij when we recorded vij visits of insect species i on plant species j in the site. We calculated the network specialization index, H2' <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blüthgen et al. 2006</ref>) using the H2fun function implemented in the bipartite package <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dormann et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">R Core Team 2018)</ref>. We obtained the d-value (Kullback-Leibler divergence between the interactions of the focal species and the interactions predicted by the weight of potential partner species in the overall network) and the dmax-value (maximum d-value theoretically possible given the observed number of interactions in the network) using the dfun function in the bipartite package <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dormann et al. 2009</ref>). We did not use the d' values provided by this package as they sometimes yielded spurious results based on the computation of the minimal d value (e.g. reporting low d' for species with only one partner in the network).We then manually calculated the standardized specialization index d' <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blüthgen et al. 2006)</ref> for each plant and insect species as the ratio of the d-value to its corresponding dmaxvalue.</p><p>We calculated the modularity of the network and the associated partition of species into modules using the cluster_leading_eigen method for modularity optimization implemented in the igraph package <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Csardi &amp; Nepusz 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Newman 2006)</ref>. Modularity optimization can help identify strong, simple divisions of a network into relatively independent sub-networks by looking for highly interconnected subnetworks. However, modules are not meant to inform about more subtle groupings among the species, e.g. particular avoidance of interactions between insects of group A and plants of group 1. In order to detect such groups, we implemented latent block models (LBM) using the BM_poisson method for Poisson probability distribution implemented in the blockmodels package <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Leger et al. 2015)</ref>. Blocks are calculated separately for the two groups (insect and plant) based on the number of visits (i.e. a weighted network). The algorithm finds the best divisions of insects and plants through fitting one Poisson parameter in each block of the visit matrix, thus essentially maximizing the ICL (Integrated Completed Likelihood; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Biernacki et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Daudin et al. 2008)</ref>. The LBM script is given in Supplementary Information (Appendix S3). All analyses were performed in R version 3.3.3 (R Core Team 2018).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plant and hoverfly abundances and phenology overlap</head><p>We calculated plant abundance using information about the abundance-dominance recorded in the field following the methodology of Braun-Blanquet presented above. We transformed the coefficients of abundance in percentages (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>): we used the mean of the percentage corresponding to each class. We then calculated the relative abundance (AP) of each flowering plant species as the ratio of the focal species cumulated abundance to total flower abundance during its flowering season. For hoverflies, we used the recorded number of visiting individuals (total abundance) and their presence (recorded months) along the season to calculate their average abundance during months when they were present (AH).</p><p>We refer to plant phenology as their flowering period and insect phenology as the flying period. We considered only flowering plants which had been visited by pollinators. For the pollinators, we considered only hoverflies which were found in interaction. To build the species phenology tables for both plants and hoverflies, we merged the information provided by two sources of data (field data and the literature): we used the observed phenology of both plants and insects during the field session as the only source of information for plants (plants visited by insects and plants found in the botanic inventory in the site at that date), and we complemented the hoverfly phenology with information provided by the Syrph the Net Database <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Speight et al. 2016)</ref>. We then built the phenology overlap (PO) matrix based on the species phenology tables by calculating the number of phenologically active months that are shared by each pair of insect and plant species along the season.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling (SEM)</head><p>SEM is a confirmatory technique that involves cause-effect equations to evaluate multivariate hypotheses in ecological networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Grace 2006)</ref>. The primary interest of SEM analyses lies in its ability to compare different causal models between the same sets of explanatory and explained variables. Another important feature of SEM is that they can relate data through latent variables, i.e. variables which are not measured in the model and which represent underlying causes or effects, coupled with observed variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Grace 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Grace et al. 2010)</ref>. SEM can now be assessed using Bayesian approaches and parameters estimated using MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Grace et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fan et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In our study, we modelled hoverfly-plant interaction networks using a SEM approach (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) with latent variables linking the number of visits per plant-pollinator species pair to abundance and phenology overlap (PO) data through a first latent table representing probabilities of interactions, another latent table representing the possible interactions between plant and pollinators (as a realization of the aforementioned interaction probability matrix), and a third latent table yielding the expected number of visits per plant-pollinator species pair (i.e. the intensity of interactions). We used the term latent tables to describe latent variables organized as insect x plant tables, such as the expected number of visit matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1.</head><p>Summary diagram of the SEM model. We estimated 4 effects: the effect of plant abundance (AP  λij, coefficient λP), the effect of insect (hoverflies) abundance on the intensity of visits (AH  λij, λH), the effect of phenology overlap on the intensity of visits (PO  λij, λPO) and the effect of phenology overlap on the probability of interaction (PO  Iij, µPO). The phenology overlap (PO) is the number of phenologically active months that are shared by each pair of insect and plant species along the season. The intensity of visits (λij) and the probability of interaction are latent variables in the model. Effect-i and effect-p are random effects calculated by the model which represent the insect and plant species identities. The Iij (Possible interactions) is a binary variable and the Vij (visits observed) follow a Poisson distribution with an expected value given when the probability of interaction is predicted as "true". Rectangles represent observed variables while ovals represent unobserved influences.</p><p>In this model, we considered that PO had an effect on possible interactions (Iij) and the number of visits (λij) -a longer overlap is intuitively expected to drive a higher probability of interaction and a larger number of visits. Interaction probabilities were also assumed to depend on two random effects (plant and insect species identities, E i and E j ), to represent heterogeneity of species degrees (i.e. the number of links) in the network. We modelled the possibility of interaction Iij between insect species i and plant species j (i.e. Iij = 1 when species i and j can interact) as a Bernoulli random variable of probability µij given by: logit(𝜇 𝑖𝑗 ) = 𝜇 0 + 𝜇 𝑃𝑂 𝑃𝑂 𝑖𝑗 + 𝐸 𝑖 + 𝐸 𝑗 where logit is the usual logistic transformation (log(x/(1-x)), µ0 is the intercept of this relation, µPO is the coefficient measuring the effect of PO, and E i and E j are the random effects associated with insect species i and plant species j respectively.</p><p>The number of visits Vij was assumed to depend on plant and hoverfly abundances, as more abundant species are expected to be more often sampled (and thus more often recorded "in interaction"). Please note that we only linked abundances to the number of visits, Vij, and not to the possibility of interaction Iij, because the aim of the latter latent table is to capture "forbidden links", while detectability and sampling effects are supposed to be captured by the statistical model of the number of interactions. We integrated species abundances as predictor variables in order to assess the effect of PO on the number of visits on top of a "null model" that already includes sensible drivers of the numbers of visits, such as species abundances. Vij was modelled as a Poisson random variable to allow for sampling variability, with a conditional mean λij (the intensity of visits that can occur) given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">log (𝜆𝑖𝑗) = 𝜆 0 + 𝜆 𝐻 𝐴 𝐻,𝑖 + 𝜆 𝑃 𝐴 𝑃,𝑗 + 𝜆 𝑃𝑂 log(1 + 𝑃𝑂 𝑖𝑗 )</formula><p>where λ0 is the intercept of this relation, λH is the coefficient measuring the effect of hoverfly abundance AH, λP is that of plant abundance AP, and λPO is the coefficient of the effect of PO.</p><p>Possible interactions (Iij) and the intensity of visits (λij) are multiplied to obtain the unconditional mean number of recorded visits, i.e. Vij is then obtained as a Poisson draw of mean Iij λij .</p><p>Overall we estimated four main parameters: the effect of phenology overlap on the probability of interaction (PO  Iij, µPO), the effect of phenology overlap on the intensity of interactions (PO  λij, λPO), the effect of plant abundance on the intensity of interactions (AP  λij, coefficient λP) and the effect of insect (hoverflies) abundance on the intensity of interactions (AH  λij, λH). We used the jags function (R2jags package), which provides an interface from R to the JAGS library for Bayesian data analysis, to estimate model parameters. JAGS <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Plummer 2003</ref>) uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to generate samples from the posterior distribution of the parameters. We ran two Markov chains with 10 6 iterations per chain to check for model convergence. The code of the model is given in Supplementary Material (Appendix S1 and S2).</p></div>

The goodness-of-fit of these models were compared using the leave-one-out cross-validation criterion (LOO) calculated using the R package loo using Pareto smoothed importance sampling for regularizing importance weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Vehtari et al. 2017)</ref>. The LOO criterion is a fully Bayesian method to compare models of different complexities and to estimate prediction accuracy using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Vehtari et al. 2017)</ref>. Models can thus be ranked according to their LOO scores, with the best model being the one with the lowest LOO value. The LOO criterion is analogous to the classic Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria, which are used to compare frequentist models, but can instead be applied to Bayesian models, without suffering the instability issues of the Deviance Information Criterion which used to be the main information criterion for Bayesian models <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Vehtari et al. 2017)</ref>. To rank the models, we then calculated the ΔLOO (noted Δᵢ) as Δᵢ = LOOᵢ-LOOmin (following <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Burnham &amp; Anderson 2004)</ref>, where LOOmin is the minimum of the LOOᵢ values among the 16 models.

We used this sum to evaluate the null hypothesis (H0) that a given factor has no effect on the plant-pollinator interactions by comparing the sum of weights to null expectations, based on the fact that each tested effect is incorporated in exactly half of the tested models. The effect is considered plausible when wH &gt; 0.5, implausible otherwise, likely when wH &gt; 0.73, and unlikely when it corresponds to a value of 0.27 or lower, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Massol et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictive power analysis</head><p>We tested the predictive power of the models we built by making predictions for the Iij table and checking their validity using a binarized version of the visit table Vij. Predictions were obtained by defining a threshold on interaction probability µij: values found above the threshold were predicted as occurring interactions, values below the threshold as no interaction. The threshold probability value was found by maximizing the sum of model specificity and sensitivity. We computed accuracy statistics (sensitivity, specificity, omission rate, area under the ROC curve [AUC]) in two situations: (i) when predicting data for the site that was used to build the model (selfvalidation; e.g. predicting interaction data in the site of Riez based on the model developed for this site) and (ii) when predicting data for the other site from the same region (cross-validation; e.g. predicting data for the LAR site based on the model for the R site). We performed theses analyses using the SDMTools package in R. We only used the set of best models (LOO &lt; 4) found for each site to predict the interactions in the other site through a multimodel averaging approach. We obtained the threshold probability using optim.tresh function with option max.sensitivity+specificity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plant-hoverfly networks and phenology overlap</head><p>At the end of the field campaign we had collected 1584 hoverflies and recorded 1668 interactions between 76 hoverfly species and 115 plant species overall (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S2</ref>). The number of sampled hoverfly and plant species varied between sites and among regions. In Normandie we generally sampled a higher number of hoverflies than in the other two regions (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) and the maximum number of visits recorded in the site of FAL was 47 (between Helophilus pendulus and Scabiosa columbaria, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>) and in the site of CG was 22 (between Eristalis tenax and S. columbaria and between Sphaerophoria scripta and Leontodon hispidus, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). We observed the highest diversity of both plants and hoverflies in Occitanie and the lowest diversity of hoverflies in Hauts-de-France. Despite the high species diversity in Occitanie, the total number of interactions recorded in these sites (BF and F) is not the highest recorded in the field (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>): the maximum number of visits in the site of BF was 10 (between Spherophoria scripta and Helichrysum stoechas, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>) and 12 in the site of F (between Syrphus ribesii and Bellis perennis, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). In the two southern sites we also recorded the lowest connectance values (BF: 0.07 and F: 0.08) of all six sites, with the highest connectance observed in the site of R (R 0.16; LAR 0.13; CG 0.13; FAL 0.12). The maximum number of visits recorded in the site of LAR was 12 (between Syrphus ribesii and L. hispidus, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>) and in the site of R was 17 (between Syritta pipiens and Asperula cynanchica, Fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>).</p><p>In spite of differences in diversity and the number of interactions, the overall level of specialization (H2 index) did not show a high variation among the 6 networks (range: 0.32 -0.37). However, we found that the sites in Occitanie (BF and F) had a higher average degree of specialization (d') for both insect (BF 0.63 and F 0.57) and plant species (BF 0.58 and F 0.48). The sites in Occitanie also had a higher modularity (BF 0.51 and F 0.48) than the ones in Normandie (CG 0.34 and FAL 0.23) and Hauts-de-France (LAR 0.37 and R 0.34; Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Given that these statistics only compare 6 sites, none of these assessments can be properly statistically tested, but the importance of the differences among sites is highly suggestive of a difference in average specialization and modularity. We found that plant phenology is generally shorter in all sites than that of hoverflies (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The phenology overlap was shorter in Occitanie (BF and F) than in the other sites (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>Illustrations of the block clustering provided by the LBM analysis (Latent Block Model) are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and 3 in the main text and in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref> to S5 in Supplementary Information. We found different numbers of blocks in plants and hoverflies among sites: the BF site had 2 insect blocks and 2 plant blocks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>); the F site had 4 of both (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>); the CG and R sites had 3 blocks for the plants and 4 blocks for the insects in (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">S5</ref>); the FAL site had 4 plant blocks and 3 insect blocks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>); the LAR site had 3 blocks for the plants and 2 for the insects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>).  <ref type="bibr">(2006)</ref> and implemented in the R package bipartite <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dormann et al. 2009</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1. Summary table of results</head><p>Model ranking and comparison of parameters in each site For each site we compared the 16 models using the LOO criterion (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, ΔLOO values). We found that models 1, 2 and 4 had consistently better goodness-of-fit than the others. The model incorporating all effects except the effect of phenological overlap on the probability of interaction (Model 4: λ ij ~ AH + AP + PO, Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) was the best model in the sites of CG, FAL and LAR. In the two southern sites (BF and F), we found that the model incorporating all effects except that of phenological overlap on the intensity of visits (Model 1: <ref type="table">2</ref>), was the best one. The model incorporating all effects (Model 0: <ref type="table">2</ref>) was found as the best one only in the site of R, but was a suitable model (ΔLOO &lt;4) in all the other sites (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). We also compared the sum of model weights of the four parameters among sites (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, Effects weight). We found that the effect of insect abundance on the intensity of interaction (AH  λ ij ) is always likely (i.e. the sum of their weights is always higher than 0.73, Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) and of large effect size in all sites (standardised coefficient higher than 1, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Likewise, we found that the effect of plant abundance on the intensity of interaction (AP  λ ij ) was always likely and had large effect size in most part of sites, except in the site of F (wH = 0.59, Table <ref type="table">2</ref>; standardised coefficient = 0.67, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). The effects of phenological overlap on the probability of interaction (PO  Iij) and the intensity of visits (PO  λ ij ), however, had variable plausibility among sites. The effect of phenological overlap on the probability of interaction was likely only in half of the sites (Table <ref type="table">2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). The effect of phenological overlap on the intensity of visits was not plausible only in the two southern sites (BF and F) and plausible in the other four sites (LAR, R CG and FAL, Table <ref type="table">2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). In all sites, the standardised coefficients of PO effects were always less than 1, thus showing a low effect size of phenology on interaction probability and intensity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">λ ij ~ AH + AP / Iij ~ PO, Table</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">λ ij ~ AH + AP + PO / Iij ~ PO, Table</formula><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.

The wH limits for unlikelihood is 0.27, plausibility 0.5 and likelihood 0.73. Underlined and bold values represent the likely hypothesis only.  When assessing the predictive power of the best models, we observed that the sensitivity and specificity values, both for the self-validation and the cross-validation, were higher than 0.5 (Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>), which means that the interactions predicted by the models are better than predicted by chance. While area under the curve (AUC) values were all higher than 0.75 for self-validation, cross-validation tests yielded intermediate values (AUC between 0.62 and 0.73), reflecting the fact that abundances and phenology are certainly not sufficient to make accurate predictions on the occurrence of plant-pollinator interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Latitude affects the seasonality, with advancing species phenologies at higher latitudes, and thus, can be a limiting factor for the phenological coupling of interacting species <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Post et al. 2018)</ref>. In this study we explored the effect of phenology overlap on a large network of species interactions in calcareous grasslands and how this effect could vary along a latitudinal gradient in France using empirical data on six planthoverfly networks. We identified plants and insects at the species level to build detailed interaction networks and hence avoid spurious generalisation levels. In order to better understand the determinants of variation in species interactions in space and time, we used the latitudinal gradient to consider variations linked to environmental cues and the entire flowering period to allow for seasonal variation <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Valverde et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Pellissier et al. 2017)</ref>. One of the main problems of comparing networks along gradients is the dependence of network metrics on network size <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Staniczenko et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Astegiano et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Tylianakis &amp; Morris 2017)</ref>. In this study, to avoid the problem of comparing networks with different dimensions, we decided to focus on the determinants of the probability of interaction and the number of visits, rather than the overall structure. We employed Bayesian Structural Equation Models (SEM) which is an emergent approach increasingly used to investigate complex networks of relationship in ecological studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Grace et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Eisenhauer et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fan et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Theodorou et al. 2017)</ref>. In our study we used SEM to link the numbers of visits to phenology overlap (PO) and species abundance through latent probabilities of species interaction and expected numbers of visits per plant-pollinator species pair. We tested different models with variable numbers of effects and compared them in each site. In our models, we used species abundances to construct a sensible null model to test whether phenology overlap could help explain the probability and intensity of interactions when the effects of species abundances are already taken into account. In all sites, we found that models that included both PO and abundances had always better goodness-of-fit than models that included only abundances.</p><p>Abundances indeed provided a sensible null model since the goodness-of-fit of models that did not include abundances were always quite worse than the ones which did.</p><p>We also found that in all sites the most important factor affecting pollinator visits was insect abundance (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Likewise, we found that plant abundance was also a very important effect in most sites, except in the site of F (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Since insect abundances are given by visitation data, it is not surprising that the intensity of interactions positively depends on these abundances. Species abundance often explain the linkage level in pollination network studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Olesen et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bartomeus et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chacoff et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Pellissier et al. 2017)</ref> but it is often associated with the length of the phenology to better assess the general properties of the interaction network <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Vázquez et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Olito &amp; Fox 2015)</ref>. In accordance with this verbal prediction, we indeed found that the best models incorporated the effect of PO on either the probability or the intensity of interactions (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>), and the model that only considered species abundance (model 5 in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) was not the best one in any site. Phenology overlap generally cannot predict the probability of interaction on its own <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Encinas-Viso et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">CaraDonna et al. 2017)</ref>. Our findings do agree with this general predicament since no site favoured a model that only incorporated PO effects and because these effects always display lower effect sizes than the other variables. However, our objective was not to compare the effect of phenology overlap to that of species abundance -for such an endeavour, one would need estimates of species abundances independent of visitation data. Because models which consider the effect of PO on the intensity and/or probability of interactions are the best models for all sites, this evinces a clear effect of PO. In our model, the effect of PO on the probability of interaction and the expected number of visits also vary along the latitudinal gradient (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).In general, we observed that southern sites (BF and F) showed shorter plant phenology and phenology overlap (PO) than the other four sites (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). In these sites, plant species richness is higher and fewer visits were sampled, probably because the presence of specialist species with short phenophases may increase the number of forbidden or undetected links <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Olesen et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Martín González et al. 2012)</ref>. Conversely, in sites where plant phenology is longer, PO is longer too, as observed in Normandie and Hauts-de-France (CG, FAL, LAR and R, Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Moreover, when plant richness and specialization are lower, a higher number of visits can be observed (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) because generalist species could interact without constraints. Indeed, in Normandie and Hauts-de-France we found that the effect of phenology overlap on the intensity of visits was always likely (PO  λij, Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) and we observed higher numbers of interactions in the first two/three blocks of insects and plants which also corresponded to blocks with longer PO (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, S2, S4 and S5). A higher phenological overlap is expected to drive a higher probability of interactions and a larger number of visits <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Olesen et al. 2011)</ref>. In Occitanie, we did not find any effect of PO on the number of visits because the more densely visited blocks do not correspond to those with longer phenology overlap. Plant phenology can therefore drive the probability and the intensity of interactions in networks in which plant phenology is shorter, thus suggesting that hoverflies may undergo selection for behavioural flexibility in order to maintain synchrony with their foraging resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Iler et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ogilvie &amp; Forrest 2017)</ref>.</p><p>We also found that modularity decreased along the latitudinal gradient, with richer sites (BF and F) displaying higher modularity (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sebastián-González et al. 2015)</ref> but also the lower connectance. In the two southern sites, higher modularity could be related to shorter phenologies and higher proportions of non-overlapping sets of species, which induce some form of temporal short-term specialisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lucas et al. 2018)</ref>. However, modularity also seems to be influenced by species abundances and degrees <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Schleuning et al. 2014)</ref>, and is expected to increase with link specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Morente-López et al. 2018)</ref>. Indeed, in these sites, species blocks match species degrees (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>), with generalist and specialist species forming separate blocks among both plants and insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Martín González et al. 2012)</ref>. With lower modularity and more generalist species, we expect a stronger relationship between phenology and the intensity of interactions because interactions are less influenced by insect preferences and more by seasonal rhythm and flower availability <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dormann et al. 2017)</ref>. Thus, different phenophases might correspond to different compartments <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Martín González et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Morente-López et al. 2018)</ref>, as observed in CG, FAL, LAR and R where higher overlap corresponded to higher numbers of observed visits. Although phenology improved model fit (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>), its effect size was modest (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), which suggests that other types of data such as traits and phylogenies might help predict specific interactions. In our study, we did not consider competition among studied insect species or with other group of insects, such as bees which were present in all sites. Different types of pollinators with different abundances could have contextdependent effects on network topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Valverde et al. 2016)</ref>. Moreover, in our study we only considered as "true absence" of the interaction the lack of phenological coupling between species (i.e. plant and hoverfly species which are not present at the same moment along the season cannot interact). We did not consider "false absences", i.e. missing links, since not all the potential links among species are recorded in the field <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Olesen et al. 2011</ref>) which may introduce bias in the estimation of the probability of interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bartomeus et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cirtwill et al. 2019)</ref>.</p><p>To conclude, plant phenology here drives the duration of the phenology overlap between plant and hoverflies, which in turn influences either the probability of interaction or the expected number of visits, as well as network compartmentalization. Longer phenologies correspond to less constrained interactions (lower modularity), shorter phenologies to more constrained interactions (higher modularity), which in turn restrict the number of visits. Phenology overlap alone was not sufficient to explain interactions, as suggested elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(CaraDonna et al. 2017)</ref>. Plant and insect abundances played a substantial role to explain the number of visits (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chacoff et al. 2017</ref>) since abundances may affect partner choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Trøjelsgaard et al. 2015)</ref>. Our results, and the ability of the method used here to compare different effects on interaction patterns, suggest that the use of Bayesian SEM to compare networks of different sizes is a valuable tool which can help understand plant-pollinator networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Eisenhauer et al. 2015)</ref>. The use of latent variables can help predict the probability of interaction and the expected number of visits while avoiding circularity -the introduction of plant and insect specific random effects played the role of an implicit "degree" effect. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering differences in plant and insect phenologies to better predict their interactions in pollination networks at different latitudes. The use of morphological traits (e.g. tongue length, inter-tegular distance, …) together with species richness and phylogenies, on top of variables already used, might improve the modelling of interactions and could help better understand some forbidden or missing links in richer communities or considering other pollinators (e.g. wild bees).</p></div>

Exemple: Rscript (name) "script-SEMLOO_generique.R" "-d o-BFs-2016" "-s BFs" In order to calculate the standardised coefficients for each parameters used, at the end of the third block, we added the functions to get the parameter values for each site and each model.</p><p>####BLOCK 1 -SCRIPT OPTION #### library(optparse) option_list = list( make_option(c("-d", "--dir"), type="character", default=NULL, help="directory", metavar="character"), make_option(c("-s", "--site"), type="character", default=NULL, help="site name", metavar="character"), make_option(c("-m", "--modele"), type="character", default="all", help="modele name", metavar="character")) opt_parser = OptionParser(option_list=option_list);

Overall, we estimated 16 models that included between 0 and 4 of the above-mentioned effects. To create the code for these other models, parameters should be removed following the order in the Tab. 2. The four parameters tested in the model are: (i) alpha: effect of the phenology overlap (cooc) on the probability of interaction; (ii) epsilon: effect of the phenology overlap on the intensity of visits; (iii) gamma: effect of the insect abundances (ab_I) on the intensity of visits; and (iv) delta: effect of the plant abundances (ab_P) on the intensity of visits.  <ref
