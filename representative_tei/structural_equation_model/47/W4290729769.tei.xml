<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose</head><p>-While customer perceived augmented reality (AR) values have generally enhanced customer experience, AR value would be appreciated the most by a consumer segment that remains unexplored. Drawing from human value orientation theory and consumption value theory, this research proposes a new model analysing the effects of human value orientation (openness to change, conservation, self-transcendence, and self-enhancement) on perceived AR values (playful, social, visual appeal, usability) and subsequently the effects on customer satisfaction.</p><p>Design/methodology/approach -We employed a two-step online data collection. The first step was to identify those who had used retailers' AR applications, who were then invited to participate in the full survey in the second step. A sample of 253 AR technology users' data was analysed using partial least square and structural equation modelling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings -</head><p>The results reveal that each human value orientation is associated with its unique perceived AR values and that various perceived AR values influence customer satisfaction differently.</p><p>Originality -This study shows the pivotal role human value orientation plays in influencing customer perceived AR values and their impacts on customer satisfaction. The findings offer key implications for digital marketing segmentation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Augmented reality (AR) is defined as a "medium in which digital information is overlaid on the physical world that is in both spatial and temporal registration with the physical world, and that is interactive in time" <ref type="bibr">(Craig, 2013, p.20)</ref>. AR links virtual reality with the realworld environment, allowing customers to visualise products online and engage in "touch and feel" experiences before actual purchases <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Rauschnabel et al., 2015)</ref>. AR technology has become a new reality <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Goebert and Greenhalgh, 2020)</ref>, offering an innovative way for retailers to interact, engage with their customers and create a fun shopping experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Yim et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">McLean and Wilson, 2019)</ref>. For example, the Makeup Genius app of L'Oréal, the IKEA Place app, and Ray-Ban magic mirrors allow consumers to try different products and preview how it looks on them.</p><p>Prior research mainly investigates the impact of technology attributes on customer satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Zolkepli et al., 2020)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Sharma and Li (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">McLean et al. (2018)</ref> claim that technology attributes (e.g., convenience, interactivity, and ease of use) influence customer satisfaction with social networking technology and mobile applications of retailers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">McLean and Wilson (2019)</ref> reveal that perceived ease of use, usefulness, enjoyment, and subjective norms of technology influence customer satisfaction and usage intention of brands who adopted AR technology. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jung et al. (2015)</ref> explore the roles of AR content quality, AR system quality, and AR personalised service quality in determining customer satisfaction. While focusing on technical attributes is useful to gain insight into the effectiveness of a specific technical attribute (e.g., the vividness of AR), such research neglects that consumers with various backgrounds often use different product attributes to express similar underlying consumption values <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Tse et al., 1988)</ref>. Another stream of research examines the impacts of perceived technology value to address the concern. Some research focuses on the perceived value of general technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Goncalves et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Partala and Saari, 2015)</ref>; other studies focus on a specific type of technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(McLean and Wilson, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">McLean and Wilson (2019)</ref> reveal that AR consumption is driven by enjoyment, perceived usability, and ease of use. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kim et al. (2011)</ref> claim that when consumers purchase digital avatars, they use price utility to represent the utilitarian value, playfulness to reflect the emotional value, and social self-image expression represents a crucial social value element.</p><p>Despite the importance of perceived technological value, the aforementioned studies focus on the individual consumption value, which is specific to a product or a technology but fail to overlook the relationship/interlink between one's value orientation and individual consumption values to understand the underlying motivations/justifications for selected technological values. Understanding such a relationship is crucial because one's value orientation tends to provide a justification for individuals acquiring certain goods or services <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Schwartz, 1992)</ref>. Furthermore, each consumer may hold a combination of different values. There is no consensus within the existing literature on the relative importance of a specific technological value. Retail managers need a deep understanding of which technological values customers appreciate the most in order to deliver a compelling experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Javornik, 2016)</ref>. Matching consumer segments with their preferred AR value will help retail brand managers tailor marketing communications. Such a gap in the literature also reveals a strong managerial need to understand how AR technology can drive customer satisfaction by satisfying their value orientations. This research offers the following contributions to the literature. First, we draw on <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Schwartz's (1992)</ref> human value orientation and consumption value theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Sheth et al., 1991)</ref> to show that consumers' value orientation explains the degrees of importance of a specific AR value within a consumer segment. That is, the universal cultural value explains the motivations and provides justifications for why a consumer appreciates a particular AR technological value over others. We conceptualise universal value orientation as guiding principles, varying in their importance, in people's lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bardi and Schwartz, 2003)</ref>. Values are associated with what customers believe they ought to do, and those values can be acquired in the social interaction process <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bardi and Schwartz, 2003)</ref>. Although value orientation is an individual difference variable, it can be activated and affect subsequent behaviour (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Schwartz, 2003)</ref>. Individuals tend to make decisions consistent with their value orientations when such orientation is activated, as customer value orientation predicts one's consumption choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kim et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Second, we extend the existing literature on human value orientation which assumes that a value that sits at the opposite of the value circumplex to another will influence the same variable systematically with increasing or decreasing correlations as we move around the value circumplex <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fischer, 2013)</ref>. In other words, conservation sits at the opposite of openness to change; both values are expected to show a systematic pattern of increasing or decreasing impacts on the third variable. However, interestingly, our findings demonstrate that such a systematic pattern may not exist. The current research reveals that the seemingly conflicted value orientations do not exert opposing effects on AR values. This may extend the value orientation literature that only examines the impact of AR attributes and AR values on customer satisfaction. Second, by investigating the effects of AR values, our research provides deeper insights into the customer experience of retailers' AR applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review and theoretical background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">AR in retail marketing</head><p>Retailers have been using different advanced technologies as part of the smart retailing strategy. In particular, AR has been attracting many brands in various industries. For example, in the beauty industry, brands such as Sephora, L'Oréal, Benefit cosmetics, and Mac introduced virtual smart applications for makeup trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ameen et al., 2020)</ref>. In the fashion industry, ASOS introduced the virtual catwalk <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Nazir, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>AR technology enhances consumers' online shopping experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Pantano et al., 2017)</ref> and influences consumers' purchasing decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Spies et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Roggeveen et al., 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rauschnabel et al. (2019)</ref> propose that AR is distinguished from the other virtual reality (VR) technologies. AR describes the visual alignment of virtual content with realworld contexts. At the same time, VR completely separates the user from reality, and the user consequently only moves in an entirely virtual world. This specific feature of AR makes it more valuable in many ways from a marketing perspective because AR users do not disconnect from reality <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Craig, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alimamy and Nadeem, 2021)</ref>. Despite the importance of AR technology in the retail sector, not all customers appreciate the same AR values associated with specific AR attributes. Customers with different value orientations may put varying levels of importance on perceived AR technology values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Human value orientation theory and value orientation components</head><p>Value orientation represents one's desired goals, varying in importance, and guiding principles in people's lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bardi and Schwartz, 2003)</ref>. Values are multifaceted standards employed by consumers to evaluate and judge themselves and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Schwartz, 1992)</ref>. In contrast to personality, which reflects one's innate dispositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Olver and Mooradian, 2003)</ref>, values are subject to social influence and influence subsequent behaviour when they become salient <ref type="bibr">(Schwartz, 2010)</ref>. Consumers often behave according to the values they hold due to the high demand for consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Rokeach, 1973)</ref>, and thus such values reflect consumers' actual needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bardi and Schwartz, 2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Schwartz (1992)</ref> develops ten core values widely recognised in different cultures worldwide, including power, achievement, hedonism, stimulation, self-direction, universalism, benevolence, tradition, conformity, and security. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bardi and Schwartz (2003)</ref> further categorise all ten fundamental values into one of the four value dimensions: openness to change, conservation, self-enhancement, and selftranscendence.</p><p>Openness to change represents individuals' thoughts, actions, and emotional interests based on stimulation, self-direction, and hedonism <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Pepper et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Schwartz, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Conservation is the opposite of openness to change, including conformity, security, and tradition. Openness to change and conservation value orientations are motivationally conflicting with each other. In particular, openness to change value orientation emphasises novelty and personal autonomy, whereas individuals who hold conservation values would focus on preserving their stability, safety, and traditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Schwartz, 1992)</ref>. Furthermore, selfenhancement focuses on power, achievement, and hedonism. These individuals tend to emphasize personal accomplishment, social status, and superiority over others <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Pepper et al., 2009)</ref>. Conversely, self-transcendence reflects the essence of benevolence and universalism.</p><p>Self-transcendence-oriented individuals are expected to focus on their welfare, supporting others, and social justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Schwartz, 1992)</ref>. Similar to openness to change and conservation, self-enhancement and self-transcendence are also incompatible with each other. Selfenhancement emphasizes personal interests (e.g., achievement and power), interfering with self-transcendence values that promote benevolence and universalism.</p><p>Although the importance of technical attributes is widely recognised, those specific attributes tend to associate with similar perceived technology values. For example, McLean and Wilson (2019) identify vividness, interactivity, and novelty as the particular attributes of AR technology that positively influence ease of use, usefulness, and enjoyment. Further, <ref type="bibr">Šumak et al. (2011)</ref> suggest that consumers hold technology-specific values, influencing customer satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Turel et al. (2010)</ref> posit that the theory of consumption value represents "a means of explaining user decisions to employ a hedonic digital artefact" (p.53). Customers tend to make informed purchase decisions after evaluating multiple value dimensionsusability value, playful value, social value, and visual appeal value <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Turel et al., 2010)</ref>. The relative importance of a value component can vary from one context to another. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Turel et al. (2010)</ref> highlight the claims that the playfulness value of hedonic artefacts (e.g., ringtone adoption) is more influential than the social value in predicting positive WOM intention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Siamagka et al. (2015)</ref> also reveal that perceived usefulness is one of the most influential values in organizational applications. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Han et al. (2020)</ref> claim that both usefulness and playfulness are essential in influencing the behavioural intention of using AR technology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Consumption value theory and perceived AR value dimensions</head><p>A consumer's past experiences and interactions with products or services may shape one's perceived consumption value. Some research focuses on the perceived value of general technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Goncalves et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Partala and Saari, 2015)</ref>; other studies focus on a specific type of technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(McLean and Wilson, 2019)</ref>. To illustrate, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Liu et al. (2015)</ref> examine the effects of perceived money savings, perceived convenience, and perceived enjoyment of mobile coupon applications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">McLean and Wilson (2019)</ref> reveal that AR consumption is driven by joy, perceived usability, and ease of use. Therefore, the perceived values of AR technology differ from other technologies as a customer's overall assessment of the utility of AR technology will be based on their perception of what is received in comparison with what is given <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Turel et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Drawing on the consumption value theory and consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Turel et al. (2010)</ref>, this research focuses on the AR technology values, including visual appeal, playfulness, social, and usability.</p><p>Visual appeal represents an aesthetic response that can be an essential motivator for interactive technology consumption. In an online shopping context, web/app aesthetics may mean how different elements and attributes of AR technology are combined to yield an impression of beauty. Many online shopping activities are driven by aesthetic design <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ganesh et al., 2010)</ref>. Consumers no longer rely on websites just for information searches; they are becoming a popular place for entertaining and recreational experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ganesh et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hartman et al., 2006)</ref>. Furthermore, the aesthetic design of AR technology has been found to influence visitors' evaluation of AR-facilitated museum experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(He et al., 2018)</ref>. Thus, AR technology's aesthetic design that affects consumers' online experiences will be critical in understanding customer satisfaction with using AR technology.</p><p>Playful value is one of the key aspects of experiential value, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Mathwick et al. (2001)</ref>, and it determines the effectiveness of AR facilitated experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(He et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Playfulness often depends on enjoyment and escapism <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Turel et al., 2010)</ref>. Prior research suggests that AR technology's interactivity and vividness are associated with enjoyment experienced by the technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Yim et al., 2017)</ref>. In a similar vein, AR technology's interactivity influences the perceived ease of use and usefulness of AR technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(McLean and Wilson, 2019)</ref>. AR technology provides consumers with the enjoyment of direct trial experiences of the products without physically trying them on in a physical store <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Verhagen et al., 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Yim et al. (2012)</ref> claim that consumers reported a greater enjoyment level when they experienced 3D images than those who experienced 2D experiences. Consumers experiencing more vivid product visualisations tend to report a more positive customer experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Pantano et al., 2017)</ref>. Therefore, we posit that AR technology's playful value is one of the key determinants of customer satisfaction.</p><p>Social value refers to the "perceived utility of a digital item based on the item's ability to enhance one's social well-being" <ref type="bibr">(Kim et al., 2011, p. 229)</ref>, similar to physical products, which may be associated with significant symbolic meanings and indicate one's social groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Stathopoulou and Balabanis, 2019)</ref>. The consumption of AR technology may depend on how customers perceive themselves or wish to be viewed by others. In other words, digital consumption can enhance one's self-image and indicate group membership <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(De Valck et al., 2009)</ref>. Social values in technology consumption indicate symbolic meanings, social relationships, and consumer identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kim et al., 2011)</ref>. Furthermore, community members' use of digital technologies, such as social networking sites, could build and maintain social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kim et al., 2011)</ref>. This indicates that social values may affect consumers' experiences with AR technology. The social value of AR technology has been highlighted in earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cranmer et al., 2020)</ref>. For example, tom <ref type="bibr">Dieck et al. (2017, p. 115</ref>) state, "An AR app could allow visitors to share their scores on treasure hunts or quizzes on social media, leading to a sense of personal fulfilment and sharing their experience with friends and family". AR apps offered by different brands such as L'Oreal, Sephora, Benefit cosmetics, Mac, Ikea, and Amazon describe the visual alignment of virtual content (e.g., a product) with real-world contexts. This helps customers obtain an initial feel of what the product would look like in the real world. In many cases, customers share the images they capture using the AR apps on social media with their networks (such as friends and family), making them feel that they are perceived better by their peers even before purchasing the product.</p><p>Usability value refers to users' state of experience during their interaction with technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barnard et al., 2013)</ref>. It is a prominent motive in technology consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barnard et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lee and Coughlin, 2015)</ref>. Usability value reflects one of the key intrinsic characteristics of the system about the abilities, skills, perceptions, and attitudes of the user. Interface attributes, including limited input methods, limited screen size, and navigation difficulties, influence users' experiences <ref type="bibr">(Lee et al., 2015)</ref>. Other than the interface attributes, many other variables, such as the degree of interactivity and environment, also influence users' experience of usability value <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Coursaris et al., 2012)</ref>. In a similar vein, <ref type="bibr">Lee et al. (2015)</ref> posit that interactivity value is a key determinant of the usability of mobile phones. Retailers often implement AR technologies in their apps/websites to enhance interactivities and support consumer decision-making (Adebe Scene 7, 2020). Thus, we argue that usability value is one of the critical values associated with AR technology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Conceptual model</head><p>Drawing on human value orientation theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Schwartz, 1992)</ref> and consumption value theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Sheth et al., 1991)</ref>, we propose a theoretical model for this research (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The model depicts how customer satisfaction is influenced by perceived AR values and how the variation of human value orientation in terms of openness to change, conservation, selftranscendence, and self-enhancement influence various perceived AR values (i.e. usability value, playful value, social value, and visual appeal value). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Value orientation</head><p>Perceived AR value components <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Soyez, 2012)</ref>, and vacation choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hedlund et al., 2012)</ref>, and fashion apparel consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Sarabia-Sanchez et al., 2012)</ref>. Despite a wide range of identified perceived technology values <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kim et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Turel et al., 2010)</ref>, there is a lack of understanding of which technology value is perceived as more important than others in influencing customer satisfaction for a customer segment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Hypotheses development</head><p>The Individuals with a high degree of openness to change often enjoy novelty and exhibit a high degree of flexibility in imagination, processing, and responding to innovative stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Russ, 1993)</ref>. These individuals enjoy exploring new perspectives, knowledge, and exciting ideas. These expectations would be even more important for the AR technology experience. Prior research shows that personal innovativeness with technology affects 'one's expectations for their digital experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Yi et al., 2006)</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jackson et al. (2013)</ref> claim that innovative consumers often recognise and appreciate the usefulness of innovation. Openness to change values encourages individuals to pursue new intellectual and emotional avenues <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Schwartz, 1992)</ref>. Additionally, openness to change predicts teachers' usage of classroom technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baylor &amp; Ritchie, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Vannatta &amp; Nancy, 2004)</ref>. Teachers with high openness to change are more likely than those with low openness to change to use technology in instruction. Thus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hartman et al. (2006)</ref> suggest that openness to change values is related to innovativeness. A lack of usability can be detrimental to one's usage experience.</p><p>Consumption can be used to enhance consumers' social images because these consumptions can convey symbolic meanings <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(De Valck et al., 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kim et al. (2011)</ref> further claim that digital items help consumers enhance the "representation and articulation" of consumers' online self-image, making others in the same social group consider consumption and usage of the same digital items as symbolic products to express and improve their image. In the context of AR technology consumption, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Guttentag (2010)</ref> suggests that AR technology enhances consumers' experience of cultural heritage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Oleksy and Wnuk (2016)</ref> affirm that AR could be a useful tool for reducing ethnic bias and increasing one's openness to other cultures. Consumers who are high in the openness to change orientation often seek diverse and innovative ways of building social relationships with other group members. Furthermore, those individuals who emphasise openness to change tend to develop complex and multiple social identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Roccas and Brewer, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, we expect individuals who are high in the openness to change orientation to appreciate the social values of AR technology.</p><p>In addition, AR technology combines virtual and real objects, and such a combination will bring a rich sensory experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Steuer, 1992)</ref>. Individuals who rely on openness to change as a guiding principle may emphasize the visual appeal values of AR technology.</p><p>Prior research alludes to perceived AR values influencing customer satisfaction (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">McLean and Wilson, 2019)</ref>. In this vein, one's value orientation is expected to determine the level of importance a specific AR value is in affecting customer satisfaction with using AR technology. Based on the reasoning above, we propose the following hypotheses: Moreover, consumers who place various importance on conservation value demonstrate attitudinal differences toward innovative technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Han et al., 2009)</ref>. Individuals high on conservation values are likely to focus on preserving their stability, safety, and traditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Schwartz, 1992)</ref>. Prior research indicates that individuals who display a strong need for security and conformity put more emphasis on peer recognition and group membership <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amaldoss and Jain, 2005)</ref>. According to the dynamic group theory, one's sense of security can be achieved through group acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Schein, 1988)</ref>. This is in line with Bian and Conservation can be an individual difference variable that explains the attitudinal differences toward innovative technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Han et al., 2009)</ref>. AR technology may bring challenges to conservative consumers who may consider the technologies familiar with enough. To persuade them to use AR technology, the technology itself must be sufficiently superior to the existing ones in that it dramatically changes their ways of living <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ishii et al., 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">McLean and Wilson (2019)</ref> suggest that vividness, interactivity, and novelty are ARspecific attributes. Such technology provides its consumers with distinctive and unique experiences so that conservative consumers are expected to perceive AR as fit to be used to enrich their visual experiences. Individuals who rely on self-transcendence, which promotes benevolence and universalism as a guiding principle, tend to appreciate usability value. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Roy et al. (2001)</ref> suggest that a less cognitively demanding interface signals the vendors' willingness to establish a mutually satisfying relationship. The importance of benevolence is also evinced in the context of employer-employee relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Tian and Sanchez, 2017)</ref>. Employees often perceive leader benevolence as the extra reassurance, indicating that they will not be taken unfairly by their leader. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Flavián et al. (2006)</ref> claim that the degree of website usability perceived by the customers could also signal benevolence. Usable technology is interpreted as the desire to adjust to consumers' needs. As a result, the perceived usefulness of the AR technology can symbolise to what degree retailers care about the mutual relationship for those individuals who emphasise universalism and benevolence.</p><p>Prior research suggests that design aesthetics enhance consumers' trust in technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cyr et al., 2008)</ref>.

According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Sarker and Wells (2003)</ref>, the beauty of the website's aesthetics could be used to build consumers' trust.

Individuals who rely on benevolence as an important guiding principle in life are expected to value trust. We argue that trust in AR technology can be built through its visual appeals. In other words, visual appeals of AR technology could be used as a signal of trust. Despite the importance of visual appeals in developing trust, playful and social values could also be used as indicators of retailers' benevolence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gefen and Straub (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hwang and Kim (2007)</ref> propose that customers' the perceived enjoyment and social needs influence consumers' trust in technology.</p><p>Therefore, people with a high level of self-transcendence tend to appreciate AR technology's usability, and playful, social, and visual appeal values.

To illustrate, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Moore and Benbasat (1991)</ref> claim that playing a mobile AR game tends to be perceived to enhance their status in the social system. When consumers observe that the use of AR technology could create a positive image for others in the social groups, consumers may also attribute such a positive image to themself <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Rauschnabel et al., 2017)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Sampling and data collection</head><p>Our target population is the young UK consumers who have used retailers' AR technology and have gained insights from their AR shopping experiences. All participants were recruited from a reputed online consumer panel, Prolific Academic <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Peer et al., 2017)</ref>. To confirm respondents had used the actual AR features, we employed a two-step data collection process.</p><p>The first step was to approach general consumers to identify those who had used AR applications. First, our participants were informed that this academic research project looks at AR experiences daily as a customer. They were also informed that this survey remains strictly confidential and anonymous. As a result, 854 participants were recruited in step one, and 295 of them reported their previous usage of AR technology used by retailers. Some participants have experienced AR features from more than one retailer. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> illustrates the list of retailers where participants have experienced AR features. We then invited the 295 participants to the second step of the main survey focusing on their experiences and value perceptions. A sample of 258 completed responses was collected. Following James Gaskin's Data Screening method <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gaskin, 2016)</ref>, five observations were identified as non-engaging cases.</p><p>After the removal, 253 valid cases were used for the statistical analysis. explained less than 22 per cent of the variance of all 42 measured variables.

(2020)</ref>. Five items with loadings less than 0.6 were removed to achieve the reliability and validity of the measurement models. Five more items with loadings less than 0.7 were released to achieve the construct convergence indicated by the AVE value of over 0.50. Furthermore, two more items were removed due to cross-loading issues. As a result, nine measurement models are measured by 30 items, with a minimum of three items measuring each construct. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> displays the results of construct reliability and convergent validity, including loadings, Cronbach's alpha (CA), composite reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE). CA and CR values are all over the suggested threshold value of 0.7. Convergent validity of all constructs is satisfied as the AVE values range from 0.544 to 0.746, higher than the threshold value of 0.5. Note: Diagonal shows square roots of the AVE values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Structural model analysis</head><p>The hypothesised model was estimated using SmartPLS3 with a bootstrap re-sampling procedure using 5000 sub-samples, which were randomly generated in the analysis process <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hair et al., 2020)</ref>.

Three AR value components -usability value, playful value, and visual appeal valueare the direct predictors of customer satisfaction (H5, H6, H8). However, there is no evidence supporting the direct effect of social value on customer satisfaction (H7). Among the four value orientation variables, the significant antecedents include openness to change (-&gt; playful value: β = 0.227, t = 3.328; -&gt; visual appeal value: β = 0.144, t = 2.302), conservation (-&gt; usability value: β = 0.175, t = 2.377), self-transcendence (-&gt; visual appeal value: β = 0.178, t = 2.766), and self-enhancement (-&gt; social value: β = 0.238, t = 3.730; -&gt; usability value: β = 0.192, t = 2.791). Therefore, H1(a), H1(d), H2(c), H3(d), H4(b), H4(c), H5, H6, and H8 are supported.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hair et al., 2019)</ref>.

Thus H1(a) and H1(d) are supported. In contrast, conservation-oriented customers only emphasise the usability value of AR technology. Thus H2(c) is supported. Our findings also reveal that selftranscendence-oriented consumers only appreciate the visual appeal value of AR technology.</p><p>Whereas those who are self-enhancement-oriented appreciate both social value and usability value. Therefore, H3(d), H4(b), and H4(c) are supported. Finally, the research findings identify positive relationships between usability, playful value, visual appeal value, and customer satisfaction. Hence, H5, H6, and H8 are supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Theoretical contributions</head><p>This research contributes to the existing literature on AR technology. First, a key contribution of this research relates to the unique theoretical lens that it employs in examining customer satisfaction behavioural for AR technology. Incorporating human value orientation theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Schwartz, 1992)</ref> However, contrary to our intuitive logic, this research shows that each value orientation is associated with its distinctive AR values, indicating the importance of a unique perceived AR value for a selected consumer group or market segment. Accordingly, openness-to-changeoriented consumers tend to appreciate the playful value and the visual appeal value. This may be because individuals who adopt openness to change as a guiding principle often pursue playful consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aroean, 2012)</ref>. Their willingness to use new technologies often leads to joyful experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hur et al., 2017)</ref>. Furthermore, openness-to-change-oriented individuals focus on individuality <ref type="bibr">(Schwartz, 1994)</ref> and how products help them demonstrate their thoughts <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Pepper et al., 2009)</ref>. AR technology may allow these customers to demonstrate technical competence and explore novel ideas through joyful and rich sensory consumption.</p><p>Interestingly, conservation sits opposite the value circumplex to openness to change. The findings suggest that conservative consumers only emphasise the usability value. Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ishii et al. (2007)</ref>, conservative consumers often engage with new technologies when their functions are sufficiently superior to the existing ones.</p><p>Furthermore, our research extends <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bardi and Schwartz's (2003)</ref> human value orientation theory by challenging its assumption that the paired value orientations (e.g., selftranscendence vs self-enhancement) are motivationally conflicting. Our results show that self-enhancement positively influences usability and social value, whereas self-transcendence positively impacts the visual appeal value. Self-enhancement-oriented consumers are expected to emphasise positive self-images <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Keinan and Kivetz, 2011)</ref>. One way to achieve such positive self-images is through more proactive consumer participation with efficient information processing, resulting in a more incredible experience of usability <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Coursaris et al., 2012)</ref>. When customers observe that the aesthetic features of AR technology could be used to create a positive image for others in the social groups, customers may also attribute such a positive image to themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Rauschnabel et al., 2017)</ref>. In contrast to our intuitive thinking, individuals who are expected to focus on one's welfare, supporting others, and social justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Schwartz, 1992</ref>) put a great level of emphasis on the visual appeal value. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Li and Yeh (2010)</ref> suggest that retailers' website visual design features are among the most effective for developing trust. The visual design of websites/apps signifies trust, reflecting the key guiding principle in life that self-transcendent-oriented consumers use.</p><p>Moreover, our research advances the consumption value theory by identifying the unique AR-specific values that influence customer satisfaction in the retail sector. Such findings seem contradictory to <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rauschnabel et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kim et al. (2011)</ref>. They highlight how individuals perceive technology consumption as status consumption to improve their social standing. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Turel et al. (2010)</ref> propose visual appeal value, social value, playful value, and value for money for hedonic digital technology. Usability is important in the organisational application context <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Siamagka et al., 2015)</ref>, and playfulness is important in the usage intention of AR technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Han et al., 2020)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Practical implications</head><p>This study has several implications for retail brands and AR application developers as they improve their understanding of the critical determinants of customer satisfaction. Given that retail brands have adopted these applications to offer customers a more personalised experience and save cost, it is important to find ways to increase customer satisfaction, leading to continuous usage of these applications. Additionally, retail brand managers should be aware that not all perceived AR values will increase customer satisfaction and WOM intention. Except for social value, enjoyment, usability, and visual appeal, values seem to contribute positively to customer satisfaction for all customer groups. While acknowledging that AR app allows retailers to showcase new products, emphasising how using AR app improves the way customers look and make a good impression on other people can backfire as it may not contribute to customer satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Limitations and future research directions</head><p>This research investigates the effects of human value orientations and technology values on customer satisfaction in the retail industry. The importance of individuals' value orientation may differ across different products type <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fam et al., 2013)</ref>. Future research may replicate the research findings in other industries, such as the service industry. Furthermore, values can be prone to social influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bardi and Schwartz, 2003)</ref> and can be cognitively activated to influence behaviour (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Schwartz, 2010)</ref>. Future studies can employ the experimental method to prime one's value orientation and examine its causal effect on customer satisfaction. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Boer and Fischer (2013)</ref> examine cultural differences in value orientations. Future research may investigate whether perceived technology value varies across different cultures. For example, East Asians often emphasize interdependence and conformity. Therefore, social values may be more important to them than to Westerners. In addition, our study only focuses on customer satisfaction of AR technology users; thus, it is limited to participants who have experienced the use of AR offered by retail brands previously. Hence, our findings cannot be generalised to non-users of this technology. Future studies can collect data from non-users and compare the findings. Furthermore, similar to other studies, this study is based on self-reporting, possibly affecting the results. Finally, our research focused on the general AR applications in the retail sector. Future studies can adopt our proposed model and apply it to specific types of AR applications <ref type="bibr">(Edwards-Stewart (2016)</ref> used by various retailers and identify whether AR technology type is a moderator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>Our research shows that customer value orientation determines which AR technology value they appreciate the most and highlights the significant effects of AR technology values on customer satisfaction. The target customer segment's value orientation should be considered when retailers design and implement AR technology on their websites/apps.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Therefore, individuals who are open to new technologies may appreciate the fun and joyful experiences. Openness to change may also affect one's usability expectations. Individuals who are open to change may have a high expectation of products/services easily and effectively used.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>More importantly,<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fischer (2013)</ref> claims that prior research focuses on the effects of a single value by excluding other values can produce misleading findings.<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fischer (2013)</ref> further proposes that if the circumplex structure of value holds, "correlations between any value type and third variables should show a systematic pattern of increasing and decreasing correlations as we move around the value space (p. 237). The sinusoid pattern suggests that any correlation with the third variable, such as the playful value in our study, decreases as one value orientation moves from one end to the other end of the circumplex. "This captures the extent to which the circular structure of values is present in a sample, and third variables follow this circumplex pattern of relationships". Therefore, we expect openness to change and conservation to influence the same AR values. The following hypotheses are proposed: H2a -H2d. Conservation value orientation is related to (a) playful value, (b) social value, (c) usability value, and (d) visual appeal value associated with AR technology.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head>First</head><label></label><figDesc>, our results demonstrate that retailers aspiring to deliver a compelling customer experience of AR applications should understand the important role of value orientations in shaping one's attitudes. Retail brand managers ought to communicate the benefits of AR technology to their target consumer segments, outlining the appropriate perceived AR values.Retail managers can adjust their marketing communications to match target consumers' value orientation to deliver customised services due to the high level of congruency. Specifically, retail brand managers should tailor their marketing communication strategies to activate one's value orientation to match customers' preferred AR values to improve customer satisfaction. For example, managers can highlight the lifestyle of being creative, always looking for new things in life first, and then promote the playful value of AR technology or how AR technology enriches one's sensory experience for openness-to change-oriented and self-transcendence-oriented customers. In a similar vein, managers should emphasize the usability value by communicating the characteristics of AR technology, such as the degree of interactivity and navigation experience to conservative and self-enhancement-oriented customers.To understand the consumer segment's value orientation, we recommend retailers conduct short surveys that identify their target consumers' value orientation and highlight the appropriate AR technology value they appreciate the most in their communications to those target consumers. Furthermore, another way to understand one's value orientation is to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to complement retailers' AR technologies when delivering a compelling customer experience. Retail brand managers can rely on artificial intelligence and machine learning to"guess" a customer's value orientation based on the language used by the customer in their messages with the brand. For example, computers can be programmed to highlight relevant AR values to the different customer "value orientations" to improve customer experience. Retail brands should emphasise the playful feature of their brands to customers who relish openness-to-change values. In contrast, conservation-oriented customers also appreciate the usability value of AR technology used by retailers. Furthermore, self-enhancement and self-transcendence values can provide a promising segmentation.Therefore, retail managers should promote the visual appeal value to self-transcendenceoriented customers and emphasise the social value of AR technology to self-enhancementoriented customers. Stressing the importance of benevolence (e.g., helpfulness, honesty, and loyalty) and achievement values (e.g., competence, ambition, and individual accomplishment) in using AR applications may positively influence customer satisfaction.</figDesc></figure>

While it is important to understand the impacts of perceived technology values, examining how individual value orientations influence the degree of importance of a specific perceived AR value is also crucial. Therefore, building on earlier research in AR technology experiences, we propose a new model that includes human value orientations, perceived technology values, and customer satisfaction. While extant literature on value orientations compares openness to change with conservation or compares selfenhancement with self-transcendence (McLean and Wilson, 2019; Stathopoulou and Balabanis, 2019), and Fischer (2013) further claims that "correlations between any value type and third variables should show a systematic pattern of increasing and decreasing correlations as we move around the value space (p. 237). A logical extension would allow us to assume that the same value orientations would affect the same perceived AR technology value.</figDesc><table /></figure>
