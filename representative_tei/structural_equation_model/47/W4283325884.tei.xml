<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical implications-</head><p>The author provides some direction to the managers engaged in the humanitarian supply chain, contemplating using emerging technologies to enhance information visibility and collaboration.</p><p>Original/value-The current study offers some useful implications for theory. The study findings suggest that the digital technologies under the moderating effect of the crisis leadership significantly improve the information visibility and the collaboration among the emergency supply chain relief workers. These findings contribute to the contingent-resource-based view (C-RBV) literature by expanding the scope of the theory. To date, the C-RBV is yet to be explored in humanitarian or emergency settings. Further, the study empirically tests the moderating role of crisis leadership which is touted to be the game-changer, particularly in crises or emergencies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Digital transformation has changed the ways disaster relief efforts were carried out in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dubey et al. 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dubey et al. , 2021;;</ref><ref type="bibr">AlHinai, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Queiroz et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fosso Wamba, 2021)</ref>, but there is a limited conceptual study that how the organizations leverage these digital technologies in the highly chaotic environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Khan et al. 2018)</ref>. In this study, the author argues digital technologies (DT) based on <ref type="bibr">Warner and Wager (2019, p. 328)</ref>, "as a combination of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies". <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Prasanna and Haavisto (2018)</ref> argue that in an extremely chaotic environment, the collaboration among emergency relief supply chain workers holds a great promise in terms of resolving issues that may hinder emergency supply chain workers' ability to respond efficiently and effectively to tackle the crises. In the past due to the lack of information visibility, disaster relief efforts have often failed <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Yates and Paquette, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Fosso Wamba et al. 2019</ref>). There exist a rich body of literature on the positive influence of information visibility on supply chain performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Wang and Wei, 2007)</ref>. The role of information visibility and supply chain flexibility has played a significant role in technology-mediated integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Wang and Wei, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Williams et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ganesh and Kalpana, 2022)</ref>. However, research focusing on the criticality of information visibility for supporting collaborative task performance in highly fragile environments, such as disasters caused by pandemics, floods, earthquakes, and geopolitical crises is scant <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fosso Wamba et al. 2021)</ref>. Hence, the author argues that the organizations dealing with the emergency relief supply chains are still not clear about the relationship between digital technologies, information visibility, and collaboration. The collaboration among the emergency relief workers is often hindered due to differences in power, financial reasons, conflicting goals, or poor alignment in terms of the use of IT <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dubey et al. 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dubey et al. , 2021))</ref>. The author notes this as a clear research gap in the literature. To address this research gap, the author posited the first research question (RQ1):</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What are the distinct and combined effects of digital technologies on information visibility and collaboration?</head><p>Despite increasing awareness of digital technologies, emergency relief agencies remain skeptical about the potential application. <ref type="bibr">Schaedler et al. (2021, p. 1)</ref> argue, "Of all actors involved in managing an organizational crisis, strategic leaders play a particularly central role". <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Tourish (2020)</ref> further argues the role of leadership during the COVID-19 is a point of differentiation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Salem et al. (2019)</ref> found in one of the studies, that the intergroup leadership role during disaster relief operations plays a significant role in tackling complexity resulting from the hastily formed groups often belonging to different cultures and speaking different languages, and practicing different religions.</p><p>Organizational researchers have recognized the activities of the leaders or top executives in shaping organizational strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hambrick and Mason, 1984)</ref>. Hence, the role of leaders is especially critical in terms of resource allocations and deployment decisions that are necessary for organizational change <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dubey et al. 2021)</ref>. The author argues that the leadership perspective offers illuminating insights into operations and supply chain management literature, where resource allocations and deployment decisions may create different outcomes in dynamic and uncertain environments (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dubey et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Salem et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dubey et al. 2021)</ref>. During a time of crisis, the common citizen is in a state of confusion and helplessness due to the chaotic environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Deitchman, 2013)</ref>. With time the severity of the crisis often increases due to a lack of information visibility <ref type="bibr">(Littlefield and Quennette, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">James et al. 2011)</ref>. Those who are accountable and vested with authority are responsible for mobilizing the resources necessary to support the disaster relief efforts. As the event progresses through various stages, those in the authority must demonstrate crisis leadership to restore the normalcy and reduce the panic among the common citizens <ref type="bibr">(Littlefield and Quennette, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">James et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Mutch, 2015)</ref>. Crisis leadership includes the following traits, " initiating a crisis response; mitigating the harm; serving as a spokesperson; expressing sympathy to victims; framing meaning; remaining accessible and open; facilitating the flow of information; acting decisively; coordinating actions among the various response groups and agencies; reconnecting with stakeholders; maintaining decision vigilance; prioritizing activities and resources; communicating core values; paying symbolic attention to the crisis; maintaining appropriate flexibility, and facilitating renewal via public commitments", <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Littlefield and</ref><ref type="bibr">Quennette, 2007, p.30, c.f. Seeger et al. 2003, p. 250)</ref>. Hence, the author suggests that in the context of the emergency supply chain, "crisis leadership theory" may offer useful insights to explain collaboration among members in the emergency supply chain. As a result, the role of crisis leadership in the use of DT for enhancing information visibility and collaboration among emergency supply chain workers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Liang et al. (2007)</ref>  To address these two research questions, the author has grounded the theoretical model in the contingent-resource-based view (C-RBV) (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003)</ref>. Although the RBV has been used to explain the competitive advantage of the firm relying on strategic resources, the RBV has been often criticized by scholars citing insensitivity towards context <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Ling-yee, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Eckstein et al. 2015)</ref>. The management scholars argue that the RBV does not explain why resources under different contexts generate different values. The contingency theory (CT) is one of the most useful perspectives to understand how internal and external conditions may influence the outcome variable. Hence, CT provides direction to the organizations to adapt to specific environmental conditions in which they exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Sousa and Voss, 2008)</ref>. To further test the research hypotheses drawn based on the C-RBV, the author gathered data from 117 NGOs in India who were involved in relief activities during the COVID-19 crisis. The authors tested the data using the variance-based structural equation modeling commercial software (Warp PLS 7.0).</p><p>The author has further organized the manuscript as follows. In section 2, the author provides the groundwork for building a theoretical framework, which seeks to explain how DT improves the information visibility and the collaboration among the emergency relief workers, under the moderating effect of intergroup leadership. Section 3 discusses our hypo-deductive research strategy, including the sampling design and data collection strategy, which resulted in data from completed questionnaires from 356 individuals working in 117 NGOs in India. The author also reports the results of non-response bias testing. In section 4 the author presents the data analyses, using PLS-SEM. Next, in section 5, the author presents a discussion of results, focusing on the implications to theory and practice. About theory development, the author describes three main contributions of the study. The author finishes section 5 with a discussion of the study limitations and some thoughts on future research directions for further work in this area. Finally, in section 6, the author concludes, finishing by stressing how the study provides an enhanced understanding of relationships between critical elements in emergency supply chains which can contribute to better management of emergency relief supply chains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical Development and Hypotheses Formulation</head><p>In this study, the author underpins the theoretical model in the contingent resource-based view (C-RBV). Based on the arguments of <ref type="bibr">Aragon-Correa and Sharma (2003)</ref>, the C-RBV is a combination of two popular theories: RBV <ref type="bibr">(Barney,</ref><ref type="bibr">191)</ref> and contingency theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Donaldson, 2001)</ref>. Despite its immense popularity among some sections of the operations and supply chain management community <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hitt et al. 2016)</ref>, the central criticism of the RBV is that it never looked beyond the properties of the resources and the resource markets to explain the firm heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Oliver, 1997)</ref>. The RBV often fails to explain the differential outcomes yielded through the bundling of the resources and capabilities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Ling-yee (2007)</ref> term this phenomenon as a context insensitivity. Context insensitivity suggests that the RBV fails to provide a better explanation or identify the conditions in which resources or capabilities may be most valuable <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brandon-Jones et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Sedera et al. 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Eckstein et al. (2015)</ref> argue that the contingency theory offers an alternative theoretical lens to examine the contingent conditions under which resources and capabilities can generate better value. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Donaldson (2001)</ref> uses contingency theory to explain how organizations must adapt depending on the environmental conditions in which they operate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Sousa and Voss (2008)</ref> discuss how contingency factors, including national context and culture, firm size, strategic context, and other organizational variables, have been analyzed in operations and supply chain literature. The factor of crisis leadership has been identified as a key contingent factor. Whilst some scholars have integrated contingency theory and RBV to address the limitations of the static nature of the RBV (see, <ref type="bibr">Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003)</ref>, it is well recognized within the operations and supply chain literature that contingent perspectives of RBV in the context to crisis management are still underdeveloped (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Ruel et al. 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Theoretical Model</head><p>The theoretical model is underpinned by two theories: resource-based theory and contingency theory, with specific use of crisis leadership in respect of the latter of the two elements (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). In this study, the author uses a resource-based perspective to explain how DT improves information visibility and collaboration among emergency supply chain workers. The visibility of information is recognized as a critical factor that supports collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Caldwell et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dubey et al. 2018)</ref>. Contingency theory explains how contingent factors like crisis leadership help to enhance the effects of DT on information visibility and collaboration. Following the preceding arguments, the author develops the theoretical model, which explains the effective and efficient </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Impact of digital technologies on Information Visibility/Collaboration</head><p>As is well established, information technology has a significant role to play in improving supply chain visibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Wang and Wei, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bawack et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Herold et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ju et al. 2021)</ref>, and further help enhances collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Lee et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cai et al. 2016)</ref>. The sharing of vision, information, and resources is considered pivotal for effective and efficient disaster relief efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Altay and Labonte, 2014)</ref>. The collaboration among the emergency supply chain workers is significantly important which determines the success or failure of disaster relief efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balcik et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Moshtari, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dubey et al. 2019</ref>). In the emergency relief supply chain, information visibility among disaster relief workers is often considered critical for better collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dubey et al. 2018)</ref>. DT is fundamentally transforming the organizational strategies, the organizational capabilities, and the interfirm relationships <ref type="bibr">(Warner and Wager, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Khan et al. 2021</ref>). Thus, the author argues that DT and information visibility are complementary, in the sense that each demand and supports the other <ref type="bibr">(Hitt, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Srinivasan and Swink, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Golan et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gligor et al. 2022</ref>). Hence, we can expect organizations involved in humanitarian activities, such as disaster relief, to understand the connections between DT, information visibility, and collaboration. The author hypothesizes these connections as:</p><p>H1: DT has a positive effect on information visibility.</p><p>H2: DT has a positive effect on collaboration.</p><p>H3: IV has a positive effect on collaboration</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The Moderating Role of Crisis Leadership</head><p>In recent times the entire globe has seen a significant rise in the different forms of crises. These crises have a severe impact on the economy and organizations and thus require different kinds of leadership skills to tackle such situations that can satisfy the expectations of the various stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Wu et al. 2021)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Liden and Antonakis (2009)</ref> argue that the situations often shape the leadership traits and define the approach of the leaders to tackle such crises. Thus, to explain the role of leaders during the crises such as pandemics resulting from the COVID-19 mandate the crisis leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Wu et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bastardoz et al. 2022)</ref>. The growing body of rich literature on the impact of crisis leaders on tackling such situations is "…characterized by a high degree of fragmentation, considerably hindering the generation of parsimonious theory and practically useful insights" <ref type="bibr">(Schaedler et al. 2021, p. 1)</ref>. The positive beliefs of the leaders about the usefulness of the DT during crises result in certain managerial actions that help the organizations to assimilate the DT as an integral component of their organizational design <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Boin and Lodge, 2021)</ref>. Based on crisis leadership theory <ref type="bibr">(Littlefield and Quennette, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Wu et al. 2021)</ref>, the author argues that managing emergency supply chain leaders need to recognize and respect each worker's identity and must be open to innovative ideas and ways to tackle the situations favorably. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dubey et al. (2021)</ref> argue that to improve technologymediated collaboration among disaster relief actors from diverse backgrounds, the role of leadership is highly critical, especially in the adoption of DT and creating awareness among the humanitarian relief workers. The leaders publicly championing the new emerging technologies or systems lends legitimacy to the adoption of the DT and the changes imposed by the managers in the work routines. Following crisis leadership theory (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Wu et al. 2021</ref>) the author argues that leaders cultivate unique and beneficial traits via team meetings, personal conversations, or afterwork occasions, which build special bonds amongst diverse groups engaged in emergency relief operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Stern, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sadiq et al. 2020</ref>). These traits often help leaders to resolve conflicts that are a result of a lack of visibility or transparency. In this way, we view crisis leadership plays an important role in the successful adoption of digital technologies to tackle the crises through visibility and collaboration among the emergency supply chain workers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Survey Instrument Development</head><p>In this study, the author has adopted two stages to develop the questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Eckstein et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dubey et al. 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dubey et al. , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr">Dubey et al. , 2021b</ref>) (see Appendix B). Firstly, the author undertook an extensive review of the literature published in operations management, information management, and organizational research. Existing literature was used to define the constructs and the initial list of items used for measuring each construct. Secondly, the author adapted the constructs and their associated items in the context of emergency relief settings (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dubey et al. 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dubey et al. , 2021))</ref>. The items were measured on a five-point Likert scale, with anchors ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5).</p><p>This scale assures high statistical variability amongst responses gathered using our structured survey-based instrument (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Salem et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dubey et al. 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dubey et al. , 2021) )</ref> (see Appendix B).</p><p>The author undertook two steps to pre-test our instrument, to ensure that respondents would not face any difficulties in understanding the items when completing the survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Boyer and Pagell, 2000)</ref>. Firstly, the author invited 9 experts in the field of the emergency supply chain to read the first draft of the questionnaire and provide their input related to the ambiguity, clarity, and suitability of the measuring items <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(DeVellis, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dubey et al. 2021)</ref>. Next, the author further analyzed the feedback of these researchers to understand whether the questions apply to emergency relief supply chain settings.</p><p>After refining the questionnaire based on input provided by the researchers, the author sent the questionnaire to the 33 managers from the NGOs who had extensive experience in managing supply chains of healthcare items and who had an in-depth understanding of the subject matter.</p><p>The author requested these managers to provide their suggestions on the structure, readability, ambiguity, and completeness of the questions asked in the survey. After incorporating their inputs, the author has finalized the questionnaire for the data collection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Data Collection</head><p>The author gathered the data between 27 September 2021-15 February 2022. The data were gathered from NGOs in India. The author e-mailed the questionnaires to nearly 1200 potential respondents from 365 organizations and followed up with two e-mail reminders. For this purpose, the author recruited four graduate assistants who are well familiar with the local conditions. Before data collection, the author has organized two weeks of training to understand the importance of data collection and how to politely follow up with each organization to return the responses collected from multiple respondents from each organization. The author assured the respondents that the data are collected purely for academic study and that the author will maintain anonymity.</p><p>After careful examination of each response, the author eliminated cases that failed to meet the selection criteria. This usable response from 117 organizations (see Appendix A), an effective rate of 32.05 %, with at least three participants from each organization (a total of 356 multiple responses).</p><p>Although the data collection took place at one point, the author understands that the respondents may have some cognitive biases which may influence the findings of the study. The author performed wave analysis based on the guidance offered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Armstrong and Overton (1977)</ref>. The author performed a t-test on data split into two parts: early wave and late wave. The results show no significant difference between early-wave and late-wave groups of respondents (p=0.37). Thus, the author concludes that non-response bias is not a concern in the current study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data Analysis and Results</head><p>The author performed statistical analyses on data using the PLS-SEM technique to test the theoretical model and research hypotheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Peng and Lai, 2012)</ref>. In this study, the author has used Warp PLS 7.0 to address criticisms of traditional PLS-SEM methods due to them being compositebased, not factor-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kock, 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Multiple Rater Agreement Measures</head><p>The author has gathered data using a multi-informant questionnaire as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ketokivi and Schroeder, 2004)</ref>. Further to assess the reliability and the agreement among the responses gathered from the multiple respondents, the author performed four different methods as suggested in existing literature (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Boyer and Verma, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ketokivi and Schroeder, 2004)</ref>.</p><p> The percentage method <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Boyer and Verma, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ketokivi and Schroeder, 2004)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0"></formula><p>The ratio method <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Boyer and Verma, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ketokivi and Schroeder, 2004)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1"></formula><p>The inter-class correlation coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Boyer and Verma, 2000)</ref>  The paired t-test <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Boyer and Verma, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ketokivi and Schroeder, 2004)</ref> The results suggest that the inter-agreement among the respondents is within the acceptable range (see, Appendix C)</p></div>

Despite, following the strict measures before the data collection (see, MacKenzie and Podsakoff, 2012), still the author believes that the common method bias is likely to contaminate the results. Hence, the author performs some statistical analyses to assure that the CMB is not a major concern in the current study (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Srinivasan and Swink, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dubey et al. 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dubey et al. , 2021))</ref>. The author examined CMB via the correlation marker technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Lindell and Whitney, 2001)</ref>. For this, the author adopted an unrelated variable to partial out correlations caused by CMB. Additionally, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Lindell and Whitney (2001)</ref>, the author assessed the significant values of correlations. The author observed minimal differences between the adjusted and unadjusted correlations. Therefore, based on these statistical results, the author concludes that the CMB does not pose a serious concern in the present study.</p><p>To further assess the causality, which is considered one of the most important statistical tests before testing research hypotheses (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Guide and Ketokivi, 2015)</ref> the author reported the NLBCDR (nonlinear bivariate causality direction ratio), test result <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Kock, 2017)</ref>. The NLBCDR measures the extent to which bivariate nonlinear coefficients of association provide support for the hypothesized directions of the causal links in the proposed theoretical model <ref type="bibr">(Kock, 2012, p.52-53)</ref>. The threshold value should be ≥ 0.7.</p><p>In the current study, the NLBCDR=0.98 (approx..) is greater than the threshold value. The result suggests that causality is not an issue in the current study. The author further provides the values for model fit and quality indices supporting this conclusion in Appendix D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Measurement Model Reliability and Validity</head><p>In this study, the author adopted two steps to theoretically validate the model (see Figure1)</p><p>following suggestions of the organizational scholars (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Peng and Lai, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Moshtari, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Salem et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kock, 2019)</ref>. Firstly, the author examined the individual factor loadings (λi), scale composite reliability (SCR), and average variance extracted (AVE) of measuring items and the constructs following <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fornell and Larcker's (1981)</ref> recommendations. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> shows the result of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The recommended threshold values are:</p><p> factor loadings of each item ≥ 0.5;</p><p> scale composite reliability (SCR) of each construct is ≥0.7.</p><p> average variance extracted (AVE) of each construct is ≥0.5, Secondly, the author analyzed the discriminant validity of the constructs (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The author further examined the rotated factor loadings matrix, which indicates that no item loads higher on another construct than it does on its associated construct i.e., the parsimonious structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dubey et al. 2019</ref>) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>). Hence, the author concludes that the reflective measures demonstrate acceptable levels of divergent validity. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref>, the author further assessed the entries of the leading diagonal matrix (see Table <ref type="table">4</ref>), with the inter-correlation values in the given rows and columns. The square root values of each entry of the leading diagonal, i.e., square root of AVE of construct, are greater than the inter-correlation values in each row and column in the matrix. Hence, the author concludes, that constructs possess sufficient divergent validity. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Hypotheses Testing</head><p>The hypotheses were tested using the PLS-SEM <ref type="bibr">(Peng and Lai, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kock, 2019)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">5</ref> provides the results of the PLS-SEM analysis using the Warp PLS 7.0. The hypotheses H1-H3 examine the linkage between DT, information visibility, and collaboration. Firstly, the author found support for H1 (DT→IV) (β=0.81; p&lt;0.01). Next, the author found the support for H2 (DT→CO) (β=0.43; p&lt;0.01), which is consistent with previous findings in the context of big data analytics <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dubey et al. 2019)</ref>. Addressing, H3 (IV→CO), the author found support (β=0.52; p&lt;0.01), which is consistent with previous studies (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dubey et al. 2018)</ref>. Overall, the results of H1-H3 reveal that the various relationships identified in other contexts hold in the emergency relief supply chain.</p><p>The author further tested the moderation effect of crisis leadership on the paths joining DT and IV/CO (H4a/b). The author found support for H4a (β=0.16; p&lt;0.05) and H4b (β=0.45; p&lt;0.01).</p><p>The findings extend the <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Salem et al.

To further examine the explanatory power of our theoretical model (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) the author analyzed the explanatory power (R²) of the endogenous constructs as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The R² of IV is 0.73 (approx.) and CO is 0.84 (approx.).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussions</head><p>The results offer some interesting insights which broaden our understanding related to the application of digital technologies in emergency relief operations. The role of digital technologies in a commercial application is well established. However, the empirical results focusing on the application of digital technologies in improving collaboration among the various stakeholders in response to the unpredictable events having serious implications on the lives of the people are limited. Collectively, these findings as reported in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> have implications for practice as well as raise some new queries that remain unresolved in the current study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Implications to Theory</head><p>In this study, the authors present two main implications for theory. Firstly, the findings of the study help understand how the C-RBV can be a useful way to understand how resources can help improve the collaboration under the moderating influence of the crisis leadership. Although, in this study, the author is seeking to explain collaboration among the emergency relief supply chain workers. The goal of the efforts is to save the lives of the people and reduce the suffering of the victims. The RBV traditionally has its root in strategic management literature which often seeks to gain a competitive advantage over their rival firms through the exploitation of the resources that satisfy four characteristics: valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutability. Hence, in the context of humanitarian settings, the assumptions may not hold. However, saving the lives of the people and alleviating their suffering may have a significant impact on the economy of the nation and organization. Thus, our efforts to examine the interplay between digital technologies, information visibility and collaboration under the moderating influence of the crisis leadership help expand the scope of the theory which suggests that despite the limitations of the RBV, the C-RBV can be a useful way to explain non-profit making activities. This further extends the Aragon-Correa and Sharma (2003) arguments to include humanitarian settings.</p><p>Secondly, the technology-enabled collaboration is one of the research gaps which was not adequately addressed in the previous studies. Although in the past scholars have attempted to examine the collaboration among the disaster relief actors using a relational view. The relational view <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Dyer and Singh, 1998)</ref> helps understand how relationship management can help firms to gain a competitive advantage. However, explaining collaboration among the emergency supply chain actors which are often assembled in the shortest time with no previous experience in a similar field with no or limited training is quite complex and requires a multifaceted approach. In the past scholars have made some efforts to explain the collaboration (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Moshtari, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dubey et al. 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dubey et al. , 2021))</ref>, but still, the previous studies have failed to address "who" and "how" the collaboration in the humanitarian settings can be built. In the previous studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Moshtari (2016)</ref> explained the collaboration among the humanitarian actors using the trust and commitment theory.</p><p>Further, in the same study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Moshtari (2016)</ref> identified relational constructs such as compatibility, resource complementarity, and relationship management capability which are essential for building trust and commitment. However, in this study, the author seeks to explain collaboration using digital technologies. Moreover, the study further identifies the role of crisis leadership which plays a significant role in enhancing the effects of digital technologies on information visibility and collaboration. In a way, the study contributes to collaboration theory in humanitarian settings and further identifies how crisis leadership plays an integral role in building collaboration in times of crisis.</p><p>Thirdly the findings of the study distinctly contribute to the leadership traits. The role of leadership in managing disaster relief operations has attracted significant attention from the humanitarian scholars, however, to date the empirical study focusing on the traits of the leader tackling humanitarian crises are relatively less studied. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Salem et al. (2019)</ref>, contribute to the pending research calls by examining the role of intergroup leadership in humanitarian relief efforts. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Deitchman (2013)</ref>   <ref type="bibr">et al. 2019)</ref>, however, in this context, the author posits that the humanitarian supply chain or disaster relief supply chain and emergency supply chain both stems from crises. However, the humanitarian supply chain/ disaster relief supply chain includes pre-and post-disaster activities.</p><p>However, the emergency supply chain is purely in response to the crises that immediately occur.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Implications to Practice</head><p>The findings of the study offer some very useful implications for the managers, who still have some doubts related to the usefulness of digital technologies in the emergency relief supply chain. It is well established that in the past most disaster relief efforts, failed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Altay and Labonte, 2014)</ref>. The main reasons for such failures have been attributed to a single cause (i.e., poor coordination/ poor collaboration). Many factors hinder the successful collaboration among the disaster relief actors.</p><p>Some of these factors are lack of role clarity in the actors, lack of adequate resources to tackle the crisis, and a variety of the actors involved having different backgrounds and beliefs. However, some of these challenges can be easily taken care of with the use of digital technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balcik et al. 2010</ref>). The study findings further confirm the <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Balcik et al. (2010)</ref> arguments that the digital transformation which relies on the potential application of the digital technologies which include mobile, artificial intelligence, drone technology, data analytics tool, blockchain technology, cloud computing, and internet of things (IoT) to enable major improvement through creating more visibility in the entire chain and increasing accountability of the managers. However, to achieve desired success the role of leaders who can respond to crises play a significant role in achieving the desired success. In simple words, the author argues that in absence of the right leaders the potential benefits of the digital technologies remain limited and the return on the investment in the digital technologies may be low or insignificant. For instance, during a health crisis such as pandemics resulting from the COVID-19, the leaders require different skills such as competence in public health crises; ability to handle media; exposure to different technologies, and a thorough understanding of the positive and negative sides of the social media; ability to coordinate diverse relief workers and the stakeholders; excellent communication skills; and the ability to build trust and motivate team members.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Limitations and Further Research Directions</head><p>Humanitarian organizations are increasingly using digital technologies to improve information visibility and collaboration among the actors engaged in disaster relief operations. The media, common citizens, opposition parties, and international bodies are becoming less tolerant of the inefficiencies resulting during disaster relief operations, and, therefore, demanding more visibility, accountability, and better coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Salem et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dubey et al. 2021)</ref>. The study provides a nuanced understanding of technology-enabled collaboration and the role of crisis leadership in tackling complex situations resulting from crises. However, despite significant efforts to use established organizational theories and test the research hypotheses using multi-informant data gathered from NGOs engaged in the emergency relief supply chain, the author still finds some questions that remain unanswered.</p><p>Firstly, the author has focused on the application of digital technologies and information visibility, to enhance the collaboration among the actors involved in disaster relief operations. Hence future studies can explore how other organizational factors may enhance collaboration in the digital era.</p><p>Additionally, the current study has not considered other potentially significant variables, such as culture or the attitude of those involved in humanitarian activities towards the usage of technologies.</p><p>Secondly, the author gathered cross-sectional data to test the research hypotheses. It is well established that the cross-sectional data has its inherent weaknesses that cannot be repaired. Hence, to tackle such studies the future study may consider the longitudinal data or can undertake a multilevel study.</p><p>Thirdly the study is grounded in the positivism philosophy. However, the hypotheses-driven research often limits the scope of the study. Hence, to address this major weakness of the current study, the author suggests adopting a multi-method approach as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Boyer and Swink (2008)</ref>. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Flynn et al. (1990)</ref> notable contribution toward empirical research in operations management, the survey-based research has gained significant attention. The author appreciates the use of survey-based research to tackle the research questions, which is quite appropriate to a large extent provided that the researchers follow the rigorous methodological protocol offered by scholars (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Flynn et al. 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ketokovi and Schroeder, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Guide and Ketokivi, 2015)</ref>. The survey-based research is particularly very useful when the researcher is trying to deal with the behavioral constructs which only can be measured through perceptual scales. However, despite significant benefits realized using the perceptual scales, one cannot deny that the advantage comes at the cost of high measurement errors stemming from the biases of the respondents. Although empirical scholars have suggested several preventive measures and controls despite all such efforts, the potential effects of the biases cannot be repaired. Thus, to tackle some of these inherent defects of the survey-based research, future studies must embrace the multi-methods approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, the findings of the study are based on the survey-based data gathered from Indian NGOs involved in disaster relief operations during the COVID-19 crisis. Digital technology has come a long way in the last few years. Digital technologies have not only played a significant role in shaping business strategies during the COVID-19 crisis but have played a significant role in alleviating human suffering. However, despite enormous potential, the potential of digital technologies in most cases remains unexplored. There could be many reasons, however, in this study, the author found that crisis leadership plays a significant role in enhancing the effects of digital technologies on improving information visibility and collaboration. The study unfolds some complex issues that often hinder the collaboration among the diverse actors engaged in the emergency supply chains. However, despite some interesting findings, the study does not provide much clarity on crisis leadership which is one of the main contributions of the study. However, this further opens new avenues for the study. Visibility (IV) (adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wang and Wei, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dubey et al. 2018)</ref> </p></div>

The author has designed the questionnaire to gather responses from the multi-respondents from the same organization to understand how the NGOs adopted various kinds of digital technologies to have clear visibility and improve collaboration among the emergency supply chain relief workers to tackle the acute shortages of the critical items. The target respondents were project directors, deputy directors, and managers from NGOs, as they are the people who were involved during the relief operations.

The emergency supply chain stems from the crises and in most cases due to a lack of adequate resources and leadership, the emergency supply chain initiative fails.
