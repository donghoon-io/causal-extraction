<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This research investigates whether interactivity of home voice assistants can reduce the consumer's perceptions of intrusiveness when using these products because of their autonomy. To do so, the authors applied structural equation modeling to 607 questionnaires. The results show that autonomy has a quadratic effect on intrusiveness and usefulness, being more intense for high levels of autonomy. Interactivity reduces intrusiveness both directly and indirectly through brand trust, and interactivity has a positive effect on usefulness. Furthermore, interactivity moderates the effect of autonomy on intrusiveness. These results lead to interesting managerial implications, such as the inclusion of interactive characteristics in smart products to enable consumers to control and communicate with them.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The use of the Internet of things in household products is becoming more common. According to a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Accenture (2019)</ref>, smart speakers are one of the fastest-adopted technologies in US history, and 93% of consumers globally expect their home device purchases, such as smart TVs or computers, to be based on ease of integration with their standalone smart speaker. Millions of smart speakers, such as Alexa, Siri, Google Home, or Cortana, have been sold, and worldwide spending on these devices is expected to reach $2 billion by 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gartner, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>These speakers are autonomous: They are able to interact with users and other devices freely and independently <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hoffman &amp; Novak, 2015)</ref>. This characteristic can explain smart products' usefulness. In a smart home system, an autonomous speaker can put users in contact with other devices, centralizing the users' commands and doing routine tasks more efficiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Mani &amp; Chouk, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Rijsdijk &amp; Hultink, 2009)</ref>. Although autonomy has advantages, a very high level of this characteristic can increase perceived performance risks and failure severity, and academia and practitioners need more research to understand the effect of autonomy on usefulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Verhoef et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>To increase their usefulness, home voice assistants use voice control and respond to some words to awake the smart home assistant. The speakers' microphone has to be continuously listening and collecting data, and sometimes it activates unintentionally. For that reason, intrusiveness is a characteristic of this product <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Benlian, Klumpe, &amp; Hinz, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hoffman &amp; Novak, 2015)</ref>. Intrusiveness implies a loss of privacy, which has led to a public debate about the risks of these smart products, the negative impact that intrusiveness has on their brand image, and decreasing trust in the providers. Due to intrusiveness, these smart home assistants generate stress and domestic conflict among family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Benlian et al., 2019)</ref> who feel that technology invades their privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hauk &amp; Padberg, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Qiu &amp; Benbasat, 2009)</ref>. Intrusiveness is a major barrier to the adoption of smart products <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Benlian et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hoffman &amp; Novak, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Mani &amp; Chouk, 2017)</ref> and can influence other marketing variables like recommendations, acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Van den Broeck, Zarouali, &amp; Poels, 2019)</ref>, and continuance to usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Benlian et al., 2019)</ref>. However, little is known about its effect on usefulness.</p><p>As a consequence, previous research has examined how to mitigate intrusiveness, for example, through other smart characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Benlian et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Van den Broeck et al., 2019)</ref>. Studies have found that interactivity of smart products can increase trust and, in turn, mitigate negative perceptions such as privacy invasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Rijsdijk &amp; Hultink, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2009)</ref>. Interactivity has been gaining attention from academics in recent years as the possibility of interaction anytime and anywhere has increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fan, Liu, Wang, &amp; Wang, 2017)</ref>. However, no research has yet examined how the perceived interactivity of a smart product can mitigate the negative perceptions derived from its autonomy.</p><p>The present study has three aims. The first is to examine the effect of autonomy on perceived intrusiveness and usefulness by analyzing a non-linear relationship. Second, it investigates whether perceived interactivity can reduce the perceived intrusiveness of smart products, both directly and indirectly, by increasing trust in the service provider. The research also examines the effect of interactivity and intrusiveness on usefulness. Third, it aims to discover whether perceived interactivity can act as a moderator and reduce the effect of perceived autonomy on intrusiveness.</p><p>This research contributes to the marketing literature by providing empirical evidence not only of the direct effect of autonomy on usefulness, but also of its indirect effect through intrusiveness. The results suggest a non-linear effect of autonomy on usefulness and on intrusiveness. The research offers evidence of the negative effect of intrusiveness on perceived usefulness and highlights that autonomy is an important antecedent of intrusiveness. Additionally, this study contributes by examining how the benefits of the product's interactivity can mitigate the perceived intrusiveness of smart home assistants directly and indirectly. Furthermore, previous work has mainly examined interactivity in the online context. The present research provides an example of a new context (smart home voice assistants) in which interactivity is relevant, and it presents empirical evidence of the benefits to brand trust and the usefulness of the device. These results have implications for marketing managers and smart product developers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intrusiveness</head><p>Intrusiveness is defined as "the consumer's perception that the company abusively penetrates into his/her private life" (p. 843) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Boeck, Roy, Durif, &amp; Grégoire, 2011)</ref>. It is related to the surveillance of the users and their daily lives. This surveillance includes the acquisition, usage, and storage of personal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Plangger &amp; Montecchi, 2020)</ref> to monitor and control everything from screen time and hygiene habits to meal and travel schedules and other activities. Some devices are full of sensors and microphones that are envisioned as part of a surveillance web to chart families' domestic patterns so that marketing can be more easily targeted at them based on their interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Holtrop, Wieringa, Gijsenberg, &amp; Verhoef, 2017)</ref>. Surveillance has a negative connotation related to privacy costs and security risks due to some covert surveillance tactics <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Albrechtslund, 2008)</ref>. This intrusiveness is disturbing, irritating, and indiscreet <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Krafft, Arden, &amp; Verhoef, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Mani &amp; Chouk, 2017)</ref>. Nowadays, consumers can connect and use their smart products anywhere and at any time, sometimes the devices collect information without the consumers' knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Silaban, Hasudungan, Nadapdap, Situmeang, &amp; Situmeang, 2019)</ref>. A well-known example is the case of a police murder investigation in the US that drew on information collected by a voice home assistant that was listening during the incident without the users being aware of it <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Buhr, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Linked to surveillance is the concept of information privacy, which involves an individual's ability to control the use, release, collection, storage, and access to their personal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Malhotra, Kim, &amp; Agarwal, 2004)</ref>. When users perceive the smart device as being intrusive, they also perceive the probability of having a privacy breach <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Benlian et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Yang, Lee, &amp; Zo, 2017)</ref>. Users become aware of the intrusiveness of this technology when they receive information about products or services without asking for it. They then realize that the smart device has activated without their explicit instruction and has inconspicuously listened to and collected information from the user and others in the vicinity for disclosure to service providers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Autonomy</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Rijsdijk and Hultink (2009, p. 26)</ref>, autonomy "refers to the extent to which a product is able to operate in an independent and goal-directed way without interference of the user." An autonomous product does not need human intervention but instead takes over on its own, can show proactive and self-starting behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Benlian et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hoffman &amp; Novak, 2015)</ref>, and can work together with human beings to liberate consumers of some unwanted chores <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cronin, 2010)</ref> or cognitive decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Broniarczyk &amp; Griffin, 2014)</ref>. Autonomous products take over tasks, allowing the consumer to use the time and effort saved to participate in other activities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Rijsdijk and Hultink (2003)</ref> proposed four different levels of autonomy: manual, bounded, supervised autonomy, and symbiosis. Bounded autonomy is when the product acts after the user has selected all the options for doing the activity. At the supervised autonomy level, the smart product can provide some advice about the activity. At the symbiosis level, the product communicates with the user to fulfill the proposed activity. The symbiosis level requires an integration of products in the house and sensors, which is known as a smart home where the smart assistant can control other smart domestic devices such as smart lights, smart fridges, smart washing machines, smart coffee makers, smart heating, and smart doors. Each of these other devices can also be autonomous. For example, a smart washing machine can decide the water, detergent, and the program depending on the clothes that the machine's sensors detect, and smart lights can change their intensity depending on the sunlight and even have the ability to switch themselves on/off.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interactivity</head><p>Marketing researchers have paid attention to interactivity mainly in the online context. Interactivity exists when a person clicks on a machine and the machine does something (such as retrieving information or presenting content) in response to a person's request <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hoffman &amp; Novak, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>The literature conceptualizes interactivity as a multidimensional construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cyr, Head, &amp; Ivanov, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Lee, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Wu &amp; Wu, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Mollen and Wilson (2010)</ref> stated that perceived interactivity is an experiential phenomenon that occurs when a user interacts with a website or other computer-mediated communication entities. Perceived interactivity is "the degree to which the user perceives that the interaction or communication is two-way, controllable, and responsive to their actions." (p. 5). Several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chattaraman, Kwon, Gilbert, &amp; Ross, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cyr et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Horning, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Liu &amp; Shrum, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">McMillan &amp; Hwang, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Mollen &amp; Wilson, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Song &amp; Zinkhan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Wu &amp; Wu, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Yadav &amp; Varadarajan, 2005)</ref> have reached a degree of consensus on the core dimensions of perceived interactivity: perceived user control, two-way communication, and perceived responsiveness.</p><p>Previous research considers interactivity as part of the customers' experience with smart products, together with customer perceptions, such as perceived enjoyment and relative advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Roy, Balaji, Sadeque, Nguyen, &amp; Melewar, 2017)</ref>. During the last decade, there has been an expansion of embodied conversational agents that are capable of establishing conversations and being interactive, both on screens (such as Apple's Siri and Google's Ok) and as physical devices (such as Amazon's Alexa and Google's Echo speakers). The key is the existence of a process involving continuous exchange of messages in a two-way communication flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hood, Shanahan, Hopkins, &amp; Lindsey, 2015)</ref>. Interactivity is one of the main characteristics of smart products since it is an element of the user interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hoffman &amp; Novak, 2015)</ref>. However, while previous research on smart speakers has focused on the influence of some characteristics on their adoption or on user satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Mani &amp; Chouk, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Rijsdijk &amp; Hultink, 2009)</ref>, previous studies have not included interactivity among these characteristics. Moreover, research has yet to examine the assistants' ability to reduce a customer's negative perceptions about the product, or the assistants' relationship with other variables examined in the previous literature in other contexts, such as trust, attitude, or loyalty.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides some examples of the main variables of this study: autonomy, intrusiveness, and autonomy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived Usefulness</head><p>The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and its modified versions consider perceived usefulness as the main construct.</p><p>Perceived usefulness is "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance" <ref type="bibr">(Davis, 1989, p. 320)</ref>. Research about smart products defines perceived usefulness as "the extent to which a consumer believes that using them increases his or her personal efficiency, such as being more organized and more productive" <ref type="bibr">(Chuah et al., 2016 p. 278)</ref>. Connected objects offer a multitude of new service systems and assemblages, functions, and information, allowing better time management for users <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hoffman &amp; Novak, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Novak &amp; Hoffman, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Touzani, Charfi, Boistel, &amp; Niort, 2018)</ref>.

Research in the context of voice assistants has recently examined perceived usefulness as an antecedent of a customer's attitude, adoption, or satisfaction to explain the use of these types of assistant <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Fernandes &amp; Oliveira, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">McLean &amp; Osei-Frimpong, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Moriuchi, 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model and Hypotheses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Autonomy</head><p>Based on the definition of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hoffman and Novak (2015)</ref>, smart products are intrusive because they have the ability to perform actions autonomously and without the permission of the consumer. An important cause of intrusiveness is the potential for unintentional voice activation of products that listen continuously to the environment so that they can react to the consumer's needs. Previous research has shown that autonomy of smart home assistants results in a potentially high level of intrusiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Benlian et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Mani &amp; Chouk, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>An autonomous product that automatically reacts to voices can create situations in which a consumer does not know whether the smart home assistant is on or off. As a result, the product starts to collect information from the environment about the consumer's behavior, and the device can share this information with third-party service providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Wueest, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Benlian et al. (2019)</ref> suggested that the unintentional activation of the technology, and the consumer's lack of awareness of whether the smart home assistant is on or off, are the most significant causes of privacy invasion in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Mani &amp; Chouk, 2019)</ref> and they increase the consumer's perception that service providers are encroaching upon private lives. The fear of privacy violations and the concerns about data security drive this increased perception of risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Keh &amp; Pang, 2010)</ref>. It seems, therefore, that, at low levels of autonomy, the product is unable to act by itself and start listening without the user's interaction, and that, as autonomy increases, the benefits can outweigh the risks until to the point that increasing autonomy leads to a loss of control, thereby increasing the perception of intrusiveness.</p><p>H1.

It is related to the consumer's beliefs and expectations about whether the smart product's brand is honest, reliable, and dependable <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Carvalho &amp; Fernandes, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Pavlou, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Yang et al., 2017)</ref>. The perception that the brand behaves fairly, accountably, and responsibly is essential for trust development <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Singh, Iglesias, &amp; Batista-Foguet, 2012)</ref>. Consumers trust in vendors when they think that the vendors will not behave opportunistically <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gefen, Karahanna, &amp; Straub, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>In the technology adoption field, previous research has shown that trust is a key instrument for the acceptance of technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gefen, 2000)</ref>. In the smart home industry, users fear data collection from big information technology companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Yang et al., 2017)</ref>, and trust has a positive effect on the attitudes of users of smart home devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Luor, Lu, Yu, &amp; Lu, 2015)</ref>. Furthermore, brand trust can make users perceive that the surveillance of smart products is less harmful and intrusive, since they think that the brand is honest and benevolent <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Plangger &amp; Montecchi, 2020)</ref>. So, we propose:</p><p>H4. Trust will have a negative effect on intrusiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interactivity</head><p>As previously defined, interactivity refers to the extent to which users perceive that the communication with the home voice assistant is reciprocal, takes place instantaneously, and is controllable <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Liu, 2003)</ref>. Technological products are interactive if there is a bidirectional flow that the user can control to a certain extent and within a time frame. Home voice assistants can establish this communication flow and allow users to control for their interactions. Interactivity with the smart product can lead users to a perception of being co-responsible for the product's "acts" and their consequences, creating a collaborative experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(To et al., 2018)</ref>. Furthermore, using voice to interact with consumers favors the creation of a character for these assistants and leads to more engaging interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kidd, 2008)</ref>. Interactivity with smart products helps customers co-create their experience with the product, influencing their relationship with the company and the brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barwitz &amp; Maas, 2018)</ref>. Therefore, if the speaker allows bidirectional communication, it is able to understand and answer a consumer's queries, and the consumer is able to control the product as well as their ability to voluntarily interact with it or not; as a result, the consumer will behave more actively and feel more confidence in dominating the interaction and handling the situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Liu &amp; Shrum, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Roy et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Verhoef et al., 2017)</ref>. The better the interaction and the communication, the more the product provides information about how it will perform the task, which will reduce the perceived intrusiveness of the product. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis: H5. Perceived interactivity will have a negative effect on intrusiveness.</p><p>Greater interactivity empowers consumers as it facilitates their communication with products and brands directly, regardless of distance or time <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Deighton &amp; Kornfeld, 2009)</ref>. This interactivity can lead to trust in the service provider and greater customer loyalty in the e-commerce context <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cyr et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Lee, 2005)</ref>. Research has conceptualized trust as an important component of credibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(McCroskey &amp; Teven, 1999)</ref>. Consumers can gather the information they need to make decisions and reduce uncertainty through the interaction with smart products <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Koo &amp; Choi, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sun, Fang, &amp; Hwang, 2019)</ref>. A high level of interactivity enables the smart product to share information and knowledge, providing consumers with high-quality information to make better decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bayus, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chan, Li, &amp; Zhu, 2015)</ref>, which, in turn, makes the product seem more trustable <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Wang, Chih, &amp; Hsu, 2020)</ref>. In relation to social commerce platforms, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Liang, Ho, Li, and Turban (2011)</ref> demonstrated that consumers can receive information support through interaction, which can make them feel safe, increase their trust in these platforms, and lessen their concern about privacy issues. As a consequence, perceived interactivity can reduce intrusiveness not only directly but also indirectly through an increase in trust. Accordingly, our next hypothesis is: H6. Perceived interactivity will have an indirect effect on intrusiveness mediated by trust.</p><p>In the context of online shopping sites, previous research has shown that interactivity with virtual assistants (also known as avatars) can increase patronage intentions (Etemad-Sajadi, 2016) and that it positively influences other TAM constructs, such as self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abdullah, Jayaraman, Shariff, Bahari, &amp; Nor, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chattaraman et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Coursaris &amp; Sung, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lee, Fiore, &amp; Kim, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Thellman, Silvervarg, Gulz, &amp; Ziemke, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Veletsianos &amp; Navarrete, 2012)</ref>. The level of interactivity of the virtual assistant is useful if it helps users make decisions about their purchases or life. Interactivity involves two-way communication and responsiveness. Usefulness may increase when the product offers rich, valuable, and high-quality two-way communication. When two parties communicate, a fast response time contributes to the continuity of communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gao, Rau, &amp; Salvendy, 2010)</ref>, and, therefore, it increases the perceived usefulness of the product.</p><p>H7. Perceived interactivity will have a positive effect on perceived usefulness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderating Effect of Interactivity</head><p>Little is known about how to reduce the negative effects of autonomy on intrusiveness or privacy risk. Recent research has examined whether the anthropomorphic design features reduce smart home assistants' intrusiveness and their negative effects on privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Benlian et al., 2019)</ref>, and other researchers have suggested that human-like features increase trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aggarwal &amp; McGill, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Landwehr, McGill, &amp; Herrmann, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Waytz, Heafner, &amp; Epley, 2014)</ref>. However, an important characteristic of the product that can also increase trust is perceived interactivity. As discussed above, perceived interactivity involves an effective two-way communication, providing useful answers in an efficient time frame that can also be interpreted as human-like aspects. Interactivity increases product knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Yim &amp; Park, 2019)</ref>, which can help users obtain information about the product and increase their confidence in it <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Deighton &amp; Kornfeld, 2009)</ref>. The level of interactivity of the product can reduce the negative consequences of autonomy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baber (1996)</ref> illustrated this aspect by using a washing machine as an example. He suggested that the highest level of autonomy would involve the machine setting the program, starting itself, and giving advice. At this point, the user starts an interaction with the product and a symbiosis would occur. To provide advantages for the consumer, the ongoing communication between the user and the product would go in the same direction in order to fulfill a common goal. Therefore, as that communication is bidirectional, it is helpful, fast, and controlled by the user, and hence it will reduce the negative effect of autonomy on intrusiveness. Accordingly, we propose the following hypothesis: H8. Perceived interactivity will have a negative moderating effect on the relationship between autonomy and intrusiveness.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the model to be tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>To test the hypotheses, we collected data using a survey questionnaire administered on the Mechanical Turk website. Initially, we obtained 651 responses, but we eliminated four that used more than one smart home voice assistant, 15 that answered all the questions with the same value or following a pattern, and 25 that incorrectly responded to the two filter questions that controlled for the respondent's concentration. This yielded a total of 607 valid responses.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> There were 51.5% male respondents, and the age of participants was, on average, 34.5 years old.

In relation to the brand of the device, 56.2% used Alexa, 29.5% Google Home, 7.7% Cortana, 5.6% Home Pod (Apple), and 1% reported that they used other brands. The mean duration that respondents had been using the devices was 14.23 months.</p><p>The measurement of the variables follows constructs used in previous research (for the instrument, see the Appendix).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model</head><p>First, the authors carried out an exploratory factor analysis using SPSS to check the unidimensionality of the reflective constructs. A factorial analysis with varimax rotation confirmed nine dimensions. Then, the next analysis was a confirmatory factor analysis carried out using SmartPLS 3.0 software.</p><p>Common method variance could pose a serious problem. Therefore, the authors conducted a Harmon's one-factor test. The results show that a single factor explained 21.4% of the variance; when all five factors in the model are taken into account, the variance explained increases to 74.4%. Thus, there is no indication of any problem with common method variance.</p><p>The results proposed to eliminate some items-one item each of communication, responsiveness, and perceived control -to obtain the quality criteria (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). After that, all factor loadings of the constructs exceeded the minimum acceptable value of 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Carmines &amp; Zeller, 1979</ref>). Cronbach's alpha values and the composite reliability index for all constructs exceeded the minimum acceptable value of 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hair, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Nunnally, 1978)</ref>, confirming internal consistency. To evaluate discriminant validity, we obtained the average variance extracted (AVE); this exceeded the threshold of 0.6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> shows the discriminant validity results according to the criterion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref> and the HTMT (heterotraitmonotrait) ratio proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Henseler, Ringle, and Sarstedt (2015)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the structural results of the model. To test predictive relevance, we used SmartPLS 3.0 M3 software (www.smartpls.de), which provides the Q 2 value recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Stone (1974)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Geisser (1974)</ref>. Our models show positive Q 2 values for the main dependent variables.</p><p>The results show that there is a significant quadratic effect of autonomy on intrusiveness. However, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows that the effect is only positive and that there is no U-shaped effect, so H1 is not supported. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows that the impact of autonomy on usefulness has a U-shaped effect, so H2 is not supported. The results show that intrusiveness has a negative effect on perceived usefulness, supporting H3, and that trust has a negative and significant effect on intrusiveness, supporting H4. Interactivity has a negative and significant effect on intrusiveness, so H5 is supported, and a direct and positive effect on usefulness, supporting H7. Examining the mediating effect of trust (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>), the results show that the indirect path of interactivity-trust-intrusiveness is significant, confirming a partial mediation and supporting H6. Additionally, the indirect paths of autonomy-intrusiveness-usefulness and interactivityintrusiveness-usefulness are also significant, showing a partial mediation of intrusiveness in the relationship between autonomy and usefulness and between interactivity and usefulness. The results show that the moderating effect of interactivity is negative and significant, so H8 is supported. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the moderating effect of interactivity on autonomy. When interactivity is high, a slightly U-shaped effect of autonomy on intrusiveness is perceived. When interactivity is high, the effect of the level of autonomy on intrusiveness is lower than when interactivity is low.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This research aimed, first, to analyze the non-linear effect of the level of autonomy of smart products on perceived intrusiveness and usefulness; second, to examine how perceived interactivity of the product can reduce the negative effect of autonomy on intrusiveness; and, third, to discover whether perceived interactivity can reduce intrusiveness through an increase in trust. This paper has examined not only a direct effect of interactivity on intrusiveness but also a moderating effect on the relationship between autonomy and intrusiveness and an indirect effect on intrusiveness through trust.</p><p>Contrary to our expectations, our findings suggest that autonomy has a U-shaped effect on perceived usefulness. Previous research has found evidence only of a linear relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Rijsdijk &amp; Hultink, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2009)</ref>. Our findings show that, although there is a U-shaped effect, the main values of autonomy show a positive effect, which is consistent with previous research. Only for a very low level of perceived autonomy is the relationship between autonomy and perceived usefulness negative. Furthermore, the results show that the effect of autonomy on usefulness is not only direct, as previously found <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Rijsdijk &amp; Hultink, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2009)</ref>, but that it also impacts on usefulness in an indirect way through intrusiveness. This result confirms previous research that suggests that intrusiveness can reduce the convenience of the device <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Benlian et al., 2019)</ref>. Previous research has found that intrusiveness reduces the consumer's acceptance of the message or information provided by the chatbot <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Van den Broeck et al., 2019)</ref>, and, therefore, the message or information's perceived usefulness. Thus, our research offers new empirical support for the negative consequences of intrusiveness, showing that they are motivated, at least in part, by autonomy.</p><p>The results show that autonomy has a non-linear U-shaped effect on intrusiveness, but there is no evidence that increasing autonomy until a certain point may have a negative effect on intrusiveness. Therefore, the results have only found a positive effect of autonomy on intrusiveness confirming previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Benlian et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hoffman &amp; Novak, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Mani &amp; Chouk, 2019)</ref>. We expected the smart product's autonomy not to have a strong positive effect on intrusiveness when its levels are low, as the advantages of that autonomy on well-being may eliminate that effect. Low levels of autonomy do not require the collection of as much information about the environment or the user, so we expected low levels of intrusiveness until a point at which the smart product needs more surveillance and gathers more information to operate more autonomously and perform its task efficiently. A possible explanation for the unexpected result is that the relationship between autonomy and intrusiveness may vary depending on the use of the home speaker. Home speakers have different functionalities, from searching for information on the Internet, playing music, making phone calls, and managing lists to reading out recipe instructions, to controlling other devices in the home, such as smart door locks and smart lights. The level of autonomy and its effect on intrusiveness may vary depending on the type of use, because the device needs to collect different types of private information depending on the task it is requested to perform.</p><p>The findings suggest that perceived interactivity is an important smart characteristic that can increase perceived usefulness, as previous research on different contexts has suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chattaraman et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Coursaris &amp; Sung, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lee et al., 2006)</ref>. Our findings show that the higher the interactivity, the lower the perceived intrusiveness of the product. No previous research has focused on how this smart product characteristic can mitigate this effect, although evidence has been found of the benefits of interactivity on other aspects, such as trust, satisfaction, repurchase intention, or repatronage intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cho, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cyr et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kim, Spielmann, &amp; McMillan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lin, 2007)</ref>. Previous research has suggested that interactivity increases trust in service providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Dennis, Merrilees, Jayawardhena, &amp; Wright, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Merrilees &amp; Fry, 2002)</ref>. Intrusiveness involves a lack of trust in the service provider or brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Benlian et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wueest, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Yang et al., 2017)</ref>, so trust is an important condition to reduce privacy risk or intrusiveness. Our results confirm previous research that has found an indirect path in another context, namely, social commerce platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Liang et al., 2011)</ref>. These findings contribute by providing more evidence of the indirect effect of interactivity through trust, but in this case to reduce intrusiveness. Our results show that interactivity influences usefulness, both directly with a strong positive impact and indirectly by reducing the negative impact of intrusiveness. Therefore, interactivity is an important smart  characteristic that managers should take into account due to its positive consequences.</p><p>Finally, this research presents evidence of the moderating effect of interactivity on the relationship between autonomy and intrusiveness. Little is known about this effect as no previous research has focused on it. However, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Benlian et al. (2019)</ref> proposed in relation to anthropomorphic characteristics, the inclusion of some human-like characteristics can reduce the negative effect of privacy risk and privacy invasion by autonomous products. Interactivity involves efficient and useful two-way communication that also has human-like properties, and it allows users to exert a greater control over the product. We have found evidence that all these aspects together mitigate the perceived intrusiveness of very autonomous products.</p><p>This study makes three main contributions to marketing research. Although the negative aspects of smart products are always linked to intrusiveness and privacy risk, there has been little research on how to mitigate that negative perception, with some exceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Benlian et al., 2019)</ref>. To focus on that variable is important as it is one of the main barriers to adoption of this type of product. The first contribution of our findings is the evidence of how the smart product characteristic of perceived interactivity can reduce perceived intrusiveness. Our results provide empirical evidence of the importance of perceived interactivity for that purpose, as this characteristic reduces perceived intrusiveness not only in a direct way, but also indirectly through trust in the provider. Furthermore, interactivity reduces not only the perceived intrusiveness of the product, but also the negative consequences of autonomy in terms of intrusiveness.</p><p>Second, previous research has examined the possibility of non-linear effects of autonomy on perceived advantages or on adoption intention, but the studies have always found a linear relationship between autonomy and intrusiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Mani &amp; Chouk, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Rijsdijk &amp; Hultink, 2009)</ref>. Our results provide evidence of a non-linear effect of autonomy on intrusiveness, with this effect being stronger for higher levels of autonomy. However, when this effect interacts with other variables such as interactivity, autonomy shows a U-shaped relationship for those consumers who perceive high interactivity.</p><p>Finally, our research presents new evidence of the relationship between autonomy and usefulness. Our results show a non-linear effect between these variables and that there is not only a direct effect of autonomy on usefulness, but also an indirect effect through intrusiveness. Previous research has mainly examined direct effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Rijsdijk &amp; Hultink, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2009)</ref>, whereas the indirect paths have been less investigated.</p><p>Our findings have some practical implications for managers and product development managers to reduce intrusiveness. First, product development managers should take into account the relationship between autonomy and intrusiveness. Consumers are still reluctant to adopt products with high levels of autonomy. Managers should consider autonomy seriously in product development, as this smart product characteristic increases the level of perceived intrusiveness of the product. However, according to our results, this effect can be mitigated through the level of interactivity. Therefore, managers should focus not only on developing autonomous products but also on ensuring that these products have a high level of perceived interactivity. The results show that improving and increasing the level of interactivity have positive effects, not only reducing intrusiveness but also increasing the perceived usefulness of the voice assistant. This is important because perceived usefulness is a main driver for the long-term use of smart voice assistants <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(McLean &amp; Osei-Frimpong, 2019)</ref>. Therefore, autonomous products should also show a high level of two-way communication with consumers and provide quick and helpful answers to consumers' queries. Product developers should consider providing more information about the process and the steps that the autonomous product will take so users may feel greater control. Increasing the level of interactivity provides that advantage; in addition, the more interactive the home speaker, the lower the perception of intrusiveness due to increased generation of trust in the provider. This latter aspect is also relevant for managers due to the negative and controversial reports about home speakers. The perception of the intrusiveness of this type of product is increasing among consumers, and, at the same time, brand trust has decreased. Increasing the level of interactivity of the product can help to raise brand trust, which would enable a reduction of perceived intrusiveness.</p><p>This research also has limitations that allow us to propose some lines for future research. In this study, perceived interactivity is a second-order construct with three components. However, it would be interesting to examine whether the effect of each component is the same or if there are some interactive components that are more important in reducing intrusiveness. Perceived control, for example, can be one of the most important aspects to consider. In a similar way, future research can also examine the type of relationships of each component of interactivity. In this research, we have examined a direct, an indirect, and a moderating effect of interactivity, but what type of effect will each component show? Additionally, this study has focused on one type of product: smart home speakers. However, future research can replicate the study with other smart products because other products might yield different results. Additionally, future research can examine these relationships in a different country as consumers from different countries may value the level of autonomy in different ways due to cultural effects. The users of Mechanical Turk are mainly young and more innovative, so future research can use a wider sample. The research has focused on just one smart characteristic, interactivity, but others, such as human-like interaction or the level of personalization, might also help to reduce perceived intrusiveness. Finally, future research could focus on a more exhaustive analysis of the tradeoff between autonomy, intrusiveness, and usefulness by using other research techniques such as conjoint analysis. This technique can provide an overview of the consumer's preferences not only for those attributes, but also for other smart product characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We are living in a world with an increasing number of autonomous products that can make small decisions by obtaining information about their environment and the personal preferences of the user. A high level of autonomy of a product can be useful and efficient, but it can also lead to greater intrusiveness. Together with privacy risk, intrusiveness is one of the main consumer concerns about the new connected products or those with Internet of things technologies. Therefore, it is important to examine what firms can do to reduce these negative perceptions of smart products.</p><p>In this paper, we have examined how firms can reduce the level of intrusiveness generated by the autonomy of smart home speakers. Our study has analyzed how the perceived interactivity of the product can reduce that negative effect, not only in a direct way, but also by moderating that effect. The research also proposes that interactivity can reduce the perceived intrusiveness of the product by increasing trust in the provider. The results confirm the two waysdirect and indirectby which perceived interactivity can reduce intrusiveness. A high perception of interactivity involves a strong two-way communication, responsiveness, and perceived control. Therefore, increasing the perceived interactivity can help to reduce the effect that the level of autonomy has on intrusiveness. Firms can use the level of interactivity to offer consumers more information and communication with the product, which may increase the perceived control and ultimately reduce the perceived intrusiveness of the product. Therefore, as products become smarter and more autonomous, they should also become more interactive.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

We addressed this concern in two ways in our data processing. First, we set up Mechanical Turk so that each respondent was asked to complete a single survey; second, we checked that no responses had identical Mechanical Turk IDs.</p></note>
