<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The inter-organizational relations between firms have marked more and more the literature these recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barratt &amp; Barratt, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cousins &amp; Menguc, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Flynn, Huob &amp; Zhaod, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Liu, Luo &amp; Liu, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Ryan, Emond &amp; La Montagne, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Williams, Roh, Tokar &amp; Swink, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Zhao, Huo, Selen, Hoi &amp; Yeung, 2011)</ref>. These inter-organizational relationships include different levels and types of interaction between firms within the same supply chain. As part of this relationship, firms exchange and share information upstream and downstream of the chain in order to enhance performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Towers &amp; Burnes, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Supply chain is viewed as network consisting of nodes and links. A node is an establishment (suppliers, manufacturers, customers) which is an agent that has the ability to make decisions and maximize its own gain within the parameters in which it operates in the supply chain and Links represent transactions consisting of the flow of materials, information, and/or finance between nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carter, Rogers &amp; Choi, 2015)</ref>. A firm as a partner in the supply chain must be more integrated both internally and externally. This involves more integration of information systems, more collaboration and more information sharing within the firm (internal integration), with their suppliers (supplier integration) and with their customers (customer integration).</p><p>Several empirical researches had shown that there is a significant and positive relationship between the level of integration of the supply chain and the firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alfalla-Luque, López &amp; Dey, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fabbe-Costes &amp; Jahre, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Giménez &amp; Ventura, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Huo, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Huo, Zhang &amp; Zhao, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Irani, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Sahin &amp; Robinson, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Yu, Jacobs, Enns &amp; Enns, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Zhao, Feng &amp; Wang, 2015)</ref>. However, incomplete and evolving conceptualizations made by these authors have led to inconsistent findings about this relationship.</p><p>According to Fabbe-Costes and Jahre <ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref>, the analysis of the relationship between supply chain integration and performance depends on three aspects: The way in which integration is apprehended and measured, the way in which performance is apprehended and measured and the nature of the relationship that exists between these two variables. There are three dimensions of supply chain integration that may affect firm performance: customer integration, internal integration and supplier integration. A set of techniques and practices of integration exist in each dimension of integration: information integration, coordination and collaboration. There is also a strategic and operational level in supply chain integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Saeed, Malhotra &amp; Grover, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the abundance of literature on the benefits of all dimensions of supply chain integration, there is always few researches that studies the effects of interaction between customer integration, internal integration and supplier integration on the firm performance.</p><p>Through an organizational capabilities perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Grant, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Teece, Pisano &amp; Shuen 1997)</ref>, supply chain integration can be viewed as a set of intra-and inter-organizational capabilities. In other words, internal integration involves more competencies on information integration and collaboration within the firm and external integration is focused on all capabilities of the firm to integrate and share information and collaborate with suppliers and customers within all the supply chain.</p><p>Morocco has strengthened its global positioning in some world global businesses. So the supply chain integration has become a major challenge for manufacturing companies, especially those operating in complex supply chains (automotive, aerospace, electronics and Textile manufacturing). Indeed, the scattering of production processes around the world as generated by outsourcing strategies implies more coordination between all partners off the chain. This coordination needs more integration of the material and information flows and strategic collaboration to increase synchronization within the supply chain.</p><p>We except that a manufacturer firm may increase its operational performance by increasing the level of integration with its customers and suppliers, but this integration requires a collaboration and information sharing inside the firm. From an organizational capabilities approach we will show by an empirical study (based on PLS -Structural Equation Modeling) how the three dimensions of integration affect the operational performance of the Moroccan manufacturer and how internal integration mediates the relationship between both supplier and customer integration and operational performance.</p><p>Section 2 of the paper presents the relevant literature and research hypotheses. The methodological approach is developed in section 3. In the fourth section, we will present and analyze the results and we will discuss these results in section 5. Finally, section 6 includes limitations of the study and implications for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical Framework and Hypothesis Formulation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Supply Chain Integration Dimensions</head><p>The construct of supply chain integration is relatively recent as a research issue although there were several studies that examined the relationships of cooperation and collaboration between partners within a supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Comelli, Fenies &amp; Tchernev, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Greis &amp; Kasarda, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Mentzer, Foggin &amp; Golicic, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Spekman, Kammuf &amp; Myhr, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Xue, Wang, Shen &amp; Yu, 2007)</ref>. This construct is still difficult to understand because of its multidimensional nature. The construct must take into account both the level of integration (upstream, internal and downstream) and the nature of this integration (integration of information systems, information sharing, strategic collaboration and operational coordination).</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Van der Vaart, Giménez and Donk (2007)</ref>, SCI is "the degree to which a manufacturer strategically collaborates with its supply chain partners and collaboratively manages intra-and inter-organization processes. The goal is to achieve effective and efficient flows of products and services, information, money and decisions, to provide maximum value to the customer at low cost and high speed". This definition includes several important elements. First of all, the importance of strategic collaboration between partnerships in order to achieve mutually beneficial strategic goals, it is based on mutual trust, contract duration, sharing of information and collaboration in conflict resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Flynn et al., 2010)</ref>. The second component corresponds to coordination of operational process within the organization and between partners. Through a dyadic perspective, integration can be internal which refers to integration of flows and process and collaborating within the focal firm and external (customer integration and supplier integration) which is the degree to which a manufacturer partners with its external partners to structure inter-organizational strategies, practices and processes into collaborative, synchronized processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Flynn et al., 2010)</ref>. This multidimensional nature of the integration process involves the need to investigate how these dimensions of integration work separately and jointly.</p><p>In the first SCI's researches, authors who have specially studied the impact of integration on firm's performance, have used the construct as single dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dong, Carter &amp; Dresner, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Frohlich &amp; Westbrook, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kannan &amp; Tan, 2005)</ref> before finding that the best way to identify the phenomenon is to study it in all its dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Huo et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Huo, Qi, Wang &amp; Zhao, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wong, Boon-itt &amp; Wong, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wong, Lai &amp; Bernroider., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Yu et al., 2013)</ref>. Integration researches should, in fact, take into account all the three levels: "supplier integration", "internal integration" and "customer integration" as recommended also by Fabbe-Costes and Jahre (2008).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Supply Chain Integration As an Organizational Capabilities</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kusunoki, Nonaka and Nagata (1998)</ref>, there are various definitions for the concept of organizational capabilities, but most research agree that organizational capabilities are not easily obtainable in the marketplace and are difficult to copy; they are accumulated through long-term and continuous learning and have the potential to become a source of sustainable competitive advantage on a long-term basis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Grant, (1996)</ref> defines an organizational capability as the "ability to perform repeatedly a productive task which relates either directly or indirectly to a firm's capacity for creating value through effecting the transformation of inputs into outputs". <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Helfat and Peteraf (2003)</ref> define organizational capability as 'the ability of an organization to perform a coordinated set of tasks, utilizing organizational resources, for the purpose of achieving a particular end result. Organizational capabilities are fundamental as they provide competitive advantage to firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dosi, Nelson &amp; Winter 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Three types of organizational capabilities: local, architectural and process capabilities were highlighted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kusunoki et al. (1998)</ref>. So Internal integration and external integration can be viewed as intra-organizational and inter-organizational core dynamic capabilities of a company <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Grant, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Teece et al., 1997)</ref>. In each dimension of integration we can find local capabilities, architectural capabilities and process capabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Intra-organizational Capabilities</head><p>Internal integration can be viewed as a set of Intra-organizational integrative capabilities in which "local capabilities" are related to technology and information system integration within the firm: Enterprise Resource Planning, Advanced Planning and Scheduling System, Integrative inventory management… <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aral &amp; Weill, 2007)</ref>, "architectural capabilities" are represented by joint product design, cross-functional teams and connection among all internal functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Huh, Yook &amp; Kim, 2008)</ref> and "process capabilities" are based on information sharing, collaboration and communication inside organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Huh et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kusunoki et al., 1998)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Inter-organizational Capabilities</head><p>External integration (customer integration and internal integration) can be seen as a set of Inter-organizational capabilities in which local capabilities are related to technology and information system integration within supply chain: EDI, quick ordering systems, information networks… <ref type="bibr">(Radhakrishnan, Davis, Sridharan,, Moore &amp; David, 2017)</ref>, architectural capabilities and process capabilities refer respectively to joint product design and knowledge and information sharing, collaboration and communication within partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gianni &amp; Andrea, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Lorenzoni &amp; Lipparini, 1999)</ref>. This separation between Intra-organizational capabilities and Inter-organizational capabilities in supply chain integration is also consistent with that of "organizational internal and external core dynamic capabilities" of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Huo (2012)</ref>, and the "internal and external integrative capabilities" of <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Verona (1999)</ref>. In <ref type="bibr">Verona's model (1999)</ref> as cited by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Huo (2012)</ref>, internal integrative capabilities include internal communication, integrative strategies, job training, process integration; organization reengineering and external integrative capabilities include external communication and networks of collaborations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Impact of SCI on Operational Performance</head><p>In an analysis of the literature review of 25 articles related to the relationship between SCI and performance, Fabbe-Costes and Jahre <ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref> showed that, except 2 papers, all authors explicitly agree that the level of integration is positively related to the firm performance. Considered as a set of organizational capabilities, the integration of the supply chain can enable the manufacturer, as a partner, to reduce supply chain disruptions, to adapt to market fluctuations and to meet the requirements of customers in terms of cost, quality and lead time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Relationship between SCI Dimensions and Operational Performance of the Manufacturer</head><p>The level of linkage with customers through information networks, the level of computerization for their ordering and the level of communication with them reduce the decision making time. Furthermore, when the manufacturer and their customers share information and strengthen collaborative behavior, they can co-develop product, establish production plans jointly and coordinate the orders fulfillment in order to co-create value for the final consumer.</p><p>Customer integration has been found to be positively and significantly related directly to operational performance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Van der Vaart et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alfalla-Luque et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wong et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chang, Ellinger, Kim &amp; Franke, 2016)</ref>. Furthermore, customer integration impacts indirectly operational performance by improving innovation and product development <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Koufteros, Vonderembse &amp; Jayaram, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Song &amp; Di Benedetto, 2008)</ref>. Thus, we hypothesize that: H1a. Customer integration is positively and significantly related to operational performance of the manufacturer Internal integration as intra-organizational capabilities is related to the ability of the manufacturer to integrate process within departments and functions. Instead of a traditional organization based on a fragmented and specialized departments, the internal integration consists of breaking down functional barriers and involves collaboration and information sharing between all departments to meet the requirements of customers. Information sharing, joint planning, periodic contacts and meeting and collaboration in making decisions are a set of important competencies that allow firms to develop a competitive advantage. Moreover, this collaboration needs also some technological competencies of integration of information systems that are related to operational performance (Enterprise Resource Planning, Advanced Planning and Scheduling System, Integrative inventory management...).</p><p>As it was the case with customer integration, several authors found a positive relationship between internal integration and operational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alfalla-Luque et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Van der Vaart et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wong et al., 2015)</ref> but other authors found no direct relationship between these two constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Koufteros et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Giménez &amp; Ventura, 2005)</ref>. We can propose thus that:</p><p>H1b. Internal integration is positively and significantly related to operational performance of the manufacturer.</p><p>In an integrated supply chain, development of a strong strategic partnership with suppliers will facilitate their understanding and anticipation of the manufacturer's needs, in order to better meet its changing requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Flynn et al., 2010)</ref>. As inter-organizational capabilities, sharing information of products, processes, production schedules and plans and collaborate with suppliers helps them to synchronize their own production plans and reduce lead time. By developing a mutual understanding of the manufacturer's operations and process, suppliers achieve a high level of their customer service, which, in turn, helps the manufacturers improve their customer service <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Flynn et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Like also customer integration, several authors found a positive relationship between supplier integration and operational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Van der Vaart et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alfalla-Luque et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wong et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chang et al., 2016)</ref>, However, others authors have found no relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Stank et al., 2001b)</ref> or a negative relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Koufteros et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Stank et al., 2001a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Swink, Narasimhan &amp; Wang, 2007)</ref>. We can propose thus:</p><p>H1c. Supplier integration is positively and significantly related to operational performance of the manufacturer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">The Mediating Effect of the Internal Integration</head><p>It is generally accepted in the literature that companies first start by integrating flows and processes internally and then gradually become interested by external integration on their supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cohen &amp; Levinthal, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hillebrand &amp; Biemans, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Yu et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The relationship between internal integration and external integration can be analyzed according to the different forms of integration capabilities: information sharing, information systems integration, collaboration, coordination, a cross functional team... In the absence of high internal integration, external integration would be difficult and inefficient. Manufacturers cannot integrate their information system with their partners if their information systems themselves are not integrated (that supposes implementing ERP for example). In addition, companies that have invested well in strengthening the integration of their internal information systems have more opportunity to add modules and interfaces in order to integrate their systems with those of customers and suppliers. Similarly, sharing timely information with customers and suppliers requires sharing information within manufacturers first. Finally, the collaboration with partners supposes that collaborative behavior is already established within the manufacturer (between all departments and functions). Cross functional teams could be, for example, an organizational capacity that the firm can redeploy to resolve conflicts with its external partners and thus enhance collaboration with them.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Yu et al. (2013)</ref>, the level of internal integration is positively and significantly associated with the level of external integration. Alfalla-Luque, Marín-García and Medina-López (2015) have shown that the higher the level of internal integration, the greater the importance of customer integration and supplier integration. In the same way, the more the company develops its internal integration the higher its trust in the interest of the external integration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Carr and Kaynak (2007)</ref> have shown that intra-firm information sharing is positively associated with inter-firm information sharing. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Ward and Zhou (2006)</ref> have confirmed the existence of a positive correlation between intra-and inter-organizational integrations of information technologies. So, we suppose that external integration is positively and significantly associated with internal integration and we note:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2a. There is a positive and significant relationship between internal integration and customer integration.</head><p>H2b. There is a positive and significant relationship between internal integration and supplier integration. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kanter (1994)</ref> states that internal integration (including information sharing, interdepartmental collaboration, team-work) is important for establishing and maintaining alliances with customers and suppliers. He adds that internal collaboration allows firms to take widely advantage of their alliances and cooperation with their partners. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Stank et al. (2001b)</ref> argue that external collaboration contributes directly to logistics performance only when it can improve internal integration. In the same vein, downstream integration can improve logistics performance when the level of internal integration is high. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Germain &amp; Iyer, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, Rodrigues, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Stank and Lynch (2004)</ref> conclude that integrating separately the internal and external business processes doesn't affect significantly the performance of the firm but they have a positive and significant effect when they are combined.</p><p>We suppose, at least, that internal integration can mediate the relationship between both of customer integration and supplier integration and the operational performance of manufacturers. Based on this, we can assume that: H3a. Internal integration has a mediating effect on the relationship between customer integration and operational performance of the manufacturer.</p><p>H3b. Internal integration has a mediating effect on the relationship between supplier integration and operational performance of the manufacturer. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Questionnaire Design and Measures</head><p>We collected data in this research by using a questionnaire. The questionnaire is considered as the most preferred instrument in supply chain management surveys. It is used in almost 42% of the supply chain integration researches <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Irani, 2014)</ref>. This type of method is usually used to test hypothesis of a theoretical model.</p><p>We surveyed the literature to identify valid items and we opted for new measures based on our observations during our exploratory study in order to take on account the specific context of Moroccan manufacturing companies. All constructs were measured using five-point Likert scale. In fact, scales with 5 points are considered more able to decrease confusion and consequently enhance the response rate <ref type="bibr">(Babakus &amp; Mangold 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Devlin, Dong &amp; Brown, 1993)</ref>. They are simple to read and allow the respondent to better understand all proposed scales, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dawes (2008)</ref>.</p><p>For operational performance, cost, flexibility and are the basic determinants of performance in operations management literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Neely, Gregory &amp; Platts, 1995)</ref>. Moreover, in the context of the supply chain, firms must develop their time-based competition; their performance should also take into account their ability to respond quickly to customer needs and to adapt to demand changes.

This construct takes into account items that reflect the level of information integration which focuses on the degree of information systems integration and the level of information sharing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Droge, Jayaram &amp; Vickery, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ellinger, Daugherty &amp; Keller, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Narasimhan &amp; Kim, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Stank et al., 2001a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Vijayasarathy, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Van der Vaart and van Donk, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Other items were introduced to take into consideration the collaborative dimension of integration.

Some of these items was validated through a psychometric testing by Marín-García, Alfalla-Luque and Medina-López, C. ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>).</p><p>In the end, we adopted 8 items for operational performance, 10 items for "customer integration", 8 items for "internal integration" and 9 items for "supplier integration". The questionnaire was developed in English then translated into French. (We have translated the exploratory items from French into English). To control for the effect of contextual variables on the impact of supply chain integration, firm age and firm size were considered, which were measured by objective data; age by the number of years past inception, and size by the average total number of employees in the last three years according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hadid, Mansouri &amp; Gallear, (2016)</ref>.</p><p>In our research, the questionnaire was double-tested. Firstly, we have submitted it directly to supply chain management professors at the international conferences we attended. In the second test, we submitted the questionnaire to some professionals (plant managers, supply chain managers and logistics managers) whom we met in the Moroccan International Exhibition of Automotive Subcontracting (April 2018). Then, we modified formulations of some questions and added or deleted other questions in order to adapt items to manufacturer's Moroccan context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Sampling and Data Collection</head><p>A sample of 502 Moroccan manufacturing firms was identified using a database compiled by ourselves from the database of the Ministry of Industry and the four professional associations of four industries (automotive, aerospace, electric&amp; electronic and textile). To be included, a firm should employ more than 50 employees. We limited the sample to medium and large firms because we expect that small firms are less likely to implement supply chain management practices and to four industries because the supply chain of those industries, in Moroccan context, is more complex and the integration is more important and more benefic when the complexity of the supply chain is higher <ref type="bibr">(Van der Vaart et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wong et al., 2015)</ref>. Supply chain complexity of these companies is higher because of many reasons: They are mainly export-oriented; they are mostly partners in a complex global supply chain; they have a complex technology and production process and they operate in an uncertain environment.</p><p>We have opted for a convenience method to administer the questionnaire, but in order to make our sample more representative, we targeted companies in respect for a quota in which we tried to take into account the weight of each sector according to the number of companies. The questionnaires were addressed personally to plant manager, supply chain manager, logistics manager or production/quality manager, since these individuals are expected to have the knowledge needed to accurately respond <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hadid et al., 2016)</ref>. We have obtained in total 75 questionnaires yielding a response rate of 14, 96%. Appendix 2 provides more information on the sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Analysis and Hypothesis Testing</head><p>We used Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to test the hypothesis of the research model. Like SEM (CB-SEM), PLS-SEM is useful for latent constructs and has two components: measurement (outer) model and structural (inner) model and <ref type="bibr">(Hair, Sarstedt &amp; Ringl, 2011)</ref>. PLS-SEM does not require normality of data which is necessary for CB-SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>. In addition, PLS-SEM is capable of estimating models with small sample sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref> contrary to SEM (CB-SEM) which require large sample size. So, we used PLS-SEM given the size of our sample and because of lack of normality of data. We meet such justifications in some operations management researches <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hadid et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Reliability and Validity</head><p>In the process of verifying the validity of the scales of measurement, a factorial analysis with Principal Component Analysis, and Cronbach's alpha as well as the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index (KMO) were used to enhance reliability and unidimensionality of constructs. After purging items we adopted 5 items for operational performance, 8 items for "customer integration", 8 items for "internal integration" and also 8 items for "supplier integration. The complete scales are listed in Appendix 1.</p><p>Evaluation of the measurement model assumes a confirmatory evaluation of the convergent and discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Campbell &amp; Fiske, 1959)</ref> of the constructs as well as an assessment of predictability of the model. To assess the validity and reliability of each construct, we followed the recommendations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hair et al. (2011)</ref>. We examined the Cronbach's Alpha (&gt; 0,7), the rho_A (&gt; 0,7), the composite reliability (&gt; 0,7), and average variance extracted (AVE&gt;0,5). The Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows that all of these criteria exceed the required thresholds.</p><p>global supply chain which aspires to be more and more integrated. In addition, supply chain integration practices and behaviors are considered as a source of competitive advantage. The results of this study confirm the positive effect of the level of all dimensions of integration on operational performance in these companies which corroborates numerous findings reached by the researchers who worked on supply chain integration ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Van der Vaart et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alfalla-Luque et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wong et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chang et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The results confirm our assumptions that sharing information and collaborating with their major customers and suppliers in the business process can enhance firms' operational performance. The collaboration in the supply chain allows firms to understand the needs of their customers and to respond exactly to these needs. Likewise, partners who establish jointly demand forecasts and production schedules can minimize supply chain disruptions and quickly respond to changes in market demand. This is considered as a competitive advantage for the manufacturer given the high environment's uncertainty of automotive, aerospace, electronics and textile industries: product change and innovation, material and information flows complexity (Just-in-time) and business process complexity.</p><p>Moreover, the position of these companies in the global supply chain, insofar as they are mostly subcontractors, involves more downstream integration and consequently more internal integration. This is the reason why customer integration has a high effect on operational performance. Although supplier integration has a significant effect, its size effect is still small (f = 0.083) according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cohen (1988)</ref> comparatively with customer integration and internal integration which have a medium effect (f value are respectively 0-.141 and 0.130). We therefore assume that their integration is also the result of upstream integration's efforts undertaken by the customers themselves. Thus, the supply chain integration is seen as a customer's constraint which involves more internal integration from the manufacturer. This internal integration helps manufacturers to increase supplier integration. The empirical results of our research confirmed the positive and significant association between external integration and internal integration of Moroccan companies which corroborates findings by previous researches <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Yu et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Alfalla-Luque, et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we refer to Zhao, Lynch and Chen (2010), who offer a synthesis of prior research on mediation analysis, to explain the nature of mediation in our research. The authors identified three types of mediation: Complementary mediation: The indirect effect and the direct effect both are significant and point in the same direction; Competitive mediation: The indirect effect and the direct effect both are significant and point in opposite directions and full mediation: The indirect effect is significant but not the direct effect. The results show that both the direct effect and the indirect effect of customer integration on operational performance are significant (the product of the tow effect is positive). The mediation of internal integration is therefore complementary and partial.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hair et al. (2017)</ref>, while providing support for the hypothesized mediating relationship, complementary mediation also provides a cue that another mediator may have been omitted indirect path of which has the same direction as the direct effect. We suppose then that the relationship between external integration and operational performance may be mediated by other factors in the case of manufacturing companies like quality and duration of the relationship between supply chain partners <ref type="bibr">(Prajogo &amp; Olhager, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chang et al., 2016)</ref> national culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chang et al., 2016)</ref> and top management support <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Zhao et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>Our study set out to understand how supply chain integration impacts operational performance of manufacturing firms and how internal integration mediates relationship between external integration and operational performance in the Moroccan context. To do so, supply chain integration was viewed as a set of intra-organizational and inter-organizational capabilities. The internal side of integration was considered as intra-organizational capabilities and the external one was considered as inter-organizational capabilities.</p><p>We used data from 75 Moroccan manufacturing firms in automotive, aerospace, electronics and textile industries and we used Smartpls software to analyze data. It was found that all dimensions of the integration impact positively and significantly the operational performance of these companies and that internal integration mediates only the relationship between customer integration and operational performance.</p><p>These findings contribute to the current supply chain integration literature by extending the empirical results to the Moroccan context and adopting an improved theoretical framework. As suggested by Fabbe-Costes and Jahre (2008) "it is important to return to the theoretical bases "behind" prevailing research. Having an integrated approach also implies being critical and reflective. Strengthening theoretical bases will enhance accuracy in defining concepts and relationships between concepts".</p><p>Like most studies, this study has also some limitations. First of all, the supply chain in our research is considered as a network including customers, manufacturers and suppliers. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carter et al (2015)</ref> suggest that supply chain must be conceptualized as a network that includes also a support supply chain which means other partners through which a product does not flow, but support the physical supply chain of that product (financial institutions, brokers, and truckload transportation).</p><p>Another limitation arises from using subjective measures for measuring operational performance despite the fact that these subjective measures have and continue to be widely used in operations management literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gruber, Heinemann, Brettel &amp; Hungeling, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Rai &amp; Tang, 2010)</ref>. Likewise, we collected data from plant and senior level managers who were expected to be able to have correct information about the variables of the research <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rai, Patnayakuni &amp; Seth, 2006)</ref>. Despite that this method largely used in the literature of supply chain management and has widely been adopted by similar studies, there is some authors suggesting that senior managers may not always have all information on the practices used in their organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Leyer &amp; Moormann, 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, the sample size in our research is relatively small and the effect of its size is also a limitation of this study. Our sample includes only firms of automotive, aerospace electronic and textile industries therefore the results may not be applicable to other manufacturing firms.</p><p>Consequently, further researches may take into account the new theory building of supply chain in order to improve the theoretical framework of supply chain integration and its impact on firm performance. Moreover, since other factors which can mediate relationship between external integration and operational performance exist as we suggested, new further researches are encouraged to integrate other variables as mediating effects. Finally, employing larger samples and relying on multiple-item measures from more than one participant per firm may enhance possibilities of results generalization.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Then we assessed discriminant validity through Fornell-Larcker criterion (Discriminant validity is evident if the square root of AVE of a construct is greater than its correlations with other constructs in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref> and Heterotrait-Monotrait ratio (HTMT), <ref type="bibr">Henseler et al. (2015)</ref> suggest a threshold value of 0.90. Tables <ref type="table">2</ref> and<ref type="table">3</ref> support discriminant validity of our model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Model's Fit and Predictive Capabilities</head><p>After confirming that the construct measures are reliable and valid, we will evaluate in the next step the assessment of the structural model results. These needs examining the model's predictive capabilities and the model's fit.</p><p>Before, we examined the structural model for collinearity through "VIF value". VIF above 5 in the predictor constructs is a critical level of collinearity between construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> shows that all VIF values are below 5.</p><p>Then, R² and path coefficients (β) along with their significance were used for model assessment criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>. We used "bootstrapping" as resampling techniques to evaluate path coefficients and t-statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lee, Petter, Fayard &amp; Robinson, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hair et al. (2011)</ref> pointed out that the larger the number of samples used during the bootstrapping process, the more robust the findings will be. Thus, the bootstrapping process was applied on 1000 samples following the recommendations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hair et al. (2011)</ref>. R² values in the model are equal respectively to 0,674 and 0,749 and they are described as substantial according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hair et al. (2011) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Henseler, Ringle and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Sinkovics (2009)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, we used ƒ² effect size to evaluate the change in the R² value when a specified exogenous construct is omitted from the model. ƒ² values in our model are medium according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cohen (1988)</ref>. Effect size values of less than 0.02 indicate that there is no effect.</p><p>We evaluated the predictive capability of the model by the Stone-Geisser Q2 value <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Geisser, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Stone, 1974)</ref> by using the blindfolding technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>. When Q2 value is larger than zero, the exogenous constructs have predictive relevance for the endogenous constructs included in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Geisser, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Stone, 1974)</ref>. Table <ref type="table">5</ref> shows that Q2' values of model are all above 0. Finally, we used the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), as a criterion model fit measure known from CB-SEM. More recently, <ref type="bibr">Henseler et al., 2014</ref> assessed the efficacy of SRMR as a model fit measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hair, Hult, Ringle &amp; Sarstedt, 2017)</ref> the feature is available in Smartpls. The SRMR is defined as the root mean square discrepancy between the observed correlations and the model-implied correlations. Because the SRMR is an absolute measure of fit, a value of zero indicates perfect fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>. In CB-SEM algorithm, An SRMR value that is less than 0.08 is generally considered a good fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>. Even this threshold is likely too low for PLS-SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>, in our model, SRMR is equal to 0,077 which could be judged as acceptable fit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Hypothesis Testing</head><p>We tested the hypotheses in two blocks. The first examined the direct effect of the three dimensions of integration on firm performance (H1a, H1b and H1c). The second highlighted the mediating effect of internal integration (H3a, H3b) which is supposed to test firstly, relationships between internal integration and both of supplier and customer integration (H2a, H2b). Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> summarizes all path coefficient of structural model. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Direct effect</head><p>The Smartpls bootstrapping process results show that internal integration and customer integration are both positively and significantly associated with operational performance of the manufacturers at p &gt; 0.01 and supplier integration is positively and significantly associated with operational performance at p &gt; 0.05. Thus, H1a, H1b and H1c are all supported. Related to the path coefficients, the effect of customer integration (0.352) is higher than both of internal integration (0.328) and supplier integration effect (0.263). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Mediating Effect</head><p>Mediation occurs when a third mediator variable intervenes between two other related constructs. Testing for the type of mediation in a model requires running a series of analyses. The first step addresses the significance of the indirect effect via the mediator variable. If the indirect effect is not significant we conclude that there is no mediating effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The mediating effect of internal integration supposes firstly a positive and significant relationship with both of customer and supplier integration. Table <ref type="table">5</ref> confirms that internal integration is positively and significantly associated with customer integration and supplier integration (at p &gt; 0.01). Consequently, H2a and H2b are all supported.</p><p>Then, we followed the testing procedures of <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</ref> to test the hypothesis of the mediating effect. According to these authors the mediating effect supposes that the indirect effect must be significant and the confidence interval must not contain zero.</p><p>We used Smartpls bootstrapping to calculate the specific indirect effects. Table <ref type="table">6</ref> shows that only specific indirect effects of customer integration is significant confidence intervals does not contain zero. The specific indirect effect of customer integration is significant at p &gt; 0.05 and specific indirect effect of supplier integration is not significant. Thus, internal integration mediates relationship between customer integration and operational performance and supplier integration and operational performance. Thus, H3a is supported and H3b is not supported. </p></div>
