<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Selectively attending to relevant information while blocking out distractors is crucial for goal-directed behavior, yet with advancing age, deficits emerge in attentional selectivity. Decrements in attention have been associated with altered noradrenergic activity in animals. However, research linking noradrenergic functioning to attention in aging humans is scarce, likely reflecting long-standing methodological challenges in noninvasive assessments. We studied whether age-related differences in the noradrenergic system predict differences in attention. We measured pupil dilation, a noninvasive marker of arousalrelated norepinephrine (NE) release, while concurrently recording the EEG of male younger (N = 39; 25.2 6 3.2 years) and older adults (N = 38; 70.6 6 2.7 years). Arousal was modulated on a trial-by-trial basis using fear-conditioned (CS 1 ) stimuli. During conditioning, pupil and EEG markers related to heightened arousal were identified. Afterward, in a dichotic listening task, participants were cued to direct attention to either the left or right ear while highly similar syllable pairs were presented simultaneously to both ears. During the dichotic listening task, presentation of fear-conditioned stimuli reinstated the acquired arousal response, as reflected in pupil and EEG a-b band responses. Critically, pupil dilation to CS 1 was correlated with stronger EEG a-b desynchronization, suggesting a common dependence on NE release. On a behavioral level, stronger arousal reactions were associated with better attention. In particular, structural equation modeling revealed that the responsiveness of the NE system is associated with attention on a latent construct level, measured by several indicator tasks. Overall, our results suggest that the responsiveness of the NE system supports attention across the lifespan.</p></div>

Impaired attentional selection in aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kennedy and Mather, 2019)</ref> has been linked to deficient neuromodulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Li et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bäckman et al., 2006)</ref>. The neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) is strongly implicated in attentional processes that facilitate the processing of relevant information <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Berridge and Waterhouse, 2003)</ref>. First, increased NE release is associated with the transition to, and the maintenance of, an activated cortical and behavioral state, as evident in a desynchronized (high-frequency, low-amplitude) EEG and alert waking (sometimes termed arousal) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Carter et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">McGinley et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Neves et al., 2018)</ref>. In the waking state, fast, burst-like (phasic) and slow, rhythmic (tonic) firing patterns of the locus coeruleus (LC), the primary cortical NE source, have been tied to focused attention and distractibility, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005)</ref>. Further, a series of pharmacological and lesion studies demonstrated that, via actions at a 2Aadrenoceptors in the PFC, NE facilitates top-down selective attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Robbins and Arnsten, 2009)</ref>. In the sensory cortices, phasic NE release interacts with local glutamate levels to allow the selective processing of currently relevant representations, mediated via a 2A -and ß-adrenoceptors <ref type="bibr">(Mather et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gelbard-Sagiv et al., 2018)</ref>. Finally, NE has been linked to the reorienting and switching of attention via disruption of the dorsal and activation of the ventral attention network <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bouret and Sara, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Corbetta et al., 2008)</ref>. In line with these links between NE and attention, recent theories of both healthy <ref type="bibr">(Mather and Harley, 2016)</ref> and pathologic <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Weinshenker, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Satoh and Iijima, 2019)</ref> cognitive aging have proposed a prominent role of the LC-NE system in late-life cognition. However, LC's anatomic location in the brainstem, adjacent to the ventricular system, and its widespread, unmyelinated axons expose it to blood-and CSFbound toxins, making it vulnerable to neurodegeneration <ref type="bibr">(Mather and Harley, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Liu et al., 2019)</ref>, with potentially wide-ranging consequences. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Wilson et al. (2013)</ref> reported an association between LC's structural integrity, as assessed postmortem via autopsy, and longitudinal cognitive decline in aging (compare <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hämmerer et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Betts et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dahl et al., 2019b)</ref>. However, the question of how LC's functional characteristics (i.e., its capacity to respond to behaviorally relevant information) are linked to attention in aging humans is still unresolved. Long-standing technical challenges in the noninvasive assessment of LC-NE activity in vivo (compare <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Astafiev et al., 2010)</ref> have contributed to this lack of information. However, recently, multiple independent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Joshi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Reimer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Breton-Provencher and Sur, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Zerbi et al., 2019)</ref> demonstrated that pupil dilation in the absence of interfering visual input serves as valid, noninvasive proxy for LC activity. In addition, use of optogenetics established a causal link between phasic LC activity and event-related EEG responses (i.e., P300 event-related potential <ref type="bibr">[ERP]</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Vazey et al., 2018)</ref>. Moreover, EEG reveals fluctuations in cortical states (i.e., global EEG de/activation as reflected in a de/synchronized EEG) that have been associated with LC activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(McCormick et al., 1991)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, we thus used a multimodal assessment to evaluate individual differences in selective attention among younger adults (YA) and older adults (OA) and their dependence on functional characteristics of the LC-NE system. In order to experimentally induce LC activity, we made use of LC-NE's wellestablished role in fear processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Szabadi, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Uematsu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Lee et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Likhtik and Johansen, 2019)</ref>. We hypothesized that the functional capacity of the LC-NE system, as assessed by simultaneous, interrelated pupil and EEG responses, would be closely associated with individual differences in selective attention. In sum, the overall goal of this study was to extend our knowledge about the role of the LC-NE system in human cognitive aging by generating a multimodal, noninvasive index of LC functioning and linking it to attention abilities in YA and OA.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p>Data were collected within the framework of a larger study investigating the interplay of neurophysiological indices of LC-NE activity and their association with selective attention in YA and OA. Only aspects of the study that are relevant to the current analyses are introduced in detail below.</p><p>Participants were invited on 3 successive days (days 1-3) for individual assessments that spanned ;4 h on day 1 and day 2 and 2 h on day 3. Time of assessment (morning, afternoon, evening) was kept constant across sessions within participants.</p><p>In short, on the first day, participants completed a neuropsychological selective attention battery as well as an assessment of fear conditionability (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) while pupil dilation was recorded. To adapt auditory stimuli during later attention assessments for hearing thresholds, we assessed hearing acuity (on day 1 for YA and on a separate occasion preceding day 1 for OA). On the second day, we concurrently recorded pupil dilation and EEG while participants underwent another fear conditioning session and an in-depth evaluation of their auditory-selective attention performance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). The last day comprised a final fear conditioning session while recording pupil dilation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) and an MRI assessment (compare <ref type="bibr">Dahl et al., 2019b)</ref>. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the German Psychological Association and was conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Forty-one YA participated in the study. Two of these (4.88%; aged: 24.59 and 29.02 years) were not reinvited after day 1 due to low-quality eyetracking data, reducing the final sample to 39 YA (mean 6 SD age: 25.23 6 3.23 years; range: 20.17-31 years; 100% male). In addition, 38 OA took part in the experiments (age: 70.61 6 2.71 years; range: 65.50-75.92 years; 100% male). All participants were healthy, MRI-compatible, right-handed, fluent German speakers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision who provided written informed consent and were reimbursed for participation. Intake of centrally active drugs, and in particular medication directly influencing the LC-NE system (e.g., b -blockers), precluded participation. The current study only tested male subjects due to our pilot data demonstrating reliable sex differences in the stimulation intensity participants selected for the fear conditioning sessions. Previous research indicates sex differences in the capability to learn and maintain fear responses during conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Merz et al., 2018</ref>; but for evidence for sex-specific expressions of fear learning, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gruene et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Voulo and Parsons, 2017)</ref>. Some of these differences in fear learning may be associated with sex differences in the LC-NE system <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bangasser et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Mulvey et al., 2018)</ref>. To limit the number of control variables, we decided to test male participants; however, we would like to underscore the necessity to follow-up on the reported findings, including both sexes. Descriptive characteristics of the two age groups are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Both groups showed comparable educational levels and did not differ reliably on a brief dementia screening <ref type="bibr">(Mini Mental State Examination;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Folstein et al., 1975)</ref>. All participants scored above the commonly used Mini Mental State Examination cutoff of 26 points. In line with previous reports (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Passow et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Passow et al., , 2014))</ref>, OA demonstrated higher scores on a test of verbal knowledge (Spot a Word; <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Lehrl, 1977)</ref> and increased age-related hearing loss. On average, OA selected higher intensities as unpleasant unconditioned stimulus (US) for the fear conditioning procedure, presumably reflecting age-related differences in skin conductivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chamberlin et al., 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental procedures and stimuli</head><p>Neuropsychological attention assessment. On the first day of the experiment, participants completed a multimodal, standardized neuropsychological attention assessment comprising the D2 test of attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brickenkamp and Zillmer, 1998)</ref>, Digit-Symbol-Substitution Test (DSST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Wechsler, 1981)</ref>, and auditory Digit Sorting Task (DST) (compare <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kray and Lindenberger, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>The D2 test is a paper-and-pencil cancellation task asking participants to cross out any letter d with two marks ('') around, above, or below it from a stream of highly similar surrounding distractors (e.g., p with two marks or d with only one mark). Participants were granted 20 s to complete each of a total of 12 lists of items. The difference between processed items and committed errors (errors of omission and errors of commission) across lists was taken as a measure of attention.</p><p>During the DSST, participants were presented with a list of digitsymbol pairs (e.g., 1: -; 2: ?; [...] 9: =) along with a list of digits.</p><p>Participants were asked to write down the corresponding symbol under each digit as quickly and accurately as possible. The number of correctly copied symbols within 90 s was taken as an index of attention.</p><p>In the auditory DST, we auditorily presented participants with a stream of numbers (e.g., 2-7-5) ranging from 3 to 8 digits. Participants then had to write down the numbers sorted according to numerosity (e.g., 2-5-7). The sum of correctly reported answers across all trials was taken as a measure of attention.</p><p>Fear conditioning. To experimentally activate the LC-NE system <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Rasmussen and Jacobs, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Szabadi, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Uematsu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Likhtik and Johansen, 2019)</ref> on each assessment day (days 1-3), participants completed a brief fear conditioning session in which they learned the association between a visual stimulus and an aversive electrical shock (compare <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Lee et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fig. 1a)</ref>. During this phase, either a horizontal or vertical sinusoidal luminance pattern (i.e., Gabor patch; CS 1 ) was paired with a US (shock). The other pattern was never paired with the US and served as perceptually matched control stimulus (CS -); the association between pattern orientation (horizontal/vertical) and shock was kept constant within subject across days and was counterbalanced within age groups <ref type="bibr">(YA: 21:18;</ref><ref type="bibr">OA: 20:18)</ref>. This design guaranteed a matched luminance of CS 1 and CS -, whereas the former acquired the behavioral relevance to stimulate LC-NE activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Szabadi, 2012)</ref>. Each conditioning session comprised 40 trials, which started with a central white fixation cross on a black background (baseline; 1 s), followed by the visual stimulus (2 s; CS 1 or CS -; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). After offset of the visual stimulus, the shock was applied in CS 1 trials for 0.5 s with a 80% reinforcement schedule (i.e., 0 s trace conditioning) using a ring electrode connected to a bipolar current stimulator (DS5; Digimeter) that was taped either to participants' left or right index finger (hand assignment was constant within subject across days and counterbalanced within age groups: YA: 19:20; OA: 19:19). The intertrial interval (ITI; white fixation cross) was set to 6 s to allow sufficient time for the pupil to return to baseline in CS 1 trials (compare <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Lee et al., 2018)</ref>. The conditioning phase consisted of 20 CS 1 and 20 CS -trials that were presented in pseudorandomized order. After half of the trials, participants had a self-paced break during which they were asked to indicate which of the two visual stimuli (horizontal; vertical) was paired with the shock and how many shocks were delivered (i.e., manipulation check). On each day, before the experiment, participants individually selected an intensity for the US, which they perceived as unpleasant but not painful (compare <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Lee et al., 2018</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). During all conditioning sessions, gaze position and pupil dilation were recorded, interfering sensory input was minimized and central fixation was enforced (see below).</p><p>During data collection, for one OA, assignment of Gabor patch orientation (horizontal/vertical) to CS condition (CS -/CS 1 ) was switched  between the first and second day of assessment. Since this error worked against finding a reliable difference in responses to CS -and CS 1 , we decided not to exclude this subject. Dichotic listening task. On the second assessment day, we probed selective auditory attention by cueing participants to focus attention to either the left (focus left condition <ref type="bibr">[FL]</ref>) or right (focus right condition [FR]) ear while highly similar consonant-vowel syllable pairs were presented dichotically (i.e., simultaneously one stimulus to the left and one to the right ear). Only syllables played to the cued ear should be reported, whereas distractor stimuli should be ignored. To indicate their response, after a brief delay, participants selected the target syllable from three visually displayed response options (including the target, distractor, and one highly similar novel, i.e., not presented, syllable; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</p><p>Within attentional conditions (FL and FR), we manipulated participants' arousal level on a trial-by-trial basis. In particular, each trial started with a central white fixation cross on a black background (baseline; 1 s), followed by one of the conditioned stimuli (2 s; CS 1 or CS -). After offset of the CS, a letter was centrally displayed cuing participants to adapt their attentional focus (2 s; L for FL; R for FR). Next, a syllable pair was presented dichotically for 0.5 s. After a delay of 0.5 s, a recognition matrix (containing the target, distractor, and one novel syllable) was visually displayed for up to 3 s and participants indicated by button press which syllable they heard in the cued ear. Response hand assignment was counterbalanced within age groups (YA: 20:19; OA: 19:19; shocks were never applied to the response hand). The ITI was set to 0.5 s and consisted of a white fixation cross. Matched trial timing between fear conditioning and dichotic listening tasks (1 s baseline; 2 s CS; ;6 s until next trial) allows a comparison of arousal responses across both tasks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Twelve consonant-vowel syllable pairs consisting of syllables of voiced (/b/,/d/,/g/) or unvoiced (/p/,/t/,/k/) consonants combined with the vowel /a/ served as auditory stimuli in the dichotic listening task. Each pair contained two syllables with the same voicing that were matched for onset times <ref type="bibr">(compare Hugdahl et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Westerhausen et al., 2009)</ref>. To account for age-related hearing loss, syllable pairs were presented at an individually adjusted volume (i.e., 65 dB above participant's average hearing threshold between 250 and 3000 Hz as assessed by means of pure-tone audiometry; compare <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Passow et al., 2014)</ref>. All 12 dichotic syllable pairs were presented six times in each of the attention and arousal conditions, summing to 288 trials in total (i.e., 12 syllable pairs Â 6 presentations Â 2 attentional focus Â 2 arousal conditions) that were split in blocks of 48 trials. In 8.33% of the trials, no CS (CS 1 ; CS -) was displayed (no-CS trials; n = 24), with a fixation cross instead occurring at that time point to obtain an index of auditory attention regardless of CS presentation. In another 8.33% of the trials, the CS 1 was followed by an electrical shock (booster trials; compare fear conditioning phase; n = 24; compare <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Lee et al., 2018)</ref> to prevent extinction of the conditioned response. No-CS and booster trials were excluded from analyses. After each block, participants had a self-paced break during which their average accuracy was displayed graphically. Breaks were followed by a brief reconditioning period of 20 trials that resembled one-half of the fear conditioning phase (presented in pseudorandomized order) to maintain the fear response throughout the experiment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</p><p>To thoroughly familiarize participants with both the auditory material and the instructions before testing, on the first assessment day, we presented the six syllables first diotically (i.e., the same syllable at the same time to the left and right ear; 24 trials) followed by a presentation to only one ear (6 left and 6 right ear trials). Participants indicated by button press which syllable they heard/on which ear (mean 6 SEM accuracy: 94.801 6 0.983%). In addition, participants completed a dichotic listening task without arousal manipulation (96 trials; accuracy: 46.749 6 0.010%; chance performance in this task is 33.3%, i.e., one of three possible choices).</p><p>All stimuli were presented using Psychtoolbox (Psychophysics Toolbox; RRID:SCR_002881) for MATLAB (The MathWorks; RRID: SCR_001622) and insert earphones (ER 3A; Etymotic Research). During the fear conditioning and dichotic listening task, gaze position, pupil dilation, and the EEG (day 2 only) were continuously recorded (see below). To minimize the influence of sensory input on pupil dilation, testing took place in a dark, sound-attenuated, and electromagnetically shielded room <ref type="bibr">(compare Hong et al., 2014)</ref>. Further, to minimize the influence of eye movements on pupil dilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gagl et al., 2011)</ref> at the beginning of each trial (baseline period) participant's gaze position was sampled online and the trial only started if central fixation was either maintained (.75% of the time) or restored on presentation of a re-fixation target.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral analyses</head><p>Dichotic listening task. To evaluate age differences in auditory selective attention, we calculated the auditory laterality index (LI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Marshall et al., 1975)</ref>, for each attentional focus condition (FL, FR), collapsing across arousal conditions. This index expresses the amount of right relative to left ear responses (i.e., LI = [rightleft]/[right 1 left]). The LI ranges from -1 to 1, whereby negative values indicate more left ear responses and positive values index a tendency toward selecting the right ear syllable. The Younger and older adults' LIs were analyzed in a two-factorial (age group Â attentional focus <ref type="bibr">[FL, FR]</ref>) mixed-measures ANOVA that was followed-up by post hoc tests within age groups. To judge the influence of age-related hearing loss on auditory-selective attention, in a second ANOVA (age group Â attentional focus), we included participants' average hearing loss as a covariate. For further analyses, the difference between LIs for the FL and FR condition was calculated to provide an overall measure of participants' auditory-selective attention ability.</p><p>General attention. To obtain a single measure for general attention performance (i.e., independent of the specific task used), we made use of the comprehensive cognitive battery available for this dataset. In particular, we integrated performance across multiple visual and auditory attention tasks (i.e., dichotic listening task; D2 test of attention; DSST; auditory DST) by means of a structural equation modeling approach (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>, bottom) using the Vnyx 1.0-1013 software package <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(von Oertzen et al., 2015)</ref> with full information maximum likelihood estimation. Structural equation modeling offers a multivariate approach in which observed (manifest) variables can be used to examine hypotheses about unobserved (latent) variables. Latent variables have the benefit of accounting for measurement error in observed scores and thereby increasing statistical power <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Curran et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kievit et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In particular, in each age group, standardized performance in the dichotic listening task, D2 test of attention, DSST, and DST served as manifest variables and loaded on a single latent selective attention factor (i.e., a multiple-group model). Factor loadings (other than the first, which was fixed to 1) were estimated freely but were constrained to be equal across groups. The model demonstrated metric factorial invariance (i.e., it required variant manifest intercepts and variances across groups) and thus precluded an interpretation of age group differences in the means of the latent factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Meredith and Teresi, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Schwab and Helm, 2015)</ref>. We assessed the adequacy of the proposed selective attention model by testing for differences between the model-implied and empirically observed covariance matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Eid et al., 2015)</ref>. The x 2 test formally tests for equity of the covariance matrices. However, since it is particularly sensitive to sample size, it should be interpreted with caution in large samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brown, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Eid et al., 2015)</ref>. We thus additionally examined two frequently reported fit indices: (1) the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), which is a closeness-of-fit coefficient expressing how much the postulated model approaches the true model; and (2) the comparative fit index (CFI), an incremental fit index, which compares the goodness of fit of the proposed model with a more restrictive nested baseline model (Brown, 2006; Curran et al., 2010; Eid et al., 2015). In contrast to the x 2 test, the RMSEA and CFI are not influenced by sample size. RMSEA values close to ,0.06 and CFI values of close to !0.95 indicate good model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brown, 2006)</ref>. After establishing model fit, differences in parameters of interest were tested by fixing parameters to zero and comparing model fit to a model in which parameters were freely estimated using a likelihood ratio difference test <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Curran et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Eid et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Physiologic data recording and preprocessing Pupil dilation.

A forehead and chin rest 53.5 cm from the computer screen was used to minimize participants' head movements during measurements. Participants were instructed to maintain central fixation throughout all experiments, and compliance with this instruction was enforced at the beginning of every trial. Each experiment started with a (re)calibration of the eye-tracking system using a standard 5 point grid. During (re)calibration, fixation errors were kept , 0.5°.</p><p>For synchronous, integrated analysis of eye-tracking and EEG data, we used the Eye-EEG toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dimigen et al., 2011)</ref>, an extension for the open-source MATLAB toolbox EEGLab (RRID:SCR_007292; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Delorme and Makeig, 2004)</ref> as well as the FieldTrip toolbox (RRID:SCR_004849; <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Oostenveld et al., 2011)</ref>. Eye-tracking data of the re/conditioning and dichotic listening sessions were resampled to 500 Hz and segmented in bins of 8.5 s (i.e., -1.5 to 7 s with respect to CS onset). Time segments contaminated by blinks or excessive eye movements were automatically detected and imputed using custom-written MATLAB code. In particular, segments falling .3 SDs below a participant's median pupil dilation (calculated across the whole experiment) were considered as blink or partly occluded pupil. Further, periods with excessive eye movements, as indicated by z-scored vertical gaze channel values .3 (computed across the whole experiment), were considered artifacts. All artifacts were padded by 6 50 samples to account for biased pupil estimates shortly before/after artifacts (compare de <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gee et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Excluding detected artifacts, we computed the average event-related pupil response (ERPR) for each trial category (i.e., CS 1 ; CS -; separately for fear re/conditioning and dichotic listening data; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). In all trials, artifact-containing segments were then replaced by the corresponding time segments of the demeaned average response centered at the given trial. Because of technical issues, no pupil data were available for one YA for fear conditioning on day 2 and one OA for fear conditioning on day 3 and the dichotic listening task (day 2).</p><p>Notably, we performed a set of control analyses that included a linear interpolation of missing pupil samples (compare de Gee et al., 2014) instead of the mean imputation approach described above. Importantly, regardless of the preprocessing pipeline, qualitatively similar results are obtained on the group level.</p><p>EEG. To evaluate neural responses during re/conditioning and dichotic listening (compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), we recorded the EEG. Data were continuously sampled from 61 Ag/AgCl electrodes embedded in an elastic cap that were placed according to the 10-10 system using BrainVision Recorder (BrainAmp DC amplifiers, Brain Products, Braincap, and BrainVision, respectively). An electrode above the forehead (AFz) served as ground. Three additional electrodes were placed next to each eye and below the left eye to acquire horizontal and vertical electro-oculograms. Data were sampled at 1000 Hz in a bandwidth between 0.1 and 250 Hz and online-referenced to the right mastoid while the left mastoid was recorded as an additional channel. During EEG preparation, electrode impedances were kept ,5 kX.</p><p>EEG data processing was performed by means of the Eye-EEG <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dimigen et al., 2011)</ref>, EEGLab <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Delorme and Makeig, 2004)</ref>, and FieldTrip <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Oostenveld et al., 2011)</ref> toolboxes in addition to custom-written MATLAB code. For analyses, data were demeaned, rereferenced to mathematically linked mastoids, downsampled to 500 Hz, and bandpass-filtered (0.2-125 Hz; fourth-order Butterworth). A multistep procedure was applied to purge data of artifacts: First, data were visually screened for periods of excessive muscle activity; and subsequently, independent component analysis was used to identify and remove components related to eye, muscle, and cardiac activity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Jung et al., 2000)</ref>. Next, data were segmented in 8.5 s epochs (-1.5 and 7 s with respect to stimulus onset) and submitted to a fully automatic thresholding approach for artifact rejection (compare <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Nolan et al., 2010)</ref>. Excluded channels were interpolated with spherical splines <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Perrin et al., 1989)</ref>. Finally, remaining trials were again visually screened to determine successful cleaning. During preprocessing, on average, 36.271 6 1.667% of trials were excluded from further analyses.</p><p>Time-varying power information for each trial and electrode was then extracted by convolution of the cleaned time domain signal with a series of Morlet wavelets with a length of seven cycles <ref type="bibr">(compare Herrmann et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Werkle-Bergner et al., 2009)</ref>. Time-varying power estimates were computed for frequencies between 1 and 40 Hz (in steps of 1 Hz) in a time window between -1.5 to 7 s with respect to stimulus onset (time bins of 4 ms), separately for CS 1 and CS -trials of the reconditioning and dichotic listening phases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physiologic data analyses</head><p>Within modality within-subject statistics (first level). Within younger and older subjects, we contrasted arousing (CS 1 ) and neutral control trials (CS -) by means of independent-samples t tests to isolate arousal-associated response patterns. Contrasts were computed for time domain pupil data (i.e., ERPR), time domain EEG data (i.e., ERP), and time-frequency domain EEG data (i.e., event-related desynchronization [ERD]). To counteract potential unequal distribution of CS 1 and CS -trials (e.g., more artifacts in arousing trials), we iteratively selected random, equal-sized subsets of the available trials using a bootstrapping procedure (n bootstraps = 50 iterations; n SelectedTrials = lowest trial number across conditions -1). The mean t value over the 50 bootstraps served as final first-level test statistic that was passed on to the second level (see below). First-level statistics were computed within subjects for conditioning (separately for each day [days 1-3]; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), reconditioning, and dichotic listening trials. While the contrast (CS 1 vs CS -) remained the same across these analyses, during re/ conditioning, participants received electrical stimulation (US); thus, the observed responses may represent a mixture of fear and somatosensory responses. In contrast, during the dichotic listening task, no shocks were applied; thus, observed arousal responses (CS 1 vs CS -) indicate the reinstatement of the fear response (compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</p><p>Notably, the CS 1 versus CS -first-level t maps express the difference in pupil and EEG responses to arousing and nonarousing stimuli. That is, in the strict sense of the word, they do not constitute an ERPR/ERP/ ERD, but rather the standardized difference between two pupil/EEG responses. However, to ease readability, we use the terms ERPR, ERP, and ERD also for these contrasts.</p><p>Within-modality group statistics (second level). For analyses on the group level, we contrasted first-level t maps (i.e., CS 1 vs CS -) against zero to identify neural correlates associated with the arousal manipulation in conditioning and reconditioning trials (compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) that were shared across subjects in each group. Analyses were run separately for each day, first across all subjects (YA and OA) and then within YA and OA for all modalities (ERPR, ERP, and ERD data). In particular, we calculated nonparametric, cluster-based, random permutation tests as implemented in the FieldTrip toolbox that effectively control the false alarm rate in case of multiple testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Maris and Oostenveld, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Oostenveld et al., 2011)</ref>. The same statistical procedure was applied to 2D (i.e., channel Â time) and 3D (i.e., channel Â frequency Â time) data. That is, ERPR, ERP, and ERD were analyzed in the same manner. Here, however, only the approach for 3D data (ERD) is described to ease readability. In short, first, a two-sided, dependent-samples t test was calculated for each spatio-spectral-temporal (channel Â frequency Â time) sample. Neighboring samples with a p value ,0.05 were grouped with spatially, spectrally, and temporally adjacent samples to form a cluster. The sum of all t values within a cluster formed the respective test statistic (t sum ). A reference distribution for the summed cluster-level t values was computed via the Monte Carlo method. Specifically, in each of 1000 repetitions, group membership was randomly assigned, a t test computed, and the t value summed for each cluster. Observed clusters whose test statistic exceeded the 97.5th percentile for its respective reference probability distribution were considered significant.</p><p>On a group level, cluster statistics revealed reliable arousal effects during conditioning and reconditioning within all modalities (ERPR, ERP, and ERD). To evaluate a potential reinstatement of these fear responses also during the dichotic listening task (in which no shocks were applied anymore; compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), each subject's first-level (CS 1 vs CS -) dichotic listening data were averaged across spatio-spectral-temporal samples, which reached significance on a group level during the reconditioning period. That is, we applied the observed reconditioning fear response (i.e., significant cluster) as a search space to evaluate its reinstatement within the dichotic listening data. This approach yielded a single reinstatement value for each subject for each modality (i.e., ERPR, ERP, and ERD data). Within modalities, the reliability of the reinstatement was then determined by means of nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank (W) tests (across and within age groups).</p><p>To judge the temporal stability of fear-conditioned pupil responses (ERPR) over assessment days (days 1-3; compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), in addition, each subject's first-level (CS 1 vs CS -) conditioning and reconditioning ERPR data were averaged across time points, which reached significance on a group level (i.e., second-level statistic for the respective day). This yielded a single ERPR value for each subject for each conditioning session (days 1-3) and the reconditioning phase (day 2). We then used intraclass correlations (two-way mixed; consistency) to evaluate the temporal stability of participants' fear-conditioned pupil dilation.</p><p>Cross-modality group statistics. To determine whether EEG correlates of the arousal manipulation (i.e., ERP, ERD) were linked to the LC-NE system, we correlated participants' EEG responses with their pupil dilation, a proxy of noradrenergic activity, across age groups. We assessed this association within the dichotic listening data, since this provides an estimate of the reinstatement of the fear response regardless of potential somatosensory artifacts related to the reinforcement (US; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In particular, participants' first-level EEG t maps (CS 1 vs CS -) were correlated with participants' average pupil reinstatement (see within modality group statistics) in a nonparametric, cluster-based, random permutation framework as implemented in the FieldTrip toolbox. Analyses were run separately for ERP and ERD data; however, here only the approach for time-frequency data (ERD) is described to ease readability. For each spatio-spectral-temporal sample, a two-sided Pearson's correlation between the EEG and the pupil reinstatement data were calculated. As done for the within-modality statistics, neighboring samples with a p value ,0.05 were grouped with spatially, spectrally, and temporally adjacent samples to form a cluster. The sum of all r values within a cluster formed the respective test statistic. A reference distribution for the summed cluster-level r values was computed via the Monte Carlo method. In particular, the null hypothesis of statistical independence between EEG and pupil data was tested by randomly permuting pupil estimates between subjects over 1000 repetitions. For each repetition, a correlation was computed, and r values were summed for each cluster. Observed clusters whose test statistic exceeded the 97.5th percentile for its respective reference probability distribution were considered significant. To specifically target reinstatement responses, we restricted the cross-modality analyses to EEG samples that showed a reliable arousal effect (i.e., were part of significant clusters in the second-level reconditioning analyses). However, analyses were performed solely on reinstatement data (i.e., dichotic listening ERPR, ERP, and ERD data; compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Cross-modality structural equation model. Cluster-correlation analyses revealed reliable associations between EEG and pupil reinstatement for both ERP and ERD data, suggesting a common underlying pupil-EEG factor. For each subject, we thus extracted and averaged those samples of the EEG reinstatement response that showed a reliable link to pupil reinstatement. This returned a single pupil-associated reinstatement estimate for ERP and ERD data, respectively. As for the behavioral data, we then used a structural equation modeling approach to integrate over the interrelated indicators of the arousal response (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10,</ref><ref type="figure">top</ref>). In particular, in YA and OA, standardized pupil reinstatement and pupil-associated EEG reinstatement estimates served as manifest variables and loaded on a single, latent NE responsiveness factor (i.e., a multiple-group model). Factor loadings (other than the first, which was fixed to 1) were estimated freely but were constrained to be equal across groups. The model demonstrated strict factorial invariance (i.e., showed invariant manifest intercepts and variances across groups) and thus allowed an interpretation of age group differences in the means of the latent factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Meredith and Teresi, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Schwab and Helm, 2015)</ref>. We evaluated age differences in latent NE responsiveness by means of Spearman correlations (across age groups). Adequacy of the proposed model was assessed using a x 2 test as well as two additional fit indices (RMSEA, CFI; see above).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses of associations between physiological and behavioral data</head><p>After generating structural equation models for our cognitive and physiological measures, respectively, we set out to link both modalities. That is, we were interested in assessing the relation between interindividual differences in attention and interindividual differences in NE responsiveness. For this, we first built a unified model merging the attention and responsiveness models described above (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10</ref>). We then investigated associations between cognitive and physiological factors by allowing for freely estimated covariances on a latent level (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10,</ref><ref type="figure">yellow</ref>).

In addition to these poststimulus predictors, we also included a prestimulus baseline factor (-1 to 0 s) for the pupil and EEG data. For the EEG data, baseline samples were restricted to those electrodes and frequencies that were part of the poststimulus cluster.</p><p>The extracted physiological data were first used to predict each trial's accuracy (target/distractor selected, i.e., a binomially distributed response). Outlier trials with z scores .3 or ,-3 were excluded from the analyses. Further, trials in which no response was given or a novel, not presented syllable was picked were also dropped (overall, 12.226% of all trials were excluded, leaving 13,331 trials for analyses).</p><p>In addition to physiological factors, age group and trial condition (CS type [CS 1 , CS -], attentional focus condition [FL, FR]) were added as additional fixed effects. Beyond main effects of physiological factors and trial condition, we allowed for interactions between arousal condition (i.e., CS 1 , CS -) and the phasic physiological responses. Individual performance differences were modeled as random effects of intercept grouped by individual participant (ID).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impaired selective attention in older adults</head><p>Participants demonstrated successful auditory selective attention in the dichotic listening task as indicated by a two-factorial mixed-measures ANOVA (age group Â attentional focus; main effect of attentional focus: F (1,75) = 26.413, p , 0.001, h 2 = 0.260).</p><p>Post hoc analyses within YA and OA demonstrated that both groups were able to exert auditory-selective attention (one-factorial repeated measures ANOVA; main effect of attentional focus: for YA F (1,38) = 22.803, p , 0.001, h 2 = 0.375; for OA F (1,37) = 5.702, p = 0.022, h 2 = 0.134). YA and OA, however, differed reliably in their ability to modulate their attentional focus. While the age group main effect was not significant (F (1,75) = 0.087, p = 0.769, h 2 = 0.001), we observed a reliable age group Â attentional focus interaction (F (1,75) = 16.318, p , 0.001, h 2 = 0.179; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), indicating impaired selective attention in old age. Here a main effect of age (e.g., lower LI in OA compared with YA) would indicate better performance in one attentional focus condition (e.g., FL) and worse performance in the other (e.g., FR; compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The observed age group Â attentional focus interaction in contrast reveals worse performance in OA in both conditions (i.e., lower LI values in the FR condition [YA: 0.247 6 0.035; OA: 0.097 6 0.036]; higher LI values in the FL condition [YA: -0.070 6 0.039; OA: 0.058 6 0.033]; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p><p>Post hoc analyses indicated that age differences in auditory selective attention were not explained by age-related differences in hearing loss (i.e., age group Â attentional focus mixed-measures ANOVA, including hearing loss as covariate: age group Â attentional focus: F (1,74) = 4.862, p = 0.031, h 2 = 0.062; hearing loss Â attentional focus: F (1,74) = 0.740, p = 0.393, h 2 = 0.010). Similarly, control analyses indicated that age differences in auditory selective attention persisted after including interaural threshold differences in the model (i.e., age group Â attentional focus mixed-measures ANOVA, including interaural threshold differences as covariate: age group Â attentional focus: F (1,71) = 16.143, p , 0.001, h 2 = 0.185; interaural threshold Â attentional focus: F (1,71) = 0.462, p = 0.499, h 2 = 0.006). We replicated this finding of impaired selective attention in aging across multiple visual and auditory attention tasks using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests (all p , 0.05; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). In order to later reliably relate attention performance to physiological indices of the LC-NE system (see below), we integrated performance over tasks to derive a single measure reflecting general attention performance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10,</ref><ref type="figure">bottom</ref>). The proposed model fit the data well (x 2 = 9.827, df = 23; RMSEA = 0.0; CFI = 1.594; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Brown, 2006)</ref>. The variances of the attention factors differed reliably from zero in both age group (all Dx 2 ! 11.225, Ddf = 1, all p , 0.001), indicating interindividual differences in attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stable fear-conditioned pupil dilation in younger adults and older adults</head><p>In the conditioning and reconditioning phases of the assessment (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), YA and OA demonstrated a reliable, multimodal response to the arousal manipulation. In the following, first modality-specific results are reported (i.e., pupil dilation and EEG) before detailing their interrelation.</p><p>During fear conditioning and reconditioning, conditioned stimuli (CS 1 vs CS -) reliably elicited pupil dilation over prolonged time windows as revealed by cluster permutation analyses (both across and within age groups; all p corr , 0.01; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p><p>Fear-conditioned pupil responses demonstrated a moderate to high stability across assessments (days 1-3) as indicated by intraclass correlations (two-way mixed; consistency; intraclass correlation [95% CI] = 0.652 [0.502-0.766]; p , 0.001). In line with pupil dilation as a noninvasive marker of LC activity, this points to a stable phasic activation of the NE system by fear-conditioned stimuli (and US) across age groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reinstatement of pupil dilation in younger adults</head><p>In the absence of reinforcements (US), fear-conditioned stimuli maintained their arousing nature and led to a marginally significant reinstatement of pupil dilation across groups (W(76) = 1839; Z = 1.948; p = 0.052). While YA demonstrated a robust reinstatement effect, in OA reinstatement did not reach statistical significance on a group level (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>; YA: W(39) = 586; Z = 2.735; p = 0.006; OA: W(37) = 364; Z = 0.189; p = 0.850). The lack of pupil reinstatement in OA presumably reflects age-related difficulties in triggering and maintaining self-initiated processing (i.e., reinstatement; Lindenberger and Mayr, 2014) in line with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(van Gerven et al., 2004)</ref>. By contrast, age differences are known to be reduced or even disappear when OA can rely on external information (e.g., reminders), such as the reinforcements (US) during re/conditioning. The age difference in the reinstatement of pupil dilation approached statistical significance (YA vs OA: U(76) = 1671; Z = 1.756; p = 0.079). Since the reinstatement of pupil dilation occurs in the absence of somatosensory stimulation and associated artifacts, it is attributed to the arousal response following the reactivation of the fear memory. We thus interpret the reinstatement of the fear-induced pupil response as indicator of the effectiveness of the LC-NE system in modulating memory, which trends to be reduced in aging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fear-conditioned parietal ERPs in younger adults and older adults</head><p>During fear reconditioning, conditioned stimuli also reliably elicited event-related EEG responses (ERP) both across and within age groups as revealed by cluster permutation analyses (all p corr , 0.01; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). In particular, we observed that after an initially similar ERP (,1 s) to CS 1 and CS -, conditioned stimuli (CS 1 ) were associated with an increasingly more negative going slow wave in the delay interval (between CS 1 [t = 0 s] and US onset [t = 2 s]). This was reflected in a sustained negative cluster with strongest polarity at centroparietal electrodes (i.e., parietal slow wave; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Following the onset of the reinforcement (US), in CS 1 trials the ERP rapidly flipped its polarity while maintaining a highly similar parietal topography, thus giving rise to a sustained positive cluster (i.e., late parietal potential [LPP]; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p><p>In line with the established role of anticipatory slow waves and LPPs in arousal and emotion processing (for reviews, see van <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Boxtel and Böcker, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Schupp et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Vazey et al., 2018)</ref>, this points to increased sustained attention to CS 1 during the anticipatory delay interval (0-2 s) and an augmented arousal response following US (. t = 2 s). Both the topography and time course of the ERP responses were highly similar across age groups, indicating a maintained arousal response to conditioned stimuli (CS 1 ; and US) across the lifespan. Notably, as the earlier anticipatory potential emerges before onset of the reinforcement, we can rule out that it constitutes an artifact of the somatosensory stimulation. The latter potential in contrast may be influenced by the reinforcement and should only be considered further if it is reliably reinstated in absence of the stimulation (see below).</p></div>

Figure 6a shows the differences in relative power changes between arousal conditions (CS 1 vs CS -) during reconditioning trials (for statistics, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). Accordingly, cluster statistics across age groups revealed a reliable desynchronization effect. The observed cluster (t = -0.248-4.956 s) spanned a broad frequency spectrum (4-40 Hz) but was most pronounced in the u to b frequency bands (;5-25 Hz) with strongest polarity at parieto-occipital electrodes (compare van Boxtel and Böcker, 2004; YA and OA: p corr = 0.002). Analyses within YAs and OAs demonstrated reliable desynchronization effects in both age groups with strongest extent at posterior electrodes (YA: p corr = 0.024; OA: p corr = 0.002; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7a</ref>). However, in YA, desynchronization was restricted to the anticipatory delay phase (i.e., before US onset; t = 0.352-1.360 s; 5-40 Hz); whereas in OA, a more persistent desynchronization was observed (t = -0.248-5.144 s; 2-40 Hz). In addition, coinciding with onset of the reinforcement (US), a positive low-frequency cluster emerged across and within age groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7a</ref>).

Within the dichotic listening task (i.e., in the absence of reinforcements; US; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), we largely witnessed a reliable reinstatement of the arousal response across modalities (i.e., ERP, ERD, ERPR; Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3, 5,</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). We interpret the reinstatement of the arousal response as reflecting a phasic activation of the LC-NE system by the reactivated fear memory.

The cluster reached significance in the anticipatory delay phase (i.e., before US onset during (re)conditioning; t = 0.588-1.160 s) in the a-b frequency band (9-30 Hz) and was most pronounced at parieto-occipital electrodes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>). Spearman correlation coefficients (based on EEG data averaged across the cluster) are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. In sum, in line with our interpretation, cluster correlations indicated that both ERP and ERD responses to the arousal manipulation were linked to pupil dilation, a proxy for LC-NE activity. To further corroborate this conclusion, we repeated our analyses, this time using reconditioning instead of reinstatement pupil and EEG data (compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). We again observed a reliable, qualitatively similar, association between EEG responses and pupil dilation, suggesting a common dependence on LC-NE activity (ERP: p = 0.026 and p = 0.044 [two reliable clusters], t = 1.12-1.218 s and t = 1.706-1.832 s; ERD: p = 0.03, t = 0.648-1.112 s, frequency range = 13-37 Hz). Crucially, we additionally repeated these analyses on the single-trial level. That is, we tested whether we could predict a given trial's phasic pupil dilation based on its ERP and ERD data. We obtained findings qualitatively similar to the here reported betweensubject analyses (see Control analyses).

The strength of the NE-attention association did not differ reliably between age groups (Dx 2 = 0.003, Ddf = 1, p = 0.954).

In addition, we applied a multimodal assessment to probe general attention performance in samples of healthy YA and OA. Our findings demonstrate impaired attention in aging across multiple tasks. Moreover, older age was associated with a reduced NE responsiveness as indexed by pupil dilation and EEG. Crucially, within both YA and OA, individual differences in attention were positively related to the responsiveness of the noradrenergic system.</p><p>On the behavioral level, both YA and OA demonstrated successful auditory selective attention in a dichotic listening task <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hugdahl et al., 2009)</ref>.

CS 1 further gave rise to two sustained centroparietal eventrelated EEG components: (1) an anticipatory slow wave; and</p><p>(2) a late parietal potential that occurred before and after onset of the reinforcement (US), respectively. A comparable slow wave (stimulus-preceding negativity [SPN]) has been observed in response to cues (S1) that prepared participants for the occurrence of following arousing or behaviorally relevant stimuli (S2; compare <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Breska and Deouell, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">for review, see van Boxtel and Böcker, 2004)</ref>. Concerning its functional relevance, the SPN has been suggested as marker of anticipatory processes that adjust the excitability of cortical networks to facilitate subsequent processing (of S2; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Birbaumer et al., 1990)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Brunia (1993)</ref> proposed the SPN as index of regionally targeted changes in cortical excitability that are produced via corticothalamic interactions. Interestingly, various peripheral correlates of noradrenergic activation (e.g., skin conductance, heart rate; compare Szabadi, 2013) have been observed concomitant with the SPN (van <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Boxtel and Böcker, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Poli et al., 2007)</ref>. Together, a larger SPN (CS 1 vs CS -) points to a heightened anticipatory attention deployment in arousing situations in YA and OA. After presentation of the reinforcement (US), CS 1 were associated with a second sustained parietal event-related component (LPP). Previous studies have observed the LPP during fear conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bacigalupo and Luck, 2018)</ref> and suggested it as index of facilitated attention allocation to arousing stimuli (for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Schupp et al., 2006)</ref>. Furthermore, the LPP has been linked with peripheral markers of noradrenergic activity (e.g., skin conductance response; compare <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Szabadi, 2013)</ref> and subjective arousal ratings. In line with previous work, we interpret the LPP as reflecting elevated selective attention during arousing conditions in YA and OA.</p><p>In addition to ERP, fear conditioned stimuli (CS 1 ) produced pronounced changes in rhythmic neural activity within YA and OA. We observed an anticipatory, long-lasting desynchronization in low EEG frequencies (ERD) with strongest magnitude at parieto-occipital electrodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(van Boxtel and Böcker, 2004)</ref>. Increased activity in neuromodulatory nuclei like the LC causes global cortical desynchronization (i.e., cortical state changes; <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">McCormick et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Marzo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Neves et al., 2018)</ref>.

Using a similar fear conditioning procedure in rats, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Headley and Weinberger (2013)</ref> demonstrated that the CS 1induced decrease in low frequencies is accompanied by a strong increase in high-frequency multiunit activity (g ; 40-120 Hz), indicating facilitated feedforward processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fries, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Fries, , 2015))</ref>. In line with earlier work, the pronounced low-frequency desynchronization in response to CS (and US) suggests a transition toward a more activated cortical state, including increased cortical excitability and attention deployment. Most of the arousal responses observed during (re)conditioning (i.e., ERPR, ERP, ERD) persisted in both age groups and were reinstated during the dichotic listening task in the absence of reinforcements (US). As a notable exception, in OA, pupil reinstatement did not reach significance on a group level, potentially reflecting age-related difficulties in triggering and maintaining self-initiated processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Lindenberger and Mayr, 2014)</ref>. That is, during re/conditioning, repeated external reminders (i.e., US) may have supported OA and thus obscured age differences in pupil responses. In contrast, the lack of this external support during the dichotic listening task may have specifically affected OA and revealed underlying age-related differences in fear conditionability <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(LaBar et al., 2004)</ref> and the central noradrenergic system <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Betts et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dahl et al., 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Liu et al., 2019)</ref>.

Remarkably, the orienting response is always accompanied by EEG desynchronization and pupil dilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Sara and Bouret, 2012)</ref>, supporting a common dependency on LC activity.</p><p>We thus integrated over (pupil-associated) EEG and pupil dilation markers to derive a single, multimodal measure reflecting LC-NE responsiveness. We observed a lower NE responsiveness with older age, which complements previous reports of structural age differences in the LC <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Betts et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dahl et al., 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Liu et al., 2019)</ref> and age differences in LC functional connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Lee et al., 2018)</ref>. Crucially, within both YA and OA, a higher noradrenergic responsiveness was associated with better selective attention performance (compare <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arnsten and Goldman-Rakic, 1985)</ref>. That is, in the face of declining selective attention in aging, a responsive NE system was linked to preserved cognitive abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Nyberg et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Notably, however, as our study reports correlational data, we cannot exclude that better attentional abilities may have facilitated a preferential processing of CS, which in turn may have led to increased noradrenergic drive. In addition, while previous research demonstrated a link between LC activity and pupil dilation (LC ! pupil), increases in dilation do not necessarily imply that (only) changes in LC-NE activity have occurred <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Joshi and Gold, 2020)</ref>. In this study, we applied an experimental manipulation, fear conditioning, which reliably drives LC-NE activity, as   indicated by markers of neuronal activity in animals, for example: LC spiking activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Rasmussen and Jacobs, 1986)</ref>; Ca 21 responses in LC axons <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Deitcher et al., 2019)</ref>; and c-Fos <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Uematsu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">compare Szabadi, 2012)</ref>. Combining a manipulation that elicits LC activation (fear conditioning) with a noninvasive marker sensitive to LC activation (pupil dilation), we believe that our findings are at least partly attributable to the effects of NE. This argument is supported by our finding that pupil dilation was associated with electrophysiological indices that have also been linked to NE activity in invasive animal studies: that is, the P300 ERP <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Nieuwenhuis et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Vazey and Aston-Jones, 2014)</ref>; and low-frequency desynchronization <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(McCormick et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Marzo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Neves et al., 2018)</ref>. Targeting the noradrenergic system from multiple angles, we hope to narrow down our conclusions. While our data suggest an involvement of the noradrenergic system in this study, we do not rule out the involvement of other neuromodulatory systems in fear conditioning and attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Thiele and Bellgrove, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Likhtik and Johansen, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In conclusion, we used noninvasive in vivo markers of noradrenergic activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Joshi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Reimer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Neves et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Vazey et al., 2018)</ref> to uncover age differences in NE responsiveness. Importantly, structural equation modeling revealed reliable positive associations between NE responsiveness and attention in both YA and OA.

Experimental procedure of the (a) fear conditioning session, (b) dichotic listening task, and (c) resulting trial categories. a, Each conditioning trial began with a 1 s baseline interval during which a white fixation cross was presented. Then, either the conditioned (CS 1 ) or perceptually matched control stimulus (CS -; horizontal or vertical Gabor patch) was displayed for 2 s.In CS 1 trials, on offset of the Gabor patch, a mild electric shock was applied to the participant's finger. After 6 s of fix cross presentation (ITI), the next trial started. b, Importantly, the beginning of trials in the dichotic listening task was identical to the fear conditioning session. Upon offset of the CS, an attention cue (2 s) indicated which ear participants should focus on. Tightly synchronized syllable pairs were then presented simultaneously to the left and right ear (0.5 s), and participants indicated by button press which syllable they heard on the cued ear (up to 3 s). c, Participants underwent fear conditioning sessions (compare a) on each day of the experiment while pupil dilation was recorded (Conditioning; blue). The arousal manipulated dichotic listening task (compare b) was completed once on the second day while both pupil dilation and EEG were recorded. Interleaved after each break of the dichotic listening task, participants were reconditioned (compare a) to prevent extinction of the fear response (Reconditioning; teal). During re/conditioning, participants received electrical stimulation (US); thus, the observed responses may represent a mixture of fear and somatosensory responses. In contrast, during the dichotic listening task, no shocks were applied; thus, observed responses to the arousal manipulation (CS 1 vs CS -) indicate the reinstatement of the fear response (Reinstatement; orange). On the first day of the experiment, participants additionally completed a pen-and-paper attention assessment; whereas on the last day, structural MRI data were recorded.
