<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Sustainability is a main agenda of the world. UNESCO <ref type="bibr">[2010]</ref> has taken the initiative to implement the Decade of Education for Sustainable <ref type="bibr">Development 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">-2014 (DefSD)</ref>. Even the sustainability efforts of sustainable development has become a common agenda in many agencies, such as government agencies, non-governmental agencies and private agencies to increase knowledge and awareness of issues related to sustainable development. Basically, the concept of sustainable development, explains that, development is carried out to meet the needs of the current world's population without compromising the needs of future world population <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[WCED, 1987]</ref>. Awareness of the importance and the need for information regarding environmental issues has led to more initiatives taken by related organizations to initiate sustainable development programs for various target groups. Sustainable development is seen as one of the most modern development ideas proactive and practical to address the development needs as well as conservation of the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Fien, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hopkins &amp; McKeown, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Huckle, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hazura, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Joshi, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Moroye, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sterling, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Scoullos &amp; Malotidi, 2004]</ref>.</p><p>Hanifah Mahat, Yazid Saleh, Mohmadisa Hashim and Nasir Nayan Geography &amp; Environmental Department, Faculty of Human Sciences, Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Malaysia Email: hanifah.mahat@fsk.upsi.edu.my</p><p>The world began to worry about the exploitation issue of the environment, economic growth and deterioration in quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[Omar, 2005]</ref>. In fact, unplanned development activities and neglecting the environmental aspects are also threatening the needs of the next generation. There is no question to how serious this situation is and how it will have an impact on survival, sustainability, civilization and prosperity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Laily, 2009]</ref>.</p><p>An increase in understanding and awareness of the environment are two important elements in building the national capacity towards sustainable development <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Dimitrova, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Yeoh, 2005]</ref> Sustainable education is capable of generating changes in the mentality of the community in improving the quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Firth &amp; Smith, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lampa, Greculescu &amp; Todorescu, 2013]</ref>. In Malaysia, study revealed that students who receive early exposure in the field of environmental education has failed to show awareness and commitment to environmental issues, in which the overall is still at a low level <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Aini, Laily &amp; Sharifah, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arba'at, Kamsiah &amp; Susan, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fatimah, Norliza &amp; Salhayatin, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zohir, 2009]</ref>. Therefore, this study attempts to develop a Structural Equation Model on awareness of Education for Sustainable Development for students in an effort to promote "whole school approach" to expose to this sustainability.</p><p>There are many definitions and interpretations given to explain the concept of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). Definition given by UNESCO through Monitoring &amp; Evaluating Decade of Education for Sustainable Development, refers to a process of learning (or teaching approach) based on the principles that underlying sustainability at all levels and forms of education <ref type="bibr">[UNESCO, 2009]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Geiser [2006]</ref>pointed out that ESD should involve components consisting environmental awareness towards ecosystem and natural resources, importance and limitations, the threat of human activities on ecosystem and building the skills of monitoring, analysis and involvement.</p><p>Education for sustainable development also refers to learning that is needed to maintain and improve the quality of life for future generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Ghani &amp; Aziah, 2007]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rohaty [2005]</ref> defines ESD as a way towards a better life for the present generation and the future. It is a dynamic process that requires each individual recognizing their own potentials and improving the quality of life. <ref type="bibr">Zohir [2003]</ref> saw ESD as an educational mission to find a balance between human welfare and economic development with cultural traditions and respect for natural resources. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mazlin [2004]</ref> defines ESD as learning to understand human interaction with the environment and how the environment is managed wisely and responsibly towards sustainability of life on Earth. This process involves education about sustainable development, through sustainable development and for sustainable development.</p><p>Realizing education plays an important role in the development of society towards equality and sustainability, the United Nations launched the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DefSD) in 2005. DEfSD goal for the period of 2005-2014 is to integrate the principles, values and practices of sustainable development into all aspects of education and learning. The concept has been reemphasized during Born Declaration <ref type="bibr">[UNESCO, 2009]</ref> in which ESD is a new direction for education and learning for all. It promotes quality education to everyone based on values, principles and practices necessary to respond effectively to current and future challenges. Thus, it is expected that educational efforts will encourage behavioral changes that will create a more sustainable future in terms of environmental integrity, economic viability and community for present and future.</p><p>The relationship between sustainable development and ESD is for identifying the priorities of teachers and students to address the three main elementsenvironment, economy and social. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huckle [2013]</ref> describes the role of school in spreading knowledge, developing culture and harnessing the potential or the talent of students through school programs. Although environmental education can occur anywhere, but the basic and main place is in the school. School play an important role in the process of helping students to learn and aware of the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[Heneger, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mageswary, Zurita &amp; Norita, 2013]</ref>, in fact study by <ref type="bibr">Bergulnd, Gericke and Rundgren [2014]</ref> also found that the implementation of ESD in school affect students. When good values are instill in children, the development of the children will grow in line with the cultivation of environmental values that will ultimately produce environmentally concerned and responsible citizens <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[Hidayah et al., 2013]</ref>.</p><p>In Malaysia, the implementation of sustainable school is a planned and structured program designed to promote sustainability among students. The program, so called Sustainable School Environment Award (SLAAS), has been implemented since 2005 and is open to primary, as well as secondary schools (not made compulsory by the Ministry of Education). The purpose of SLAAS was to create a school environment that fosters the conservation and preservation of the environment in the aspects of management, curriculum, co-curriculum and continuous green activities in order to establish a life practice in line with the concept of sustainable development. The SLAAS Program has been implemented in the form of competition, and at the end of each session (2 years for each session), there will be winners in the categories of primary and secondary schools. There is a screening to select the winner for the SLAAS Award, which is screening for the SLAAS participation level, state level and national level (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual framework study</head><p>There are two interrelated theories underlying this study which is (i) Theory of Reasoned Action -TRA developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fishbein and Ajzen [1975]</ref>. This theory has proposed three general concepts which are purpose, attitude and subjective norms in shaping behavior. According to this theory, the behavior of an individual is determined by his purpose / intention and also driven by the attitude. Basically TRA puts the knowledge element that forms attitude in conjunction with subjective norm and the subsequent behavior. Next (ii) Theory of Planned Behavior, TPB <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Ajzen, 1991]</ref>, which is the development of the TRA, has suggested four basic concepts which are belief (knowledge or insight), attitude, recommendation and behavior. TPB emphasizes on recommendations for action which is influenced by the belief (knowledge or insight) and also attitude. Both of these theories underlying the conceptual framework study in which knowledge has an impact on attitude and subsequently creating behavior. But this study is not only to review the domain knowledge, attitude and behavior, but also added three domain knowledge, namely knowledge of the program, ESD content knowledge and knowledge of ESD practices that are included as a measurement tool for ESD awareness.</p><p>The models in the study of environmental behavior change that also underlying the study are Conceptual Model of Environmental Behavior proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barr, Ford and Gilg [2003]</ref>, Model System of Behavioral Changes by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ramsey and Rickson [1976]</ref>, Model of Responsible Environmental Behavior by Hines, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hungerford and Tomera (1986/87)</ref> and Model of Environmental Behavior by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hungerford and Volk [1990]</ref>. Through Conceptual Model of Environmental Behavior by <ref type="bibr">Bar et al. [2003]</ref>, in changing behavior it involves three variables, (i) environmental value variables (individual orientation towards the environment and the public view towards natural resources) (ii) situation variables (context / place, socio-demographic and knowledge / experience) and (iii) psychological variables (altruism variable, intrinsic motivation, perception, subjective norms, environmental threats, self-efficacy, and citizenship). Researchers adjust the model of this study by looking at the environmental value which is measured against ESD knowledge ie knowledge on SLAAS program, content knowledge about the concept </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>of ESD and knowledge of ESD practices done</head><p>The situation variable in this study also involves context which is location of the school (SLAAS in urban and rural area) and the participation of the school in SLAAS Program (entry level, state level and national level), indirect socio-demographic and experience in implementing environmental activities or ESD activities. Psychological variable involved is in the context of the attitude which is cognitive, affective and psychomotor. Cognitive behavior involving belief, knowledge, or one's evaluation towards an object, affective attitude or emotion is one's feeling towards an object and psychomotor behavior is behavior or action taken by any person based on his belief and feeling. Attitude as agreed by most researchers Ma'arof <ref type="bibr">[2001] Ramsey and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rickson [1976]</ref>, Trandis <ref type="bibr">[1971]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tonglet, Phillips and Read [2004]</ref>, that attitude is an action that is not translated through action / behavior. The main conclusion of this model is the intention to behave is influenced by situation factor and psychology and finally forming the behavior.</p><p>The second guide in developing the conceptual framework is based on Model System of Behavior Change that was presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ramsey and Rickson (1976)</ref>. This model is based on the linear development of environmental knowledge that leads to concern and environmental awareness. But according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Matthews and Riley [1995]</ref>, the acquisition of knowledge does not necessarily change attitude and changes in attitude are not necessarily going to change the behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hwang, Kim, and Jeng [2000]</ref> also reckon that, the increase in knowledge and awareness does not always lead to proenvironmental action. This study uses both opinions as a basis to see to what extend these facts are evident in the study of ESD awareness through this SLAAS Program.</p><p>Next, in confirming the presence of knowledgebehavior relationship in the context of environment, this study also places the Model of Responsible Environmental Behavior by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hines et al [1986/87]</ref>, as a guide. Through this model, the emphasis is on knowledge variable and skill to encourage the individual to act in the direction of responsible behavior towards the environment. One's desire to act positively is also driven by the desire which is attitude towards the environment. The main summary of this model is the attitude (desire) will affect individual to gain knowledge before acting. This model emphasizes attitude between personality factors that is in line with knowledge factor to influence behavior.</p><p>Model of Environmental Behavior by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hungerford and Volk [1990]</ref> is also used as the basis of the study. This model puts the three stages of behavior change which is the entry level, ownership level and ownership level to develop responsible citizens of environmental behavior. The main emphasis of this model is towards the knowledge in each level so it will have an impact on behavior. The position of attitude domain is only as ancillary variable in the entry level. Based on theories and models derived from previous studies, a summary has been established in which putting the behavior domain as the final act of an individual who is molded or produced through knowledge and attitudes. In fact, in the context of SLAAS program, basically all programs and activities have to emphasis on knowledge because it is expected to influence attitude that ultimately expressed in the form of actual behavior. In fact, some of the SLAAS activity is those that involve outside of classroom area. In the context of this study, it is expected that teachers with knowledge will affect the attitude towards SLAAS program and influence the students to behave in line as well as students with knowledge of ESD through SLAAS activities will influence the attitudes and subsequently change the behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Methods</head><p>Analysis of structural equation modeling (SEM) is used to identify variables that influence awareness of Education For Sustainable Development for students. A total of 447 students from 12 schools that participated in the Sustainable School Award for the Environment (SLAAS) program were made respondents of the study. A cluster sampling technique were used in this research. The purpose of this study is to develop Structural Equation Model on awareness of Education For Sustainable Development for students in Sustainable School cluster. Quantitative study has been used by using questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research instrument</head><p>The questionnaire developed for this study is based on literature highlights on the topic of sustainable development, ESD, environmental education and mainly from questionnaire set based on previous studies that are common, stable and robust and similar to this field of research. In this study, face validity and content validity is done in advance before constructed validity process is done. Questionnaire for students is divided into six main parts. Part I involves the background of the respondents. A total of 11 items for Knowledge of SLAAS Program variables are constructed based on the Basic Formation of Sustainable School Award for the Environment [DOE, 2012a] also Guidelines on Implementation and Evaluation of Sustainable School Award for the Environment <ref type="bibr">[DOE, 2012b]</ref>. For content knowledge variable, there is a total of 20 items that dismantle the ESD Content Knowledge. The items constructed are in accordance with the items that have been built through the study by <ref type="bibr">Suriati [2009]</ref>, and some items constructed by the researcher based on literature review. For ESD Practice knowledge variables, the construction of the items is based on The Implementation of SLAAS Program Handbook [Department of the Environment, 2004a] and also Guidelines on Implementation and Evaluation of Sustainable School Award for the Environment <ref type="bibr">[DOE, 2004b]</ref>. Questions involving the ESD knowledge source acquired either through the curriculum, co-curricular or other sources. Next, the ESD attitude variable comprises 20 items constructed from modifying items from the study of <ref type="bibr">Norshariani [2009]</ref> and most items developed by the researcher based on literature review. Finally, the ESD behavior variable totaling 18 items. Improvements made after the items' first pilot and second pilot study done.</p><p>Internal consistency reliability test puts a variety of value / instrument reliability index. The ideal Cronbach Alpha coefficient is 0.70 above <ref type="bibr">[Pallant, 2010]</ref>. Based on statistical analysis, the value of Cronbach Alpha for all constructs of ESD awareness has more than 0.6 degrees of reliability and is acceptable (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The data were also analyzed using AMOS (Analysis of Moments Structure) software version 18. In this study, SEM is used as a tool to identify whether there is a relationship between the dependent variables (variable endogenous) and independent variables (variable exogenous) in the model proposed by the researcher and whether it's true among respondents of the survey. This multivariate technique combining aspects of multiple regression and factor analysis to estimate a skill of related dependents that interrelates simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Hair, Anderson, Tatham &amp; Black, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Joreskog &amp; Sorbom, 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Kelloway, 1998</ref>]. The standard beta value (standardized regression Coefficient) will serve as a guide to see significant levels of relationship of each construct and then to accept or reject the hypothesis.</p><p>Through SEM it can identify whether the pattern fit the model by using SEM guideline which are Goodnessof-fit index (GFI), Comparative-fit-index (CFI), the normalized-fit index (NFI) and Root Means Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). SEM combines the concept of multiple regression analysis and path analysis (involving more than one relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable in the model).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.Result and Discussion</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the profile of the 154 respondents (34.5%) from the schools that are not going to the state level, 163 (36.5%) of respondents from the SLAAS state participants and 130 people (29.1%) were respondents at national level. Based on gender, a total of 309 were female respondents (69.1%) and a total of 138 were male (30.9%). From that amount there were 262 respondents aged 16 years (58.6%) and respondents aged 17 years that makes a total of 185 people (41.4%). Based on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> it shows the relationship between the students ESD awareness variable. The study found that there is a relationship between SLAAS knowledge with ESD behavior (r = 0.137**, P &lt;0.  (r = 0236 ** P &lt;0.05), ESD attitude with ESD behavior (r = 0.240 ** P &lt;0.05). However, the study found no significant relationship between ESD behavior with ESD content knowledge (r = -0059 P&gt; 0.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural equation model fit test</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> shows model development on awareness of education for sustainable development by using flow-analysis. The result of the study found that the indication on the overall model study have met the suggested value (recommended value). Thus the model study is fit with the data observed and has produced fit model index value RMSEA = 0.047 as suggested by <ref type="bibr">Hair, et al. [2006]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kline [1998]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arbuckle [1995]</ref> which is root means square error of approximation (RMSEA) &lt;0:10. Other indices have also been used to assess the suitability of the model namely chi-square / degree of freedom ≤ 2.0, Goodness-of-fit index (GFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and the adjusted goodness of fit index (AGFI) that is needed to produce an index ≥ 0.90 <ref type="bibr">[Hair et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kline 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arbuckle and Wothe 1995]</ref>. Based on this study, it is found that index value for DF = 1.0 ≤ 2.0, GFI = 0.996, TLI = 0.980 and AGFI = 0.973 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Thus, the suggested model for constructs of ESD awareness (knowledge of SLAAS program, ESD content knowledge, knowledge of ESD practices, ESD attitudes and ESD behavior) is fit based on data that is observed to build the model development on awareness of education for sustainable development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimation value of the regression weight path analysis model</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the results of students' measurement model using structural equation model test at the probability level of p &lt;0.05. It is found that all variables significantly affected except knowledge of SLAAS on ESD attitude (β = -0.70) showed no significant relationship. This explains that the knowledge of SLAAS against ESD attitude does not give significant contribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The standard value of direct effect and indirect effect model</head><p>The SEM approach can estimate standard direct effect, standard indirect effect and total standard effect between independent variable, intermediate variable and variable bound, as well as the connectivity between variables with the variable domain of a model.

However, this study has added three domains of knowledge: knowledge of SLAAS program involving two sub-domains which is values and activities in SLAAS program, ESD content knowledge domain that covers three sub-domains namely environmental, economic and social. Finally, knowledge of ESD practices domain which consists of two sub-domains namely ESD practices in school and outside of school.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>SLAAS program that was implemented in Malaysia for 2009/2010 session has put a measurable guide to measure the achievement of sustainable schools covering the field of management, co-curricular and greening. The focus of this study is in terms of ESD awareness domains. The production of the new Student Awareness Model of ESD saw action and route in term of psychology that has to be taken in the effort to provide ESD awareness to students. Thus, in the context of sustainable schools, it is an intellectual contribution to the parties involved to provide guidance towards creating ESD awareness. Even with the model study results of this study, it is a contribution of new knowledge in the context of ESD. Through the implementation in curriculum will expose students to various aspects of sustainability through everyday relationship with people, energy, materials and plants / animals in the school and outside the school. The implementations of ESD activities are not only through the theoretical input but also practical which gives more impact. Based on this study, it clearly gives the impression that the program has successfully met the fundamental objectives, and should be continued with some improvements or should be extended systematically. Directly or indirectly, it is a mechanism to help the nation through educational approaches to achieve sustainability in order to develop an understanding and love towards nature at an early age.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
