<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study aimed to determine whether digital literacy has a direct effect on creative thinking disposition and an indirect effect through lifelong learning disposition. The study was conducted with 327 teachers working in Siirt Province, Turkey in 2021-2022 academic years. "The Marmara Creative Thinking Dispositions Scale", "Digital Literacy Scale" and "Lifelong Learning Trends Scale" were used in the data collection process. Correlational survey method was employed in this study. The structural equation modeling technique was also used to analyze the relationships of variables. Two models, which explain the direct effect of digital literacy on creative thinking disposition and its indirect effects through lifelong learning disposition, were developed. As a consequence of the analysis, it was determined that structural models were in good agreement with each other. In this study, digital literacy has a statistically significant and positive effect on creative thinking disposition both directly and indirectly through lifelong learning disposition.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Creativity is an ability which leads to the production of products that makes individuals' life easier and which enables individuals to find flexible, original, reasonable and appropriate solutions to the encountered problems. Furthermore, it gives birth to the creation of the masterpieces of art through which individuals live a life in a meaningful way. Creativity, as one of the most significant features, which distinguishes human beings from other species, provides innovation by going beyond the ordinary ways or methods. Through this innovation, creativity causes a change, and in turn ensures the continuation of development with change. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Judkins (2017)</ref> describes creativity as a way of one's seeing the world around him/her, communicating with and responding to it. Thus, it can be said that creativity is a skill that is affected by the conditions in which the individual lives. The description of a product or an idea as creative could change from one society to another. An idea or a product which is defined as creative in a society may not be regarded as creative in another society. Creativity may be subjected to change across time. In a society, an idea or product that is not creative today may be considered as creative in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sak, 2020)</ref>. Therefore, it can be said that there is a social process in which creativity is affected by cultural and individual factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Daniels &amp; Peters, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Memduhoğlu, Uçar &amp; Uçar, 2017)</ref> and cannot be considered as independent from its evaluators <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arik &amp; Arik, 2020)</ref>. In this regard, the factors that have an effect on creativity may differ by society and time.</p><p>In today's information society, developments that have been experienced in the information technologies and on the internet affect every aspect of life. The digital tools and technologies which provide access to internet enable the work and transactions to be done more practically and effectively with new methods in education, art, media, industry, government, commerce and social areas as well as many other fields. There is no limitation in those changes and transformations and innovations continue to enter people's life every day. The digital tools such as computer, cell phones or Ipad bring about the change in people's work life, meeting their social needs, entertainment and communication and learning facilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kesici, 2018)</ref>. As a consequence of this, the skill of using digital tools efficiently is one of the most basic skills in today's society. Accordingly, digital literacy, which is defined as the effective and ethical use of digital tools for a specific purpose, may be efficient to find creative solutions to the problems people encounter in today's society <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hague &amp; Payton, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Technology, which provides to overcome the limitations of time and space, deeply affects the production, consumption and dissemination of information so the information produced by means of technology becomes more convenient, cheaper, more functional and effective one. Hence, the information has become a factor that has an effect on the economic processes. The prominence of the economic value of information results in a knowledge-based competition between countries. The majority of the society continues to live by dealing with the production, consumption and dissemination of information. Therefore, today's society is defined as information society <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lankshear &amp; Knobel, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kesici, 2018)</ref>. In this regard, keeping up with the changes and transformations in the information society can only be possible by keeping one's self updated so it is necessary to keep one's self © 2022, Journal of Learning and Teaching in Digital Age, 7(2), 260-273 updated in order to produce creative products and find out creative solutions to problems. Being able to keep one's self updated requires lifelong learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Knapper &amp; Cropley, 2000)</ref>. Thus, it can be said that lifelong learning is also a factor that affects creative thinking.</p><p>With the rapid changes in today's information society, individuals are required to acquire creative thinking skills to survive, compete and have a more successful and happier life than before. It is very important to develop the creative thinking potential of individuals in today's world where the focus is on developing creativity capacity of individuals through education <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Daniels &amp; Peters, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Memduhoğlu, Uçar, &amp; Uçar, 2017)</ref>. Determining the factors that affect the creative thinking in the training of creative individuals that are elligible for every sector, and taking into consideration these factors in education will contribute to the development of creative potential. In this respect, this study aims to investigate the relationships among creative thinking, digital literacy and lifelong learning skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Qadir, Yau, Imran &amp; Al-Fuqaha, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">van Laar, van Deursen, van Dijk &amp; de Haan, 2020)</ref>, which are defined as the 21st century skills. The theoretical explanations with regard to these skills are presented in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Digital Literacy</head><p>The digitalization in every field has rendered the ability to use digital tools an important skill. In terms of the use of digital tools, digital literacy is an approach that aims to situate the individuals in a position in which they can effectively use digital tools and solve the problems they encounter by using digital tools through innovative methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Ventimiglia &amp; Pullman, 2016)</ref>. Therefore, individuals do not use digital tools with the aim of social networking and entertainment in a passive way anymore.</p><p>Digital literacy is generally regarded as understanding information by using digital technologies, creating new information, and sharing information as well as evaluating existing knowledge effectively and critically <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Parlak, 2019)</ref>. What is meant by the effective use of digital tools in digital literacy is not only about knowledge of the technical use of digital tools. Digital literacy encompasses the conscious use of technical knowledge for a purpose and solving a problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(MEB, 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Leu et al. (2013)</ref> define digital literacy as the ability to find, evaluate, organize and create information by using digital technologies to solve a problem. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hague and Payton (2010)</ref>, a person who is characterized as a digital literate person should know what h/she looks for via digital tools and should define where and how h/she can access the information h/she looks for and evaluate the accuracy of the information h/she obtains, and share the results h/she gets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Martin (2008)</ref> also defines digital literacy as access to information through use of digital tools and as the identification and evaluation of accessed information, analysis and synthesis skill, and attitude and ability to produce new knowledge. Drawing from this perspective, it can be said that digital literacy includes high-order thinking skills such as analysis, synthesis evaluation, and critical and creative thinking.</p><p>While the virtual world that is created by humans and accessed by digital tools offers great benefits to humanity, it may cause some problems such as cyber bullying, cyber attack and digital addiction that people have to deal with <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kesici, 2018)</ref>. These problems can also cause legal, health, social and psychological problems. There are also subject matters such as plagiarism, copyrights and to name few that digital tool users generally have to comply with. Digital literacy also includes using digital tools with awareness of these issues.</p><p>In addition to being aware of the opportunities provided by digital tools and benefiting from them, digital literacy incorporates ethical and legal use with awareness of the threats and dangers which may result from the use of digital tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sağıroğlu, Bülbül, Kılıç &amp; Küçükali, 2020)</ref>. The ethical and legal use of digital tools is associated with cognitive skills. Furthermore, the processes that are related to the interpretation, evaluation, and processing as well as the production of information obtained from digital sources include cognitive skills. Issues such as the ability to use digital tools, overcoming technical failures and adapting to new technologies are related to the technical skills. Moreover, the social-emotional dimension of digital literacy is about making meaning in the social context; therefore, it is also about necessity of acting responsibly towards individuals in communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ng, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Considering its technical, cognitive and social-emotional dimensions, digital literacy can be said to focus on the culture of using a digital tool that is suitable for today's information society. Digital literacy provides a framework with young generations to have the culture of using digital tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sağıroğlu, Bülbül, Kılıç, &amp; Küçükali, 2020)</ref>. The culture of ethical, conscious and effective use of digital tools that digital literacy forms may provide humanity with production, efficiency and profit. On the contrary, it can be said that human beings may experience major problems and disasters originating from the virtual world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lifelong Learning</head><p>Lifelong learning has brought a new perspective to learning which is different from the view that offers a traditional prespective to economical, technological and social changes as well as the research studies on human brain and rights. In comparison to today's information age, in the period when the change and transformation took place rather slowly, the accepted view was that education had to be for young people and children, and that the learning at school would be sufficient for the individual until the end of his/her life <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Doğan, 1976)</ref>. However, changes in technology, economy and social areas have revealed that people need to constantly update themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Polat &amp; Odabaş, 2008)</ref>. Research studies on adult learning show that human brain maintains its flexibility in adults, and new cells are produced in some regions such as the hypothalamus, and new connections are formed between neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Orhon, 2014)</ref>. Additionally, humanistic approaches, which stress that every individual has the innate ability to learn and develop his/her own abilities and thereby learning is a human right, has led to the acceptance of an understanding defined as lifelong learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akkuş, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Polat &amp; Odabaş, 2008)</ref>. © 2022, Journal of Learning and Teaching in Digital Age <ref type="table">,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_3">7(2),</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_3">260</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_3">261</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_3">262</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_4">263</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_5">264</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_7">265</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_3">266</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_3">267</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_3">268</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_3">269</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_3">270</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_3">271</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_3">272</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_4">273</ref>In a report prepared by the European Union Commission in 2020, lifelong learning is defined as learning activities that enable individuals to actively participate as citizens in society and to acquire social or work-related knowledge and skills as well as competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Turan, 2005)</ref>. As a result of this, lifelong learning comprises both formal education and non-formal education. Lifelong learning includes the trainings that an individual has taken for his/her personal, professional and social development and involves learning throughout his/her life <ref type="bibr">(Erdamar, 2011)</ref>. Lifelong learning has different aspects from traditional ways of learning. These are carried out in line with the willingness of individuals or communities, and they do not have any restrictions such as age, gender, education level and socio-economic background of individuals. Learning can take place at home or at work and the school setting is not mandatory for learning. In this regard, time is not an obstacle to learning due to the opportunities that are provided by technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Güleç, Çelik &amp; Demirhan, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Lifelong learning offers many individual and social benefits. Employment may be increased by lifelong learning and adaptation to the job may be provided. Learning their democratic rights and responsibilities, individuals can fulfil their active participatory actions in their society and can be sensitive to social problems and can take initiatives in society. By ensuring the individual's adaptation to the changes and transformations in society, his/her alienation from the society can be prevented. Individuals can achieve selfrealization through self-development in the field of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Turan, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">European Union, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>There are various skills that are aimed to be developed in lifelong learning. These skills are expressed with key competencies <ref type="bibr">(Erdamar, 2011)</ref>. These are: communication in mother tongue and foreign languages, basic competences in mathematics, science and technology, learning to learn, digital competence, social competences, and entrepreneurship and cultural awareness competence. By developing these competencies and encouraging them to use their creative and innovation skills, individuals can be helped to contribute to the society and be successful in the business world with their creativity and innovative features (Council of the European Union, 2018).</p><p>In lifelong learning, basic skills such as learning to learn, learning strategies repertoire, technology skills, and literacy and calculus as well as high-order thinking skills such as problem solving, self-regulation skills, and critical thinking are very important skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Coşkun &amp; Demirel, 2012)</ref>. However, these cognitive skills are not sufficient for lifelong learning. In addition to cognitive skills, it is necessary to have a lifelong learning disposition which is an affective quality. Herein, disposition is defined as an internal tendency to want or do something (TDK, 2021, August 30). An individual's inclination and willingness to do something shows his inclination towards that job. Disposition bridges the gap between doing something and wanting to do it. Disposition arises from the motivation to want to do something and provides the energy that is necessary to perform the action. Disposition enables the individual to use his/her abilities in appropriate environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Erdoğan &amp; Arsal, 2016)</ref>. In this respect, lifelong learning disposition can be described as an individual's orientation or predisposition towards lifelong learning. Therefore, individuals who have a high level of disposition towards lifelong learning may have a higher level of participation in lifelong learning (formal, informal) experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Creative Thinking</head><p>Creativity, which means producing a new idea or work (product) by using intelligence, ideas and imagination, has been explained with its different aspects by many researchers. For instance, creativity is defined as being able to see something from different perspectives and going beyond the limits of prior knowledge, producing an original product, and creating something new by making extraordinary relationships between unrelated things <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fox &amp; Schirrmacher, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Sylvan (1997)</ref>   <ref type="bibr">Üstündağ, 2014)</ref>. In addition, putting effort into giving a new identity to the old information and into making new synthesis between the known ones can be regarded as the creative pursuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Yeşilyurt, 2020)</ref>. From Torrance's (1966) perspective, creativity is composed of the processes of finding gaps in thoughts, offering various solutions to problems, developing new ideas and making new connections between ideas (Cited by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Arik and Arik, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Creativity consists of elements such as flexible thinking, rationality, originality and thinking in detail <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Orhon, 2014)</ref>. Flexible thinking is the ability to look at things from a different perspective, to make relationships between unrelated or independent ideas, and to direct thoughts from one way to another. Rationalism is the ability to generate as many ideas as possible about a topic. Originality refers to uniqueness of the created idea and product. Morever, thinking in detail means analyzing the problem in detail and in depth, not in general terms <ref type="bibr">(Üstüdağ, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Orhon, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Öncü, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Rewieving the notes and writing of creative persons, <ref type="bibr">Wallas (1926)</ref> states that creative products do not emerge randomly but are formed as a result of a process that is followed by one and another and moves on to the next phase after each phase is completed. This process is composed of periods defined as preparation, incubation, enlightenment and verification (Act. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Sak, 2020)</ref>. This also includes processes such as sensing the problem, identifying elements, obtaining information about the problem, and learning different approaches to the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Memduhoğlu, Uçar, &amp; Uçar, 2017)</ref>. The incubation period in which an individual stops dealing with the problem and continues life, and in which the problem is sent back to the subconscious and it is unknown how long this period would last. The problem continues to be examined in the subconscious mind <ref type="bibr">(Üstündağ, 2014)</ref>. In the enlightenment period, the solution of the problem becomes clear in the mind unconsciously. Solution suddenly emerges and develops <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Doğan, 2011)</ref>. In the validation phase, the suitability, effectiveness and the solution of the problem can be evaluated. The solution is rearranged by detailing it <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sak, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Creativity cannot be limited to fields such as art and science. Creativity can take place in all kinds of human endeavors, including affective and intellectual ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kale, 1994)</ref>. A creative idea or a product must be new; that is, the product is original and unusual. In creativity, the product, which must be appropriate, means that the product must be useful and valuable and provide inspiration to new ideas. The importance and quality of the product determine the creativity level of the product <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sak, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Creativity is classifed as big creativity, little creativity, and mini creativity. Big creativity is defined as the creative skills which are not seen in everyone and leave deep traces in society, science or art, and defined as skills of people whose names are still mentioned. Big creativity is an innate, different and superior talent <ref type="bibr">(Öncü, 2020)</ref>. This creativity corresponds to the special talent creativity that Maslow (1968) uses while explaining creativity based on the hierarchy of needs (Cited by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Sak, 2020)</ref>. Little creativity is the skills that make life easier by offering different solutions to the problems encountered in daily life or in a profession. This is the type of creativity that is thought to exist in everyone and can be developed. Furthermore, mini creativity is a sub-component of little creativity and the reinterpretation of the information that is obtained based on the experiences <ref type="bibr">(Öncü, 2020)</ref>. Little and mini creativity is thought to correspond to the creative type that Maslow defines as self-actualization creativity. Self-actualization creativity can be related to fields such as science, art, business and home. This type of creativity can be actualized through education <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sak, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Creative thinking is very important for a creative product or idea. Creative thinking incorporates thinking processes such as intuitive comprehension, visualization, questioning-answering, analysis-synthesis, problem solving, critical thinking, and producing extraordinary original solutions and knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kale, 1994)</ref>. In creative thinking, there is an effort to go beyond the ordinary ways with an original and innovative perspective that will cause change in the solution of the problem <ref type="bibr">(Üstündağ, 2014)</ref>. Creative thinking is based on analogy, embodying abstract ideas, producing original ideas, being open to new ideas, changing ideas, looking at problems from different perspectives, imagination and providing a realistic and rational prediction about the future with models, using imagination, visualizing in mind, and being open to intuition, inspiration and sudden thoughts <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Daniels &amp; Peters, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Doğan, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Creative behaviors are influenced by creative skills and creative disposition. Skills are qualities that must be possessed in order to perform or take an action. These skills are associated with cognitive traits such as flexible thinking, rationality, and originality. Disposition is related to a person's orientation to and attitudes towards performing an action. Dispositons lead people to use their creative cognitive skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Özgenel &amp; Çetin, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Orhon, 2014)</ref>. Therefore, it can be said that creative thinking disposition is a driving force for individual to use creative thinking skills, and can also provide information about the individuals' creativity.</p><p>In light of findings in literature, it is thought that digital literacy, lifelong learning and creative thinking skills, which are among the requisite skills today, may be related to each other because they cause innovation, development and progress. In creative thinking, genius and practical solutions are produced for problems while digital solutions which are based on technology are produced in the digital literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arik &amp; Arik, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Ventimiglia &amp; Pullman, 2016)</ref>. In both of these approaches, the aim is to find an innovative solution and production. Considering the widespread use of digital technology in every field today, it can be said that digital technology has an influence on creative thinking. Based on the research studies, it can also be said that using digital technology has an effect on creative thinking. Notably, there are studies in literature that are about various applications of the use of digital tools which positively affect creative thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Karakuş, Türkkan &amp; Namlı, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Akyeampong, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Smyrnaiou, Georgakopoulou &amp; Sotiriou, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Haymana &amp; Özalp, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Badeleh, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Çakır, Korkmaz, İdil &amp; Erdoğmuş, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Durak &amp; Şahin, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tiryaki &amp; Adıgüzel, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kabadayı, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Noh &amp; Lee, 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Mokhtari, MohammadKazemi &amp; Kamkari, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Alt &amp; Raichel, 2020)</ref>. However, digital literacy also includes the ethical and cultural use of digital technology. For this reason, it is thought that creative thinking disposition in the context of digital literacy will contribute to the production of creative ideas and products for humanity and nature. As creativity is a skill which can be developed through education <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Daniels &amp; Peters, 2015)</ref> and all kinds of formal and informal learning are evaluated within the scope of lifelong learning, it can be concluded that lifelong learning disposition affects creative thinking. The goal pursued in lifelong learning is to comply with changes, acquire new knowledge, and use and produce that knowledge to prevent people from alienation in life <ref type="bibr">(Erdamar, 2011)</ref>. Adjusting to changes and developments in the context of digital technology shows that a person is part of the real life. Furthermore, efforts that are put into developing digital literacy can be identified as lifelong learning. Thus, it is thought that lifelong learning disposition mediates the effect of digital literacy on creative thinking disposition. Drawing from the perspective of lifelong learning, it is necessary and fruitful to develop digital literacy and creative thinking as it is worth investigating this subject matter. In this regard, the relationships between the variables of the research are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In the model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, it demonstrates that digital literacy has a direct effect on creative thinking disposition and an indirect effect through lifelong learning disposition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim of The Study:</head><p>This research study aims to test the accuracy of the model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) on participants who were teachers. In line with the purpose of this study, the study answers the following research questions:</p><p>1. What is the effect of digital literacy on creative thinking disposition (path c)? 2. What is the effect of digital literacy on lifelong learning disposition (path a)? 3. What is the effect of lifelong learning disposition on creative thinking disposition (path b)? 4. Is there a mediating role of lifelong learning dispositon in the effect of digital literacy on creative thinking disposition (path c')?</p><p>Creativity is seen as a very important skill today and required to develop young generations' creative thinking skills through education. Hence, teachers have a responsibility to develop their students' creative thinking potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Memduhoğlu, Uçar, &amp; Uçar, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">MEB, 2021)</ref>. Teachers who are role models for their students should have creative thinking skills so as to have learners who should also think in a creative way. Therefore, this research study contributes to teacher training of creative teachers, and in turn to teacher education field. In addition, the study also contributes to the discussions about what skills are necessary to have today and to revelation the effects of using technological tools on people.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODOLOGY Design</head><p>This research, which aims to examine the direct effect of teachers' digital literacy level on the creative thinking disposition and the indirect effect through lifelong learning disposition, was employed by correlational survey method. Correlational survey is a method used to identify covariance existence as well as levels between various variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Karasar, 2014)</ref>.</p></div>

Mean values of three main variables -namely creative thinking disposition, digital literacy and lifelong learning disposition -were converted into z grades and 6 outlier points were identified between -3 and +3 levels. Outlier points were excluded from the study. Then 11 items having been identified to corrupt multiple normality by means of Mahalanobis distance were also excluded from the study. The remaining 310 were concluded to have (-1,+1) level kurtosis and skewness coefficient which means they were normally distributed. Moreover, multivariate critical level was 6 which means that this level was below 10. Therefore, multiple normality level requirement was achieved in the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gürbüz, 2019)</ref>. Descriptive statistical analysis such as mean values, standard deviation and skewness and kurtosis were applied to the collected data. Correlational analysis was also applied to see whether there was a statistically significant difference between the variables. The correlation level among variables was (r&lt;.80) which seemed not to corrupt any multiple relation level <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Büyüköztürk, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Can, 2014)</ref>. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze direct and indirect impact of teachers' digital literacy levels on creative thinking tendencies by means of lifelong learning disposition. Structural equation model is a statistical technique which is used as a combination of factor analysis and regression analysis to test the validity of a theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bayram, 2016)</ref>. The subcomponents of lifelong learning disposition which is a latent variable of the model, willingness to learn and openness to improvement were analyzed as observed variables for this latent one. Moreover, the subcomponents of creative thinking disposition-another latent variable of the model such as self-discipline, innovation search, courage, inquisitive, doubt, flexibility were also evaluated as observed ones for this latent variable. The Maximum Likelihood method was used to test the structural model because the data of the study did not violate the normality assumption.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This study aimed to examine the relationships among digital literacy, lifelong learning disposition and creative thinking disposition.</p><p>In line with the aim of this study, two models were developed explaining the direct effect of digital literacy on creative thinking disposition and its effect through lifelong learning disposition. The models were tested on teachers as the participants of this study.</p><p>This study shows that digital literacy level has a positive effect on creative thinking disposition (path c) both directly and indirectly through lifelong learning disposition (path c).</p><p>In today's information society, digital tools are used in education on the grounds that they are effective to use in learning. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Zhao et al.

In their study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Allen, Caple, Coleman, and Nguyen (2012)</ref> state that social media can be used in the development of creativity, and it can contribute to the development of personality traits such as, risk-taking and not being afraid of failure that are necessary for creativity.</p><p>The effect of digital literacy on creativity can be explained by the need for information in the process of cerativity. In the preparatory period which is the first stage of creativity, theoretical knowledge about the problem is required <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aktan, 2015)</ref>. At this stage, the research is conducted about the problem <ref type="bibr">(Öncü, 2017)</ref>. In today's information age, creative individuals can carry out the research they need in the creative process through use of digital tools. As a result of this, digital literacy skills may affect the creative thinking disposition with its contribution to obtaining information about the problem through use of digital tools, seeing different perspectives on the problem and determining possible solutions. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Zagalo and Branco (2015)</ref>, digital tools and software are not only tools that promote the development of creativity, but they are creative products. Given the fact that new syntheses are creative products <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Yeşilyurt, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Sak, 2020)</ref> among the known ones providing that they are original and appropriate, it can be said that the occupations of digital literates are creative ones. As a consequence of this, it can be concluded that the level of digital literacy is a factor affecting the creative thinking disposition.</p><p>In digital literacy, solving a problem or sharing the product in an effective way is seen as an important skill <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hague &amp; Payton, 2010)</ref>. In Judkins's opinion (2017), creative individuals can find effective ways to convey an idea to others in a memorable way. Therefore, it can be said that the efforts that digital literates put into an effective sharing are creative efforts and these efforts affect the creative thinking disposition. In addition, the finding, which indicates that lifelong learning disposition has a mediating role in the effect of digital literacy on creative thinking disposition, can be explained by the fact that teachers' efforts to develop digital literacy skills are their lifelong learning activities.</p><p>In the study, it was determined that the level of digital literacy had a positive effect on the lifelong learning disposition (path a). Therefore, it has been concluded that the disposition for lifelong learning increases as the level of digital literacy increases. Supporting the findings of the study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bahadır (2020)</ref> says that there is a positive, moderate and significant relationship between teachers' self-efficacy perceptions for using technology effectively in learning environments and their lifelong learning dispositions. Furhetmore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gürkan (2017)</ref> finds out that there is a positive, moderate and significant relationship between the technology leadership of school principals and their lifelong learning competencies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kozikoğlu and Altunova (2018)</ref> also state that there is a low-level, positive and significant relationship between teachers' lifelong learning dispositions and their knowledge, media and technology skills. Similarly, in a study conducted with pre-service teachers, Boyacı (2019) mentions that there is a positive, moderate and significant relationship between digital literacy and lifelong learning dispositions. However, in his study, <ref type="bibr">Özoğlu (2019)</ref> indicates that there is not a statistically significant relationship between digital literacy and lifelong learning tendencies. This finding contradicts the findings of the study. The reason is that Özoğlu (2019) conducted the study with first-year university students. This © 2022, Journal of Learning and Teaching in Digital Age, 7(2), 260-273</p><p>research study was conducted during the Covid 19 pandemic. During the pandemic process, teachers were given the responsibility of providing distance education to their students. This responsibility has required teachers to increase their level of digital literacy.</p><p>In order to fulfill their responsibility, it can be said that teachers' demands for their competence in digital literacy affect the lifelong learning disposition.</p><p>Digital technology has a great contribution to people's overcoming the limitations of time and space while communicating and having access to information <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kesici, 2018)</ref>. Digital tools offer an opportunity to individuals to achieve their personal development that they cannot achieve because of the obstacles such as time and space. For this reason, it can be said that the increase in the digital literacy level leads to an increase in lifelong learning disposition by having a positive impact on individual's beliefs that h/she has towards their personal development. In addition, the requirement which digital technology brings about to follow the innovations in the way things are done, promotes digital literacy level. The increase in digital literacy level positively affects the individual's lifelong learning disposition by having a positive impact on his/her self-confidence about learning new things. Furthermore, it can be concluded that motivation to have career and financial opportunities by increasing qualifications and opportunities such as open education and distance education which are provided by digital technology affect lifelong learning disposition.</p><p>In this study, lifelong learning disposition had a positive effect on creative thinking disposition (path b). Therefore, it can be concluded that the change in lifelong learning disposition had a similar effect on the creative thinking disposition. This can be explained by personality traits. Individuals who have a high level of lifelong learning have a desire to constantly improve themselves and have learned to learn <ref type="bibr">(Erdamar, 2011)</ref>. Creative individuals are people who do not see themselves as experts on a particular subject matter and who want to improve their skills and can learn things by themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Judkins, 2017)</ref>. Based on the existence of similar and compatible features of both skills, it can be said that creative thinking disposition is a factor affecting lifelong learning disposition. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Tsai (2012)</ref>, creativity is not actualized through a one-time effort. Creativity takes place at the end of a long process. This situation can be associated with lifelong learning. Therefore, it can be concluded that creative thinking disposition is affected by lifelong learning disposition.</p><p>As a consequence of this study, it should be beneficial to test the model of this study with other samples. Thus, it can be determined whether or not the relationships between the variables of the study are valid for different groups. Based on the results of the study, teachers should be provided with training to improve their digital literacy levels within the scope of lifelong learning. Thus, creative thinking can be promoted by improving the ability of teachers to solve the problems with the help of digital tools. Research studies should be employed to increase the awareness of teachers about the significance of lifelong learning in today's information society.</p><p>Teachers' field of interests should be determined and trainings or digital content should be prepared for their field of interests. Thus, lifelong learning disposition of teachers can be developed by encouraging their self-actualization. By encouraging teachers to receive education in a new field or to take postgraduate education through open and distance education, their creative thinking disposition can be promoted through lifelong learning. Teachers should be encouraged to prepare digital learning materials in their branches.</p><p>In so doing, both creative thinking skills and digital literacy skills of teachers can be developed. The use of digital tools in education should also be encouraged. Similar practices can be developed and can become common by determining the creative practices.</p><p>Ethics Committee Approval Information: Ethics committee approval for this study was received from the Ethics Committee of Siirt University (Date: September 03, 2021; Approval Number: 2021/203).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
