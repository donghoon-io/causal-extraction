<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose -Building on the sociotechnical systems theory (STS), the purpose of this paper is to investigate the direct impacts of the social and technical QMs (ISO 9001) practices on both incremental and radical product innovation and the direct relationships relaying QMs (ISO 9001) as a sociotechnical system with incremental and radical product innovation. Design/methodology/approach -The paper opted for a survey instrument to collect quantitative data from 82 Moroccan certified ISO 9001 firm. A partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to test the research hypotheses. Findings -Results show that the social and technical QMs (ISO 9001) practices do not have a significant relationship with incremental and radical product innovation when they are taken in isolation. However, when ranged together to constitute a whole sociotechnical system of QMs (ISO 9001), QMs (ISO 9001) prove to have a strong positive and significant impact on incremental product innovation and a weak positive and significant impact on radical product innovation. Research limitations/implications -Because of the small sample size that might weaken the significance of the results and the use of cross-sectional data, this research may lack a large statistical generalizability vis-à-vis the analytical generalization. Practical implications -The results provide useful implications for managers, suggesting that in order to develop their product innovation, they must ensure that both QMs (ISO 9001) social and technical practices achieve a high level of integration without allowing some quality practices to take over. Originality/value -Based on the STS, this study is the first to focus primarily on the role of the multi-dimensional structure of QMs (ISO 9001), i.e. social and technical practices, in incremental and radical product innovation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In today's aggressive global competition, firms are obliged to improve quality and promote innovation to create and safeguard their sustainable competitive advantage at the same time <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Cho and Pucik, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Pekovic and Galia, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Tushman and Nadler, 1986)</ref>. However, a traditional view considers that there is a trade-off between quality and innovation to the extent that the increase of one leads to deteriorating the other, so firms must make an exclusive choice between quality and innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Flynn, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Prajogo and Sohal, 2003)</ref>. Conversely, the modern view rejects this idea and suggests that quality and innovation can coexist together in a cumulative improvement model, and firms that achieve excellence in quality are expected to also excel in innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Prajogo and Sohal, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Zeng et al., 2015)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Nowak (1997, p. 132</ref>) "Division of quality and innovation is, to some substantial extent, largely theoretical, not practical. In practice, because of self-reinforcing and dual-direction character of the impact quality management and innovation have on one another, firms seek quality through innovation or innovate through quality improvement." Thus, quality and innovation are two necessary business orientations that complement each other to raise performance and cannot be mutually exclusive, as <ref type="bibr">McAdam et al. (1998, p. 140)</ref> said, "while quality is doing things better, innovation is doing things differently."</p><p>Over the past two decades, the quality and innovation relationship has generated widespread attention in the management literature. A review of the current studies reveals that a large body of the literature has mainly considered the role of the total quality management (TQM) in product innovation. However, less interest was presented in the quality management system QMs (ISO 9001) in the context of innovation. The limited number of studies that have studied the impact of QMs (ISO 9001) on product innovation show controversial results. On the one hand, some studies report that ISO 9001 positively influences product innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Kafetzopoulos et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Kafetzopoulos et al., , 2015;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Pekovic and Galia, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Refaie et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Wu and Chen, 2011)</ref>, since it has a set of elements that can foster innovation. While others found that QMs (ISO 9001) is negatively related to product innovation <ref type="bibr">(Magd and Curry, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Naveh and Erez, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Terziovski and Guerrero, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Wei, 2010)</ref> due to some of its components which are designed to eradicate waste and reduce variations which are inharmonious with innovation. Between the two streams there are studies that found no significant relationship between QMs (ISO 9001) and some product innovation aspects (Al- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Refaie et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Arauz and Suzuki, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bayo-Moriones et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Delić et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Huarng, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Huo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Magd et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Mangiarotti and Riillo, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Pivka and Ursic, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Yahya and Goh, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Ziegler, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>A close analysis of these studies reports a rigorous comparison between their contradictory results is difficult to carry out given the different samples, analysis methods and measurement used, though a major potential explanation of these results may be the neglected multidimensional aspects of quality management and innovation. Several authors have treated QMs <ref type="bibr">(ISO 9001)</ref> and product innovation as one-dimensional variables without taking into consideration the different QMs (ISO 9001) practices and the types of product innovation in a single analysis. Hence, the multidimensional view of quality and innovation can be a promising approach to clear up the ongoing debate about quality management and innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">(Zeng et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Abrunhosa and Moura E Sá (2008)</ref> state that it is difficult to generalize the inclusive impact of QM on innovation due to the complexity of QM that encompasses dissimilar components, and consequently can give rise to conflicting results when linked to innovation. Therefore, the relationship between QMs (ISO 9001) practices and product innovation is still unclear and the literature fails to precisely answer the question about the impact of QMs (ISO 9001) on product innovation.</p><p>The particularity of our study is that it follows the "brave" studies, in the sense of <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Davis et al. (2014)</ref>, that extend the sociotechnical systems theory (STS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Trist and Bamforth, 1951)</ref> and apply its core ideas to new management domains, besides the traditional focus on new technologies, or new types of systems that involve both social and technical components <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Eason, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Davis et al. (2014, p. 171, 172)</ref> argued, "[…] the use of socio-technical thinking to new areas may help address significant contemporary challenges offering opportunities for theoretical development <ref type="bibr">[…]</ref>. We believe the focus of socio-technical systems research to-date has been too narrow and that there are new contexts and problems that could benefit substantially from sociotechnical systems thinking." Otherwise, some authors have used the STS in the field of quality management, particularly TQM (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Carson and Stewart, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Cua et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Manz and Stewart, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Zu, 2009)</ref>, but, to the best of our knowledge, no single research has explored the consequences of social and technical practices of QMs (ISO 9001) in terms of product innovation.</p><p>Based on the STS, the aim of this study is to empirically test a conceptual framework of the relationship between QMs (ISO 9001) and product innovation. Our study seeks to contribute to a need in the literature by answering the question: How can QMs (ISO 9001) affect product innovation? First, we examine the direct impacts of the social and technical QMs (ISO 9001) practices on both incremental and radical product innovation. Then, we explore the direct relationships of QMs (ISO 9001) as a sociotechnical system with incremental and radical product innovation. To do so, the partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method was employed to analyze data drawn from 82 Moroccan certified ISO 9001 firm. The results emphasize that when the social and technical QMs (ISO 9001) practices are taken in isolation, they do not show any significant relationship with incremental and radical product innovation. Yet, when ranged together to constitute a whole sociotechnical system of QMs (ISO 9001), we noticed a positive and significant impact on both incremental and radical product innovation. This impact is remarkably stronger for incremental product innovation and weak for radical product innovation.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The first section provides a literature review and establishes the hypothesis of our conceptual research model. The second describes the study sample and the data collection procedure. Third, we present the results of the estimation of the measurement and structural models. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of the findings, theoretical and managerial implications and gives limitations and suggestions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical background and hypotheses</head><p>2.1 The social and technical practices of the quality management system (ISO 9001) Since the 1950s, researchers and managers have recognized that the technical and social organizational factors interact to influence the firm's performance. The rationale is that organizations are made up of people using tools, techniques and knowledge to produce products/services valued by customers who are part of the firm's external environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Griffith and Dougherty, 2001)</ref>. Inspired by the open systems theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(von Bertalanffy, 1969)</ref>, this new standpoint came to criticize the technological determinism <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Katz and Kahn, 1978)</ref> and to give birth to the STS that provides critical perspectives for understanding the relationships between the psychological, socio-psychological and sociological conditions of individuals, technology and organizational outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(von Bertalanffy, 1969)</ref>. The STS goes beyond the technological determinism by considering the organization as a working system with two interdependent subsystems, the social system and the technical system <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Manz and Stewart, 1997)</ref>. The social system focuses on the relationships between people, their attitudes, skills and values, While The technical system handles the processes, tasks, and technology needed to transform inputs such as raw materials to outputs such as products <ref type="bibr">(Bostrom and Heinen, 1977a, b)</ref>. Given that work systems produce both physical products and social/psychological outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Appelbaum, 1997)</ref>, the objective of the STS is to achieve a joint, balanced and synergistic optimization between the technical requirements of the organization and the needs and values of its members so that these two parties produce positive results <ref type="bibr">(Bostrom and Heinen, 1977a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Griffith et al., 1998)</ref>.</p><p>The QM and STS are broadly recognized as two utilized work design strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Manz and Stewart, 1997)</ref> that are connected due to some convergences between their theoretical frameworks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Shani and Mitki (1996)</ref> identified some shared distinct similarities between STS and QM (TQM): the two perspectives focus on the entire system; they need a strategic decision that entails major financial and resource investment and commitment; both focus on customers and improvement; their change process is substantially based on the organizational learning and; both involve modification and/or transformation of the firm's organizational culture. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Bowen and Lawler (1992)</ref>, they promote technical proficiency and some degree of employee involvement as an integral part of an organizational change endeavor <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Manz and Stewart, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Quality is a multidimensional concept and QM is a holistic philosophy of management, including different principles linked to different aspects of quality. Therefore, the application of the STS in the field of quality maintains the coexistence of intertwined social and technical subsystems in the QM reflected by a number of quality practices required by the various international quality models and standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Shah and Ward, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Wang et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Zeng et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Zu, 2009)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Spencer (1994)</ref> has explained that TQM is a management system that captures characteristics of the different mechanistic, organic and cultural organizational models and operationalize them by proposing methodologies for use (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>). Like TQM, the ISO 9001 QMs can be constituted following the same logic by incorporating some characteristics of these organizational models, since the ISO 9001 and TQM share common dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Martínez-Costa et al., 2009)</ref> and there is empirical evidence that demonstrates the strong link between ISO 9001 and TQM <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Terziovski and Guerrero, 2014)</ref>. The ISO 9000 standards can be a stepping-stone to the implementation  <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Spencer (1994)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Abrunhosa and Moura E Sá (2008, p. 210)</ref> Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. TQM and organizational models of TQM <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Antony et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Quazi and Padibjo, 1997)</ref>, or even more, it complements TQM <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Anderson et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Gotzamani and Tsiotras, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Magd and Curry, 2003)</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Jayaram et al. (2010)</ref> argue that the design of quality management systems collectively encompasses a sociotechnical mix of practices. Indeed, many authors have adopted this dichotomy of social and technical systems to study the practices of quality management in relation to performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abdullah et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Cho et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Flynn et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Rahman and Bullock, 2005)</ref>.

Excepting <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bakotić and Rogošić (2015)</ref> who studied the impact of social QMs (ISO 9001) practices on the implementation of the technical practices, practically no research has adopted this taxonomy for QMs <ref type="bibr">(ISO 9001)</ref>. This study follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bakotić and Rogošić (2015)</ref> and considers the QMs (ISO 9001) practices of leadership, customer focus, involvement of people and mutually beneficial supplier relations as social practices, whereas the technical practices embrace continual improvement, process approach, system approach to management and factual approach to decision making (Table <ref type="table">II</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Product innovation</head><p>A simpler way to distinguish innovations is to perceive them according to their area of application. In this case, innovation can be product innovation, process innovation, marketing innovation or organizational innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Damanpour, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">OECD, 2005)</ref>. Otherwise, in a highly competitive changing environment, introducing product innovation is an imperative strategy to face the aggressive competition and sustain a solid competitive advantage.</p><p>Product innovation is a new product or service developed to satisfy external customers or market need. According to the Oslo manual "A product innovation is the introduction of a good or service that is new or significantly improved with respect to its characteristics or intended uses. This includes significant improvements in technical specifications, components and materials, incorporated software, user friendliness or other functional characteristics" <ref type="bibr">(OECD, 2005, p. 4)</ref>. Therefore, product innovation can be associated with either the amelioration of existing products or the creation new market. The former reflects incremental product innovation which consists of pursuing an exploitation-based innovation strategy to primarily seek out opportunities located in firm's surrounding environment by extending existing products and services to existing customers, building on existing knowledge skills and capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(March, 1991)</ref>. The later involves radical product innovation which breaks with existing and dominant learning logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Enkel and Gassmann, 2010)</ref> through activities such as research, variation, risk-taking, experimentation and discovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(March, 1991)</ref>. Firms that engage in this exploration-based innovation strategy go beyond internal research <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Enkel et al., 2017)</ref> and experiment with new ideas and ways of doing things that generate new knowledge and skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Newman et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, we define incremental product innovation as the introduction of a significantly improved product and radical product innovation in terms of products that are new for both of the firm and the industry.</p></div>

More specifically, the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Abrunhosa and Moura E Sá (2008)</ref> proved that social practices have a positive association with the adoption of incremental product innovation. Another more recent study in the context of service firms conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Khan and Naeem (2018)</ref> concluded that social practices have a significant impact on both incremental and radical service innovation. Indeed, it appears that the social aspect of QM supports incremental and radical product innovation. This can be explained by the fact that these practices (e.g. leadership, customer focus, people involvement, mutually beneficial supplier relations) can create a fertile platform or environment for the development of different types of product innovation <ref type="bibr">(Prajogo and Sohal, 2006a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Song and Su, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Leadership is a key element of quality performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Ravichandran and Rai, 2000)</ref>, it not only drives the firm's quality strategy but also considerably guides innovation in the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Tang, 1998)</ref>.

Also, that can increase the power or pressure exercised by some departments that have a risk aversion behavior and focus more on incremental innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Manders et al., 2016)</ref>. In some cases, this can lead to intra-organizational conflicts and the disintegration of some managers during a product innovation project, especially for radical product innovation, which necessitates effective collaboration between the different departments.</p><p>Firms adopting QMs (9001) collect quality data and then act on the results obtained from the analysis of this data <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Benner and Tushman, 2002)</ref>.

The existing empirical literature recognizes the strong retroactive interaction between the social and technical practices of QM. From one side, it has been largely documented that the social practices represent the infrastructure of the successful implementation of the technical practices in regard to the development of performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Anderson et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Flynn et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Ho et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Kaynak, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Lakhal et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Patyal and Koilakuntla, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Rahman and Bullock, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Wu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Zu, 2009)</ref> or the development of innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Flynn et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Khan and Naeem, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Kim et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Zeng et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Zeng et al., , 2017))</ref>. Particularly, for the QMs (ISO 9001), <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bakotić and Rogošić (2015)</ref> found that social QMs (ISO 9001) practices are a key determinant of the technical practices.

For instance, when studying the role of the multidimensionality of TQM practices in determining quality and innovation performance, the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Prajogo and Sohal (2004)</ref> supports the coexistence of the social and technical TQM practices within the organization in a holistic manner even if these practices are contradictory in nature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Perdomo-Ortiz et al.

In order for QMs to succeed, these practices should all be implemented respectively given that QM is an integrated approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bakotić and Rogošić, 2015)</ref>. Moreover, to be able to stimulate product innovation, QMs (ISO 9001) needs to be taken as part of a broader organizational change strategy and not as a set of isolated social and technical practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Kochan et al., 1995)</ref>. Therefore, we consider that QMs (ISO 9001) is an integral and complex system of management containing interdependent social and technical subsystems that should be put into practice. Those subsystems will have a synergistic effect on incremental and radical product innovation, their complementarity helps to overwhelm the limits of one by the advantages of the other. For example, the technical practices disadvantages for radical product innovation might be reduced through the social practices. Yet, studies showed that technical practices need social ones to a better implementation for innovation; on the other side, the impact of social practices on innovation goes through technical practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Khan and Naeem, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Zeng et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Zeng et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Perdomo-Ortiz et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research methodology 3.1 Sample and data collection</head><p>As all the measurement scales were adopted from previous Anglo-Saxon literature, we opted the double-back translation method to translate them into French. This method is widely used in the social sciences to test the accuracy of the translation and to detect its errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Brislin, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Craig and Douglas, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Douglas and Craig, 2007)</ref>. Once the French version of the measurements scales was done, we prepared a first version of the questionnaire that was revised by 11 individuals: two professors in quality and marketing management, three doctoral students in economics and management, two experts in innovation surveys and market research and four quality managers. The objective was to ensure clarity of content and the understanding of questions and items, to review the length of the questionnaire, its structure, and layout. The suggestions and modifications gathered were very helpful in improving and developing the second version of the questionnaire. Then, a questionnaire pretest for this second version was conducted with 20 firms to evaluate the reliability and validity of the measurement scales within the Moroccan context. This study concerns innovative and ISO 9001 certified Moroccan firms. Since it was difficult to estimate this population of firms, we chose a non-probabilistic method, namely, the judgment sampling, to build a sample that meets the two predetermined criteria by merging the databases of the Moroccan Association of R&amp;D and the Moroccan Association of Quality and Management. From January to May 2017, we sent an e-mail with a cover letter explaining the purpose of the research and mentioning a link to the online selfadministered survey to 323 e-mail addresses randomly extracted from the merged databases. These databases include manufacturing and service firms. The questionnaire was addressed in the first place to quality managers as they are the key persons to have an important role in quality strategy and a deep understanding of the QMs (ISO 9001) of the organization. Thus, they are more qualified to understand the questions and provide relevant information about the QMs practices.</p><p>In total, we received 82 exploitable responses after rejecting 30 questionnaires with missing data and from firms that did not introduce any product innovation in the last five years. This represents a response rate of 25 percent judged tolerable in comparison with the response rates in the management studies ranging between 10 and 32 percent <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(Yusr et al., 2017)</ref>. Additionally, the number of returned responses assures the minimum sample size required to use PLS equation-modeling method (PLS-SEM). It respects the "rule of ten" stipulating that the minimum sample size should be 10 times the largest number of the regression paths pointing a construct in the inner model, or 10 times the largest number of indicators for the most complex formative construct, or 10 times the largest number of any dependent construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Barclay et al., 1995)</ref>. In our case, for example, the formative constructs of social or technical QMs (ISO 9001) practices have the largest complex multiple regression in the model with 4 regression paths each. Accordingly, we need a sample size of 4 × 10 ¼ 40. Also, the dependent variables of incremental/radical product innovation have a large number of eight indicators, so we will need 8 × 10 ¼ 80 observations. In both cases, with 82 responses, our sample appears to be sufficient to allow PLS analysis to have a satisfactory statistical power. The demographics of the sample and the profile of respondents are shown in Table <ref type="table">III.</ref> 3.2 Variables measurement 3.2.1 Independent variables. As previously discussed, the construct of QMs (ISO 9001) social practices has four dimensions of practices: leadership, customer focus, people involvement and mutually beneficial supplier relationships. Based on scales developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Lee et al. (2009)</ref> we use five items to measure leadership, customer focus and people involvement, and four items for mutually beneficial supplier relations. Similarly, the QMs (ISO 9001) technical practices construct is composed of four dimensions: continuous improvement; process approach; system approach to management; factual approach to decision making. To measure these variables, we adopted five items for continual improvement from <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Psomas and Antony, 2015)</ref>, and four items for process approach, three items for system approach to management and three items Factual approach to decision making from <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Lee et al. (2009)</ref>.</p><p>3.2.2 Dependent variables. To establish the measurement scales for this two dependent variable, eight items for each of incremental and radical product innovation were adopted from the studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Guimarães et al.

We opted for this variance-based SEM method for the following reasons: our study is concerned with the prediction of the endogenous variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Chin, 2010)</ref>. The PLS algorithm does not require data to be normally distributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. PLS has good statistical power and it is more efficient in the case of very small samples like in our study (n ¼ 82) and as noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Reinartz et al. (2009)</ref>, PLS must be applied when the research sample is lower than 250 observations. SmartPLS is also more appropriate for studies that incorporate second-order constructs in their research models.</p><p>About this latter reason, our conceptual model contains two second-order constructs and one third-order construct. Therefore, by considering all of our constructs as reflective, we started by specifying Model (1) (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) which takes into consideration the two dependent variables (incremental and radical product innovation) and the two reflective-formative second-order constructs of social and technical QMs (ISO 9001) practices.

To model these two-second order constructs, we use the repeated indicator approach which consists of repeating all the indicators of all the first order construct in the related second-order construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Becker et al., 2012)</ref>. The same approach was used to create the third-order construct of Sociotechnical QMs (ISO 9001) with social and technical practices as dimensions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p><p>The procedure of data analysis consists of two main phases: the assessment of the reliability and validity of the measurement model (outer model), and the estimation of the structural model (inner model) to test the research hypotheses.

To be considered satisfactory, composite reliability for each construct should take a value equal to or above 0.70, we supplemented it by Cronbach's α with the same rule. To assess the convergent validity, all the indicators loadings must be statistically significant and surpass 0.7, and the average variance extracted (AVE) of each construct have to be about 0.50 or higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Hair et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Henseler et al., 2009)</ref>. The discriminate validity is evaluated by the means of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref> criterion in which the AVE of each construct should be higher than the highest squared correlation with any other construct. In addition, the crossloadings method is used to verify the discriminant validity. In fact, the loadings of each indicator on its construct have to be higher than the cross-loadings on other constructs.</p><p>Since both the second-and third-order constructs are formative, the assessment of formative measurement models' guidelines is applied. Thus, we examine the multicollinearity between the lower-order constructs (VIF o5, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Hair et al., 2017)</ref> and the significance of their weights.</p><p>The estimation results in Table <ref type="table">IV</ref> verify that the measurement model meets all common requirements. First, in terms of the internal consistency, the composite reliability and Cronbach's α for each construct are acceptable because it is greater than 0.7 (Table <ref type="table">IV</ref> ). Second, the AVE scores are above the level of 0.5, and, except for one deleted indicator (CF4), from the variable customer focus, with an item loading of 0.620, all standardized item loadings of the other indicators exceed 0.7 and were significant at p o 0.01 (Table <ref type="table">IV</ref> ). Thus, all constructs achieve convergent validity. Finally, all the constructs attain the discriminant validity. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Fornell and Larcker's (1981)</ref> criterion is respected, as the square of the AVE for each construct is higher than its squared correlations with all other constructs (Table <ref type="table">V</ref> ). As well, the examination of the crossloadings of the indicators by moving across the rows and going down columns shows that each indicator loads higher on its associated construct than all of its loadings on other constructs (Table <ref type="table">VII</ref>). It is worth noting that there are some items landings that seem to be quite close to other cross-loadings. Although, and according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Chin, 2010)</ref>, it can be seen through their squares that there is a difference between them in terms of their variances with the related constructs. Providing squared results gives a more intuitive interpretation because it represents the percentage overlap between an item and any construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Chin, 2010)</ref>. For example, in our case the item CI1 share 69 percent (0.831 × 0.831) of the variance with its own construct but it just overlaps most at 51 percent (0.716 × 0.716) with the construct of the factual approach to decision making. Therefore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Chin (2010)</ref> adds that this difference may seem to be reasonable, given that the objective is to have a strong nomological network where constructs at the structural level are closely related. Table <ref type="table">V</ref> reports the assessment of the formative second and third-order constructs, it shows that their measurement models respect the required conditions. All VIFs are less than 5 and all weight are significant at p o0.001 (Tables <ref type="table">VI</ref> and<ref type="table">VII</ref>).</p></div>

Before, we should begin by analyzing the multicollinearity between the exogenous variables, the variance inflation factor (VIF) values should be below the common cut-off threshold of 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>. The VIFs for social and technical QMs (ISO 9001) are 2.70 pointing out the absence of multicollinearity issues.</p><p>The structural model's quality is made by evaluating the coefficient of determination (R²), the standardized path coefficients ( β), the effect size ( f ²) and the cross-validated redundancy (Q²) and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Hair et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Henseler, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Henseler et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Ringle et al., 2018)</ref>. Therefore, we start this second phase by running SmartPLS Algorithm to get the standardized path coefficients ( β) for each cause-effect relationship, the R² coefficients for the dependent variables, and the size effect ( f ²). Since the acceptable levels of R² depend on research context <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hair et al., 2012)</ref>, this study considers the rule of thumb proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Cohen (1988)</ref> to accept R², values of 0.26, 0.13 0.02 are respectively interpreted as substantial, medium, weak levels of predictive accuracy. For the size effect ( f ²), values of 0.02, 0.15 and 0.35 represent small, medium and large effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Cohen, 1988)</ref>. After that, the bootstrapping technique using 1,000 bootstrap resamples with no sign change <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Chin, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Hair et al., 2012)</ref> was carried out in SmartPLS to generate the statistical significance (t-values) for each path in the model.

For a specific endogenous construct, a Stone-Geisser's Q² value superior to zero states that the proposed path model has a satisfactory predictive relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Henseler et al., 2009)</ref>. Finally, the predictive relevance of the models is examined by looking at the SRMR, a value of 0.08 or 0.10 indicates that the model has a good model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Henseler et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Hu and Bentler, 1999)</ref>. All these model assessment criteria are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">VIII</ref>.</p><p>From the Model (1) (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">VIII</ref>, Bootstrapping results revealed no significant impact of social practices on incremental product innovation ( β ¼ 0.123, t-value ¼ 0.869) and radical product innovation ( β ¼ -0.079, t-value ¼ 0.419). Similarly, the technical practices do not have a significant impact on incremental product innovation ( β ¼ 0.271, t-value ¼ 1.602) and radical product innovation ( β ¼ 0.283, t-value ¼ 1.616). Therefore, H1a, H1b, H2a and H2b were rejected. Although, in terms of R², the model (1) point out that both social and technical practices respectively explained 14 and 5 percent of incremental product innovation and radical product innovation. The SRMR value for the first model was 0.078, which is less than the value of 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Hu and Bentler, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>The obtained results in Model (2) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">VIII</ref> indicate that QMs (ISO 9001) has a positive and significant impact on incremental product innovation ( β ¼ 0.375; t-value ¼ 3.538, p o0.01), in comparison to its weak impact on radical product innovation ( β ¼ 0.199; t-value ¼ 1.852; p o0.010).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion and conclusion</head><p>Quality and innovation are two complementary strategies that allow firms to face aggressive competition and sustain their competitive advantage. In spite of the amount of the literature about Quality and innovation, the relationship between these two strategies is still not deeply explored, and studies say nothing about the relationship between QMs (ISO 9001) practices and product innovation. From a sociotechnical perspective, the main purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the relationship between QMS (ISO 9001) practices and product innovation. Therefore, this paper is a first attempt to study the impact of the social and technical QMs (ISO 9001) practices on incremental and radical product innovation. A PLS SEM analysis of data from 82 Moroccan certified ISO 9001 firm conducted us to support only two hypotheses among the six hypotheses of our research model. Contrary to our expectations, we find that there is no significant relationship between the social practices of QMs (ISO 9001) and both incremental and radical product innovation. These results align with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Zeng et al. (2015)</ref>, who found that soft QM has no direct impact on innovation performance. But they contradict theoretical views and empirical evidence which reported that social practices allow firms to be more innovative <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Abrunhosa and Moura E Sá, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Feng et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Kanapathy et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Moura E Sá and Abrunhosa, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Perdomo-Ortiz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Prajogo and Sohal, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Santos-Vijande and Álvarez-González, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Song and Su, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Thai Hoang et al., 2006)</ref>. However, these are seemingly counter-intuitive and need to be interpreted with caution. A plausible theoretical explanation can be that the link between social practices and product innovation may not be in a simple direct linear form as tested in our study. Also, the social practices can be insufficient to support product innovation alone, and they need to be integrated with technical practices, which can play a mediating role in the relationship between social practices and product innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Kim et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Zeng et al., 2015)</ref>. On the other hand, a possible managerial explanation may be that Moroccan certified firms place more emphasis on the technical aspect to the detriment of the social aspect of ISO 9001. Some studies found   <ref type="formula">2</ref>)the impact of the sociotechnical QM ( <ref type="formula">9001</ref>) system on incremental and radical product innovation that organizations rely more on instrumental tools and technical methods rather than the social <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Pheng, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Seymour and Low, 1990)</ref>, because they are more popular in terms of their implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Lewis et al., 2006)</ref>, and they can be more easily observable and exactly quantified in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Calvo-Mora et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Gadenne and Sharma, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Meanwhile, our results show that QMs (ISO 9001) technical practices also have no significant relationship with incremental and radical product innovation. This can meet <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Song and Su (2015)</ref> findings that technical practices have an insignificant influence on new product development capabilities. And do not support <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">López-Mielgo et al. (2009)</ref> who indicate that technical practices will hamper product innovation but only when it is radical. These practices introduce more formalization, standardization and low variability in the organizational process which stifles the spirit of innovation within the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Beasley, 1992)</ref>. By nature, the development of incremental or radical product innovation is a creative and iterative design that generates new ideas through organizational processes variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Sethi and Sethi, 2009)</ref>. Indeed, reducing process variations may, in fact, reduce the emergence of new ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Song and Su, 2015)</ref>, and get employees trapped into current activities that are workable and convince their work routines without being open for change <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Prajogo and Sohal, 2001)</ref>. Furthermore, firms when relying more on technical practices can just improve the quality of their product, however, producing a high-product quality may not necessarily lead to incremental and radical product innovation since it is found that the technical QMs (ISO 9001) are more correlated to product quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Feng et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Prajogo and Sohal, 2006a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Prajogo and</ref><ref type="bibr">Sohal, 2003, 2004)</ref>. In fact, concentrating on technical practices does no longer appear to raise the achievement of product innovativeness beyond improved quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(Zeng et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, another possible explanation for the insignificant effect of social and technical QMs (ISO 9001) on incremental and radical product innovation can be the attitude of Moroccan innovative firms about the adoption of the QMs (ISO 9001). They are partially enthusiasts in their QMs (ISO 9001) implementation as they are more motivated by the external benefits of the ISO 9001 certification rather than internal ones. The external motivations steer the organization to focus on enhancing its quality reputation and reacting to the external pressures. That will not allow the optimization of the advantages that the organization can draw from the MQ (ISO 9001) because it will be implemented in a superficial way. "having a certificate is not the same as adopting the ISO 9001 standard" <ref type="bibr">(Manders et al., 2016, p.</ref> 3), and do not lead to the same organizational efficacy. Consequently, such partial "quality enthusiasts" attitude transform the QMs to an "iron cage" that shuts the organization and undermine the effectiveness of the QMs (ISO 9001) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Boiral, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Authors claim that the contrary effect of QM on product innovation is possibly explained by the way of QM practices implementation, firms can be more oriented by social practices or more by technical practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Martínez-Costa and Martínez-Lorente, 2008)</ref>. According to our results above, we observe that being more oriented by some specific QM practices does not ensure incremental or radical product innovation. Thus, the confirmation of the H3a and H3b reveals an interesting insight that QMs (ISO 9001) positively and significantly affect incremental and radical product innovation, even if the impact is relatively weak for the later.</p><p>Our results might share particular similarities with <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Benner and Tushman (2002)</ref> who found that ISO 9001, through process management, is more adapted to increase the potential of exploitative innovations rather than explorative ones. Therefore, QMs (ISO 9001) is likely to better support firms' incremental product innovation once the implementation and management of its social and technical practices are well adjusted. In other words, firms that operate according to social and technical practices of QMs (ISO 9001) in a combinatory fashion successfully achieve incremental product innovation. Accordingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Kafetzopoulos et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Pekovic and Galia (2009)</ref> found that top-quality level firms with effective implementation of the ISO 9001 standard is more and introducing new products faster than major competitors do.</p><p>Nonetheless, QMs (ISO 9001) only shows partial support for radical product innovation. This result does not reject the potential role that QMS (ISO 9001) can play in radical product innovation; perhaps this role should be viewed longitudinally. That means QMs (ISO 9001) may have a minor significant short-term impact on radical product innovation before producing long-term benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Bourke and Roper, 2017)</ref>. This weak impact could be contingent on other environmental or organizational factors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Blank and Naveh (2014)</ref> found that QM (ISO 9001), through quality climate, is significantly and positively associated with radical product innovation when firm establishes a high information exchange climate. Otherwise, the structure of the ISO 9001 standard and its tenet of continuous improvement philosophy made it incrementally oriented and do not largely favorite the development of radical product innovation. Moreover, through its intense internal focus, this standard partially encourages firms open innovation strategy required to develop radical innovation, or even negatively <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Roldán Bravo et al., 2017)</ref>. However, the implications of QMs (ISO 9001) for radical product innovation should not be completely rejected, we argue that the standard, until now, can facilitate this type of innovation only just in a very constrained manner.</p><p>Our findings support the idea that the system is a whole rather than a sum of simple practices arranged together. They are generally consistent with studies that used the STS in QM and confirm that the implementation of both the social and technical practices allows firms to achieve the best performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Cua et al. (2001)</ref> showed that the joint optimization of both the socially oriented common practices and the technically oriented basic TQM, JIT and TPM techniques is necessary for achieving performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Ho et al., (2001)</ref> found that the interdependent nature of TQM, between social and technical practices, positively affects quality performance. Results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Zu (2009)</ref> also indicates that the social and technical QM practices interact and both positively influence quality performance. Considering product innovation as an outcome to explain, we have already identified that the social and technical aspects of QMs (ISO 9001) are symbiotic, must be designed jointly without taking a logical superiority over each other. When we test the direct impact of social and technical practices on incremental and radical product innovation, the relationships were not significant. While, when the two are integrated to form a sociotechnical QMs (ISO 9001), we detect a positive and significant association between QMs (ISO 9001) as a whole with incremental and radical product innovation. These explicitly address that product innovation required the implementation of a sociotechnical QMs (ISO 9001) that proficiently fit its two social and technical subsystems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Theoretical and managerial implications</head><p>The contribution of this paper can be twofold. Theoretically, our study is the first research that is especially interested in the social and technical practices of QMs (ISO 9001) and their relations with incremental and radical product innovation. In fact, we contribute to the field of sociotechnical systems design by using the sociotechnical thinking in the area of quality management as authors (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Davis et al., 2014)</ref> have suggested it. By doing so, this study shows that QMs (ISO 9001), similarly to TQM, is a multidimensional management framework that encompasses both social and technical subsystems differently to certain authors who consider QMs (ISO 9001) from a very narrow point of view by reducing it as a whole to a technical practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Bourke and Roper, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Prajogo and Sohal, 2004)</ref>. However, our findings contrast with the studies on the relationship between TQM and innovation that generally show that social and technical TQM practices have a differential impact on incremental or radical product innovation. This study reveals that social and technical QMs (ISO 9001) generally have a synergistic effect on product innovation, with a particular emphasis incremental product innovation.</p><p>From a managerial perspective, our results provide valuable implications for firms from developing countries like Morocco engaged in QMs (ISO 9001) that seek to develop product innovations. The generalization of the results to other countries with lower middle income like Morocco may be possible, as North African, sub-Saharan and Middle Eastern economies. However, some contextual factors should be integrated into our conceptual model, considering the existence of socio-cultural differences in QM practices (ISO 9001) implementation and innovation. In that sense, our study fills one the several literature gaps in research in the area of QM which is the application of QM systems in developing countries. By showing that their product innovations can depend on the way they adopt QMs (IS0 9001), managers should first review the level of the implementation of their quality management system, correcting its anomalies and ensure that both social and technical practices achieve a high level of integration without allowing some quality practices taking over the others. For instance, an inefficient integration of social practices will deteriorate the effectiveness of the technical practices, and vice versa, then that will condemn firm's innovation capacity that can be achieved from the overall QM (ISO 9001) implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Kaynak, 2003)</ref>. In fact, a high level of integration will enhance the efficacy of their product innovation process. Because the social practices are more needed to help some functions like the research and development (R&amp;D) in the ideation phase of the process whilst the technical practices are required to assist production at the new product industrialization phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Prajogo and Sohal, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Watson and Rao Korukonda, 1995)</ref>. This can be more pronounced for incremental product innovation. While concerning radical product innovation, managers should establish an information exchange climate that facilitates to QMs (ISO 9001) not only the exploitation of current knowledge but also the search for new knowledge through novel approaches to problem solving that are required to producing radical product innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Blank and Naveh, 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Limitations and future research</head><p>Our study admits some limitations. First, the small sample size weakened the significance of the results and the use of cross-sectional data limited our ability to determine the causal effect of QMs (ISO 9001) practices on incremental and radical product innovation. This study must be replicated on a large sample size with a panel data to determine the effect of QMs (ISO 9001) in short and large term since the benefits of the implementation of QM practices cannot be reached instantly, also taking into consideration the experience effect of QM implementation that may moderate its impact on product innovation. This impact can also be moderated by some other important variables, especially the firm's internal and external motivations for certification, in addition to firm size and the type of industry.</p><p>Second, the questionnaire was largely filled out by the quality managers. The subjective nature of the data collected through these respondents may imply the risk of a social desirability bias as quality managers are overly positive about their QM systems and its impacts. In addition to the quality managers, collecting data from the marketing and R&amp;D managers will help to better understand the impact of the QM (ISO 9001) on product innovation.</p><p>Third, our research just catches that there is a synergistic effect of social and technical QMs (ISO 9001) practices on product innovation but do not deeply explain how the synergy between the two categories of practices occurs in product innovation. Researchers are invited to investigate how innovative firms manage these social and technical aspects of QMs (ISO 9001) at the new product development project level. On the other hand, we suggest future research to introduce the complementary role that some firm's strategic orientation, e.g. market orientation or entrepreneurial orientation, can play supporting QMs (ISO 9001) impact on incremental and radical product innovation and, in turn, enhance financial performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(El Manzani et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2017)</ref>. Finally, the effective role of the new ISO 9001: 2015 QMs in product innovation must be investigated, as the majority of the firms in our sample have not yet switched from the ISO 9001:2008 to the new version.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 2.
