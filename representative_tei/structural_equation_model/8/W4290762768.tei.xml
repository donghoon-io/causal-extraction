<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In this study, the research titled as "Trust Building Model of Customers on B2C Websites: A Research on Generation Y Customers" was repeated by using a partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Civelek &amp; Ertemel, 2018)</ref>. The sample size limitation is the most important reason for repeating this work. In the sample, also distribution is nonnormal because small sample size mostly leads to non-normal distribution. A comparison was made between the results found in both methods.</p><p>Recently, structural equation modeling method is increasingly used in scientific studies in the field of social sciences. The reason behind the spread of this statistical technique is that the direct and indirect relationships among the variables can be measured in a single model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Meydan &amp; Şen, 2011)</ref>. Another reason for the widespread adoption of this method is the taking of the measurement errors in to consideration. In this way, measurement errors can be minimized <ref type="bibr">(Civelek, 2018)</ref>. For complex models, the reason behind preferring structural equation modeling method instead of traditional regression analysis is that indirect effects among variables can be explained. Because in traditional regression analysis, only direct effects can be detected. In the method of structural equation modeling (SEM), direct and indirect effects are detected together. In the method of structural equation modeling, measurement model and structural model can be tested together. It is, therefore, superior to multiple regression <ref type="bibr">(Civelek, Essentials of Structural Equation Modeling, 2018)</ref>. There is one dependent variable in the multiple regression. However, there may be more than one dependent variable in the structural model in SEM, and a variable can be both a dependent variable and an independent variable in the same time. In SEM analyzes, more than one regression model can be analyzed at the same time, and indirect and direct effects can be measured at the same time. The indirect effect arises from the intervention of a variable that assumes the mediator role between two variables. The sum of the direct effect and the indirect effect of a variable on another variable is called the total effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Raykov &amp; Marcoulides, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>There may be some cases where the assumptions of the estimation methods used in the structural equation modeling method are not met by the existing data set. In the small sample size case, there are methods that can be used if it is necessary to be satisfied with the existing data. The most used and preferred one of these methods for small sample size is partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method.</p><p>Structural equation modeling is also called covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) because it is based on the covariance matrix. But PLS-SEM is a variance-based analysis method. For this reason, it is also called as the variance-based structural equation modeling. The PLS-SEM method is an advantageous method when the assumptions of least squares are neglected. This is a second generation multivariate analysis method that allows measurement and structural models to be analyzed together. Therefore it is an alternative to CB-SEM. PLS-SEM is an explanatory analysis method but CB-SEM is confirmatory method <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hair, Hult, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2017)</ref>. According to some sources in the literature, covariance-based structural equation modeling is a more powerful and reliable method. For this reason, the partial least squares method is generally preferred in cases where the following conditions are found: Insufficient sample size, non-normal distribution, the number of indicators connected to the latent variable is less than three, there is multicollinearity, there is missing value and the number of observations is less than the number of explanatory variables. In the cases that these conditions are found PLS-SEM is a much superior method to CB-SEM because it reduces the unexplained variance to a minimum level. As the model becomes more complicated no larger sampling is required in PLS-SEM by contrast with CB-SEM. There is a 10-fold rule in the literature about the sample sensitivity of the PLS-SEM method. According to this rule, in the measurement models, 10 times sample size is required for the number of indicators used to measure the constructs. In structural models also there is a requirement to have 10 times sample size for the paths <ref type="bibr">(Barclay, Higgins, &amp; Thompson, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Besides, PLS-SEM is a non-parametric method since it does not have any distributional assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hair, Hult, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2017)</ref>. It is also an explanatory approach, which is why it is preferred in exploratory research. In other words, when the theory is under developed and relations need to be explained, it can be said that researchers prefer to use PLS-SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Rigdon, 2012)</ref>. In the literature, there are some sources that demonstrate the advantages of the PLS-SEM method <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Henseler, Dijkstra, Sarstedt, Ringle, Diamantopoulos, &amp; Straub, 2014)</ref>. Despite some drawbacks, PLS-SEM has become an increasingly used method in scientific studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hair, Hult, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2017)</ref>. In the CB-SEM method, many of the fit indices are influenced by sample size. In some papers, minimum sample size for CB-SEM analysis is recommended as 150 <ref type="bibr">(Bentler &amp; Chou, 1987)</ref>. The minimum sample size that must be used in the CB-SEM is recommended as at least 10 times the number of parameters that can be estimated in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jayaram, Kannan, &amp; Tan, 2004)</ref>. In some papers in the literature, it is also stated that the sample size for CB-SEM should be within the range of 200-500 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Çelik &amp; Yılmaz, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The most important assumption of the maximum likelihood estimation method is the multivariate normal distribution. This assumption is often violated because ordinal and discrete scales are generally used in social sciences. Also, when the sample size is low, the normal distribution condition is usually not fulfilled. Violation of the assumption of multivariate normal distribution of observed variables cause high χ 2 /DF value and significant test outcome. In case of violation of this assumption, it is recommended to use different estimation methods such as weighted least squares (WLS) instead of the maximum likelihood. This method can be used if the data is continuous but does not meet the normal distribution. Other prediction methods that can be preferred in non-normal distribution are ADF (asymptotically distribution free), MLM (Robust Maximum Likelihood) and GLS (generalized least squares) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001)</ref>. In CB-SEM, as the complexity level of the model increases, the number of observations must also be increased. It is also necessary to increase the number of data in case of the distribution is non-normal <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kline, 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background 2.1. Word of Mouth</head><p>Word of mouth (WoM) is defined as an interpersonal communication regarding a brand between a receiver and a communicator. The receiver perceives this communication as <ref type="bibr">noncommercial (Arndt, 1967)</ref>. WoM communication is implicitly more trustworthy and in WoM none of the participants are marketing sources <ref type="bibr">(Bone, 1995)</ref>. Further, in order for the communication to be considered as WoM, the medium should also be perceived as independent of the brand. With the advent of the digital revolution, an electronic extension of WoM, eWoM has evolved. eWoM is defined as any positive or negative statement made by consumers about a brand which is made available to a multitude of people via the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hennig-Thurau et. al, 2004)</ref>. Existing literature measure WoM with different dimensions. One important dimension is the WoM content that focuses on what's being said about the brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Higie et al, 1987)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Higie et al (1987)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Bone (1992)</ref> have studied this WoM dimension. Another dimension is WoM intensity, which can be identified as the scope of WoM and studied extensively by Godez et all ( <ref type="formula">2004</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Harrison-Walker (2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Brand Awareness</head><p>Brand awareness can be defined as "the ability of a potential buyer to recognize or recall that a brand is a member of a certain product category <ref type="bibr">(Aaker, 1991)</ref>. Brand recognition takes place when consumers are exposed to brand-oriented messages. Brand awareness provides added value to a brand which creates familiarity, and hence commitment from consumers <ref type="bibr">(Aaker, 1991)</ref>. Brand recall can be defined as the consumers' ability to retrieve brand-related information from their memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Brand Trust</head><p>In e-commerce context, the brand trust is defined as a set of beliefs of consumer regarding defined characteristics and possible future behavior of the e-commerce site. Brand trust affects customer attitudes towards web site <ref type="bibr">(Lee et.al, 2005)</ref> and intention to purchasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Quelch and Klein, 1996)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research Model and Hypotheses</head><p>The theoretical model is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. This model aims to clarify the relationships among word of mouth, brand awareness and brand trust. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hoyer (1990)</ref> and MacDonald et all (2000) WoM affects brand awareness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hoyer (1990)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">MacDonald and Sharp (2000)</ref> pointed out the role of WoM on brand awareness in consumer buying behavior. According to some research in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Smith and</ref><ref type="bibr">Wheeler, 2002, Macdonald and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sharp, 2000)</ref>, brand awareness has a relationship with trust. Prior studies show that a brand with high brand awareness leads to higher brand trust and stimulate purchase behavior and that if consumers are more familiar with a brand, they would be more likely to trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Smith &amp; Wheeler, 2002)</ref>. Thus, in the light of the existing literature, following hypotheses were put forward:</p><p>H 1 : WOM Intensity (WIN) has a positive effect on Brand Awareness (BAW).</p><p>H 2 : WOM Content (WOC) has a positive effect on Brand Awareness (BAW).</p><p>H 3 : Brand Awareness (BAW) has a positive effect on Brand Trust (BTR).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Research Method</head><p>When the sample size is low, the data usually does not distribute normally. Firstly, therefore, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests were conducted to assess the normal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Sarstedt &amp; Mooi, 2014)</ref>. In case of the data is continuous but does not meet the normal distribution, in CB-SEM there are different estimation methods instead of the maximum likelihood (ML) such as asymptotically distribution free (ADF) and generalized least squares (GLS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001)</ref>. Therefore, before comparing CB-SEM and PLS-SEM, a comparison was conducted among different estimation methods in CB-SEM. Finally results of CB-SEM and PLS-SEM were compared.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Measures and Sampling</head><p>The scales adopted by Han et al. from prior studies were used to measure brand awareness and brand trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Han, Nguyen, &amp; Lee, 2015)</ref>. To measure the eWOM, the scale developed by Goyette et al. was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Goyette, Ricard, Bergeron, &amp; Marticotte, 2010)</ref>. 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree was used. More than 400 distributed, 305 valid questionnaires were gathered from prominent cities throughout Turkey. 171 of the respondents are male and 134 are female. The most important limitation of this research is the sample size. Although preferred sample size is more than 400, due to practical constraints, only 305 valid sample size has been reached. Nevertheless, validity and reliability of the scale has been determined.To assess convergent validity, confirmatory factor analysis was performed. CFA results indicated that the model has good fit: χ2/DF =1.266, CFI=0.974, IFI=0.975, RMSEA= 0.047. In order to assess discriminant validity, the square roots of average variance extracted values were compared with correlation values of the constructs. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, the diagonals demonstrate the square root of AVE value of each variable. And as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, the square roots of average variance extracted values are beyond the correlation values in the same column (Byrne, 2010). Reliability of each construct individually calculated. Composite reliability and Cronbach α values are beyond the threshold level (i.e. 0.7) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>. Average variance extracted values, composite reliabilities, , Cronbach α values and Pearson correlation coefficients of the constructs are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Comparison of the Analyses Results</head><p>In order to assess the normality, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests were applied. The results of these tests are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. As shown in the Table, all of the constructs do not fit normal distribution assumption. Shapiro-Wilk test is more reliable in the small sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Durmuş, Yurtkoru, &amp; Çinko, 2013)</ref>.   In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, the results obtained by different estimation methods of maximum likelihood (ML), asymptotically distribution free (ADF) and generalized least squares (GLS) are shown. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>, size and significance of path coefficients estimate values calculated in CB-SEM and PLS-SEM methods are compared with each other. PLS-SEM depends upon bootstrap procedure to test the significance of the estimates because it is a nonparametric statistical method. In the significance level of 5%, p values smaller than 0.05 are considered as significant. When comparing the results obtained by two different methods, all of the hypotheses test results are found consistent.  In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, CB-SEM structural model is shown. This model was analyzed by using maximum likelihood estimation method. In order to evaluate the structural model, the absolute and relative goodness of fit indices were used. The absolute goodness of fit indices are the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and the χ 2 goodness of fit statistic.  In CB-SEM, evaluation of the model relies on goodness of fit measures which are based on the fit between empirical and theoretical covariance matrix. But in PLS-SEM, the most used evaluation measures are R 2 (explained variance), f 2 (effect size) and Q 2 (predictive relevance)</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, path analysis results in PLS-SEM are shown. Coefficient indicates the direct relations. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>, comparison of R 2 values of the dependent latent variables are shown. In PLS-SEM, the most used measure to assess the path models is the coefficient determination (R 2 ). R 2 value indicates the predictive power of the model and refers to combined effects of exogenous latent variables on an endogenous latent variable and represents the amount of variance explained <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hair, Hult, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2017)</ref>. There is rule of thumb for acceptable value of R 2 that differs according to the discipline. In consumer behavior area 0.20 R 2 value can be considered as high. For this study, the values in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref> can be considered as acceptable (Hair, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, PLS-SEM: Indeed a silver bullet, 2011). Effect size f 2 is a measure of the impact of a construct on another. It is calculated by omitting the construct from the model. Effect size f 2 represents the change in R 2 when a construct omitted from the model. To assess f 2 , following values of 0.02, 0.15 and 0.35 are used. These values represent respectively, small, medium and large effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cohen, 1988)</ref>. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref>, effect size values are shown. In PLS-SEM, another measure to assess the models is predictive relevance (Q2). This value is also called as Stone-Geisser's Q2 value <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Geisser, 1974)</ref>  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Therefore skewness and kurtosis measures were additionally examined. In Table2, skewness and kurtosis values of the constructs are shown.

Q2 values are calculated for dependent variables in the model and indicate predictive relevance of path model for a dependent variable specifically. To calculate Q2 values, blindfolding procedure is used. Blindfolding procedure depends upon omission of data points. Q2 values larger than 0 indicate that the model has predictive relevance for a certain dependent variable. Conversely, values of zero or below indicate lack of predictive relevance. In Table 9, Q2 values of each construct are shown.</figDesc><table /></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_10"><head>Table 9 . Q 2 Values of the Dependent Variables in PLS-SEM</head><label>9</label><figDesc>Both statistical methods produced consistent and robust results. These results, therefore, provided a confirmation of the theoretical research model. All the hypotheses were supported by the tests conducted both CB-SEM and PLS-SEM. Although consistent results were obtained in both methods analysis conducted in CB-SEM resulted in significantly higher R 2 values than PLS-SEM. Squared multiple correlations for each endogenous construct in CB-SEM model are relatively high. But, in PLS-SEM model, R 2 values of BAW and BTR can be considered as moderate and weak respectively. Consequently, finding of this study highlighted the differences between CB-SEM and PLS-SEM and also compared the results obtained different estimation methods of ML, ADF and GLS under non-normal distribution and small sample size limitations. While PLS-SEM is the most preferred method to handle small sample sizes and non-normal data distribution, results obtained in CB-SEM are non-contradictory..
