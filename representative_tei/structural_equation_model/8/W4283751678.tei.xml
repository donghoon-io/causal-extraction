<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of civic and political engagement in schools: A structural equation model of democratic school characteristics' influence on different types of participation</head><p>Existing literature has argued that effective citizenship education focuses on more than the teaching of civic knowledge and provides opportunities for participation that foster the development of citizenship skills and efficacy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lawy &amp; Biesta, 2006)</ref>. The perception that one's school is characterized by opportunities for open discussion, student influence, critical reflection, and active engagement can be part of youth positive development of participatory citizenship.</p><p>The present study seeks to contribute to recent research examining how students' experience of democratic citizenship at school fosters civic and political participation. The study focuses on the influence of perceived school characteristics on participative behaviors through the increase of factors such as trust, efficacy, and interest. Citizenship education at school, however, often refers to a normative idea of civic and political engagement, in which dissent and criticism of existing power relations are rarely contemplated <ref type="bibr">(Zimenkova, 2013)</ref>. In this sense, schools' characteristics might be oriented toward promoting dutiful citizenship and conventional forms of participation, but not critical and lifestyle-based forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bennett et al., 2009)</ref>. To explore this, we extend previous analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Tzankova et al., 2021)</ref> by examining the effects of school democratic characteristics on different forms of participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Democratic School Characteristics</head><p>Several authors have stressed the importance of providing opportunities for open and respectful discussions in the classroom, as well as centering the school climate around democratic values <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ehman, 1980)</ref>. Democratic school climate has been shown to promote political attitudes and behaviors, when students feel they can discuss topics openly in the classroom, take part in decisionmaking at school, and that there is fair treatment at their school (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Flanagan et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Geboers et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lenzi et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Torney-Purta, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>This item was downloaded from IRIS Università di Bologna (<ref type="url" target="https://cris.unibo.it/">https://cris.unibo.it/</ref>)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>When citing, please refer to the published version.</head><p>There is also increasing attention to the need to foster critical active citizenship by providing opportunities for participation and reflection in a supportive and challenging environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ferreira et al., 2012)</ref>. Schools can be pivotal in offering experiences that allow critical thinking and the consideration and integration of plural diverse perspectives for adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ferreira et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Piedade et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">ten Dam &amp; Volman, 2004)</ref>. The contribution of perceived critical reflection at school to the promotion of civic participation, however, has received limited attention in empirical research in comparison to democratic school climate and student participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Tzankova et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, schools can involve students in their governance and recognize them as social agents with claims and interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lawy &amp; Biesta, 2006)</ref>. Democratic experiences can be offered through structures for student participation, such as student elections and councils, extra-curricular activities, student projects, and networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Flanagan et al., 2007)</ref>. Previous research has shown that opportunities for active learning lead to greater civic participation in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Davies et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kahne &amp; Sporte, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Democratic Schools and Promotion of Trust, Efficacy, and Interest</head><p>Different school characteristics have been investigated as explanatory variables of engagement attitudes and behaviors. However, contributions analyzing multiple democratic experiences and the processes that could explain the promotion of active participation are rare. In the present study, we investigate how perceived democratic school characteristics could promote different types of civic and political participation through the increase of institutional trust, efficacy beliefs, and political and social interest.</p><p>Existing research has shown that an open classroom climate contributes to the development of institutional trust (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barber et al. 2015)</ref>. Participating in school councils has also been shown to predict higher trust in institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Claes &amp; Hooghe, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>This item was downloaded from IRIS Università di Bologna (<ref type="url" target="https://cris.unibo.it/">https://cris.unibo.it/</ref>)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>When citing, please refer to the published version.</head><p>The value that the school attributes to the participation of students in the school environment can strengthen students' beliefs in their abilities to act and engage concretely <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Schulz et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Empirical evidence suggests that democratic school climate and classroom deliberation increase perceptions of political efficacy among students <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barber et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pasek et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sohl &amp; Arensmeier, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Political interest has also been shown to be influenced by participation in school councils <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Claes &amp; Hooghe, 2017)</ref> and, less strongly, by open classroom climate (García-Albacete, 2013).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Types of Participation</head><p>Distinctions have been drawn between political and civic forms of participation. Political participation has been defined as having the aim of shaping governmental decisions directly or indirectly by influencing the making of public policy or the selection of policymakers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Verba et al., 1995)</ref>. Civic participation, by contrast, refers to voluntary activity focused on helping others, achieving a public good, or participating in the life of a community to effect change <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barrett &amp; Zani, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Another common differentiation is between conventional or institutionalized forms of activity related to the electoral process and the support of representative democracye.g., voting, party membership, election campaigningand unconventional or non-institutionalized forms beyond the electoral sphere, including activism and consumer behaviore.g., protesting, involvement in social movements, signing petitions, political consumption, boycotting <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barrett &amp; Zani, 2015)</ref>. Non-institutionalized engagement may also take advantage of online opportunities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Oser et al., 2013)</ref> and political and cause-related consumption (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gotlieb &amp; Thorson, 2017)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>When citing, please refer to the published version.</head><p>climate, for example, increases institutional trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barber et al. 2015)</ref>. However, political trust has generally been related to the promotion of institutional and conventional activities, rather than noninstitutionalized and critical engagement (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hooghe &amp; Marien, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tzankova et al., 2022)</ref>. It is not clear what school factors and pathways may provide greater support for engagement in noninstitutionalized or protest-based participation. Previous research has been limited to predicting expected future participation without differentiation of activities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Castillo et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lenzi et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Manganelli et al., 2015)</ref>. We seek to fill such gaps in empirical studies by examining the effects of school factors on levels of past engagement in multiple types of activities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aims and Conceptual Model</head><p>The two-wave study seeks to contribute to the understanding of the effect of democratic experiences at school on different types of youth participation in four different European countries in the North, South, Central, and Eastern Europe. We examine how perceived democratic school climate, opportunities for critical reflection and student participation relate to different forms of participative behaviors at a one-year interval through their effects on psychological factors such as civic and political trust, efficacy, and interest.</p><p>Based on the literature presented above, the overall conceptual model and corresponding hypotheses are presented in Error! Reference source not found.. These were tested through four models with different types of participation as the outcomecivic, political, activist, and lifestyle/online. We adopt the use of temporally separated measures, with the advantage to reduce common method bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Podsakoff et al., 2012)</ref>. The model evaluates the following pathways.</p><p>[Insert Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>] Firstly, perceiving a higher democratic school climate at Time 1 is hypothesized to be directly related to higher participation at Time 2 (H1).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>When citing, please refer to the published version.</head><p>Time 2 is predicted by perceiving to have more experiences of critical reflection at school at Time 1 (H2) and by student participation at school at Time 1 (H3).</p><p>Moreover, institutional trust, political efficacy, and political interest are evaluated as mediators between school characteristics and participation. It is expected that a higher democratic school climate predicts higher institutional trust (H4), political efficacy beliefs (H5), and political interest at Time 2 (H6). We also hypothesize that higher critical reflection at school at Time 1 is positively related to political efficacy (H8), and political interest at Time 2 (H9). Student participation at school at Time 1 is also expected to predict higher institutional trust (H10), political efficacy (H11), and political interest at Time 2 (H12). In turn, we expect that participation at Time 2 is influenced positively by higher political efficacy (H13), and higher political interest at Time 2 (H14). Since the effect of political trust has been shown to be ambivalent and to vary according to the type of activity, we do not formulate specific hypotheses on the expected relationship between trust and participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and procedure</head><p>The data were collected in two waves, in 2016 and 2017, in four European countries -Italy, Sweden, Germany, and the Czech Republic. The data collection was part of the European-funded H2020 research project CATCH-EyoU (Grant Agreement 64538). Adolescents, aged between 14 and 19 years old, filled out a self-report questionnaire mostly on paper (90%), as well as online (10%). The study was approved by the ethic committees in each country. The participants were approached in upper secondary schools from different school tracks (i.e., lower and higher). To allow for the pairing of data between waves and protect data privacy, participants were instructed to create anonymous codes. The procedure could result in the exclusion of participants due to spelling mistakes, identical codes, or change in schools and classes. Attrition rates varied between countries:</p><p>This item was downloaded from IRIS Università di Bologna (<ref type="url" target="https://cris.unibo.it/">https://cris.unibo.it/</ref>)</p></div>

Attrition analysis showed differences for the Czech and German samples in variables such as place of residence, country of birth, income, and school track. Overall, there were mean-level changes between the two waves of the survey consistent with developmental changes in adolescence, but these could also be related to broader events throughout the year (e.g., elections; Noack &amp; Macek, 2017).</p><p>The final sample consisted of 1589 participants (51.1% were female; 48.7% were male).</p><p>The distribution across countries was as follows: 685 (43.1%) from Italy, 226 (14.2%) from Sweden, 263 (16.6%) from Germany, and 415 (26.1%) from the Czech Republic. The average age of the participants was 16.65 years old (SD = 1.16) at the time of the first wave of data collection.</p><p>Students coming from a higher school track were 74.3% of the sample. Those with a migrant backgroundborn abroad or with parents who were born abroadwere 19.3%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>The independent variables were all measured at Time 1 (T1) in the first wave of the survey in winter 2016. The mediators and the outcomes were measured one year later in the survey's second wave at Time 2 (T2). Moreover, country, school track, age, gender, and perceived family income were controlled for. </p></div>

The reliability was good (α = .83) and consistently acceptable across countries (α &gt; .74).</p><p>Critical Reflection at School. Critical reflection at school was measured by three items on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree), corresponding to the dimension of reflection within the Quality of Participation Experiences Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ferreira et al., 2012</ref>; e.g., "I have observed conflicting opinions that brought up new ways of perceiving the issues in question").</p><p>Cronbach's alpha was .76 and consistently acceptable across countries (α &gt; .72).</p><p>Student Participation at School. Participants were asked whether in the past year they: had represented other students in student councils or in front of teachers or principals; had been active in a student group or club; had been active in a school sports group or club. Answers were dichotomous and a composite score was obtained by summing the three items (range 0-3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediator Variables at Time 2</head><p>Institutional Trust. Institutional trust was measured by two items assessing trust in European and national institutions (e.g., "I trust the national government"). Both were measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree), with sufficient reliability (α = .68). Cronbach's alpha was above .61 across countries.</p><p>Political and Societal Interest. Interest in politics, European and national politics, and societal issues were measured by four items on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree), adapted from Amnå and colleagues (2010). An example was "How interested are you in politics?". The reliability was very good (α = .86), and consistently acceptable (α &gt; .83) across countries.</p><p>Political Efficacy. Two items adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barrett and Zani (2015)</ref> assessed collective efficacy (e.g., "I think that by working together, young people can change things for the better").</p><p>This item was downloaded from IRIS Università di Bologna (<ref type="url" target="https://cris.unibo.it/">https://cris.unibo.it/</ref>)</p></div>

The analysis took into account the nested structure of the data according to classrooms. In particular, standard errors and a chi-square test of model fit were computed taking into account clustering, using a sandwich estimator for standard error computation. We estimated the structural model separately on each type of participation (civic, political, activist, or lifestyle and online) as endogenous latent outcomes. Students' country, age, gender, perceived family income, and school track were included as observed control covariates.</p><p>Additionally, to examine the specific cross-country differences, we performed multiple group analyses through structural equation modelling with partial least squares using the Stata This item was downloaded from IRIS Università di Bologna (<ref type="url" target="https://cris.unibo.it/">https://cris.unibo.it/</ref>)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present research sought to examine the role of school-related opportunities that impact the development of youth participation in four European countries. The paper seeks to fill gaps in the literature by analyzing multiple democratic experiences and the processes that could explain the promotion of actual active participation in civic, political, activist, and lifestyle/online activities among adolescents.</p><p>The results indicate that students' perceptions of openness in the classroom, fairness, and influence in schools' decision-making seem to influence the perception of institutions and to promote greater confidence in personal and collective civic abilities. These results are consistent with previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barber et al. 2015)</ref>. However, contrary to what could be expected, democratic school climate did not influence reported civic and political participation activities in our sample, while it even decreased activist and lifestyle/online participation. This suggests that the benefits of perceived school climate were not enough to promote engagement in contrast to other school opportunities for democratic experience. It should be noted that previous research has reported an association between civic engagement and participation intentions rather than actual participation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Quintelier, &amp; Hooghe, 2013)</ref>. The association between student civic engagement and school climate is more complicated than previously expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Geller et al., 2013)</ref>, and future theorizing cannot take for granted the impact of democratic school climate on civic and political participation. Moreover, school climate had small contrasting effects on lifestyle/online and activist behavior through institutional trust and political efficacy. Indeed, political trust has a varying relationship to different activities in our results. It does not influence traditional civic participation, while it is negatively related to political and non-institutionalized behavior. In this sense, the discontent that such forms entail may be tempered by promoting trust through a democratic school climate. Our findings suggest that school climate's role in promoting trust in authorities and This item was downloaded from IRIS Università di Bologna (<ref type="url" target="https://cris.unibo.it/">https://cris.unibo.it/</ref>)</p></div>

Moreover, participation in student councils and extra-curricular groups was associated directly with civic, activist, and lifestyle/online participation as well. These findings give support to the claim that schools promote broader civic development toward self-actualizing citizenship (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bennett et al., 2009)</ref> when they represent supportive and challenging environments, in which students can experience opportunities for participation and reflection <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ferreira et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Piedade et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The results also suggest that there are cross-national differences in the studied variables.</p><p>Students from Sweden and Germany showed greater efficacy, trust, and lifestyle/online participation than Italian and Czech participants. Czech students also showed lower activism.</p><p>Additional analyses also suggest that there are some differences in the strength of effects among the countries (see Appendix B). These variations could be related to macro-institutional determinants related to the level of democratic development, the socio-economic conditions, and the political culture of the state <ref type="bibr">(Vráblikova &amp; Císar, 2015)</ref>. According to the EIU Democracy Index 2017 (The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2018), for example, Sweden and Germany are ranked as "full democracies", while Italy and the Czech Republic are ranked as "flawed democracies". Future cross-national comparative research could shed more light on the national political and educational contexts that determine variations in school-based democratic experiences. Multilevel studies could provide important evidence of the interplay between national and individual factors, which was not possible in the present study due to the low number of countries involved.</p><p>This item was downloaded from IRIS Università di Bologna (<ref type="url" target="https://cris.unibo.it/">https://cris.unibo.it/</ref>)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>When citing, please refer to the published version.</head><p>While the study is based on non-representative data, it presents a large sample from several European countries which gives us confidence in the results. The inclusion of both large and small countries with different traditions of democratic experience provides cultural representativeness to the study. Further research with large-scale representative samples, however, would help confirm our findings. Moreover, the inclusion of non-European countries could provide greater insight into the possibility to generalize our findings. Moreover, longitudinal designs with longer periods and more time points would help understand better the development of civic and political attitudes in relation to democratic school factors over time. Finally, one measure used in this study (i.e., trust) had low internal consistency reliability and could be improved by using better measurement scales.</p><p>The study has significant implications for the existing literature and citizenship education programs in Europe, pointing to how practice-based citizenship education can nurture participation for the public good and social change by promoting the discussion of different perspectives, the integration of conflicting opinions in class, and involvement in student participation at school.

These differences were mainly observed between Italy and the Czech Republic: the paths from PI to civic and political participation were stronger in Italy; the paths from PE to political and lifestyle/online participation were stronger in the Czech Republic, as was the path from SP to political participation.</p><p>Finally, IT had a stronger negative association to lifestyle/online participation in Italy than in Sweden.</p><p>The findings imply that some of the hypothesized effects differ among Italy, Sweden and the Czech Republic. According to these results, political interest may be a more central predictor of civic and political participation in Italy, while political efficacy is more central in the Czech Republic.</p></div>
