<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>As always, tax is an important source of revenue for governments. Governments are unable to collect as much taxes as they would like or need. Tax noncompliance, such as tax evasion and tax avoidance, has become widespread, which has led to countries being confronted with a number of problems, such as distortions in the distribution of the tax burden and wealth in society and budget deficits <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Leviner, 2008)</ref>. In all countries, tax administrations have been faced with the issue of how to decrease their tax losses. This issue keeps tax compliance literature on the agenda. Tax noncompliance is becoming more costly for governments' budgets. For instance, in the United States, noncompliance is estimated to cost the federal government over $300 billion annually <ref type="bibr">(Bobek et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">James and Alley, 2004)</ref>. In addition, tax noncompliance not only decreases public revenues for financing government expenditures but also contributes to social inequality between social groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Wenzel, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Researchers embarked on studies of tax compliance during the 1980s. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Clotfelter (1983)</ref> conducted the first empirical research on tax compliance. However, progress up until the 1990s was somewhat disappointing <ref type="bibr">(Beron et al., 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Tax compliance can be voluntary or enforced by authorities. Voluntary tax compliance has prevailed over law enforcement, which has led to the need to determine the factors that affect a taxpayer's behavior towards tax compliance. The factors that explain taxpayer noncompliance can be classified into economic factors and social factors. Despite economics models having been used for a long time, they have not been able to precisely explain the compliance behavior of taxpayers.</p><p>There are many previous studies on tax compliance focusing on social factors. <ref type="bibr">Bobek et al. (2007)</ref> found that social norms can explain the differences in tax compliance across countries (Australia, Singapore and the U.S.). <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wenzel (2004)</ref> researched social norms for three countries (Australia, Singapore and the U.S.) as well. He found that the effects of non-personal norms on tax compliance are more ambiguous than those of personal norms. In addition, he stressed that the role of social norms on tax compliance is greater than that of personal norms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Murphy (2004)</ref> showed the relationship between trust and tax compliance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Devos (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andreoni et al. (1998)</ref> investigated the relationship between demographic variables (age, occupation, etc.) and taxpayers' attitudes towards tax evasion. The related relationship was found to be statistically significant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cummings et al. (2009)</ref> analyzed the influences of political norms on tax compliance behavior using survey data. The survey results indicated that a high quality of governance encourages taxpayers to voluntarily comply with taxes. Seeing that every country has distinctive features, successful tax compliance must give due weight to all relevant factors and their interaction in each country <ref type="bibr">(James and Alley, 2000:42)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, few studies have directly addressed the relationship between tax compliance and fairness as a social norm. The aim of this study is to fill this gap. This study focuses on finding the relationship between tax compliance and fairness as a social norm under the auspices of factors determining tax fairness with an empirical study using Turkey as a sample. Therefore, this research shed new light on tax compliance and tax fairness with a focus on social norms. Research based on the tax compliance indexes indicates that Turkey has high levels of tax evasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Riahi-Belkaoui, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Many empirical studies have used information from the reports of national revenue administrations. For example, most studies in the United States have used data from the Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program (TCMP). However, TCMP and other countries' data have some deficiencies. These data lack socioeconomic variables. In addition, the data do not indicate all under-reported income. In contrast, survey method gives socio-economic variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Torgler, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>We believe that this research contributes to the tax literature in two ways: (1) Broadening the database with findings will improve the limited literature for related areas. (2) The relationship between tax compliance and fairness is measured with a structural equation model. In this way, the effects of tax fairness on tax compliance can illustrate broader themes.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the theoretical framework. Section 3 explains fairness and tax compliance using previous literature. Section 4 presents the empirical results, and section 5 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">OVERVIEW OF TAXPAYER COMPLIANCE</head><p>Although there is no standard definition of tax compliance, the most comprehensive definition that is accepted is compliance with reporting requirements, meaning that the taxpayer files all required tax returns at the proper time and that the returns accurately report tax liability in accordance with the internal revenue code, regulations and court decisions applicable at the time the return is filed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Devos, 2008)</ref>. Tax compliance includes both tax avoidance and tax evasion, which are distinguished in terms of legality <ref type="bibr">(James and Alley, 2004)</ref>. Tax avoidance is legal. In contrast, tax evasion is illegal.</p><p>Tax compliance means that taxes are completely collected. The underlying reason taxes are paid can be voluntary or enforced by authorities. In this framework, two theories have been developed by researchers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Devos (2008)</ref> claimed that there are two schools, "The Economic School" and "The Social Psychology School". The first view is the "The Economics of Crime Approach" by <ref type="bibr">Allingham and Sandmo (1972)</ref>, which is developed from the papers of <ref type="bibr">Becker (1968)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Tulkens and Jacquemin (1971)</ref>. This is known as "The Deterrence Model" <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Doyle et al., 2009)</ref>. Enforcement strategies such as audits and sanctions are enforced. The view behind this approach is based on the theory of public enforcement of law <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Polinsky and Shavell, 2000)</ref>. With this approach, the tax administration has a command of the traditional ''enforcement" paradigm. Taxpayers think that the tax administration views taxpayers as potential criminals, rather than providing services to taxpayers <ref type="bibr">(Alm et al., 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andreoni et al. (1998)</ref> argued that the weakness of Allingham and Sandmo's model is that it is based on the assumption that the probability of an audit is constant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cummings et al. (2009)</ref> suggested that reducing tax evasion or noncompliance is not simply a matter of applying higher penalties and/or increasing the frequency of audits.</p><p>The second view is known as "The Accommodative Model" <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Doyle et al., 2009)</ref>. This model consists of non-economic social factors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ayres &amp; Braithwaite (1992)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Leviner (2008)</ref> emphasized this approach as "The Responsive Regulation". For this model, tax compliance requires a multi-disciplinary approach, for example drawing from the perspectives of economics, sociology and psychology.</p><p>Although economic models are older than social models, they are unable to explain the compliance behavior of taxpayers. Taxpaying behavior is also a social process, where taxpayers share information, experiences, attitudes, and patterns of behavior, which affect their assessments of costs and benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Leviner, 2008)</ref>. For these reasons, empirical research has focused on social factors <ref type="bibr">(Bobek et al., 20070)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Doyle et al. (2009)</ref> argue that there must be a balance between the deterrence model and the accommodative model. <ref type="bibr">Simon and Alley (2004)</ref> reached similar conclusions. They claimed that both approaches have disadvantages in terms of tax compliance. A successful strategy for tax compliance should exist somewhere between voluntary compliance and enforced compliance.</p><p>Social norms are divided into personal and non-personal factors. Personal norms, such as the ability of a taxpayer to pay, tax morals, individual tax burdens and demographics, hold subjective features. These factors can change among individuals. Non-personal norms consist of components such as fairness in tax system, the structure of the tax system and tax administration efficiency. Whereas non-personal norms are related to others' (e.g., family, friends, and colleagues) expectations, personal norms are based on one's own decisions and expectations on ethics and morale <ref type="bibr">(Kirchler Hoezl and Wahl, 2008:218)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kirchler and Wahl (2010)</ref> analyzed the relationship between voluntary compliance and enforced compliance. They found that voluntary and enforced compliance are not correlated. <ref type="bibr">Gary et al. (2003)</ref> explained why taxpayers' attitudes towards tax compliance vary across time, regions, and similar enforcement regimes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">FAIRNESS AND COMPLIANCE WITH PREVIOUS RESEARCH</head><p>Tax fairness means that taxpayers "pay a fair share" <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Morris, 2012)</ref>. According to the literature, taxpayers pay their taxes based on their ability to pay in a fair tax system. In addition, tax should be administered fairly in terms of the assessment and collection of tax. Tax laws should be applied without regard for the taxpayers' features, such as race, gender, and social status. Not only are taxpayers interested in the returns on the taxes they pay, but they also want to be equal to other taxpayers in terms of returns <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Leviner, 2008)</ref>. Fairness is a result of this perception. For these reasons, fairness is an important factor in taxpayers' decision between tax compliance and tax evasion. Because tax fairness has a potential impact on tax compliance, taxpayers' perception of the fairness of a tax is important for policy makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Thomas, 2012)</ref>. An unfair share of the tax burden may cause taxpayers to be less tax compliant <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(OECD, 2012)</ref>. Fairness in tax system can be divided into three types. Distributive fairness is the perception that the government acts as a good custodian and wise spender of tax revenues. Procedural fairness is the perception that the revenue adheres to procedures that are fair in dealing with taxpayers. Retributive fairness is the perception that the revenue is fair in the application of punishment when the rules are broken <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(OECD, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>A number of researchers have examined the relationship between fairness and tax compliance. Evidence obtained from prior research shows that fairness is positively related to tax compliance. Previous research shows that fairness in tax compliance can be explained from distributive, dimensional and procedural points of view (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andreoni et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Thomas, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Hartner et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Doyle et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Feld and Frey, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bordignon 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Spicer &amp; Becker 1980)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andreoni, Erard, Feinstein (1998)</ref> argue that an unfair tax system can lead taxpayers to rationalize tax evasion. There is much empirical evidence showing that taxpayers who feel that the tax system is procedurally fair are more tax compliant. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bazart and Bonein (2014)</ref>, the dynamics of tax evasion are designated by social norms and taxpayers tend to evade taxes after reaching a given threshold. This threshold depends on the sensitivity of taxpayers to the unfairness. If the distribution of taxpayers' burden is unequal, tax compliance is likely to decrease <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kirchler et al., 2008)</ref>. That is to say, an unfair tax system may lead taxpayers to rationalize tax evasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andreoni et al., 1998)</ref>. Emphasizing fair procedures makes it possible to increase taxpayers' trust in tax administration, and the possibility of voluntary tax compliance will increase. As a noteworthy example, in his empirical study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Murphy (2004)</ref> finds that the more regulators act fairly, the more taxpayers will trust the authority. In another survey-based study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Murphy (2005)</ref> found that when taxpayers were treated procedurally unfairly by taxes, they were more likely to have negative views on the legitimacy of the tax authority.</p><p>In our analysis, we used the following main components of perceived fairness: the structure of the tax system, inefficiency in the tax system, tax morale, interaction with the tax administration and the use of public expenditures. These components are related to procedural justice and are used to measure tax fairness as factor affecting taxpayers' behavior.</p><p>Tax law is the main factor affecting the performance of the structure of the tax system. The tax code being complex and open to interpretation leads to lower tax compliance. In addition, correct income declaration is difficult with a complex tax system <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Schaltegger, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Oberholzer and Stack, 2014)</ref>. Tax complexity can take many forms, like computational forms. Too much detail in the law, ambiguity and low levels of readability are common problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Saad, 2014)</ref>. In addition, tax complexity creates "gray areas", which can lead to tax noncompliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andreoni, et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Graetz et al. 1986</ref>). Researchers have studied how fairness may affect taxpayers' attitudes towards taxes with respect to the tax code. Alm et al. <ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref> showed that taxpayers pay fewer taxes when their tax liability is uncertain. They suggest increasing services for taxpayers to decrease tax evasion. With these services, taxpayers can understand tax codes and solve problems. In Saad's studies for New Zealand (2014), tax complexity and fairness perceptions partly contributed to taxpayers' noncompliance towards taxes.</p><p>Inefficiency of the Tax System can be assessed with a number of tax policy parameters, such as instability in tax law, fines, audits and tax amnesty. Audits and fines are crucial tools for combating taxpayer resistance. As seen in some studies, fines are more effective than tax audits in inducing tax compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kirchler et al., 2008)</ref>. Amnesty may negatively affect tax compliance in the long run if taxpayers think of amnesty as an inequitable issue. An amnesty given to tax evaders is generally seen as unfair. From this perspective, amnesty hinders honest taxpayers' compliance with the tax authority's rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andreoni et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Schaltegger, 2007)</ref>. In the same way, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Posner (2000)</ref> suggested that amnesty contributes to an unfair procedure. With amnesty, greater revenue in the short term offsets reduced revenue in the long term. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Leviner (2008)</ref> claimed that voluntary compliance with taxes is especially important in a complex and constantly evolving tax system. A more fair and efficient tax system improves voluntary reporting.</p><p>It is accepted that tax morale serves as an important explanation for tax compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andreoni et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Feld and Frey, 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Calvet and Alm (2013)</ref> suggest that morale has a greater influence on tax compliance than what is predicted by standard economic theory. When tax evasion is seen as a moral issue, individuals are less likely to evade taxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Morris, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Empirical research related to tax morale reached the same conclusions. One factor shaping tax morale is a fair tax system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cornelissen et al. (2013)</ref> found a strong link between tax fairness beliefs and work morale based on German data. In an empirical study, based on data from 30 countries, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Riahi-Belkaoui (2004)</ref> found that tax morale can best explain the phenomenon of tax compliance internationally, in addition to the level of economic freedom, the level of importance of the equity market and the effectiveness of competition laws. Riahi-Belkaoui used a tax compliance index to measure tax compliance in countries. According to this index, developed countries have greater tax compliance compared to developing countries.</p><p>The last factor that determines the perceptions of taxpayers on tax fairness is the use of public expenditures. Tax is a relevant civic duty and liability that makes it possible to provide public goods and services, to distribute wealth and to improve welfare <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Wahl et al., 2010)</ref>. Taxpayers' attitudes toward the use of public expenditures can be assessed two ways. One is on the basis of equality theory. If taxpayers believe that there is a positive relationship between the paid tax and government goods and services in general, they are more likely to comply with taxes <ref type="bibr">(Torgler, 2007:18)</ref>. With the other, taxpayers usually want reciprocity in their exchange relationship with the government. If there is a lack of equity between a taxpayer's own exchanges compared to those of others, the perception of that taxpayer on fairness may be negative. Taxpayers, at least those who want to benefit from public goods funded by their taxes, want to attain an equal level <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Savage and Torgler, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fehr and Schmidt, 2005)</ref> Feld and Frey (2010) suggested that when government policies are perceived as unfair by taxpayers, a crowding out effect will occur with respect to tax compliance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andreoni et al. (1998)</ref> also found that the use of public expenditures was a factor determining tax fairness. <ref type="bibr">Alm et al. (1992)</ref> showed how tax payments as public good funds are important for tax compliance. Differences in the levels of public goods provided among taxpayers are a source of unfairness as perceived by taxpayers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bazart, Bonein, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Interaction with tax administration is another factor defining taxpayers' fairness perception. The procedural fairness literature specifically highlights the importance of the tax authority's trustworthiness, interpersonal respect, and neutrality <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Tyler, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">James and Alley, 2004)</ref>. This interaction can come in three forms: The treatment of the tax authority, the level of supplied taxpayer services and tax knowledge. Tax authorities should adjust their regulatory efforts to comply with the behavior of taxpayers. When taxpayers find dissatisfaction with the tax authority's treatment, they resist towards the authority. In addition, taxpayers have good reason to evade taxes when tax authorities do not treat taxpayers equally. Taxpayers' perceptions of unfair treatment provided by a tax authority erode the trust of taxpayers in the tax administration <ref type="bibr">(Murpy, 2004)</ref>. Respectful and fair treatment leads to feelings of respect and acceptance and standing in taxpayers' social group <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hartner et al., 2008)</ref>. In tax compliance analysis, taxpayers' perceived respectful treatment by the tax authority is an important determinant of tax compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Feld and Frey, 2005</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wenzel's (2002)</ref> empirical study for Australia found that taxpayers' were more compliant when they felt fairly and respectfully treated by the tax authority. According to the result of her survey, <ref type="bibr">Murpy (2005)</ref> showed that a tax office's misuse of its authority leads to resistance towards this authority by taxpayers. To measure taxpayers' relationship with tax authorities, this study used questions related to their perceived fairness. Tax authorities should treat taxpayers affected by their decisions respectfully and politely, which will increase perceptions of fairness, by making individuals understand that any unfavorable consequences of the authority's decisions do not reflect maliciousness or intention to harm. Like other studies, leviner (2008) argued that taxpayers who believe that the tax administration is fair are respectful toward it. High levels of taxpayer services may be a useful tool for combating tax evasion <ref type="bibr">(Alm et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Tax knowledge is an essential component of tax compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Saad, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">(Saad, :1070))</ref>. Tax administration policies in recent years have focused on services for taxpayers, in contrast to the traditional "enforcement" paradigm. More information related to tax law being provided by the tax administration means greater perceptions of fairness, increasing voluntary tax compliance <ref type="bibr">(Alm et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kirchler et al., 2008)</ref>. The provision of satisfactory information to taxpayers may increase fairness in a tax <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Doyle et al., 2009)</ref>. Previous research supported this suggestion. For example, some studies done for Malaysia showed that tax knowledge is the most influential factor determining taxpayers' compliance behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Loo et al., 2009)</ref>. In addition, knowledge about tax law decreases the probability of an audit <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andreoni et al., 1998)</ref>.</p><p>There was a study on whether the beliefs and evaluations of taxpayers and the tax authority on tax compliance are similar for Australia. The findings of the study demonstrate that taxpayers and tax authorities have similar views. Treating taxpayers fairly and providing reliable information will lead to increasing the willingness to comply among taxpayers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kirchler et al., 2006)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">METHODOLOGY</head><p>To obtain research data using a developed survey, a questionnaire was applied to taxpayers. We received a total of 481 responses. The survey questions were aimed at assessing participants' perceptions of the dependent and independent variables. All survey results were confidential. Some demographic data were obtained through the survey questions. The results were analyzed through structural equation modeling techniques (SEM) using AMOS 22.0 software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Sample</head><p>The sample for this study consists of taxpayers' perceptions of fairness in the tax system in Turkey. The total number of participants was 500. 19 questionnaires were invalidated; thus, 481 responses are included in the analysis. The response rate is high, at approximately 96%. A total of 52.4% of participants were male, and 47.6% were female. The sample's ages ranged predominantly between 21 and 40 (57.9%). The level of education of most respondents was the bachelor's degree level (46.4%). The majority (74%) of respondents earned less than 5.000 TL a year (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).  <ref type="bibr">(1992)</ref>, due to it having a number of methodological problems that make its data highly suspect. Despite this risk, surveys have more advantages compared to other methods. To measure taxpayers' perception of fairness in the tax system, a survey-based data gathering technique was used. Questions were appropriated from relevant studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kirchler &amp; Wahl, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kirchler et al.;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Oberholzer, Stack, 2014)</ref>. The wording was changed to adapt the questions to the issue of taxpayers' perceptions of fairness in the tax system in Turkey. The survey was completed face to face. To measure the perceived fairness of the tax system in Turkey inefficiency in the tax system, the use of public expenditures, tax morale, the structure of tax the system and interaction with tax administration, as independent variables, were measured using a five-point Likert-type scale, with values ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree). All items in the questionnaire were randomly sequenced. The research model and construction of the questionnaire were modified through pre-testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Analysis and Results</head><p>The data analysis was conducted in two stages, as suggested by <ref type="bibr">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</ref>. First, the measurement model was estimated using confirmatory factor analysis to test whether the constructs possessed sufficient validity and reliability. Second, the structural model was identified, and the hypotheses were tested using various constructs of the model. The research model was tested with SEM techniques using AMOS 22.0 software (Byrne, 2010).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Factor Analysis</head><p>To determine the reliability and structural validity, pre-testing of the 27 questionnaire questions was conducted using a sample of 45 taxpayers. Three questions (Q8, Q16 and Q23) were found to be unreliable and, for this reason, eliminated from the analysis. The discriminant validity of the remaining items and scales was tested with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using SPSS 22.0 software. Because the "communality" values were below 0.50, Q12, Q19 and Q29 were deleted. Further, Q6, Q26 and Q31 were removed from the analysis because their values in the "anti-image" matrix were below 0.50. Then, we performed factor analysis for the remaining 18 questions. The values of Cronbach's Alpha (0.722), Bartllet's Test of Sphericity (0.000) and KMO (0.747) are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The data on taxpayers' perception of fairness in the tax system in Turkey were appropriate for factor analysis. Six factors were extracted from factor analysis using varimax rotation as stated in the theory. These factors' pulled variance explained <ref type="bibr">14.49, 10.86, 10.74, 8.70, 7</ref>.58 and 7.30%, respectively, with the Eigen values of all factors greater than 1. Other results of the analysis indicate that the factor loading of the items of the six factors range from 0.447 to 0.821. The lowest values in terms of communality and the anti-image correlation coefficient were recorded in items Q14 (0.508) and Q22 (0.587), respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Structural Model Results</head><p>The model fit measures are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. The χ 2 value for the 481 participants was found to be 281.625, with 120 degrees of freedom. Because this value was affected by sample size, a better measure, CMIN/DF, was used and found to be 281.625/120 (degrees of freedom). The ratio for the proposed model in this study is 2.347, which is within the suggested 3-1 bracket <ref type="bibr">(Chin &amp; Todd, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gefen, 2000)</ref>. Therefore, the model fit was found to be statistically significant. In addition, we report two fit indices. In this study, we used the comparative fit index (CFI), which is one of the more stable and robust fit indices <ref type="bibr">(Anderson and Gerbing, 1988)</ref>. The CFI ratio for the proposed model in this study is 0.913, which should be at or above 0.90 <ref type="bibr">(Hoyle, 1995)</ref>. The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was also used in this study to test the significance of the proposed model. The value of RMSEA for this model is 0.053, which is less than the recommended value (0.08) <ref type="bibr">(Kline, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Byrne, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The hypotheses tested in the analysis are as follows:</p><p>H1: Inefficiency in the tax system has a negative and significant effect on fairness in the tax system.</p><p>H2: The use of public expenditures has a positive and significant effect on fairness in the tax system.</p><p>H3: Tax morale has a positive and significant effect on fairness in the tax system.</p><p>H4: The structure of the tax system has a positive and significant effect on fairness in the tax system.</p><p>H5: Interaction with tax administration has a negative and significant effect on fairness in the tax system.</p><p>The proposed research model was tested with structural equation modeling (SEM) using the AMOS 22.0 software. Standardized estimates for the explanatory variables and p-values are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.  <ref type="bibr">2011)</ref>. Accordingly, a "larger" positive standardized effect size of 0.86 was found for the path from The Structure of the Tax System to Fairness in the Tax System. However, "large" negative standardized effect sizes of -0.69 and -0.51 were found for the paths from Interaction with Tax Administration and Inefficiency in the Tax System to Fairness in the Tax System, respectively. In addition, "typical" positive standardized effect sizes of 0.46 and 0.32 were found for the paths from tax morality and the use of public expenditures to fairness in the tax system.</p><p>The same figure indicates that taxpayers' perceptions of fairness in the tax system in the model was in total explained by 71 percent (R 2 value), which is an acceptable value given numerous factors may affect perceived fairness in a tax system. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION</head><p>The present study aims to contribute to identifying factors that influence taxpayers' perception of fairness in the tax system in Turkey using SEM. It has been proposed that taxpayers' belief that the tax system is fair tends to increase voluntary tax compliance. The study focused on exploring whether fairness played a role in tax compliance. As explained in the analysis part to this paper, even if taxpayers engage in the "rational choice" model, which suggests taxpayers will maximize their personal gains and minimize their personal losses, they will emphasize tax fairness.</p><p>In this analysis, we used inefficiency in the tax system, the use of public expenditures, tax morality, the structure of the tax system and interaction with tax administration as independent variables. We used fairness in the tax system as the dependent variable.</p><p>Using large-scale Turkish data, we found a positive correlation between tax fairness and the structure of the tax system, tax morale and the use of public expenditures. By contrast, the relationships between tax fairness and other variables, namely, inefficiency in the tax system and the interaction with tax administration, were strongly significantly negative.</p><p>In this analysis, it was found that the structure of the tax system was the strongest factor determining taxpayers' perception of fairness in the tax system. As seen from the results of the present study, if tax codes are simple and understandable and contain all tax liabilities, the tax system may be perceived as fair. Increasing taxpayers' perception of fairness in the tax system will diminish tax losses and increase voluntary tax compliance. This finding is similar to those of previous studies, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Schaltegger (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Oberholzer &amp; Stack (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Saad (2014)</ref>.</p><p>Our empirical findings indicate that two variables have a negative effect on taxpayers' perception of fairness in the tax system. One of these is the interaction with tax administration. Interaction with tax administration is the second most important factor determining taxpayers' perception of fairness in the tax system based on the estimated values. Respondents were found to be unsatisfied with the treatment of the tax administration, which leads to resistance towards authority. The other variable is inefficiency in the tax system. Instability in tax law is an important parameter measuring the inefficiency of a tax system. In addition, the results of the survey showed that the respondents have an understanding of amnesty, because the tax administration frequently applied it. To eliminate inefficiency in the tax system, measurements such as deterrence fines, reasonable amnesty and satisfying audits must be taken. Provided that the efficiency of the tax system is assured and increased interaction with tax administration, taxpayers will believe the tax system is fairer and comply with taxes. The interaction between the tax administration and taxpayers should be rearranged, with the tax authority providing respectful and service-oriented treatment to taxpayers. Following these adjustments, taxpayers' perceptions of fairness in the tax system will become positive, and voluntary tax compliance will increase. These results conform to previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kirchler et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andreoni et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Schaltegger, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Posner 2000)</ref>.</p><p>The results showed that tax morality and the use of public expenditures were substantial factors determining taxpayers' perception of fairness in the tax system. The views of taxpayers are based on their own responsibilities of the fair tax share. In addition, it is suggested that tax evasion is a moral issue. Our findings indicated that taxpayers' perceptions were based on reciprocity between their paid taxes and the government spending in a way that is effective and responsible. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Feld and Frey (2005)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Calvet and Alm (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Torgler (2007)</ref> reached the same conclusion. Consequently, we can say that social norms are considerable deterministic factors in Turkey.</p><p>This study has some limitation. This study used survey data in Turkey. Therefore, the results cannot be generalized to other countries. It is suggested that future research should attempt to compare this topic among both developed and developing countries.  <ref type="bibr">Psychology, Vol. 31, pp. 577-586. Allingham, M.G. &amp; A.
