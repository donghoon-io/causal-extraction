<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose. Past research has convincingly shown that higher employee subjective well-being, or happiness, is a source of higher job performance and retention. This paper therefore examines the relationships between organizational virtuousness, subjective well-being, and individual job performance among French and Japanese employees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology.</head><p>A questionnaire survey was conducted among Japanese and French managers and staff at Japanese and French domestic companies and structural equation modeling was employed to compare those associations.</p><p>Findings. We found that the Japanese and the French have different conceptualizations of organizational virtuousness, suggesting that firms must tailor their virtue-building activities based on the local culture.</p><p>Subjective well-being is comparatively more important in Japan since it acts in complement to organizational virtuousness to positively affect job performance, while in France, only organizational virtuousness counts as a source of job performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research implications.</head><p>National culture is revealed to be a new factor explaining differences in how employees consider organizational virtuousness and we provide evidence of positive associations of organizational virtuousness with positive subjective well-being and with job performance for both the Japanese and the French.</p><p>Practical implications. Organizational virtuousness cannot be construed from a universalistic perspective where virtues are conceptualized on the same basis regardless of location or region, and firms should also consider their employees' individualist or collectivist inclination when trying to influence work outcomes.</p><p>Originality. These findings point to the role of national culture on the perception of organizational virtuousness and its effect on subjective well-being and job performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Companies have come to realize that employee welfare is essential for greater corporate performance and innovation. Organizations seeking competitiveness in an ever-globalizing environment with more agile players have started giving consideration to the happiness of their employees. Putting employees at ease ensures they devote their full attention and use all available intellectual capacity to the tasks and jobs they were hired to accomplish. Perceptions of security and well-being are therefore important to counterbalance</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Job Performance</head><p>Campbell, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">McCloy, Oppler, and Sager (1993)</ref> define job performance as "goal-relevant actions that are under the control of the individual, regardless of whether they are cognitive, motor, psychomotor, or interpersonal" (pp. 40-41). In other words, job performance consists of all employee activities, which support in part or in whole the achievement of organizational goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Viswesvaran, and Ones, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Magnier-Watanabe, Uchida, Orsini, and Benton, 2017)</ref>.

Written and oral communication denotes how workers handle the receiving and delivering of messages on the job. Demonstrating effort measures the level of commitment in accomplishing one's job. Maintaining personal discipline refers to the extent to which workers act within established rules and the law. Facilitating peer and team performance assesses how much workers effectively engage in teamwork and support colleagues. Supervision considers the leadership abilities, whereas management or administration reflect non-supervisory work (Campbell,    </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>a business environment which has grown more uncertain with globalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Engwall &amp; Hadjikhani, 2014)</ref>. Why should companies be concerned? Because past research has convincingly shown that higher employee subjective well-being is a source of higher performance for the corporation, in the form of higher sales and/or lower costs. For instance, happiness has been found bring about a variety of measures related to health care (expenditure, hospital visits), productivity (job performance ratings, presenteeism, short-term disability leave, unscheduled absence), and retention (voluntary and involuntary turnover, intention to stay) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Sears, Shi, Coberley, and Pope, 2013)</ref>. Empirical evidence demonstrates that higher well-being by 1-point on a 7-point scale doubled the likelihood for employees to stay with their firm <ref type="bibr">(Wright and Bonett, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The importance of well-being is also visible through the Great Place to Work certification which assesses the perceptions of employees and managers and asserts that "a great place to work is one in which you trust the people you work for, have pride in what you do, and enjoy the people you work with" (Great Place to <ref type="bibr">Work, 2018)</ref>. However, it is not always clear whether the firm can nurture well-being among employees, or whether well-being acts as a mediator between the firm's corporate virtue and employee performance.</p><p>Emphasis on well-being is important for individual performance, but also for employee retention, loyalty, and corporate social responsibility. In the case of Japan, it is all the more important to keep employees happy regardless of performance benefits; the declining population in the country has led to an all-time low unemployment rate of 2.8%, sparking a labor shortage and rising wages <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Nikkei, 2017)</ref>. So, it is essential for Japanese companies to display an attractive image to lure fresh graduates, and ensure that they retain those they are already employing.</p><p>Given the many aforementioned benefits of well-being for organizations, what can firms do to ensure their employees are happy at work? Past research points to virtuousness or "the best of the human condition, the most ennobling behaviors and outcomes of people, the excellence and essence of humankind, and the highest aspirations of human beings" as a necessary condition for well-being <ref type="bibr">(Cameron and Caza, 2013, p. 677)</ref>. Virtuousness has been associated with more resilient and longer-lasting productive organizations, thanks in part to its core features related to ethical value, positive influence on individuals, and improvement of the common good <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cameron, Bright, and Caza, 2004)</ref>. Consequently, virtuousness in organizations has quickly become a central concept which results in several positive outcomes such as individual well-being and job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Meyer, 2018)</ref>. Accordingly, we investigate the relationship between organizational virtuousness and subjective well-being and both their effects on job performance in one model. In addition, we will examine the effects of national culture on this model by surveying firms in France and in Japan.</p><p>Based on our analysis, we will offer pragmatic suggestions for multinational firms to support their employees' well-being, and in turn to increase employee and ultimately firm performance.</p><p>We target firms in Japan and France for three reasons. First, past research has not considered how culture and cultural differences may affect the relationships between organizational virtuousness, subjective wellbeing, and job performance. Selecting two countries with distinct and well-documented cultures -Japan and France -can therefore provide evidence of the role of culture on the constructs under study. However, culture is not the central focus of this research and instead, only selected discrete cultural dimensions among the two countries are highlighted to explain differences for antecedents and outcomes of subjective wellbeing. Second, globalization of the world economy has increased corporate ties and cross-shareholdings between these two countries, compelling firms to evaluate and compare the antecedents of their nationally diverse workforce towards sustained performance. As of 2017, French firms accounted for 12% of inward foreign direct investment stock in Japan or about JPY 3.5 trillion, the third highest after American and Dutch firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(JETRO, 2018)</ref>. And Japanese investments represented 1.2% of inward foreign direct investment stock in France, or USD 10.5 billion, the fifth highest for firms from outside of the European Union <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bank of France, 2018)</ref>. Third, previous research has shown that these two countries vary considerably in cultural dimensions that affect the relationship and ties between employees and their firms. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner (1997)</ref> have found that these two countries are on the opposite sides of two dimensions that define national culture: the specific-diffuse and the individualism-communitarianism spectrums. The specific-diffuse dimension refers to "the degree to which we engage others in specific areas of life and single levels of personality, or diffusely in multiple areas of our lives and at several levels of personality at the same time <ref type="bibr">(Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner, 1997, p. 81)</ref>. That is, in specific cultures, there is a tendency to keep separate the different areas of one's lives, such as family life, professional life and hobby life, while in diffuse cultures these areas often overlap and are less clearly defined. As such, in more specific-oriented cultures like France, we suggest that work-related issues may be compartmentalized, and would spill over less into other areas of one's life than they would in diffuse-oriented cultures like Japan. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Parsons and Shils (1954)</ref> relate the latter dimension to "the dilemma of private versus collective interest" and state that this dilemma can be resolved "by giving primacy to the interests, goals, and values shared with other members of a given collective unit of which he is a member of or by giving primacy to his personal or private interests without considering their bearing on the collective interests" (pp. 80-81). <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner (1997)</ref>, who expand on this position, assert that "For the French the community is France and the family. They become individualists in other social encounters (pp. 50-51)". <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hofstede et al. (2010)</ref> have also found that French culture is strongly individualistically oriented with an individualism score of 71 (out of 100). In contrast, Japanese culture was found to be moderately collectivist with a score of 46 (out of 100). Accordingly, we predict that French employees' sense of happiness or contentment with their lives may be less affected by happenings in their workplace than that of Japanese employees, whose sense of fulfillment may be more strongly tied to their own situation in their firms.</p><p>This research contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it shows that culture may be responsible for differences in how employees consider organizational virtuousness since we found that Japanese and French respondents conceptualized organizational virtuousness differently from each other and differently from the dimensions in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cameron, Bright, and Caza, 2004)</ref>. This variance in perception of organizational virtuousness may be responsible for its differentiated effects on subjective well-being and job performance. Second, this study provides evidence of positive associations of organizational virtuousness with positive subjective well-being and with job performance for both the Japanese and French, thus confirming the importance of perceived corporate virtue established in earlier works <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(De Araujo and Lopes, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Section two reviews the definitions of the concepts. Section three examines their relationships and proposes hypotheses. Then, section four presents the methodology of the survey, followed in section five by results, and their discussion in section six. Last, section seven concludes this paper by looking at implications for research and practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>Organizational Virtuousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cameron, Bright, and Caza (2004)</ref> state that "organizational virtuousness (…) includes individuals' actions, collective activities, cultural attributes, or processes that enable dissemination and perpetuation of virtuousness in an organization," with "virtuousness in organizations (…) referring to transcendent, elevating behavior of the organization's members" (p. 768). Organizational virtuousness is divided into virtue in organizations and virtue through organizations, whereby the former relates to "the behavior of individuals in organizational settings that helps people flourish as human beings", while the latter to "the enablers in organizations that foster and perpetuate virtuousness" <ref type="bibr">(Bright, Cameron, and Caza, 2006, p. 252)</ref>.</p><p>Virtuousness is also relevant for organizations in so far as it is characterized by the three attributes of moral goodness, human impact, and social betterment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cameron, Bright, and Caza, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Organizational virtuousness is measured by assessing five components in the organization: optimism, trust, compassion, integrity, and forgiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cameron, Bright, and Caza, 2004)</ref>. Optimism denotes the confidence that members have in the mission and purpose of their organization, even in hard times.</p><p>Organizational trust signifies a general environment of mutual respect, courtesy, and kindness, in which members feel they can rely on each other as well as their management. Organizational compassion refers to the fact that members of the company are genuinely concerned with others' welfare and caring acts occur frequently. Organizational integrity indicates that honor, truthfulness, and honesty permeate the organization, which always acts in good faith. Organizational forgiveness reflects the intentional acceptance of mistakes, seeing them as learning and growth opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rego, Ribeiro, Cunha, and Jesuino, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Magnier-Watanabe, Uchida, Orsini, and Benton, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Organizational virtuousness can be a source of resilience and enduring success for the firm. It has been recognized as a self-perpetuating condition since "the context is more like a conductor of virtue (…), might motivate others to act and maybe even become virtuous as well" <ref type="bibr">(Meyer, 2018, p. 261)</ref>. More generally, virtuousness at work aims to create an environment which protects self-respect, enhances human capital, and improves well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cameron and Winn, 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective Well-Being</head><p>Well-being refers to a positive or acceptable assessment of one's life overall <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Magnier-Watanabe, Uchida, Orsini, and Benton, 2017)</ref>. But because it is inherently subjective, most scholars in the field favor using the term subjective well-being when considering an individual's overall evaluation of one's life <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Diener, Oishi, and Lucas, 2003)</ref>. Well-being is considered to be multidimensional, as demonstrated by research analyzed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Stiglitz, Sen, and Fitoussi (2010)</ref>, who included elements related to the subject's physical health, education, occupation, political voice, social relationships, environment, and economic security.</p><p>Past studies have attempted to model subjective well-being from an economic perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Oswald, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Oswald, Proto, and Sgroi, 2015)</ref>. These works acknowledge that the construct is based on satisfaction with life in general and on satisfaction with subjective sub-domains, which decompose life into basic components.</p><p>For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Van Praag, Frijters, and Ferrer-i-Carbonell, (2003)</ref> equate subjective well-being to the level of general satisfaction obtained from job, financial, housing, health, leisure, and environmental satisfaction.</p><p>However, more recent research argues that, in addition to satisfaction with life as a whole, subjective well-being should take into account emotions rather than satisfaction with bounded sub-domains.</p><p>Accordingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Helliwell, Layard, and Sachs (2017)</ref> assert that subjective well-being should be measured along two dimensions: the first relates to emotions, both positive and negative, towards daily events; the second involves one's evaluation of life, comprising a broad assessment of one's family, social relationships and environment. As examples of positive affect and negative affect, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Olesen, Thomsen, and O'Toole (2015)</ref> cite feelings of energy and engagement, and distress and anxiety, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Wright (2010)</ref> who has written extensively about well-being, defines psychological well-being very similarly to subjective wellbeing since he asserts that "psychological well-being is a subjective experience" (p. 14), and that it is operationalized assessing the occurrence of both positive and negative emotions, whereby "to be high on well-being is to be simultaneously high on positive and low on negative emotion" (p. 14). In addition, subjective well-being reflects an aggregate or overall assessment of one's life, and this judgement is rather stable over time and not subject to the influence of particular conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Wright, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The literature connecting organizational virtuousness and job performance was first reviewed extensively by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cameron, Bright, and Caza (2004)</ref>, who established a clear link between the two constructs and uncovered the amplifying and buffering functions of virtue in organizations. Its amplifying property denotes that positive emotions lead to more prosocial behaviors in a self-sustaining virtuous cycle, while its buffering quality limits the formation of negative behavior thus protecting against adverse effects in trying times <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cameron, Bright, and Caza, 2004)</ref>. One illustration of the amplifying effect is virtuous leadership which supports stronger organizational commitment among employees, which in turn leads to higher job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(De Araujo and Lopes, 2014)</ref>. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Meyer (2018)</ref> ascertained the strong link between organizational virtuousness and organizational performance in an extensive review of the literature. He observes that a wide range of positive practices grouped under the virtuousness umbrella in the firm have been tied to increased performance at work. This can be summed up as "Virtuousness pays dividends; doing good helps organizations to do well'' <ref type="bibr">(Caza, Barker, and Cameron, 2004, p. 174)</ref>.</p><p>Each virtue fosters a climate in which employees behave in a way perceived to be desirable and conducive to positive organizational outcomes. Optimism gives employees the necessary confidence to pull through in adversity and try to reach goals that may seem unattainable. Trust among employees results in social capital and a climate of cooperation necessary to achieving complex and long-term group-level goals.</p><p>Compassionate employees are more inclined to helping each other and having stronger interpersonal relationships, thus further contributing to reaching group-level objectives. Pervasive integrity among workers is more likely to have a ripple effect and to prevent the coverup of adverse behavior detrimental to corporate success. And forgiveness by the organization allows members to learn from past mistakes and to contribute their experience to future outcomes, thus avoiding the repeat of the same errors.</p><p>For-profit organizations seek returns on investment, which are expected and monitored by shareholders.</p><p>As explained previously, virtue in and through organization comes from employee behavior and from firm enablers which create and support virtuous acts, respectively. However, commendable organizational goals are not sufficient; the firm must also offer working conditions which sustain virtuousness through optimism, trust, compassion, integrity, and forgiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cameron, Bright, and Caza, 2004)</ref>. When workers perceive the organization to have socially worthy goals and to provide a safe, just and positive environment, they work harder without restraint, exhibiting higher levels of productivity and eventually reaching greater job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rego, Ribeiro, Cunha, and Jesuino, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, we anticipate that organizational virtuousness is positively related to job performance (H1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organizational Virtuousness and Subjective Well-Being</head><p>As stated previously, one goal of virtuousness at work is the improvement of well-being, recognizing that it can ultimately enhance human capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cameron and Winn, 2012)</ref>. The link between virtuousness and subjective well-being is made possible thanks to the elicitation in the organizational context of positive feelings such as empathy, trust and eagerness <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rego, Ribeiro, Cunha, and Jesuino, 2011)</ref>. For instance, trust has been found to be a strong predictor of well-being, whereby "those who feel to be living in a trustworthy environment have much higher levels of subjective well-being" <ref type="bibr">(Helliwell and Wang, 2011, p. 56)</ref>. Similarly, good relationships among employees enabled by corporate virtue have been found to result in well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dutton and Heaphy, 2003)</ref>. We can therefore conceive that the employees' overall sense of well-being is greatly affected by their working environment, and that therefore a positively perceived workplace will result in happier employees.</p><p>The physiological health benefits of organizational virtuousness at the individual level have been well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Meyer, 2018)</ref>. These benefits can be traced back to each virtue of organizational virtuousness.</p><p>Optimism renders individuals more constructive and positively affects relationships with others since it puts confidence in the future. Trust, a required condition for social capital, allows employees to relax since they no longer need to doubt their coworkers' actions and motives. Compassion results in caring acts and mutual concerns for welfare, therefore multiplying good deeds at work. Integrity ensures honesty and at the same time deters unfair behaviors, thus precluding feelings of injustice at work. And forgiveness decreases workrelated stress because employees feel they can safely make mistakes towards the achievement of organizational goals. Taken together, these relationships point to a positive association between employees experiencing virtuousness at work and their subjective well-being, as they "feel recognized as valuable emotional and intellectual beings, and not just human resources" <ref type="bibr">(Rego, Ribeiro, Cunha, and Jesuino, 2011, p. 526)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, we hypothesize that organizational virtuousness is positively related to subjective wellbeing (H2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective Well-Being and Job Performance</head><p>Past research indeed supports the existence of a positive link between employee well-being and job performance. Some scholars have called it the "happy-productive worker" thesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cropanzano and Wright, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Wright, Cropanzano, and Bonett, 2007)</ref>. Satisfied employees exhibit higher performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Wright, 2010)</ref>, higher positive affect is associated with superior performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hosie, Willemyns, and Sevastos, 2012)</ref>, while workers having better days than usual attain higher job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Zelenski, Murphy, and Jenkins, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Subjective well-being affects job performance in three distinct ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bryson, Forth, and Stokes, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>First, it acts on individuals' cognitive abilities, enabling enhanced creativity, more effective and faster problem-solving, because the mind is relieved from stress and unburdened by negative thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cropanzano and Wright, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Oswald, Proto, and Sgroi, 2015)</ref>. Second, employees have more positive attitudes towards their job, therefore they are more disposed to take on more tasks for cooperative and collaborative work <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Organ and Ryan, 1995)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Staw, Sutton, and Pelled (1994)</ref> argue that positive emotions may increase social capital and improve relations with colleagues in the workplace, improving job performance.</p><p>Third, employees with higher subjective well-being are in better health and less prone to illness, exhibit higher levels of energy, and thus demonstrate greater effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Diener and Chan, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Despite early doubts about the directionality of the link between happiness and job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Fisher, 2003)</ref>, past research has further confirmed the relationship between subjective well-being and job performance by isolating the effects of possible confounding variables such as exhaustion, positive and negative affect, and job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Wright, Cropanzano, and Bonett, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Wright and Huang, 2012)</ref>. Thus, we expect that subjective well-being has a positive influence on job performance (H3).</p><p>In addition, while research on well-being and its organizational antecedents has gained momentum, few scholars have put established models to the test in country-specific work contexts. Two exceptions are the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cunha, Cunha, and Rego (2007)</ref>, who explored the meaning and implications of corporate virtue in Cuba, and that of Magnier-Watanabe, Uchida, Orsini, and Benton (2017), who studied the role of happiness in the relationship between organizational virtue and job performance in Japan. In this research, we test the aforementioned relationships and compare them among Japanese and French workers (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>Insert Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> about here</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">METHODOLOGY Sample and Measures</head><p>A questionnaire survey was conducted among Japanese and French managers and staff at Japanese and French domestic companies to test the hypotheses presented above. The questions were first created in English, and then translated into Japanese and in French by the authors who are altogether native in all three languages. The data was collected in March 2015 and in February 2016 using an Internet Survey company with offices both in Japan and France and a large number of registered respondents fitting the requested profiles. Respondents were selected among Japanese workers employed at domestic companies in Japan and among French workers employed at domestic companies in France, both groups working in a different industries and functions. Japanese respondents consisted of 208 people, with a breakdown of 75% male and 25% female, and divided evenly between general staff without subordinates and managers with supervisory duties; French respondents numbered 273 people, consisting of 74% male and 26% female, and 60% staff workers and 40% managers.</p><p>The measurement items are all taken from prior studies such as that of Magnier-Watanabe, Uchida, Orsini, and Benton (2017) and are all on a 5-point Likert scale. Organizational virtuousness was measured using <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cameron, Bright, and Caza (2004)</ref>'s 15 item-instrument assessing the respondents' perceptions of optimism, trust, compassion, integrity, and forgiveness towards their organization, with three questions for each dimension. For instance, measuring forgiveness, respondents were asked to provide their level of agreement with the following statements: "We have very high standards of performance, yet we forgive mistakes when they are acknowledged and corrected"; "we try to learn from our mistakes here, consequently, missteps are quickly forgiven"; "this is a forgiving, compassionate organization in which to work".</p><p>Subjective well-being is assessed in two ways. Five questions measured both positive and negative emotions in the past week, as previous research has found that feelings tend to vary throughout the day and respond to different interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Helliwell, Layard, and Sachs, 2017)</ref>. Negative emotions consisted of worry, sadness, and anger, while positive emotions included smiling or laughing, and happiness. One question assessed overall life satisfaction, as recommended by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in its recommendations for measuring subjective well-being (OECD, 2013).</p><p>Last, individual job performance is evaluated with <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Campbell, McCloy, Oppler, and Sager (1993)</ref>'s 13 questions covering the eight dimensions of job-specific task proficiency, non-job-specific task proficiency, written and oral communication, demonstrating effort, maintaining personal discipline, facilitating peer and team performance, supervision, and management or administration. For instance, the item to assess jobspecific task proficiency and non-job-specific task proficiency asked for the respondents' levels of agreement with the following statements: "You are proficient at the core tasks that are central to your job", and "You are proficient at general tasks that are not specific to your job", respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Yoshino (2006)</ref> and others have pointed out that survey responses from Japanese, Chinese, and Korean respondents tend to be biased by a regional culture trait (but also found in other cultures, such as the Persian one): the separation between true feelings and public opinion, or honne and tatemae, respectively, in Japanese society <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bird, 2002)</ref>. We believe that the level of this social desirability bias in our survey was low for the following four reasons: first, the confidentiality provided by anonymity in our survey; second, the relatively low level of sensitivity and privacy engagement required by the nature of our topic; third, the absence of preceding respondents with whom the respondent would want to align to; and fourth and last the absence of pressure from a physical interviewer to whom answers would have to be verbally stated <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kondo, Saito, Deguchi, Hirayama, and Acar, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DISCUSSION</head><p>In this article, we argued that firms should pay special attention to their organizational virtuousness because it can be both a source of employee subjective well-being and of job performance. We hypothesized that employees' subjective well-being would partially mediate the relationship between organizational virtuousness and job performance. Our findings were partially consistent with our hypotheses. For Japanese respondents, organizational virtuousness is positively associated with job performance and positive subjective well-being, and a partial mediation of positive subjective well-being exists between organizational virtuousness and job performance. For French respondents, organizational virtuousness is positively related to job performance and positive subjective well-being, albeit with no mediation effect of subjective well-being between organizational virtuousness and job performance. While the effects of organizational virtuousness on both subjective well-being and on job performance were substantiated, evidence of partial mediation by subjective well-being was found only for the Japanese but not the French.</p><p>We then discuss the most important contributions of our findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Contributions</head><p>A first contribution of this study is to establish national culture as a new factor explaining differences in how employees consider organizational virtuousness. Japanese and French respondents were found to conceptualize organizational virtuousness differently from each other and differently from the five dimensions in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cameron, Bright, and Caza, 2004)</ref>. The Japanese think of organizational virtuousness in terms of forgiveness and optimism on the one hand, and the rest on the other hand; while the French conceive it as optimism and the rest. Hence, beyond showing that national culture explains differences in organizational virtuousness, we found it also affects the relationships between the factors used in the extent literature's models. The above two different national conceptualizations can be explained by looking at the two classes of virtues -tonic and phasic -previously identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Park and Peterson (2003)</ref>.</p><p>Tonic virtuousness is generalized and irrespective of circumstances, and it can consist of different dimensions such as integrity, trust, and compassion; phasic virtuousness is related to an external event in relation to organizational resilience, such as forgiveness in case of failure or optimism when the outlook is bleak <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cameron, 2011)</ref>. Our results suggest that both Japanese and French respondents divide organizational virtue in similar tonic virtues but different phasic virtues (forgiveness vs. optimism), which must therefore respond to distinct external events. This is consistent with data on economic mood where the French consistently hold some of the most negative views about the economic situation in the next 12 months, 42% (versus 20% for the Japanese) in 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Stokes, 2015)</ref>. For the French, optimism depends more on the economy at large rather than the condition or health of their firm. For the Japanese, forgiveness is regarded as distinct from other virtues because it is a quality only relevant when mistakes are made and acknowledged. The importance of forgiveness is reflected in the Japanese practice of amae, or depending on receiving indulgence from authority figures or fellow co-workers. This behavior, which Doi describes as the oil of life in Japan, represents a dependence on other people's benevolence <ref type="bibr">(Doi, 1973)</ref>. Similarly, De Mente states that amae reflects a need to "be in good favor with" and "depend on" the people around oneself <ref type="bibr">(De Mente, 2004, p.11)</ref>. The Japanese are also expected to hold a "central Japanese value" <ref type="bibr">(Murase, 1982, p. 317)</ref>, being sunao. <ref type="bibr">Crossman and Noma (2012)</ref> explain sunao as a concept associating "su" or "things in their original state without any transformation" and "nao" or "right-mindedness, authenticity, and genuineness" <ref type="bibr">(Murase 1982, p. 321)</ref>. The components of sunao-ness at the individual level broadly overlap with organizational-level virtuousness. For instance, when comparing the concepts of organizational virtuousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cameron, Bright, and Caza, 2004</ref>) and of sunao-ness <ref type="bibr">(Crossman and Noma, 2012)</ref>, one finds in both texts virtue, trust, humility, and honesty, but not forgiveness. Being sunao in turns supports indulgence from authority figures.</p><p>The difference in the conceptualization of organizational virtuousness harks back to Moore (2015)'s assertion that the list of virtues is not rooted in a particular philosophy. Beyond the virtues discussed previously, some researchers have considered different ones, such as responsibility, humility, and fulfillment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bright, Cameron, and Caza, 2006)</ref>. Moreover, both these virtues and the conception of what well-being is, are rooted in national education systems. For instance, Ohmae asserts that individualism, as emphasized by Western education, may lead to "a distressing lack of concern for the well-being of the organization" <ref type="bibr">(Ohmae, 1982, p. 413)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Maruyama (1984)</ref> goes even further by arguing there is a fundamental misinterpretation by Western theorists of some Asian and African concepts, especially those pertaining to interpersonal relations or mental connectedness in Japanese organizations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Yoshimura and Anderson (1997)</ref> do also call attention to Japan's peculiar way of ritualizing interpersonal interactions. We can therefore expect organizational virtuousness to vary by country or culture -such as among French and Japanese employees -based on different definitions of virtuousness and distinct desirable virtues. Another consequence of the variance in perception of organizational virtuousness is its differentiated effects on subjective well-being and job performance in each country sample.</p><p>A second contribution of this study is that it offers evidence of positive associations of organizational virtuousness with positive subjective well-being and with job performance for both the Japanese and French, thus confirming the importance of perceived corporate virtue established earlier in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dutton and Heaphy, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">De Araujo and Lopes, 2014)</ref>. These associations are stronger for the French than for the Japanese. However, the link between positive subjective well-being and job performance was only substantiated with the Japanese sample, thus confirming the partial mediation previously hypothesized. And overall, the strength of the association of job performance with only organizational virtuousness for the French and with both organizational virtuousness and positive subjective well-being for the Japanese is about the same. This highlights the relative importance of subjective well-being for the Japanese rather than for the French, since it acts in complement to organizational virtuousness to positively affect job performance.</p><p>The fact that positive well-being affected job performance in the Japanese but not in the French sample is consistent with and can be explained by key cultural differences. One of the seven cultural dimensions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hampden-Turner and Trompenaars (1993)</ref>'s model of cultural differences is the specific-diffuse spectrum which evaluates how cultures separate their private and work lives. On this spectrum the Japanese are evaluated as being more diffuse, or being more apt to integrate their work and private lives. Accordingly, in a diffuse society such as Japan, job performance tends to be more affected by one's overall sense of wellbeing. Furthermore, "In collectivist cultures, people are interdependent within their in-groups, give priority to the goals of their in-groups, shape their behavior primarily on the basis of in-group norms, and behave in a communal way" whereas "in individualist societies, people <ref type="bibr">[…]</ref> give priority to their personal goals over the goals of their in-groups, and behave primarily on the basis of their attitudes rather than the norms of their in-groups […]" <ref type="bibr">(Triandis, 2001, p. 909)</ref>. In group-oriented cultures such as that found in Japan, the community and the firm have therefore an influence on their member's well-being; indeed, Stone-Romero and Stone ( <ref type="formula">2002</ref>) have already pointed out that "[…] this interdependence is viewed as essential to wellbeing" (p. 287). Furthermore, individualist members have been shown to be less susceptible to affective influences, such as well-being, compared to collectivist members <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ilies, Wagner, &amp; Morgeson, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>The practical implications of this research are twofold. First, organizational virtuousness cannot be construed from a universalistic perspective where virtues are conceptualized on the same basis regardless of location or region. The firm must therefore tailor its "individuals' actions, collective activities, cultural attributes, or processes that enable dissemination and perpetuation of virtuousness in an organization" based on the country where it is located <ref type="bibr">(Cameron, Bright, and Caza, 2004, p. 768)</ref>. Just as research on national culture recognized long ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hampden-Turner and Trompenaars, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hofstede, 2003)</ref> that values -or what is important, useful, or right -differed from one society to the next, firms must consider how to foster virtuousness that matters to their local employees. Phasic virtues depend on external events or surely on local cultural characteristics which need to be first taken into account.</p><p>Second, organizational virtuousness is vital for subjective well-being and job performance in both Japanese and French contexts. However, for the Japanese, organizational virtuousness affects job performance in conjunction with subjective well-being. Employee well-being is arguably a laudable intention for any firm; but when it comes to operational superiority, it matters even more in collectivist cultures where job performance -itself the product of group cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hofstede, 2003)</ref> -depends also on subjective well-being. Conversely, for the French, only organizational virtuousness matters -and not subjective well-being -as a source of job performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>This study has three main limitations. First, the model only considered job performance as the focal endogenous variable assessing tangible effects of interest on corporate operations. There are possibly many more work-related outcomes firms are eager to affect, such as organizational citizenship behaviors or work engagement. Indeed, such measures or predictors of job performance have been used in previous research albeit without examining the effects of cultural differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Rego, Ribeiro, and Cunha, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Singh, David, and Mikkilineni, 2018)</ref>. Second, although we advocated for the path from organizational virtuousness to subjective well-being and from there to job performance, reversed causality is possible for these relationships. It is conceivable that higher job performance positively affects one's own well-being and satisfaction, which could can in turn elicit more favorable judgement about one's company's virtue. Third, the sampling method cannot account for intrinsic differences between the two country groups, although the samples were built so that gender, age, and industry distributions were comparable. Future studies should use larger pools of respondents or a sample consisting of the employees of one firm in different countries. Moreover, differences among demographic categories may exist as subjective well-being has been found to change with aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Ulloa, Møller, and Sousa-Poza, 2013)</ref>, and a subsequent step could compare these subgroups first within one country and second across countries. Last, the relationships between organizational virtuousness, subjective well-being, and job performance should be evaluated for specific country respondents and lead to the identification of specific cultural patterns among the constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSION</head><p>Employee welfare and well-being at large have received more attention as they have been shown to make a difference for job performance. In this article, we contend that firms should pay special attention to their organizational virtuousness because it can be both a source of employee subjective well-being and of job performance. We have established that corporate virtue positively affects subjective well-being and job performance for both Japanese and French respondents. However, the Japanese and the French were found to have different conceptualizations of organizational virtuousness, suggesting that firms must tailor their virtue-building activities based on location. In addition, we observed that the relationship between organizational virtuousness and job performance was partially mediated by subjective well-being for Japanese workers only. This finding indicates that firms must also consider their employees' individualist or collectivist inclination when trying to influence work outcomes. In collectivist societies like Japan, subjective well-being is comparatively more important since it acts in complement to organizational virtuousness to positively affect job performance. In individualist cultures like France, only organizational virtuousness counts as a source of job performance. In brief, these findings point to the role of national culture on the perception of organizational virtuousness and its effect on subjective well-being and job performance. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 .FIGURE 2 .FIGURE 3 .</head><label>123</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1.

For Japanese respondents, model-fitting results indicated that the structural equation model of organizational virtuousness, positive subjective well-being and job performance provide a good fit for the data with fit indices χ2 = 120.645 (97); CFI = 0.985, NFI = 0.928; IFI = 0.985; TLI = 0.981; RMR = 0.035; RMSEA = 0.034 (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The results of hypotheses testing are summarized in Table <ref type="table">9</ref> and show that organizational virtuousness is positively associated with job performance (H1) (β = 0.426, C.R. = 3.789) and positive subjective well-being (H2) (β = 0.504, C.R. = 5.344) in Japanese firms. Results also showed that positive subjective well-being is positively related to job performance (H3) (β = 0.236, C.R. = 2.425), albeit with a lower level of significance (p&lt;0.05).</p><p>Insert Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> about here Insert Table <ref type="table">9</ref> about here The fitted model suggests a partial mediation of positive subjective well-being exists between organizational virtuousness and job performance. A partial mediation denotes the existence of both significant direct and indirect effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baron and Kenny, 1986)</ref>. It is alternatively called a complementary mediation since both the direct and indirect effects are of the same sign <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Zhao, Lynch, Chen, 2010</ref>). The mediating effect was analyzed by testing alternative models with direct effect only and full mediation only, separately, as well as with effects on factors of job performance instead of job performance variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hair, Black, Babin, and Anderson, 2010)</ref>. The resulting fitted model, whereby the relationship between organizational virtuousness and job performance is partially mediated by positive subjective well-being, was found to improve fit measures in every case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Equation Modeling: Hypotheses Testing (France)</head><p>For French respondents, model-fitting results suggest that the structural equation model of organizational virtuousness, positive subjective well-being and job performance provide a good fit for the data with fit indices χ2 = 325.351 (139); CFI = 0.953, NFI = 0.922; IFI = 0.954; TLI = 0.943; RMR = 0.087; RMSEA = 0.070 (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The results of hypotheses testing are summarized in Table <ref type="table">10</ref> and show that organizational virtuousness is positively related to job performance (H1) (β = 0.754, C.R. = 8.243) and positive subjective well-being (H2) (β = 0.692, C.R. = 7.796) in French firms. However, unlike with the Japanese sample, there is no association between positive subjective well-being and job performance (H3). When the model included such link, the relationship was found to be not significant, and model fit was lower, thus indicating that no such relation exists.          </p></div>			</div>
