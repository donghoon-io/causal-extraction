<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Loneliness is an aversive state which reflects a deficit in social connection <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. According to the evolutionary theory of loneliness, loneliness is momentary in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, many longitudinal studies prove that, for some individuals, loneliness can be a prolonged experience with harmful effects on mental and physical health over several years <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. For instance, the chronic feeling of loneliness has been linked to anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and it is related to individuals' higher risk for many physical problems, such as cardiovascular disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, sleep problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and even suicide <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. A study by Holt-Lunstad <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> et al. found that loneliness was a risk factor for morbidity and mortality, and the likelihood of death increased 26% for reported loneliness. Since loneliness is an important topic in the sociological, psychological, medical, and nursing literature, an enhanced understanding of loneliness and related phenomena would potentially be beneficial to individuals' health and well-being.</p><p>According to the literature on loneliness, different types of factors can predict loneliness, such as socio-demographic <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, health-related <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and psychological factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Recent empirical studies have uncovered a close relationship between emotional skills, such as emotional intelligence, and loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The findings showed that poor emotional skills increase loneliness over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Similarly, if people could effectively perceive and manage negative feelings associated with loneliness, they could successfully overcome loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Thus emotion regulation abilities (ERA) may be an important factor related to loneliness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Failure-Related Action Orientation as an Emotion Regulation Ability Difference</head><p>According to action control theory, emotion regulation processes can be classified with respect to low versus high ERA (state orientation versus action orientation) at a functional level <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. During failure-related situations (e.g., dangers or painful experiences), high ERA individuals could be more effective in down-regulating stress and negative emotions compared to low ERA individuals; as a consequence, low ERA persons tend to ruminate about failure-related situations for prolonged periods of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and they tend to be at higher risk of developing psychopathologies such as depression or anxiety disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Rumination is defined as thoughts and behaviors that focus a person's attention on negative moods. Rumination has consistent independent effects on many health risk indicators and outcomes such as loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Thus, ERA might be associated with loneliness. Other literature has indicated that low ERA individuals tend to view themselves primarily as entities detached from the social world <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. However, how the relationship between ERA and loneliness has not previously been investigated.</p><p>It is reasonable to infer that mediators exist between ERA and loneliness. According to the functional perspective of emotion regulation, the ability to disengage from negative emotions in threatening situations is adaptive, because such behavior is consistent with an individual's own goals including maximizing long-term survival or welfare <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. Previous findings suggest that maladaptive emotion regulation strategy, such as inflexible suppression or avoidance of emotion, could mediate the relationship between ERA and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. ERA is also positively related to functional coping strategies (reappraising) and negatively related to dysfunctional strategies (suppression of emotional expression) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore in the current study we are interested in the relationship between ERA and loneliness. Specifically, we want to analyze this relationship by adding a mediator: experiential avoidance (EA), which is an inflexible avoidant emotion regulation strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiential Avoidance as a Mediator</head><p>EA is receiving increasing attention in the empirical literature of clinical psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. EA is thought to be critical to the development and maintenance of psychopathology, such as addiction, anxiety, depression, and impulse control disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. It involves the unwillingness to remain in contact with aversive experiences such as painful feelings, thoughts and emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Although it seems that attempting to hide or inhibit unpleasant thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations is the most effective way to control feelings in the short-term, applying those techniques rigidly and inflexibly actually increases the frequency and distress of similar experiences, perhaps with an added sense that one is being disconnected from oneself <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. Whereas acceptance, "a disposition to accept thoughts and feelings" <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, is the opposite of avoidance and could therefore negatively predict loneliness. Specifically, acceptance predicts over a quarter of the variance in loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Thus, low acceptance (high experiential avoidance) may potentially leave people impaired in social interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Lonely people will pay less attention to people in interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and seem less involved in conversations <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Moreover, according to theoretical model of metacognitive therapy, EA is a counterproductive emotion regulation strategy which may lead to social anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Social anxiety is the combination of fear and worry that people experience when they anticipate that they have failed to make a positive impression on others <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Since social anxiety and loneliness are correlated states, and social withdrawal and isolation often occur as the result of acute social anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, we infer EA might be related to loneliness.</p><p>Additionally, theoretical literature and empirical research provide support for the potential presence of emotion regulation difficulties in the form of EA <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. Furthermore, EA relates to other less adaptive emotion regulation strategies such as avoidant coping, thought suppression, stress intolerance, and anxiety sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. But the important distinction regarding EA and these strategies is that EA refers to avoidance strategies being applied rigidly and inflexibly, even when such strategies cause harm in the long term. Additionally, EA could mediate the effects of emotion regulation strategies on mood and distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. A previous study found that EA was negatively correlated with ERA <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. As EA was associated with both ERA and loneliness, we expect that EA could account for the relationship between ERA and loneliness. Aside from the possible theoretical relationship mentioned above, previous research suggested ERA could be viewed as a trait that is linked to an individual's ability to regulate emotions and cope with stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. Also, EA can be considered as another coping style largely related to ways of emotion-focused and avoidant coping <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Therefore, we assume that EA is a strategy and might be a mediator between ERA and loneliness.</p><p>Thus the purpose of this study is, first, to examine if EA is related to loneliness, using a sample of Chinese university students. The second purpose is to investigate if EA mediates the anticipated relationship between ERA and loneliness. Here it is hypothesized that: 1) EA will be positively related to loneliness, 2) ERA will be negatively associated with EA and loneliness, and 3) the relationship between ERA and loneliness will be mediated by EA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedure</head><p>Five-hundred-twenty-three undergraduates enrolled in a psychology class were invited to participate in this study. All invitees were from one university in northwestern China, and they were asked to complete a study on individuals' attitudes toward personality and life. Five hundred participants (366 males and 134 females; mean age = 20.6 years; SD = 0.86) completed the questionnaire to be included in this study's convenience sample, for a response rate of 95.6%.</p><p>Data were collected in March, 2015, using questionnaires. Prior to data collection, ethical approval was provided by a research ethics committee. All participants signed individual consent forms and the questionnaire was administered anonymously. The questionnaire included items on ERA, EA, loneliness and some demographic variables (e.g., gender, age).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Emotion regulation abilities. We used a Chinese edition of the Action Control Scale (ACS-90) to assess individual differences in ERA <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. The failure-related subscale consists of 12 failure-related actions which assess an individual's ability to disengage themselves from undesirable events or unobtainable goals (i.e., people with high ERA), as well as an individual's inability to deal with undesirable experiences and failure (i.e., people with low ERA). Each item has two response alternatives, for example, "When something really gets me down (a) I have trouble doing anything at all" (people with low ERA were coded as 0); (b) I find it easy to distract myself by doing other things" (people with high ERA were coded as 1). The ACS-90 has sufficient reliability and adequate construct validity across cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>, and the reliability coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) for the failure-related subscale in this study was α = 0.74.</p><p>Experiential avoidance. The seven-item Chinese version of the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Bond et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Cao et al. 2013</ref>) was used to assess EA. Participants indicated the extent to which they agreed with each of the seven statements from the AAQ-II, which featured seven-point Likert-type response scales with anchors ranging from "never true" to "always true". All answers were summed to form the EA measure, with lower scores reflecting greater psychological flexibility and therefore lower EA. The AAQ-II has demonstrated reasonable internal reliability in different cultural contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>, as well as in the present study (α = 0.85, Cronbach's alpha).</p><p>Loneliness. Loneliness was assessed using the Chinese translation of the UCLA Loneliness Scale (Version 3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>, which consisted of twenty statements measuring loneliness on a 4-point Likert-type response scale ranging from "never" to "always". Responses were summed to provide a total loneliness score. Higher scores reflected higher levels of loneliness. The UCLA Loneliness Scale has previously demonstrated good reliability and validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. In this study, the reliability coefficient of the UCLA Loneliness Scale was α = 0.83 (Cronbach's alpha).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>We used SPSS version 18.0 to calculate descriptive statistics and correlations between the variables (there was no missing data). Then we used AMOS version 17.0 to analyze the mediation effects, which used maximum likelihood estimation by two-step procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. Five indices were employed to assess the goodness of fit of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>: the Chi-square statistic (χ 2 ), χ 2 /df of 2 or less, the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) of .95 or more, the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) of 0.06 or less, and the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) of 0.08 or less (the path coefficients were accepted as significant at the 0.05 level). Since there were 20 items included in the UCLA Loneliness Scale, in order to control for inflated measurement errors due to multiple items for the latent variable, four item parcels (average scores of the items) were created only for the loneliness constructs (α = 0.843, Cronbach's alpha). The random algorithm method was adopted for the parceling procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. The procedure of creating the item parcels was conducted as follows: first we decided on four parcels to be created, and then we randomly assigned the items to the parcels. The value of each parcel was used as an indicator, or observed variable, which was the average scores of the five items selected for each parcel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Statistics and Correlations</head><p>Independent samples t-tests indicated that neither gender nor age significantly affected ERA, EA, or loneliness (p &gt; 0.05). As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, all variables were significantly correlated in the predicted directions. ERA was negatively correlated with EA and loneliness, and EA was positively correlated with loneliness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediation Analyses</head><p>In order to test whether EA might mediate the relationship between ERA and loneliness, structural equation modeling was used in AMOS. Two possible kinds of mediation are: full mediation and partial mediation. Full mediation is when there is a relationship between ERA and Loneliness such that, when the mediating variable is included, the ERA-Loneliness relationship completely disappears. Partial mediation is when there is a relationship between ERA and Loneliness such that, when the mediating variable is included, the ERA-Loneliness relationship weakens or changes in direction but still remains significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model</head><p>The measurement model included three latent variables, ERA, EA, and loneliness, and thirtynine observed variables. All observed variables were loaded onto their respective latent factors, which followed the original design of the measures. A primary test of the measurement model indicated good fit to the data (χ 2 (699, 500) = 1639.89, p &lt; 0.001, χ 2 /df = 1.925, SRMR = 0.05, RMSEA = 0.04, CFI = 0.92). All factor loadings for the indicators onto their corresponding latent variables were significant (p &lt; 0.05, indicating that all the latent factors were well represented by their respective indicators) (i.e. this supports that the measurement shows convergent validity, 63).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model</head><p>We used maximum likelihood estimation in AMOS version 17.0 to test the structural model. First, we deleted all non-significant associations (p ! 0.05) and left only latent variables with significant associations in the model. The results shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> indicate that the direct standardized path coefficient from the predictor (failure-related action orientation) to the criterion (Loneliness) in the absence of mediators was significant, β = -0.40, p &lt; 0.001. This mediated model exhibited a good fit to the data: χ 2 (228, 500) = 437.519, p &lt; 0.001, χ 2 /df = 1.6519, SRMR = 0.04, RMSEA = 0.04, CFI = 0.95. As the residuals from all the variables were not significant, no additional path was significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. According to the mediation testing procedure (the path coefficients among these variables were all significant) <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), we found that EA was a full-mediator between ERA and loneliness. Therefore, these results assisted in our understanding of the role of EA in our hypothesized model. In addition, we tested an alternative model (EA-ERA-Loneliness; χ 2 (227, 500) = 436.975, p &lt; 0.001, χ 2 /df = 1.925, SRMR = 0.05, RMSEA = 0.05, CFI = 0.92), but we found that the path between ERA and loneliness was not significant (β = 0.05, p = 0.482).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Although the connection between ERA and loneliness has been suggested by findings from previous research, the mechanisms through which these variables affect loneliness has not been well understood. This is the first study to explicitly show this relationship. Over decades ago, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hayes et al. (1996)</ref> proposed that many emotional distresses share a common experiential avoidance function. Although a growing literature has explored the effect of EA on psychological   As expected, ERA was significantly and negatively related to feelings of loneliness and to EA. EA was also significantly and positively related to loneliness. These results supported our hypotheses and were consistent with previous findings related to emotion regulation and loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>. Particularly, the current study suggested that, within Chinese culture, individuals with low levels of ERA were more likely to have a greater tendency to engage in EA. In addition, individuals low on ERA tended to have heightened feelings of loneliness.</p><p>Most of all, we tested a theoretically-grounded model wherein EA mediated the association between ERA and feelings of loneliness. As we expected, EA fully mediated the relationship between ERA and loneliness. The finding suggests that the extent to which ERA is related to loneliness may be explained by individuals' different tendencies to willingly remain in touch with unwanted private experiences. According to Action Control Theory, ERA is conceptualized as a trait-like characteristic representing the ability to regulate emotions, cognitions, and behaviors involved throughout the process of accomplishing a goal. Especially in threatening situations, high ERA individuals could be more effective in down-regulating stress and negative emotions compared to low ERA individuals. Thus, as a consequence, low ERA persons may tend to ruminate about negative experiences long after they occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. In that case, ERA may, therefore, help individuals feel less lonely through their use of emotion regulation strategies. Specifically, low ERA individuals may have a greater tendency to engage in EA. Although adopting an EA strategy may help individuals succeed in down-regulating initial discomfort, people would probably ultimately experience a rebound effect with increased distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. Since controlling thoughts and suppressing unwanted emotions can be cognitively draining, high EA may potentially leave people impaired during social interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. This is because people with high EA will pay less attention to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and they may be perceived as less engaged <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The result is that high EA people may suffer from higher levels of loneliness. This is consistent with evolutionary perspectives of loneliness.</p><p>Overall, these findings highlight mechanisms underlying the relationship between ERA and loneliness, and they suggest that EA may be an important target for intervention strategies for lonely individuals. Moreover, some limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, this study adopted a cross-sectional, correlational design, which allows only for cautious interpretation of results, as alternative models could also be possible. The cross-sectional design of this study precludes inferences regarding the direction of associations between variables. Thus, longitudinal or experimental studies could facilitate causal evaluations of similar phenomena in the future. The second limitation of our study is that our sample is unlikely to be representative of the Chinese young adult population: the study was only conducted in one school in China. Its results may not be generalizable to other populations. Furthermore, item parcels were formed to create latent values loneliness constructs. The use of item parceling in SEM offers advantages, but parceling has potential drawbacks such as it may increase the chance of Type II error <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. Lastly, this study exclusively used self-report questionnaires for data collection. Future studies could use multiple data sources for evaluation (e.g., observer reports, behavioral measures, or data from experimental manipulations).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Despite limitations, our findings contribute to the existing literature on the factors associated with ERA, and they provide an empirical framework for researchers to test the mediating effects of EA on the relationship between ERA and loneliness. The findings suggest EA is a key mechanism in explaining why people with high ERA are prone to feeling lower levels of loneliness. In particular, this study's findings have important implications for designing effective psychological interventions for loneliness, such as interventions that target EA (e.g., Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, ACT). Future research might investigate the potential effectiveness of ACT as an intervention for chronic loneliness.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1.
