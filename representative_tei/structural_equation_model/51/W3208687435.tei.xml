<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The purpose of this article is to analyse the effect of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on performance through the mediating role of job satisfaction and innovation in a sample of 503 Spanish SMEs construction. Developing a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test our hypotheses, the results provide evidence that performance is influenced by CSR, job satisfaction, and innovation. These effects are not only direct and positive but, indirect effects which allow the positive effects of CSR to be enhanced are also obtained. This research by empirically examining the relationship between CSR, job satisfaction, innovation and performance provides an essential contribution to the literature by filling a gap related to the direct effect of CSR on performance, and the indirect effect by the mediation of job satisfaction and innovation. The findings show significant implications for policy makers and managers. The findings can help managers to invest in CSR, which, by improving the well-being of their employees and the innovative capacity of their company, will lead to better performance and the capacity to adapt to the current changing environment. In addition, our results provide evidence that SMEs with fewer resources should be able to count on public support to carry out CSR practices.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The construction sector is considered one of the driving forces of the Spanish economy. At a relative level, this industry currently accounts for approximately 7% of the national total in terms of both employment and productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. These rates are similar to those of China, the United States and the European Union <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Recently, construction has been significantly affected by COVID-19, yet it is critical to the post-COVID economic recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. To this end, it is important to highlight the drag effect that this sector has on other sectors of the economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Thus, while the Spanish productive fabric is not capable of making a structural change so that other productive sectors with greater technological dynamism and growth potential replace construction, the desired return to economic growth and the generation of employment depends on helping the construction sector to emerge from the difficult moment in which it finds itself, as occurred in the previous economic crisis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is an area of increasing importance in the construction sector. CSR is defined as a firm's commitment to improving the well-being of the community through business practices and discretionary and corporate resource contributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The construction industry has often been criticised for having little respect for the environment, for being confrontational with its clients and for being inconsiderate and indifferent towards society <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In general, the activities carried out in this area have adverse impacts on the environment as they often include dust and gas emissions, noise pollution, waste generation, water misuse, land misuse and pollution <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. For this reason, it is considered necessary to apply of the International Organization for Standardization 14001 environmental management system <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, as it allows the organisation to engage responsibly through a definitive and practical form of continual improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Nevertheless, many construction companies have not shown a commensurate concern for environmental issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and CSR is therefore seen as a means of assessing their progress towards sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>One key aspect in the construction industry is the study of business performance.</p><p>Performance is seen as a concept of an organisation's success, and as an indication of how effectively the organisation is performing in achieving its goals successfully <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In this context, it is widely accepted that the construction industry is dynamic in nature, due to increasing uncertainties in technology, budgets and development processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Thus, the highly competitive environment of the construction industry has made performance improvement an increasingly relevant objective <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, to determine the overall success of companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. However, the innovative processes of construction companies have not been sufficient to promote productivity, quality and ultimate value for money from an efficiency perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. For this reason, we consider that promoting CSR is necessary for the business activities of these companies, since it will lead to greater technological flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and it will change the social system of the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, which will improve their competitive advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> due to an increase in the efficiency and effectiveness in the business activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, in earnings <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and in customers and employees satisfaction, contributing to improve society <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Companies that proactively engage in CSR activities and consider the interests of all stakeholders can gain support and trust from stakeholders such as employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Bauman</ref> and Skitka <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> indicate that job satisfaction can be influenced by a company's actions, including those that relate to CSR.</p><p>Job satisfaction is "a pleasurable or positive emotional state resulting from the appraisal of one's job and job experience" <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The level of employee job satisfaction varies according to certain aspects and the nature of the job. Shabnam and Sarker <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> affirm that CSR should immediately enhance job satisfaction because demonstrated social responsiveness directly satisfies the employee's social requirements of the firm.</p><p>Although recent research results have demonstrated the impact of CSR on business performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, few studies have investigated this impact in SMEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and even fewer in the construction sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Consequently, the main objective of this research is to examine whether CSR is conducive to the performance of construction SMEs, through enhancing employee satisfaction and improving innovative capacity. To this end, we analysed the effect on this relationship of the implementation of strategies aimed at improving job satisfaction and promoting innovative processes. The following research questions arise: Does CSR influence performance in SMEs? Is this influence mediated by job satisfaction and innovation? To answer these questions, we developed a Structural Equations Modeling based on Partial Least Squares (PLS-SEM) in order to test our hypotheses in a sample of 503 Spanish construction companies. Our research has a double purpose: confirmatory and predictive. We have analysed the specific size of firm, sector and country for several reasons:</p><p>(1) SMEs play a significant role in the economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>; (2) the approach to CSR is very different in SMEs than large companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> although SMEs are of little importance individually, collectively their impacts can be huge <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. (4) the development of the construction sector is essential to achieve the economic recovery and employment generation destroyed by COVID-19; (5) the choice of a particular country has been motivated because the results of previous research in CSR show that cultural and legal differences among countries can lead to very different results <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) adoption rate of a country is related to its specific culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Hence, our sample covers a gap in the current literature, as recommended by <ref type="bibr">Beltramino [42]</ref>.</p><p>This research provides an essential contribution to the literature by considering the CSR as a key business performance tool in SMEs in the construction sector, through the analysis of the relationship between CSR adoption and performance, and by incorporating the mediating effects of job satisfaction and innovation. The inclusion of these two mediating effects seek to the inconclusive results concerning the effects of CSR on firm performance in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. In addition, the findings can help SMEs managers to invest in CSR, which will lead to better performance and the ability to adapt to the current changing environment, by improving the well-being of their employees and the innovative capacity of their company. This is the most important practical implication of this research, covering the need to provide empirical work to create better CSR and innovation strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p><p>After this introductory section, Section 2 gives the hypotheses development; Section 3 exhibits the methodological aspects, while Section 4 shows the results. Finally, Section 5 discuss these results and presents the main conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review and hypotheses development</head><p>In recent decades, many researchers have tried to determine the influence of CSR on performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Recent empirical evidence shows that the main objective of companies is to make a profit <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Nevertheless, a large number of these organisations do not consider the option of implementing CSR in their activities because the costs of implementation are too high <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. However, adopting strategies that promote CSR will increase the company's good reputation, which in turn makes it a more attractive company in the labour market, and therefore attracts more applicants <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Furthermore, the company's commitment to CSR leads to benefits for stakeholders: increased profits, generation of new jobs, social investment, extended agreements with suppliers... all of which are closely linked to the construction of the social fabric <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. This is due to the social role of business, for as their size and influence grows, so do the social responsibilities they have to fulfil <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Thus, companies are not simply profit-making organisations, but must respond to the needs of their stakeholders and strive for social support as corporate citizens <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Consequently, corporate social engagement will enable higher levels of business performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. However, although previous studies have analysed the performance of construction companies, to date the impact of CSR has not been examined. For this reason, we propose the following research hypothesis: H1: Corporate social relationship has a positive effect on performance.</p><p>Likewise, CSR stimuli affect firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> by modifying their strategy and business model <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> with the aim of achieving more responsible products, services and processes that satisfy the stakeholders' requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. In SMEs there is a virtuous circle between CSR and innovation, as the higher the CSR, the more innovative the SME will be <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. This gives firms significant competitive advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, with greater opportunities for greater earnings <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Thus, CSR offers companies an excellent opportunity to improve their efficiency, effectiveness and innovative capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Otherwise, recent developments in the field of innovation have affirmed that organisations that engage in innovative activities have higher business performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. This is because companies that develop more innovative products and services gain advantages over their competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, because innovative products and services face less competition when being introduced in the market, enabling the company to increase profits and differentiate itself from the competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</p><p>CSR requires the company to make innovative efforts to improve processes, products and services, as well as to use inputs more efficiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. In addition, innovation offers concrete benefits to SMEs by enabling them to effectively develop, communicate, adopt and explore innovation orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. Firms with innovative capacity will therefore be more likely to promote their performance in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. In consequence, the adoption of a CSRoriented strategy will lead to an increase in performance by increasing the innovative capacity of the company <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Because when implementing CSR practices, companies are obliged to innovate, as their traditional way of doing things does not work and they must be supported by innovation to be able to implement these practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Hence, part of the impact of CSR on performance is given by innovation acting as a mediator between CSR and performance.</p><p>Given the above, we establish the following research hypothesis: H2: Innovation partially mediates the relationship between CSR and performance. This H2 hypothesis is sub-divided into the following three hypotheses:</p><p>H2a: CSR has a positive effect on innovation.</p><p>H2b: Innovation has a positive effect on performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2c: CSR indirectly affects performance through innovation.</head><p>The human capital of a firm is recognized as one of the most important resources of a business <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. Social responsibility to employees involves different activities like communication and information flow, adequate training, looking after the health and wellbeing of employees, balance of working and family life and concern for the safety of the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. Recently, some studies have investigated the influence of CSR on employees by investigating at organizational commitment, engagement and identification with the organization. Nevertheless, most companies do not how CSR has to be used to engage their employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>.</p><p>Responsible activities of the firm favour employees' positive attitude and behaviour, including job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> suggest that employees are more satisfied with their work in companies that perform social activities, while employees who work in companies that do not invest in CSR are not satisfied with many aspects of their work <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>.</p><p>Employees' satisfaction is one of the most important factors for success in an organization.</p><p>A satisfied workforce is imperative since organizational performance depends largely on employee satisfaction. Employees who have a high level of job satisfaction feel that their job give them positive aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. These employees will show extraordinary performance, and the company will be successful <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. There is no doubt that employee satisfaction can improve business outcomes, enhance productivity and strengthen commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>.</p><p>Employee satisfaction has an important function in improving firm profitability and enhancing the operational performance of organizations. Undoubtedly, employee satisfaction is basic to achieve the organizational growth and sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>.</p><p>Research findings suggest that employee behaviour impacts on companies' outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> and greater job satisfaction may lead to higher employee commitment to business values and goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. However, the relationship between job satisfaction and organisational performance is complex. The studies conducted by Latif et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>, Harter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref> and Mafini and Pooe <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref> provide evidence of a strong and significant relationship between job satisfaction and organization performance. Nevertheless, Daily and Near <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref> and Mohr and Puck <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref> found no statistically significant correlation between these two variables.</p><p>In addition, job satisfaction is expected to affect employee performance. The relationship between job satisfaction and employee performance has been studied extensively in management <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>. Therefore, it can be argued that socially responsible firms will improve job satisfaction among their employees, which consequently will enhance performance.</p><p>Based on the above, we formulate the following research hypothesis:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3: Employee satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between CSR and performance.</head><p>This H3 hypothesis is sub-divided into the following three hypotheses: H3a: CSR is positively associated with employee satisfaction.</p><p>H3b: Employee satisfaction is positively associated with performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3c: CSR indirectly affects performance through employee satisfaction.</head><p>Organizational innovation resides in its employees' motivation and capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>.</p><p>Human capital is implicated in the innovation process, because their implication is needed for the development and implementation of innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>.</p><p>Human capital is seen as an input in the innovation process and therefore augments the capacity to innovate and increases the use of new technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. As a result, higher levels of human capital lead to the generation of new technologies or to a more efficient adoption of a given technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, a satisfied employee is more likely to be innovative and creative and produce breakthrough which make possible for an organization to expand and revolutionize positively with passing time <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>.</p><p>Human capital is an independent factor of production which increases performance for a given level of technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>. However, these innovations can even come from teams motivated by human resources initiatives intending to drive change and produce a competitive advantage for the organization (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref>). This increase is given because innovation is related to the growth of competitive advantage and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref>.</p><p>We believe that innovation can be conceptualized as a human capital related result, where some human capital practices, like job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>, apply their influence on organization performance through innovation.</p><p>Finally, the relationship between CSR and innovation could be mediated by some variables such as human capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The innovation on SMEs is increased by the attitude and qualification of employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref>. As Cinnirella and Streb <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref> affirm, innovation needs satisfied human capital. The relationship between CSR and innovation has been analysed and the results show a positive relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>. But CSR practices can help companies to preserve their employees more satisfied, which is necessary to improve the company innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>. From these arguments, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>Based on the information provided above, we state the following hypotheses: H4: The effect of job satisfaction on performance is partially mediated by innovation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H5: CSR indirectly affects innovation through job satisfaction.</head><p>The H4 hypothesis is sub-divided in the following two hypotheses: H4a: Job satisfaction is positively associated with innovation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H4b: Job satisfaction indirectly affects performance through innovation.</head><p>On the basis of all the above, it seems reasonable to believe that by increasing CSR, job satisfaction increases the capacity of companies to carry out innovative activities, which has an impact on their performance. Therefore, a sequential mediation of the relationship between CSR and performance by job satisfaction and innovation can be expected. Hence, we propose the following hypothesis:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H6: Employee satisfaction and innovation sequentially mediates the relationship between CSR and performance.</head><p>To test our hypotheses, we designed a model that on the one hand proposes that CSR has a direct impact on construction companies' performance, and on the other hand, aims to determine the mediating effect of innovation and job satisfaction on this relationship. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> presents our research model. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Population, Sample and Data Collection Techniques</head><p>The construction industry has great economic relevance in Spain. In 2018 there were 411,074 construction SMEs according to the National Statistical Institute (INE). Of these, SABI database contains financial information on 351,032, of which 503 microenterprises and SMEs were randomly selected once segmented by size.</p><p>With a confidence level of 95% and taking into account the sample obtained, the maximum error in the estimation of the population was 4.53%. The survey was conducted anonymously with the aim of reducing social acceptance bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>. The t-test and the chi-squared test for all the variables verified that there were no extreme values in the sample and confirmed that if we compare the first answers with the last ones, the nonresponse bias was not an issue. In reference to a possible concern arising from collecting all the data from the same source, the results of the variance inflation factors (VIF) were verified. As will be seen below, all the results are below 3.3. (the maximum value is 1.273), and therefore, common method bias is not an issue in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>. Moreover, The Harman's single factor test <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref> has been applied. The findings reveal that four factors (KMO: 0.895; Bartlett sphericity test Sig. 0.000) explain 62.09% of the total variance of the model, and performance (the main factor) explains 30.25%, which corroborates that the presence of common method variance bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref> there is not an issue in this model. However, it would still be recommendable for further research to use a variety of sources to gather the information.</p><p>Using the G*Power 3.1.9.2 program <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref> we have calculated the statistical power of our sample assuming a standard error of 0.05 and an effect size of 0.15 <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>. The result obtained is 1, which confirms that in this model significant relationships can be identified and that the sample size is sufficient for the magnitude of the effects found.</p><p>To conduct a quantitative study, the data was collected through a survey directed towards Spanish SMEs. Firms that did not want to take part were replaced by others of similar size.</p><p>The fieldwork was carried out in the first four months of 2018 through telephone surveys with firm managers, since they are the most important decision-makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref>. A pre-test was used to check the ease of understanding of the questionnaire. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> shows the distribution of the final sample, which comprises 503 Spanish Construction SMEs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Measurements</head><p>First, on the assumption that there is no unified way to measure CSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>, we measured CSR using a latent variable consisting of 7 items which was adopted from the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref>. Second, for job satisfaction, a latent variable with 6 indicator was used. This construct measures aspects related to personnel management in the company. For this purpose, we took into account the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref>. Third, innovation was measured using a scale in which products and processes of innovation are distinguished <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, in line with Ali et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref>, performance was measured through the balanced scorecard (BSC) approach established by Kaplan and Norton <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Statistical procedure</head><p>Our model contains four composite mode A <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref> due to the presence of high correlations between indicators in each construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref>. For this main reason, it was tested using partial least squares (PLS), a variance-based structural equation modelling (SEM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref>. Moreover, PLS-SEM technique is also suitable in this study because it does not require specific distribution in the indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref>, it evades severe troubles such as inadmissible or improper solutions and indeterminate factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>, PLS-SEM is also pretty robust when regressors are not included <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>, and PLS-SEM is an appropiate technique to use in a theory development such as this research <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref>, and where the model includes mediating variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138]</ref>.</p><p>The model was estimated from a causal-predictive perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref> by using SmartPLS 3.3.3. <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>. To check the hypotheses, a bootstrap method based on 10,000 sub-samples was applied. We assess our PLS model in several phases: measurement model, structural model, mediation analysis and predictive performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Measurement model evaluation</head><p>The contructs in the model were measured in terms of reliability and validity. The factor loadings, Cronbach's Alpha, composite reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref>, the Dijstra-Henseler rho ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref> and the average variance extracted (AVE) are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>. All the results exceed their shortcut values. Regarding the relevance and significance of the measures, most of the items' loads on their respective constructs were more than 0.7, the shortcut value <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Hair et al., 2016)</ref>. Although, there were some ítems with a loading that varied between 0.696 and 0.609, these loading were accepted <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref>. Therefore, convergent validity and reliability are demonstrated. In addition, to determine the overall predictive relevance of the model, a confirmatory composite analysis test was performed using a blindfoldling procedure (omission distance of 9). This was the first step in confirming the quality of the model, as the values of Q 2 values are above 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref>, thus confirming the predictive relevance of the model.</p><p>In the second stage, discriminant validity was measured through cross-loadings (not reported), the Fornell-Larcker criterion, and the HTMT criterion in variance-based SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref>. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">IV</ref>. According to the Fornell-Larcker criterion, the correlations between each pair of constructs did not exceed the square root of the AVE of each construct. Similarly, the level of the Heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) between each two constructs varies from 0.282 to 0.593. These levels are lower than the maximum recommended of 0.85 <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[146]</ref>. The results show the existence of discriminant validity.</p><p>Furthermore, this research measured quality by checking that the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) does not exceed the value of 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref>. These findings prove a good fit in model specifications.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Structural model evaluation and hypotheses testing</head><p>The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">V</ref> shows that Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) constructs ranged from 1.00 to 1.27, suggesting that in this research there is no problem with the collinearity <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref>.</p><p>Once the measurement model has been accepted and collinearity problem has been rejected, we next measure the R 2 values of endogenous constructs, the algebraic sign, magnitude, significance and the f 2 values of the standardized regression coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>. For this purporse, a bootstrapping (10,000 resamples) process was run in order to obtain t-values and percentile confidence intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>.</p><p>In concordance with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, all the proposed hypotheses have The results regarding the R 2 of the endogenous variables are 0.200 for job satisfaction, 0.091 for innovation and 0.331 for performance. Taking as a reference the criterion of being at least close to 0.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152]</ref>, these results indicate the model has a good explanatory power, especially in the case of performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[153]</ref>.  <ref type="table">3</ref>; Standardized path values reported.

Source: Authors.</p><p>According to Cohen <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>, effect sizes (f 2 ) evaluate the contribution of each exogenous construct to the R 2 values of an endogenous latent variable. Values of 0.02, 0.15, and 0.35 indicate a weak, medium, or large effect, respectively. All links except one (job satisfaction), reach f 2 values above the minimum level of 0.02 <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[153]</ref>. In particular, the results show that CSR has an important effect on job satisfaction. Overall, these results show that the proposed model has adequate structural properties and acceptable explanatory power.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Multiple Mediation Analysis</head><p>Once the direct effects between the different variables have been analyzed and taking into account that the main objective of this research is to analyze the effect of CSR on performance, additional tests were developed to prove if job satisfaction and innovation mediate this relationship, which constitutes a case of multiple mediation. In this stage, the indirect effects have been contrasted with the mediators job satisfaction and innovation.</p><p>Similarly, the total effect (c) and the direct effect (H1=c') have been examined. As established by Chin <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[154]</ref>, a bootstrapping technique with 10,000 samples has been used to determine the indirect effects. This generates 95% bias-corrected CIs for each individual indirect effect and sequential mediation. Moreover, this research also examined the variance accounted for (VAF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>, which determines the size of the indirect effect in relation to the total effect. The results are shown in addition to Table V above, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. The results show how the indirect effects of CSR on performance through innovation and job satisfaction are both positive and significant (β=0.021 * and β=0.134 *** respectively, plus a sequential indirect effect β=0.011 * ). Regarding the VAF, the indirect effect of CSR on performance is about 31.16% of the total effect, with 4.32% through innovation, 27.57% through job satisfaction, and an additional 2.26% sequentially. Since both direct and indirect effects are significant, and the proportions mediated are not prominent, a partial mediation is suggested in all cases, supporting H2c, H3c and H6. Furthermore, the indirect effect of job satisfaction on performance is positive and significant (β=0.024 * ). The proportion mediated by innovation is 7.82% (VAF) of the total effect of job satisfaction on performance, supporting H4b. Finally, job satisfaction partially mediates between CSR and innovation (β=0.093 *** ), with 33.10% (VAF) of the total effect of CSR on innovation, supporting H5.</p><p>In conclusion, the findings suggest that the relationship between CSR and performance is mediated by job satisfaction and innovation. The more deeply companies involve themselves in CSR, the better their performance becomes. In addition, the effect of CSR on performance increases when the mediating variables are considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Evaluation of the predictive performance</head><p>According to Shmueli <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156]</ref>, the predictive performance of a model is the capability to produce correct predictions of further observations. In this vein, predictive validity (out-ofsample prediction) shows that a given set of measures of a particular variable can predict a given outcome variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref>. This has been assessed through a cross-validation with holdout samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref> by applying the PLS predict algorithm with SmartPLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref>.</p><p>First a k-fold cross-validation was executed, setting k= 7 subgroups, with the aim of meeting the minimum size of N=30 for the holdout sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref>, with ten repetitions of the procedure. Next, a PLS predict analysis was run in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161]</ref>.</p><p>The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">VI</ref> show that in both construct and indicator levels all the Q 2 values are above 0. Therefore, the model offers a satisfactory predictive performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, a similar conclusion was obtained at the indicator levels when the results in terms of RMSE or MAE of the PLS-SEM were compared with those of the linear regression model (LM). In most cases, and especially in the constructs referring to Performance, PLS-SEM findings have a lower prognostication error and greater Q 2 . This would mean a theoretically established path model improves (or at least does not worsen) the predictive performance of the available indicator data <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref>.</p><p>In summary, this model has power to predict values for further observations of Job Satisfaction, Innovation and Performance variables using data that are not included in those used to test the research model <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163]</ref>. As a result, an additional support for the model tested in this research has been offered by the predictive validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion and conclusion</head><p>This research has addressed the question of whether CSR contributes to improve SMEs performance in the construction sector, and whether this relationship is mediated by job satisfaction and innovation. It uses a sample of 503 Spanish construction companies.</p><p>In line with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, the findings demonstrate that performance is influenced by CSR, job satisfaction, and innovation. These effects are not only direct and positive but significant indirect effects are also achieved, which increase the positive effects of CSR. The results show that the performance of SMEs benefits from CSR, because CSR enables business growth by generating benefits for stakeholders and enhancing the company's reputation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. As a result, this social commitment made by the company will increase the competitive advantages for companies, so improving their market position <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref>.</p><p>The results also indicate that CSR practices are relevant for job satisfaction. This is in line with Story and Castanheira <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> and Tamm et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>, who find that if a company has a powerful CSR strategy, the employees will feel more satisfied at work, and at the same time, employee satisfaction has a significant function in improving corporate performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>. Our results also indicate that job satisfaction mediates in the relationship between CSR and performance. As a result, companies that invest in CSR practices have employees who are more satisfied and who in turn perform better. These results are consistent with Story and Castanheira <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>.</p><p>The results for Hypothesis 3 indicate that when only job satisfaction and business performance are considered, the relationship is positive and significant. There is also a significant relationship between job satisfaction and innovation. This was expected because when the employees are satisfied they contribute to the development of innovative process. This finding is consistent with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[165]</ref> and it confirms the positive and significant relationship between job satisfaction and innovation. Moreover, our results indicate that innovation mediates the relationship between job satisfaction and business performance. To achieve better business performance, managers have to improve innovation process by managing job satisfaction. This result is consistent with Alrubaiee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[166]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168]</ref>, who found that job satisfaction has an influence on business performance through innovation. Furthermore, our results also indicate that job satisfaction mediates the relationship between CSR and innovation. This implies that CSR leads to better innovation in Spanish SMEs through job satisfaction. This results are consistent with Santos-Jaén et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, it is interesting to highlight the indirect effect of CSR on performance through innovation. Our results are in line with those observed in previous studies, which claim that CSR changes the corporate business model <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169]</ref> by increasing the innovative capacity of organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. In this vein, the results of this study underline the findings of much of the previous work in this field, which affirms that the adoption of new technologies is the nexus between CSR and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[170]</ref>. This is because when an SME implements CSR in its business process, it requires a higher degree of innovation to be able to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Innovation will also give the organisation advantages over its competitors, as the new innovative product will have greater differentiation, leading to lower barriers to market entry <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>.</p><p>Innovation will therefore provide certain competitive advantages that will enhance business performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, this research builds an in-depth analysis of the influence of CSR on companies' performance by investigating the mediating effects of both job satisfaction and innovation simultaneously and sequentially. The results reveal that both job satisfaction and innovation play important mediating roles in the understanding of the relationship between CSR and companies' performance. In conclusion, the higher the CSR, the greater the performance of companies. But not only due to the effects of CSR on the company, but also because of the increased capacity of the company to carry out innovative activities, which is partly achieved by a better and greater predisposition of its human capital.</p><p>With these findings we contribute to filling a gap related to the direct effect of CSR on performance, and the indirect effect through the mediation of job satisfaction and innovation in a specific sector, in this case construction Spanish SMEs. Moreover, our model has demonstrated a predictive power to support the research model proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref>.</p><p>This research makes important contributions to the theory and research on CSR, innovation, human resources management and performance in SMEs by integrating into the literature the roles that job satisfaction and innovation play as enhancers in the relationship between CSR and performance in constructions SMEs. In particular, this study has implications for the ongoing debate regarding the antecedents of performance in an SME setting.</p><p>This study highlights several important implications. From a practical point of view, it will help many SME managers to reconsider their thoughts about CSR, from considering it as a cost to considering it as a source of competitive advantage in the medium term <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[171]</ref>. This paradigm shift is an opportunity for SMEs to begin a process of strategic change by orienting their human resources management and innovative activity more and more towards CSR, which will undoubtedly increase their capacity to adapt to the environment they cohabit <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[172]</ref>. This is essential for their survival at a time like the current one, when the pandemic generated by COVID-19 threatens to close down a large number of companies. This new, more responsible, approach will also enable them to increase their performance. Therefore, this study suggests to SME managers that investing part of their resources in CSR is not only beneficial to society but also to the companies themselves. Furthermore, in line with Fernández-Gámez et al. ( <ref type="formula">2019</ref>) the results provide governments with evidence that responsible practices are capable of generating value for firms and ensuring their survival. For this reason, especially SMEs with fewer resources should be able to count on public support to carry out CSR actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[174]</ref> in the form of incentives or subsidies to establish CSR projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[175]</ref>. This will help the construction sector to be one of the economic engines that will enable a return to economic growth and employment creation.</p><p>The present study should be evaluated in the light of its limitations, which could reveal further lines of research. Firstly, the sample only includes construction Spanish SMEs. Hence, the results could not be generalized to other sectors and other regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[176]</ref>. It would be attractive to extend the research in other geographical areas or/and sectors, so the results obtained could be compared <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Secondly, the study has been carried out applying transversal data. In this sense, a longitudinal study would be interesting in order to analyze the time effects in the proposed model <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref>. Thirdly, it could also be interesting to use quantitative data, instead of a unique source, the judgment of SME managers <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[178]</ref>.</p><p>Despite the above limitations, this research brings new insights into the connection between CSR and performance, accepting that this relationship can be mediated by job satisfaction and innovation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
