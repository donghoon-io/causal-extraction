It is hard to compete with their enemies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Robbins and Judge, 2013)</ref>. To effectively manage human resources, managers have to consider people as the central factor of the development and offer opportunities to promote the potentials of employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Herzberg, 2005)</ref>. This becomes possible if managers understand the desire of workers to give them the motivation to achieve the best results. Work motivation is one of the most important factors that strongly affect the performance of employees. Labor productivity is enhanced through motivational policies, this has been demonstrated in previous studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kamery (2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Borman (2004)</ref>, Mai <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Anh (2011)</ref>. For employees to be motivated to work, managers need to build practical, timely, and appropriate policies for each individual to promote their work motivation.</p><p>Otuksa Japan Trading -Production -Import Export Production Trading Joint Stock Company (Otuksa Japan) specializes in agro-pharmaceuticals and seafood trading. More than 70% of the company's employees are sales staff. They are usually under lots of pressure such as sales pressure, pressure from customers, or the leader. If managers have appropriate policies to encourage employees, their work efficiency will improve. To evaluate the influence of work motivation on employees' work results, the study "Effect of work motivation on employee performance at Otuksa Japan" is necessary. Based on the obtained results, the study proposes some managerial implications to promote work motivation and improve results for employees at Otuksa Japan.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Work motivation</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Herzberg (1959)</ref>, work motivation is a psychological process arising from the excitement, direction, and perseverance of employees to achieve individual and organizational goals. Work motivation is the voluntary, desire, and effort to work that helps employees achieve personal goals, thereby obtaining the organizational objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bedeian, 1993)</ref>. Work motivation is an internal impulse based on an individual's basic conscious (or unconscious) needs that lead them to work towards the goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Carr, 2005)</ref>. As presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pinder (2014)</ref>, work motivation is an assemblage of internal and external powerful energies of an individual to perform work-related behaviors and determine the direction, intensity, and duration of work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Work performance</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Judge and Bono (2001)</ref>, work performance is measured by the evaluation of the leader, colleagues, and self-assessment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kuvaas (2006)</ref> has stated that job performance is reflected by job completion (achievement of sales targets on time, difficult tasks that exceed expectations), relationship with customers (keep the existing customers and the ability to find potential ones), peer feedback, and the leader's feedback. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Karunanithy and Ponnampalam (2013)</ref>, job result is measured by the criteria of time principle, relationship with clients, relationship with colleagues, feedback from superiors, and self-confidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Relationship between working conditions with motivation</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kovach (1987)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anh (2017)</ref>, a safe environment with reasonable working hours and a well-organized workplace may help promote employee motivation. In the organization, working conditions such as safety protective equipment make employees feel secure and focused on their work. This is the basis to create high productivity, quality, and work performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Herzberg, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Reio and Callahon, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Robbins and Judge, 2014)</ref>. Therefore, the study suggests hypothesis H1: Working conditions have a positive impact on the work motivation of employees at Otuksa Japan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Relationship between job characteristics and motivation</head><p>Anh (2017) has argued that job characteristics show the way and the level of job performance. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kovach (1987)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hadi and Adil (2010)</ref>, a job that always requires improvement is an important motivating factor for employees. If employees are proactive in performing work and the tasks are divided properly, they will be more confident and enthusiastic, thereby leading to higher motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kamery, 2004)</ref>. Thus, the study hypothesizes H2: Job characteristics positively affect the work motivation of employees at Otuksa Japan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">The relationship between benefits and motivation</head><p>Salary and bonus policies affect employee motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Thu and Khoi, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Uyen, 2007)</ref>. Studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Osterloh et al. (2002)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Herzberg (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Reio and Callahon (2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jankingthong and Rurkkhum (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anh (2017)</ref> showed that salary, bonus, and welfare are factors that have the most impact on employee motivation. The study proposes hypothesis H3: Income and welfare have a positive impact on the work motivation of employees at Otuksa Japan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">The relationship between career development and motivation</head><p>Dung and Vy (2011) have indicated that training opportunities that satisfy the development needs of employees may stimulate them to perform better. In addition to this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kovach (1987)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bretz et al. (1992)</ref> have said that career development is an essential goal of any worker which influences their work responsibilities. The promotion has a great impact on employee engagement, promoting greater dedication <ref type="bibr">(Reio and Callahon, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Robbins and Judge, 2014)</ref>. Hence, hypothesis H4 is as follows: Career development has a positive impact on the work motivation of employees at Otuksa Japan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.">The relationship between corporate culture with motivation</head><p>Corporate culture is one of the factors that directly affect employee motivation. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kovach (1987)</ref>, Chew (2004), <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Shah et al. (2012)</ref>, good corporate cultures increase the cooperation of the team which enhances the motivation of the employees. Anh (2017) has confirmed that corporate culture governs the feelings and thoughts of employees, so if the corporate culture is taken care of, it may help employees improve their motivation and become more engaged. The study suggests hypothesis H5: Corporate culture positively influences the work motivation of Otuksa Japan's employees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8.">The relationship between leadership style and motivation</head><p>Managers usually apply one of three leadership styles: directive style (authoritarian), democratic style (collective), and liberal style (laissez-faire or anarchic), cording to <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Uyen (2007)</ref>. As confirmed by <ref type="bibr">Chew (2004)</ref> shows that employees' motivation depends on the leadership behavior of managers. Inheriting the previous study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Herzberg (2003)</ref> had proven that leadership style has a positive impact on motivation. Hence, the study proposes H6: Leadership style positively affects the work motivation of employees at Otuksa Japan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.9.">The relationship between workplace relationships with motivation</head><p>All employees in any position, need the support and help of colleagues, seek comfort and friendliness when working <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hill et al., 2014)</ref>. Besides, employees with good and close relationships with colleagues are more motivated to work and easily achieve organizational goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kovach, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Herzberg, 2003)</ref>. Employees maintain a close relationship and usually share with colleagues, they are more inspired at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anh, 2017)</ref>. The study hypothesized H7: Colleague relationships have a positive effect on the work motivation of employees at Otuksa Japan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.10.">The relationship between work motivation and performance</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kovach (1987)</ref>, worker motivation is a crucial factor to improve work results. Labor productivity is enhanced through motivational policies, which has been demonstrated in previous studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Herzberg (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kamery (2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Borman (2004)</ref>. As argued by Mai Anh (2011) and Anh (2017), there is a positive relationship between work motivation and work results.

However, the exact size of the sample size is currently not defined. Also, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hoelter (1983)</ref> has believed that the minimum sample size should be 200. This study collected 200 observations using convenience sampling. The survey subjects are employees who are working at Otuksa Japan. Therefore, the sample size meets the requirements, ensuring the reliability to test the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Test the reliability of scales</head><p>To determine the factors affecting work motivation and the relationship between work motivation and performance, the study used the software SPSS 22 and AMOS 22 to support the analysis. Results are estimated step by step as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Step 1: Scale reliability test</head><p>The study checks the reliability of the scales by Cronbach's Alpha coefficient. Based on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, all 36 observed variables of 9 factors achieve Cronbach's Alpha values from 0.743 to 0.832 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Nunnally, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Peterson, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Slater, 1995)</ref>. Moreover, all variables have item-total correlation values greater than 0.3. Therefore, they are used for the next step of exploratory factor analysis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Step 2: Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)</head><p>The research model requires the EFA to be performed twice. The first EFA is for independent scales (working conditions, job characteristics, income and benefits, career development, corporate culture, leadership style, and workplace relationships): (1) Reliability of observed variables (Factor loading) &gt; 0.5; (2) Suitability test of the model (0.5 &lt; KMO = 0.740 &lt; 1.0); (3) Bartlett's test on the correlation of observed variables (Sig. = 0.00 &lt; 0.05); (4) Total variance extracted = 50.7% &gt; 50%. The variables achieve discriminant and convergent validity <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al, 1998)</ref>. Therefore, 7 factors are created from 28 observed variables, there is no variable disturbance, so the name of the factor is still the same. Similarly, the second EFA applies for the motivation and performance scales: (1) Reliability of observed variables (Factor loading) &gt; 0.5; (2) Suitability of the model (0.5 &lt; KMO = 0.802 &lt; 1.0); (3) Bartlett's test on correlation of observed variables (Sig. = 0.00 &lt; 0.05); (4) Total variance extracted = 51.05% &gt; 50%. The observed variables get discriminant and convergent validity <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al, 1998)</ref>. Thus, these scales do not have disturbance in variables, the factors' name remains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Step 3: Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)</head><p>After the EFA, the above nine factors continued to be included in CFA. The results of CFA analysis show that the following conditions are guaranteed: Chi-square/df = 1.092 &lt; 2 with P = 0.000 ≤ 0.05. The TLI and CFI indexes have values of 0.975 and 0.978, all higher than 0.9. RMSEA = 0.022 &lt; 0.08. This proves that the model fits the market data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gerbing and Anderson, 1988)</ref>. The standardized regression weights are all &gt; 0.5 and the unstandardized regression weights are statistically significant, so the scales gain convergent validity. Besides, correlation coefficients among factors are all less than 1 with a standard deviation (&lt;0.05). Therefore, the scales achieve discriminant validity.</p><p>Based on the analysis of the composite reliability (Pc) and average variance extracted (Pvc), the Pc meets the conditions while the Pvc of one scale is a bit low (&lt; 0.5). However, the Pvc can be accepted at a value from 0.4 or above if the Pc value is greater than 0.6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fraering and Minor, 2006)</ref>. Therefore, all the scales in the model meet the requirements of value and reliability, so they are suitable for use in SEM. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Test the theoretical model and research hypothesis</head><p>Following the CFA step, structural equation modeling (SEM) helps to test the research hypotheses. The estimated value indicates the degree of impact of each factor on the employees' motivation and performance.</p><p>The larger the absolute value of this indicator, the higher the impact level. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> shows that the factors of working conditions, income and benefits, career development, and co-worker relations have a positive impact on the motivation of Otuksa Japan's employees. Also, the employees' work motivation positively affects their performance. If work motivation is enhanced, employees work in excitement, joy, and enthusiasm, so work results improve. This research result is consistent with previous studies of Herzberg <ref type="bibr">(2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kamery (2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Borman (2004)</ref>, Mai Anh (2011), and Anh (2017).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>The study has found out factors that positively affect the work motivation of employees at Otuksa Japan, including working conditions, income and benefits, career development, and workplace relationships. In which, career development is the factor that has the most influence on motivation. Most importantly, the study has indicated a positive relationship between work motivation and performance. Research results are an important scientific basis for managers of Otuksa Japan to have strategies to improve work motivation and work results of employees.</p></div>
