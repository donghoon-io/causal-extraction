<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose: This study aims to analyze green supply chain management (GSCM) and green marketing strategies (GMS) to green purchasing intentions (GPI). This study conducts on craft SMEs in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia.</p><p>Design/methodology/approach: This study uses primary data which is obtained through questionnaires. The unit of analysis in this study is organizations and individuals. The sampling technique is purposive sampling, with the criteria of SMEs that conduct environmentally friendly production processes and consumers who have ever bought green products. Data analysis uses structural equation modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings:</head><p>The results of the data analysis show that there is an influence of green supply chain management on green marketing strategy, and there is an influence of green marketing strategy on green purchase intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research limitations/implications:</head><p>This study is limited by relatively small sample size. The sample is only environmentally oriented SMEs. Large companies that are also environmentally friendly have not been included as samples in this study, so the results of this study only generalized to SMEs. Future research should accommodate these two types of companies, namely SMEs and companies, so that it can be easier to generalize the findings and allow different tests of GSCM to be applied to SMEs and large companies. This study only analyzed GSCM from two dimensions, namely GP and GCC. Other variables that can be used to explain GSCM are internal environmental, green information systems, eco-design and packaging.</p><p>Practical implications: GSCM can be started with conducts the right GP and always coordinating with consumers which related to green products. GP (green purchasing) and GCC (green consumer cooperation) as GSCM elements have a strong association in predicting the success of a green marketing strategy. It is expected that SMEs should pay attention to the raw material purchase, so that the problem of environmentally friendly raw materials can be truly obtained to enter the production process and produce environmentally friendly products.</p><p>Originality/value: This study analyzes the relationship between GSCM practices and organizational performance in the green marketing and business strategiescontext, where there is still a scarcity of studies in this context. Besides that, there is an increase in awareness of green operations and green marketing in Asia, but the relevant studies in Asian countries have not been conducted much, especially in Southeast Asia. The result of this study proves that the GSCM model can increase value along the supply chain by emphasizing green supply chain management and green marketing.</p></div>

Due to consumer and export demand, there are many craft SMEs which oriented in nature. It means that they use natural raw materials and the production process is environmentally friendly, so that the product result is an environmental friendly product or green products. Environmental management has become a major concern for SME businesses <ref type="bibr">(Sugandini et al., 2018b)</ref>. The scarcity of natural resources forces business managers to change the supply chain strategy to be oriented with environmental perspective.

GSCP requires the implementation of systems throughout the supply chain by conducting collaboration in the organization and cooperation between internal and external management <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Zhu, Dou &amp; Sarkis, 2010)</ref>. The scope of GSCM includes the implementation and monitoring of general environmental management programs to create more company control through Rs (Reduce, Re-use, Rework, Re-furbish, Reclaim, Recycle, Re-manufacture, relogistic) which aims to minimize waste. So far, the production process caused environmental damage such as waste, ecosystem disturbances, and natural resources depletion <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fortes, 2009)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">GSCM and Green Marketing Strategy</head><p>The globalization development and lifestyle changes made company to changes. Industrialization has increased greenhouse gas emissions, global warming and ecological degradation. Consumers more aware of environmental problems and prefer environmentally friendly products. This condition forces companies to carry out environmentally friendly production process and change their supply chain to GSC. Green Marketing Strategy (GMS) is corporate marketing strategy that aims to satisfy customer needs by minimizing environmental impacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Yazdanifard &amp; Mercy, 2011)</ref>. Consumers buy toxic-free products which produced minimum levels of pollution and environmental impact. Companies that have successfully adopted GSCM can conduct green marketing so they can generate profit <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sarkar, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>GSCM emphasizes lifecycle costing, asset efficiency, waste reduction, service innovation and recycling. GSCM stimulates product and service innovations, increases asset utilization, and enhances customer relationships and service which focus on reducing waste (green marketing) and costs (van den Broek, 2010). GSCM will improve the company's focus on green marketing strategies, because GSCM starts the supply chain from environmentally friendly suppliers of raw materials, produced with environmentally friendly technology and produces environmentally friendly products. Green marketing is companies' activities that are environmentally conscious and green environmental sustainability <ref type="bibr">(Crane, 2000)</ref>. Green marketing is a mechanism to increase customer awareness, perception and knowledge of green products and green concepts. These environmentally friendly products are a prerequisite for green marketing <ref type="bibr">(Sugandini, Mujanah, Sudiyarto., Indah, Priyadi &amp; Muafi, 2018a)</ref>.</p></div>

The model shows that the consumer intention of Green Purchase antecedents is influenced by the Green Marketing Strategy and GSCM. GSCM in this study uses two dimensions, namely green purchasing and green consumer cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Purwanto, 2002)</ref>. Measurement of discriminant validity is conducted by looking at low correlation values between constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Nunnally, 1978)</ref>. The next step is conduct reliability testing to test the consistency of the indicators used in the study. Indicators for all variables show consistency. It can be look at the Cronbach's alpha coefficient which has coefficient ≥ 0.7. Individuals as respondents in this study must have good consistency in giving answers to each question items. Because of multidimensional indicators, the validity test of each latent variable / construct will be tested by looking at the loading factor of the relationship between each observed variable and latent variable. The limit value used to assess an acceptable level of reliability is 0.70. The second measure of reliability is variance extracted which shows the amount of variance from the indicators extracted by the latent construct developed. This variance extracted value is recommended at a level of at least 0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bentler, 1992)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Data Analysis Technique</head><p>This study uses structural equation modeling (SEM). Direct influence (Path Coefficient) is observed from standardized regression weights, by testing the comparative significance of CR (Critical Ratio). Testing of models developed with various Goodness of Fit criteria. Measurement of goodness of fit model is a relative criterion. The use of several goodness of fit index allows researchers to get an acceptance of the proposed model <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hair et al., 1998)</ref>. The measurement of goodness of fit model is divided into three types, namely absolute fit measures, incremental fit measures, and parsimonious fit measures. Absolute fit measures measure the level of the model that overall predicts the covariance matrix. In this study, testing of absolute fit measures was conducted by using chi-square statistics (χ2 or CMIN), GFI, and RMSEA index.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Interpretation of Results</head><p>The interpretation of latent extracts measurement result is based on the level of significance of the loading factor or the coefficient of lambda (λ) which is based on the probability value (p). We considered it is significant if the p value is &lt; 0.05. Furthermore, testing the complete model derived from all constructs and significant indicators to examine the factors that influence the green purchase intention by observing the path coefficient (standardized regression) namely direction, magnitude, and significance. The assessment of significance is based on the probability value (p value &lt; 0.5).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Validity and Reliability Testing Results</head><p>Testing of construct validity refers to the validity of convergent and discriminant. Convergent validity shows that the values obtained from the questions that measure the same concept have high correlation, while discriminant validity shows the values obtained from the items that measure different constructs do not correlate each other. Measurement of convergent validity conduct by looking at all loading from a latent construct to the corresponding indicators which having CR value ≥ 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Purwanto, 2002)</ref> and the required lamda (standardized factor loading) is greater than 0.4. If this condition is not achieved, the value of the critical ratio or CR that is identical to the t-count greater than 2 also shows that the indicator is significantly a dimension of the factors formed <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hair et al., 1998)</ref>.</p><p>The results of testing validity construct can be seen in the following Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Based on Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, it can be seen that all question items are valid because they have a factor loading greater than 0.4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hair et al., 1998)</ref>. Reliability testing is conducted by testing internal consistency, contruct reliability and extracted variance. Reliability test results can be seen in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. The limit value of acceptable level of reliability is 0.70. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hair et al., 1998)</ref>. Variance extracted shows the number of variance indicators extracted by the latent construct developed. High variance extracted value indicate that the indicators have well represented developed latent constructs. The recommended variance extracted value is at least 0.50. The results of the internal consistency reliability testing for each construct using the Conbach's Alpha coefficient have met the required rules of thumb &gt; 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hair et al., 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Other reliability test performed is construct reliability test and extracted variance. Construct reliability and extracted variance show consistent instruments, which are indicated by the construct reliability value above 0.7 and extracted variance ≥ 0.50. Both tests are still in the internal consistency test corridor which will give researchers greater confidence that individual indicators measure a similar measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hair et al., 1998)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">The Results of Testing Green Purchase Intention Using SEM</head><p>The results of testing the green purchase intention model using AMOS 21 can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, and evaluation of the results of testing the model can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>.  Hypothesis testing is conducted by comparing the probability value (p)it is significant if the p value is&lt; 0.05. With these criteria, all the paths shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> above are significant. GP has a significant positive effect on GMS of 31.8%. GCC has a significant positive effect on GMS of 63.5%. GMS has a positive effect on GPI of 75.5%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>The study results indicate that the green purchase intention model can be accepted, it means that this model can be explained by green purchasing, green consumer cooperation and green marketing strategy. Furthermore, the result proves that green purchasing has a positive effect on green marketing strategy (H1 accepted). The result of data analysis shows that SMEs have implemented green purchasing through the selection of suppliers which are concern with the environment, conduct environmental audits to suppliers' partners, and have suppliers which supply environmentally friendly raw materials. The implementation of green purchasing causes SMEs to have specific policies to choose partners, use renewable energy sources for products / services, participate in every pro-environment activity and have a target market for consumers who are pro-environment. The craft SMEs which are become the object of research have products that are also environmentally friendly, because it uses natural raw materials and pro-environment production processes as well, such as batik, knitting, leather craft, water hyacinth craft and others.</p><p>The results of this study support the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Olaore and Adebisi (2013)</ref> which state that purchasing decisions for green raw materials is one of the strategic processes carried out in a series of operational and influential activities on green marketing strategies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wisner et al. (2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Min and Galle (2001)</ref> also state that companies that decided to conduct green marketing must also implement a green supply chain, from the purchasing to the distribution of green products to consumers. So that the decision to purchase green raw materials will greatly influence the success of the company's green marketing strategy. The purchasing function plays an important role in the selection of raw materials, supply of components and parts <ref type="bibr">(Zsidisin &amp; Siferd, 2001)</ref> The second hypothesis which states that there is association between green consumer cooperation to green marketing strategy is accepted. The results of this study indicate that the collaboration between SMEs and customers regarding clean production processes, environmentally friendly packaging, eco label design and good logistical resources encourages companies to establish green marketing strategies. The green marketing strategy conducted by SMEs in DIY Indonesia can be seen from the concentration of SME marketing strategy planning that has led to environmentally friendly products. In addition, SMEs in DIY have applied green business and always interacted with suppliers and distributors who are also oriented with environmentally friendly products, even these SMEs have targeted consumers who like green products. The results of this study support the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Vachon and Klassen (2006)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Green et al. (2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zhang et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Laari et al. (2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Vachon and Klassen's (2006)</ref> show that collaboration with green product customers (GCC) can increase the success of a green marketing strategy. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zhang et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Laari et al. (2016)</ref>, Good GCC made companies easily improve green marketing performance through a well-designed green marketing strategy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zhang et al., (2017)</ref> state that based on natural resource-based view (NRBV) theory, companies which survive in competition must be concerned with environmental pollution. NRBV emphasizes that success in overcoming environmental problems can provide more business competition opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Laari et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Muafi, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The third hypothesis which states that there is an association of green marketing strategy on the green purchase intention is accepted. The result indicates that the seriousness of SMEs in implementing green marketing strategies can increase consumers' intention to buy green products. The success of a green marketing strategy increases consumers' intention to buy green products. Consumers recognize that SMEs have implemented a green marketing strategy. This is indicated by SMEs provide environmentally friendly products and the products packaging are made from recycled paper and can easily recycled. This SME in DIY does not use plastic-based packaging as a form of environment protection.</p><p>By implementing the suitable green marketing strategy, green product customers are easier to consume green products and recommend green products to other consumers. Furthermore, green products consumers are more responsible for environmental preservation. The results of this study support the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Maheshwari (2014)</ref> which states that green marketing strategy is responsible for meeting the sustainability demands of green customers. Green marketing educates customers to be environmentally responsible and consume green products <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Grant, 2007)</ref>. GMS conducted by companies to increase customer knowledge about green products and green products demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Oyewole, 2001)</ref>. The success of green marketing strategies increases knowledge and awareness of environmental problems and increases the purchase intention of green products (Andrew-Gilg, 2005; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Uthamaputhran et al., 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Maheshwari (2014)</ref> also states that the success of a green marketing strategy has an impact on green brand awareness and purchase intentions of green products. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Papadas et al., (2017)</ref> state that in a green marketing strategy, the company focuses on environmentally friendly suppliers, use renewable resources, and have green consumer targets. Green marketing strategies can increase consumer buying intentions on green products <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lee, 2017)</ref>.</p></div>

Although all GSCM can be effective in achieving high green marketing performance, practitioners must understand each SMEs characteristics. Because each SMEs in DIY has different product characteristics and raw materials and different production processes.</p><p>2. GSCM which is conducted by the company can be started by conduct the right GP and always coordinating with consumers which related to green products. GP and GCC as GSCM elements have a strong influence in predicting the success of a green marketing strategy. It is expected that SMEs should pay attention to the purchase of raw materials, so that the issue of environmentally friendly raw materials can be truly obtained to enter the production process and produce environmentally friendly products.</p><p>3. The intention to buy green products is influenced by the green marketing strategy which is carried out by SMEs. SMEs should set green consumers as their target market, so when designing marketing strategies, SMEs begin to make policies related to partners to supply environmentally friendly raw materials, use renewable natural resources, conduct environmentally friendly production processes, environmentally friendly packaging and eco design. The suitable green marketing strategy can produce products that are truly environmentally friendly and can compete in the global market.</p></div>

The construct validity consists of two types of testing, namely the convergence and discriminant validity. Convergent validity shows the obtained value from the questions that measure the same concept which has high correlation, while discriminant validity shows the obtained value from the items that measure different constructs which do not correlate each other. The constructs in this study are measured by one method. Measurement of convergent validity is conduct by looking at all loading of latent construct to the corresponding indicators which has statistical value t &gt; 2</figDesc><table><row><cell>4.3.
