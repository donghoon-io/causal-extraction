<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Adolescent problem behaviors such as conduct disorder and attention-defi cit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are often associated with alcohol problems in adulthood, particularly alcohol dependence. This association is partly a result of shared genetic liability. However, it is unclear whether ADHD, or an ADHD subtype, shares genetic infl uences with alcohol dependence beyond those also shared by conduct disorder. Method: We evaluated phenotypic associations between adolescent conduct disorder and ADHD phenotypes with adult alcohol dependence in a population-based sample of adult male twins (N = 1,774). We then assessed genetic and environmental relationships among phenotypes using structural equation modeling. Results: Individually, conduct disorder and each ADHD factor were associated with adult alcohol dependence. Results from twin modeling indicate that a genetic factor common to conduct disorder and ADHD also loads strongly onto alcohol dependence. Even after controlling for genetic factors shared with conduct disorder and other ADHD factors, the hyperactivity component of ADHD shared signifi cant residual genetic infl uences with alcohol dependence. Conclusions: Most of the genetically mediated association between adolescent ADHD and adult alcohol dependence is shared with conduct disorder, refl ecting a generalized risk to externalizing behaviors. The signifi cant residual genetic covariance between the ADHD factor hyperactivity/impulsivity and alcohol dependence implies that impulsive behaviors less destructive/harmful than those manifested by conduct disorder can be indicative of genetic risk for adult alcohol dependence. However, the ADHD factors inattention and forgetfulness are not uniquely predictive of genetic/environmental risk for alcohol dependence. (J.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>E PIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES HAVE consistently identifi ed a phenotypic association between adolescent problem behaviors and adult alcohol use. In particular, conduct disorder (CD) and adolescent attention-defi cit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are often correlated with later alcohol use disorders, especially alcohol dependence (AD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arias et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Friedrichs et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Knop et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Langley et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Weiss et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Whalen et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">White et al., 2001)</ref>. Each of these disorders is characterized to some extent by externalizing behavior, raising the possibility that a general liability to such behavior contributes to the association among phenotypes.</p><p>Evidence from twin studies and molecular genetic studies indicates that some portion of the observed association is due to a shared genetic liability among disorders. Multiple reports support the existence of a substantial genetic correlation (r G ) between CD or adult antisocial behavior and AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Haber et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kendler et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Slutske et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Young et al., 2000)</ref>, with estimates ranging from r G ≈ .4 to .8. Studies examining shared genetic liability between ADHD and AD are less common. A genetic correlation between these phenotypes has been reported in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Knopik et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Young et al., 2000)</ref>, although such a relationship was not detected in a sample of adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Knopik et al., 2009)</ref>. That a genetic correlation between ADHD and AD is detected in adults but not in adolescents parallels fi ndings for CD and AD; although the genetic correlation between CD and adult AD is robust (see above), the relationship between CD and adolescent AD symptoms is largely environmentally mediated <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rose et al., 2004)</ref>. Thus, these childhood or adolescent behavioral disorders are potentially useful indicators of genetic risk of adult AD but might be less informative of genetic risk of earlier alcohol problems.</p><p>In addition to shared latent genetic infl uences, molecular and statistical genetic studies have identifi ed specifi c genes in which allelic variation has been associated with both CD and AD, or with ADHD and AD. These include DAT1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sharp et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">van der Zwaluw et al., 2009)</ref>, GABRA2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dick et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Edenberg et al., 2004)</ref>, CHRM2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dick et al., 2008)</ref>, and CDH13 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Franke et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Treutlein et al., 2009)</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr">Dick and colleagues (2010a)</ref> identifi ed 23 genes on chromosome 2 that harbor markers associated with a "behavioral disinhibition" phenotype in which individuals were considered "affected" if they were alcohol dependent and had either met criteria for CD or had attempted suicide. Although different variants within each gene might be associated with these outcomes, such fi ndings reinforce the notion that common genetic factors or networks underlie the phenotypic associations among CD, ADHD, and AD. These shared genetic infl uences could generally infl uence externalizing, even if those tendencies manifest in different ways (e.g., CD in one individual, ADHD in another, and a comorbid phenotype in a third).</p><p>Despite much progress in this area, unanswered questions remain with regard to the relationship among CD, ADHD, and AD. For example, because CD and ADHD are genetically correlated <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dick et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Knopik et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Silberg et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Young et al., 2000)</ref>, it is not clear whether ADHD is independently genetically correlated with AD or whether most (or all) of the genetic variation shared between ADHD and AD is also common to CD. This is an important distinction. Is shared liability limited to a genetic factor that broadly infl uences multiple externalizing phenotypes (including adult AD), or are the various manifestations of externalizing behavior (CD, ADHD, etc.) differentially genetically informative? This point is applicable within the range of ADHD phenotypes as well. The multidimensional nature of ADHD raises the question of whether any genetic correlation between ADHD and AD is specifi c to a particular component of the disorder. For example, we might hypothesize that the association is primarily related to hyperactive/ impulsive manifestations of ADHD and less relevant to the inattentive subtype. This distinction has potential clinical relevance; if ADHD subtypes are differentially indicative of genetic risk to adult alcohol problems, treatment and prevention efforts could be tailored accordingly.</p><p>Here, we report findings from a population-based, genetically informative sample of adult men regarding the genetic relationship between AD and adolescent ADHD and CD. The primary goal of the study was to determine whether AD shares genetic and/or environmental infl uences with ADHD in addition to those that are accounted for by CD. Do we gain information about liability to AD by considering ADHD in addition to CD? In particular, we examined whether different phenotypic factors of ADHD are differentially related, genetically or environmentally, to AD. By separating ADHD into phenotypic dimensions (e.g., hyperactivity and inattention) and including these components alongside CD in a single model, we can determine the specifi city of genetic factors shared between adult AD and each manifestation of adolescent externalizing behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>Participants were part of the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders, which has been previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kendler and Prescott, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The current sample consisted of male pairs who participated in Waves 2 and 3 of the study (comparable externalizing data were not collected on female pairs). This use of data across different assessments reduces the possibility of occasion-specifi c reporter bias. The sample consisted of 1,774 individuals, all with complete data and of known zygosity, comprising 1,073 monozygotic and 701 dizygotic twins. There were 458 complete monozygotic pairs and 282 complete dizygotic pairs; 294 individuals were members of incomplete pairs. Zygosity was determined using a combination of self-report measures, photographs, and genotyping <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kendler and Prescott, 2006)</ref>. Mean age in Wave 2 was 36.1 years (range: 20-57 years); in Wave 3, mean age was 40.3 years (range: 24-62 years). The project received human subjects approval from Virginia Commonwealth University, and participants provided informed consent before all interviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Conduct disorder. Data for the current analyses were obtained in Wave 2 (AD) and Wave 3 (ADHD and CD).</p><p>Participants were asked 11 items corresponding to CD symptoms and were further asked to report on these symptoms during three age ranges: 8-11 years, 12-14 years, and 15-17 years. A mean symptom count was computed across these age ranges for preliminary analyses; this mean was converted into an ordinal symptom score ranging from 0 to 4 for twin modeling (see below). For simplicity, we will refer to this phenotype as "CD"; however, the items administered did not include all of the possible CD diagnostic criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric <ref type="bibr">Association, 2000)</ref>, and this phenotype does not represent a formal diagnosis.</p><p>Alcohol dependence. AD was assessed according to lifetime DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, requiring that symptoms are temporally clustered. Individuals meeting diagnostic criteria received a score of 1; those who did not received a score of 0. Individuals who had never used alcohol were scored as missing the AD diagnosis.</p><p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Participants were administered a scale to assess childhood/ adolescent (before age 18) ADHD symptoms; these items were worded differently than were those aimed at assessing CD in that respondents were asked about symptoms they experienced before age 18, rather than being asked about three different age ranges. Each item corresponded approximately to a DSM symptom; however, as with the CD phenotype, the items administered did not include all possible ADHD diagnostic criteria and do not represent a formal diagnosis. Each item had four responses: never, rarely, sometimes, and often (scored 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively). These scores were used to conduct a factor analysis (see below) in Mplus <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Muthén and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Muthén, 1998-2007)</ref>, which indicated that the ADHD construct comprised three factors: inattention (INATT), hyperactivity/impulsivity (HYPER), and forgetfulness (FOR-GET). Three items loaded preferentially onto the INATT factor, fi ve items loaded onto HYPER, and three items loaded onto FORGET. Broadly speaking, DSM symptoms of inattention were split across the INATT and FORGET factors, whereas DSM symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity were grouped together. Once the factor structure was determined, the original 11 items were recoded such that participants who reported that the item "sometimes" or "often" applied to them were considered to have endorsed that symptom and were given a score of 1 on that item; otherwise, they were given a score of 0. Each individual received a separate symptom count for each of the three factors identifi ed previously; thus, a participant could have a symptom count of 0-3 for INATT, 0-5 for HYPER, and 0-3 for FORGET. These were treated as ordinal variables in twin analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>Descriptive statistics and preliminary analyses. Descriptive statistics and preliminary analyses were obtained/ conducted using SAS 9.2 and JMP 8 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). When appropriate, signifi cance levels were adjusted for the twin structure of the data using generalized estimating equations. Regressions (which included age at Wave 2 interview as a covariate) were conducted in which adolescent externalizing phenotypes were included as predictive variables, with adult AD as the outcome variable.</p><p>Factor analysis. Factor analysis was conducted in MPlus 5.2. A quartimin rotation was used to accommodate correlations among factors. Based on results from a separate, unpublished analysis, and in agreement with model fi t statistics, we selected the three-factor model. Results were similar regardless of whether items were coded as continuous or ordinal variables. As described above, we named the three factors INATT, HYPER, and FORGET, with three, fi ve, and three items preferentially loading onto these factors, respectively. Additional information on the factor structure of ADHD in this sample is the topic of a forthcoming report and is thus not included here. Details are also available by request.</p><p>Twin modeling. Twin modeling was conducted in Mx <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Neale et al., 2006)</ref> using the raw ordinal data option. All twins were included in these analyses, including those who were members of incomplete pairs. In Mx, ordinal and continuous phenotypes cannot be included in the same model; because AD is necessarily an ordinal model, the CD and ADHD phenotypes had to be coded as ordinal variables as well. The use of ordinal data assumes that the categories are representative of an underlying normal distribution of liability, with thresholds in liability discriminating between categories.</p><p>In twin modeling, liability to phenotypes such as depression or alcohol use can be attributed to several latent sources of variance: additive genetic factors (A), shared environment (C), and unique environment (E). The C variance component represents environmental exposures and experiences that are shared by both members of a twin pair and contribute to twins' increased similarity, irrespective of zygosity, in a given phenotype. Environmental factors that are unique to one twin are accounted for by the E component; these factors reduce twin similarity for a given phenotype. The E component also includes measurement error. Estimates of each of these variance components are calculated by comparing the phenotypic correlation between monozygotic twins (who share all their genes), with dizygotic twins (who share half of their genes, on average, identical by descent). In the current sample, phenotypic correlations were higher for monozygotic twins than for dizygotic twins for each phenotype, suggesting that genetic variance contributes to manifestation of these phenotypes.</p><p>We used three Cholesky decomposition models, each with five observed variables: CD, INATT, FORGET, HYPER, and AD (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for an example). The models were constructed such that CD was the fi rst (leftmost) variable and AD was the last (right-most) variable; the order of the ADHD factors varied across models such that a different ADHD phenotypic factor was immediately adjacent to AD in each of the three models. The ordering of the variables in the model made it possible to determine the degree to which each ADHD factor shared genetic infl uences with AD after genetic infl uences shared with CD and the other ADHD factors had been accounted for (i.e., allowed testing for residual genetic covariance). This structure is analogous to a regression model in which CD and other ADHD factors are included as covariates. An identical structure existed for shared and unique environmental factors.</p><p>Based on prior reports of positive genetic correlations among phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Slutske et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Young et al., 2000)</ref>, we restricted genetic covariance among all phenotypes to be greater than or equal to zero. This constraint decreases the risk of statistical artifact, and when compared with the corresponding model without such a restriction, model fi t statistics did not differ substantially (difference in -2 log likelihood = 0.163). The full model included A, C, and E infl uences. Sampling only twins, we cannot simultaneously model C and dominance (D) genetic effects; furthermore, our sample size does not provide suffi cient power for the robust detection of D variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Martin et al., 1978)</ref>. Models included age at Wave 2 interview as a covariate. Submodels were compared with the full model (the genetic component of which is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) using the p value of the chi-square and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akaike, 1987)</ref> as an indicator of model fi t and parsimony.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive statistics</head><p>The mean (SE) CD score was 0.76 (0.02); these scores ranged from 0 to 7.33 out of a possible 11. Nearly one quarter (n = 419, 23.6%) of the sample met lifetime criteria for AD. As expected, all adolescent externalizing phenotypes were phenotypically correlated (r = .30-.54). In unadjusted regressions, mean CD and all three ADHD factors were each signifi cantly (p &lt; .01) associated with AD (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). We then conducted regressions in which mean CD, INATT, HYPER, and FORGET scores were all included in the model to predict AD, to determine whether any ADHD factor had predictive value above and beyond that of CD. Mean CD score and HYPER score, but not INATT and FORGET scores, remained signifi cantly associated with AD in this adjusted model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Twin modeling</head><p>Establishment of the full model. We next fi t twin models as described in the Method section. The fi t of the full models  differed slightly (by &lt;1.3 AIC units) depending on the order of the ADHD factors. Based on prior evidence of potential shared environmental infl uences on CD <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Jacobson et al., 2000)</ref>, we fi rst tested whether the C path specifi c to CD (y 11 ) could be set to 0. This resulted in a deterioration in model fi t (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>; Model 2 in A, B, and C). However, shared environmental infl uences could be dropped from the other phenotypes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>; Model 3 in A, B, and C). Submodels were fi t within this reduced model with the specifi c aim of testing whether each ADHD factor shared genetic (A) or environmental (E) infl uences with AD beyond those that were shared with CD and the other ADHD phenotypic factors. This was accomplished by testing the signifi cance of paths a 54 and e 54 . Genetic infl uences. Genetic path estimates, before testing whether path a 54 could be fi xed to 0, are provided in Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> provides genetic and environmental variance and covariance estimates from the full model, in which the ADHD factors were ordered INATT-FORGET-HYPER. The total genetic covariance between ADHD factors and AD ranged from .19 to .25, with the highest covariation between AD and HYPER. The corresponding genetic correlations are moderate (r G = .44-.65). Genetic covariance specifi c to each factor and AD was low (.00-.13). Total genetic covariance between CD and AD was similar to that between AD and each of the ADHD factors at .28, corresponding to r G = .76. Genetic covariance specifi c to CD and AD was low at .08 (29% of the total genetic covariance). The heritabilities of each phenotype are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</p><p>To test whether any of the ADHD factors shared genetic infl uences with AD beyond those shared with CD, we tested the signifi cance of the genetic covariance path specifi c to AD and each ADHD factor in the model. By alternating the order of the ADHD factors in the model, we tested this relationship (represented by path a 54 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) for each factor (HYPER, FORGET, and INATT). Results from these tests are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The genetic covariance specifi c to FORGET and AD, and that specifi c to INATT and AD, could be dropped from the model without signifi cant deterioration of fit (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2A</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2B</ref>, respectively). However, setting the genetic covariance specifi c to HYPER and AD to 0 resulted in a signifi cant deterioration in fi t (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2C</ref>).</p><p>Environmental infl uences. Environmental path estimates, before model fi tting, are provided in Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>. Total environmental covariances between ADHD phenotypes and AD were very low, ranging from -.08 to &lt;.01. Covariances specifi c to AD and each ADHD factor were similarly small. The total environmental variance of each ADHD factor    Notes: The total variance, total covariance with AD, and covariance specifi c to each phenotype with alcohol dependence (AD) are presented; both are derived from models in which the phenotype is adjacent to AD in the twin model, which is required for the calculation of the residual variance.

Environmental infl uences accounted for less of the total variance of CD (.52) and AD (.50). Shared environmental factors accounted for 21% of the total variance of CD. We tested the signifi cance of unique environmental covariance specifi c to each ADHD factor and AD in the same manner that we tested the corresponding genetic covariance. Results are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Setting the covariance between FORGET and AD to 0 resulted in a deterioration in fi t (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2A</ref>), although the p value of the chi-square test was greater than .05; the environmental covariance between these two variables was negative. Unique environmental covariance between INATT and AD, and that between HYPER and AD, could be dropped without a signifi cant deterioration in fi t (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2B</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2C</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The primary goal of these analyses was to determine whether AD shares genetic and/or environmental infl uences with ADHD above and beyond those that are accounted for by CD. In other words, do we gain additional information about risk of adult AD by considering multiple manifestations of adolescent externalizing problems? Our results indicate that the majority of genetic liability shared by adult AD and adolescent externalizing is accounted for by a genetic factor shared across all phenotypes. Howeverand critical to our research question-the ADHD factor HYPER provides additional information about genetic risk to AD above and beyond this general externalizing factor. Therefore, consideration of multiple adolescent externalizing phenotypes can improve prediction of genetic risk to adult AD.</p><p>Results from twin modeling were largely consistent with those from intra-individual regression analyses, with twin modeling clarifying the etiology of phenotypic associations.</p><p>Unadjusted regressions support previous reports of a phenotypic association between each manifestation of adolescent externalizing behavior and adult AD. Among the ADHD factors, this relationship with AD is strongest for HYPER, which remains signifi cantly associated with outcome in adjusted regressions. Twin modeling revealed that genetic covariance is critical to the association between HYPER and AD. This relationship holds true even when infl uences shared with CD (i.e., factor loadings from A1) and with other ADHD factors (i.e., factor loadings from A2 and A3) are accounted for. The association between FORGET and AD-which is negative and is due to environmental factors-is more tenuous than that between HYPER and AD, as evidenced by the nonsignifi cant chisquare test of the environmental covariance between the former (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2A</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2C</ref>). Therefore, we will focus our discussion on the apparently more robust, and genetically mediated, relationship between HYPER and AD.</p><p>Items loading onto the HYPER factor included, "How often did you have diffi culty staying seated?" "How often did you fi nd it hard to wait in line or wait your turn to do something?" and "How often did you interrupt or butt into the activities of others?" These items are designed to measure impulsivity; they are derived from the "hyperactivity-impulsivity" symptoms described in DSM-IV. Importantly, CD symptoms are largely related to harmful or destructive behavior and are not limited to impulsive behavior. Because HYPER shares genetic infl uences with AD beyond those accounted for by CD, we conclude that the genetic association between impulsivity and AD is not limited to infl uences specifi c to aggressive or delinquent behavior; rather, seemingly innocuous measures of impulsivity, such as those captured by HYPER, are uniquely predictive of genetic risk to AD.</p><p>Environmental correlations between AD and each measure of adolescent behavior were low, indicating that the phenotypic associations observed are primarily because of shared genetic liability. Another possible explanation for the observed phenotypic associations is that a causal relationship exists between adolescent problem behavior and later alcohol use problems. A path from genetic factors to ADHD and one from ADHD to AD is distinct from the current model, in which paths from the same genetic factors load onto both phenotypes. This could be the topic of future analyses, although it is typically diffi cult to determine whether a causal model or a shared liability model provides superior fi t when the sources of variance do not differ between traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Heath et al., 1993)</ref>.</p><p>The genetic correlation between adolescent externalizing problems and adult AD is consistent with prior evidence linking a variety of impulsive behaviors-both disruptive/ destructive and more "harmless"-with alcohol misuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dick et al., 2010b)</ref>. Our fi ndings are also broadly consistent with fi ndings from a prospective study of adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Elkins et al., 2007)</ref>, in which symptoms of the HYPER ADHD subtype were uniquely associated with alcohol initiation, even after controlling for the explanatory power of CD symptoms; symptoms of the inattentive subtype of ADHD did not uniquely predict initiation. However, important differences exist between that study and the current report: Elkins and colleagues did not incorporate a genetic component; there are potentially relevant differences in the ages at which the externalizing and alcohol-related phenotypes were assessed; and symptoms of the HYPER subtype did not uniquely predict age 18 alcohol abuse/ dependence (a slightly different phenotype than AD alone, used in the current report) in adjusted analyses. Furthermore, another recent phenotypic analysis of an adult sample found that the INATT ADHD subtype, but not the HYPER subtype, was signifi cantly associated with AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Friedrichs et al., 2010)</ref>. These inconsistencies could refl ect genuine population differences, changes in the relationships among phenotypes across the life span, or some other unknown factor; clearly, additional research is warranted.</p><p>We note that, despite the moderate genetic correlations among CD, ADHD factors, and AD, ~41% of the total genetic variance of AD is AD-specifi c. Without incorporating measures of adult ADHD or antisocial personality disorder, or measures of adolescent alcohol problems into the model, we cannot determine whether this large proportion of unique genetic variance is a function of genetic infl uences related to development (that is, adolescence vs. adulthood) or whether it is capturing infl uences that are truly specifi c to the alcohol phenotype, beyond factors shared with hyperactivity/ impulsivity. Examples of AD-specific genes would be those involved in alcohol metabolism, such as alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kuo et al., 2008)</ref>. A previous analysis, which included adult antisocial behavior but not adult ADHD in the model, suggests that AD-specifi c genetic variance is substantial <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kendler et al., 2003)</ref>. Future analyses should attempt to replicate this fi nding when developmentally informative data are available.</p><p>In summary, these findings indicate that, although adolescent ADHD is phenotypically associated with adult AD, much of the shared genetic liability between these two disorders is shared broadly across multiple measures of adolescent externalizing behavior. Only one phenotypic ADHD factor, hyperactivity, is signifi cantly genetically correlated with AD after factoring out infl uences shared with CD and the other ADHD factors. Somewhat unexpectedly, the environmental correlation between forgetfulness and AD approaches signifi cance (and is negative), although overall environmental covariances among CD, ADHD, and AD were quite low. These fi ndings are generally in agreement with research positing that externalizing behavior is the key commonality between adolescent behavior problems and adult alcohol problems. However, they also indicate that individual measures of adolescent externalizing share genetic infl uences with AD beyond those accounted for by this broad genetic factor. Specifi cally, the HYPER ADHD factor indexes risky impulsive behavior that is not captured by the harmful/destructive behaviors typical of CD; both of these manifestations of externalizing can be independently predictive of genetic risk of AD. Future molecular genetic studies seeking to identify genetic risk variants underlying ADHD and AD might benefi t from focusing on the hyperactive/impulsive subtype. Likewise, clinicians concerned with adolescent behaviors indicative of adult alcohol problems should be aware of potential differences in predictive value across ADHD subtypes and should note that externalizing behaviors beyond those encompassed by CD are potentially relevant to risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>These results should be considered in the context of several limitations. First, reports of childhood/adolescent behavior were retrospective and might have been subject to recall bias; this could account for the fact that our heritability estimates of ADHD factors were lower than previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Faraone et al., 2005)</ref>, most of which reported estimates greater than or equal to 0.6. However, our estimate is in agreement with others from retrospective reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Haberstick et al., 2008)</ref> and with an estimate of the heritability of adult ADHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boomsma et al., 2010)</ref>. In addition, assessments from other reporters (parents, teachers) could reduce error in the measure of adolescent behavior; such reports are unavailable for this sample.</p><p>Other studies have modeled, and found support for, genetic dominance (D) effects underlying ADHD. However, we did not incorporate these effects into our models, in part because the sample size is likely insuffi cient for robust detection and interpretation of those effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Martin et al., 1978)</ref>. In addition, their inclusion would lead to unnecessarily complicated models. Twin correlations did not suggest D loadings onto CD or AD. C and D cannot be modeled simultaneously on a given phenotype using only twin data, and we prioritized the inclusion of C effects based on prior evidence in this sample of C infl uences on CD. Further, interpretation of D effects would have been peripheral to our primary research question, namely shared genetic infl uences between ADHD factors and AD, which would likely be quite minimal given the absence of evidence for D effects on AD. However, we do note that twin correlations were consistent with modest D infl uences on ADHD, and such infl uences will be explored in future work.</p><p>Because the range of the sum-score phenotype is higher for HYPER (which ranged from 0 to 5) than for the other ADHD factors (which ranged from 0 to 3), the HYPER phenotype might be a more powerful variable than FORGET and INATT. It is possible that differential sensitivity in assessment exists across the ADHD factors, which could infl uence the phenotypic associations and other results presented here. In addition, data were available only for men, and results might not be generalizable to women; not only do the phenotypes of interest differ by sex, but there could be signifi cant qualitative differences in genetic and environmental infl uences on all phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Prescott et al., 1999)</ref>. Last, the population used for these analyses is Caucasian, and the results might not be applicable to other ethnicities.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1.
