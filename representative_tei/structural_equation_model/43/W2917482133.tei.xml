<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The purpose of this paper is to analyze the occurrence of terms to identify the relevant topics and then to investigate the area (based on topics) of hospitality services that is highly associated with relationship quality. This research represents an opportunity to fill the gap in the current literature, and clarify the understanding of guests' affective states by evaluating all aspects of their relationship with a hotel. Design/methodology/approach: This research focuses on natural opinions upon which machine-learning algorithms can be executed: text summarization, sentiment analysis and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Our data set contains 47,172 reviews of 33 hotels located in Las Vegas, and registered with Yelp. A component-based structural equation modeling (partial least squares (PLS)) is applied, with a dual -exploratory and predictive -purpose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings:</head><p>To maintain a truly loyal relationship and to achieve competitive success, hospitality managers must take into account both tangible and intangible features when allocating their marketing efforts to satisfaction-, trust-and commitment-based cues. On the other hand, the application of the PLS predict algorithm demonstrates the predictive performance (out-of-sample prediction) of our model that supports its ability to predict new and accurate values for individual cases when further samples are added.</p><p>Originality/value: LDA and PLS produce relevant informative summaries of corpora, and confirm and address more specifically the results of the previous literature concerning relationship quality. Our results are more reliable and accurate (providing insights not indicated in guests' ratings into how hotels can improve their services) than prior statistical results based on limited sample data and on numerical satisfaction ratings alone.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Purpose</head><p>In recent years the tourism industry has undergone an increasing number of transformation processes, caused by the development and acceptance of information technologies. Dynamic pricing, infomediation, online reservations and recommendation systems based on user-generated content (UGC) have all taken place in the tourism sector and, as a result, transformed the way in which individuals search for experiential travel services <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Raguseo et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Sparks et al., 2016)</ref>. UGC in particular is viewed as spontaneous, insightful and passionate feedback "provided by customers that is widely available, free or low cost, and easily accessible anywhere, anytime" <ref type="bibr">(Guo et al., 2016, p.468)</ref> and it allows customers to describe, relive, reconstruct, and share their experiences. Consequently, UCG provides an opportunity for indirect experiences and therefore, for developing (or terminating) long-term online relationships and genuine customer loyalty. Although customer reviews are poorly structured, being more or less focused on a single entity or aspect of hospitality, or are multi-lingual, they are a major source of information for academics and managers that can help to provide a full understanding of guests' preferences and demands, and what it is that predicts whether or not they will return to a hotel.</p><p>Due to the high costs typically involved with investments in the hospitality industry, it is sensible to study the service components that customers assess, describe and share in their reviews. While star-based ratings (numerical and easily understood, with a lower search cost, and viewed as an overall assessment of the customers' post-consumption experience) are so critical that an extra half-star allows restaurants to sell out 19% more frequently (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011)</ref>, individuals also analyze reviews by focusing not only on the summary star ratings but also on the content of customers' free-form text based on subjectively-experienced intangibles <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Serra-Cantallops and Salvi, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Our research analyzes a sample of 47,172 reviews of 33 urban hotels located in Las Vegas, United States of America and registered with Yelp, a review aggregator of travel-related content such as TripAdvisor and Trivago. Our research focuses on (a) pre-processing the dataset to understand the structure of the hotel review corpus; (b) identifying guest experience-related topics; (c) examining the underlying semantic structure and reducing the number of topics into meaningful groupings that makes them easier to interpret; and subsequently (d) providing an explicit representation of hotel reviews that could predict the development of long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with customers (relationship quality -RQ-cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Crosby et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dwyer et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hennig-Thurau and Klee, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lin and Ding, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sánchez-Franco et al., 2009, among others)</ref>. The present study extends previous research on community services by using a marketing framework -the RQ model-focusing on the true commitment phase (taken as the desire to maintain a relationship in the future that affectively benefits us) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fogg and Eckles, 2007)</ref>. The following questions are therefore relevant. What do guests say is important in the selection and evaluation of hospitality services? What are the underlying topics in hotel reviews? What form does the relationship between subjectively-experienced features and RQ assume? Can guests' experiences as represented in customer reviews be used subsequently to predict RQ? This research is structured as follows: after this introduction, the next section (Section 2) briefly reviews the literature on the hotel guest experience and RQ. The method section (Section 3) describes the data collection and processing approach that (1) transforms free-form text into a structured form (the data cleansing process and terms extraction) that is responsive to analysis and identifies the main terms for answering the research questions; (2) identifies which features (topic communities) of a guest's stay are addressed in the review; and (3) explores the relationships between them and the extracted RQ-dimensions, to determine the predictive power of the model: ▪ Term selection aims to identify the most relevant terms, using term-frequency inverse document frequency scores (tf-idf approach; cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blei and Lafferty 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Grün and Hornik, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Salton and McGill, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>▪ Our research focuses on topic modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA; cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Blei et al., 2003)</ref> and detecting community structures (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Newman, 2006)</ref>. While counting the tf-idf values is useful in knowledge extraction, examining the distribution (and association) of the topics in the documents in relation to other topics and identifying community structures (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Newman, 2006)</ref> are more powerful approaches for understanding the context of the opinions of hospitality.</p><p>Topic modeling aims to select a small subset of features (topics) that minimizes the features' redundancy and maximizes their relevance; the inclusion of redundant, irrelevant and noisy features in the model building process would cause poor predictive performance and an increased computation. Another way to conceptualize extracted topics is to categorize them by communities based on the higher semantic organization of the topics, which leads to a greater understanding.</p><p>▪ A third goal is to explore the magnitude of the effects of the relevant community structures on RQ in the context of hospitality services, and to assess the predictive capability of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Henseler, 2018)</ref>. In particular, our research proposes RQ as a multidimensional construct encompassing satisfaction, affective trust and affective commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(De Wulf et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dorsch et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Rauyruen and Miller, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sánchez-Franco et al., 2009, among others)</ref>; and measures them through rating scores and sentiment analysis -based on people's evaluative judgments and affective responses to stimuli in the texts (cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ghasemaghaei et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Heise, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Pang and Lee, 2008)</ref>. In order to achieve both the exploratory and predictive purposes of our research, this study uses Partial Least Squares (PLS; cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cepeda-Carrión et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Henseler, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Rigdon, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Ringle et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Sarstedt et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Roldán and Sánchez-Franco, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Section 4 discusses the predictive results in depth. Finally, sections 5 and 6 set out the contributions of this investigation to the literature and practice and examine its limitations.</p><p>An overview of the research approach is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>. *Please insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref> here *</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical framework</head><p>Customers increasingly visit message boards, forums, or virtual communities rather than advertisements, which reflect biased realities; generate a significant amount of free online content on subjectively-experienced intangible goods or experiences; and use online review environments as key sources of information -rich in UGC. Consequently, they reduce the potential risks associated with purchase <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Sparks et al., 2016)</ref>. Reviews therefore play a crucial role in building hotels' online reputation by leveraging the electronic word of mouth content (eWOM; cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chong et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hennig-Thurau et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Jalilvand and Samiei, 2012)</ref> and by attracting/retaining guests in a very efficient way (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gretzel and Yoo, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Park et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Ye et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Our research therefore proposes a product feature-oriented approach to explore the usefulness of applying features of the guest experience (e.g., location, service quality, amenities and complementary services, sleep quality and value, cleanliness aspects or staff appearance and hotel ambiance) to predict how well the whole relationship meets guests' expectations, predictions, goals, and desires. RQ is defined here as the extent to which a hospitality relationship is able to fulfill the needs of guests (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Crosby et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hennig-Thurau and Klee 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Palmatier et al., 2006, among others)</ref>. It is also conceptualized as a multidimensional construct that includes several related facets: satisfaction, affective trust and affective commitment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Sparks and Browning, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Verma et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Firstly, satisfaction is defined as the guests' perception of the extent to which their needs, goals and desires have been fully met (cf. Oliver 1999; also <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Yoon and Uysal, 2005</ref> for a detailed review). Satisfaction -related to the service provider's performance-becomes one of the key measures of a hotel's effectiveness in outperforming others; that is, more satisfied guests have higher quality relationships with hospitality providers (cf. also <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dorsch et al., 1998)</ref>. Secondly, improving the interactive features and service-related information available on online services does not necessarily guarantee customer loyalty. In this regard, although customer reviews offer star-based ratings (an overall satisfaction measure, ranging from 1, negative, to 5, positive), star ratings do not provide extended information on customer loyalty. Indeed, RQ, as a higher-order construct, is replacing customer satisfaction as a source of superior performance. Accordingly, our study proposes an evaluation of the additional effect of affective trust -related to the service provider-and focuses on integrity and benevolence; in other words, trust is based on favorable expectations regarding the intentions and behaviors of another party <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Singh and Sirdeshmukh 2000</ref>; for a detailed review, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Shankar et al. 2003)</ref>. Affective trust therefore indicates that the parties in the relationship have developed an emotional bond and develop quality relationships based on the process of making promises <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dwyer et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gronroos, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Hewett and Bearden, 2001)</ref>. Thirdly, although recent studies focus on the mechanisms through which UGC generates user satisfaction or trust (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Sánchez-Franco et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Sparks and Browning, 2011)</ref>, our research also assesses the psychological sentiments through which an attitude based on the continuation of a relationship is formed <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Wetzels et al., 1998)</ref>. Cumulative affective commitment to the relationship with the hospitality firm is thus defined as the psychological tendency to get close to others (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Shankar et al., 2003)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data collection</head><p>Our dataset contains 47,172 reviews of 33 urban hotels, spanning the period between March 2005 and January 2017 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>, yearly evolution, and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>, seasonalityeffect), contained in the 9 th Yelp Dataset Challenge. Yelp is considered to be a social networking site, belonging to the realm of social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ariyasriwatana et al., 2014)</ref>. It is the leading rating and review site for businesses in the United States of America and currently enjoys a reputation as one of the most successful websites dedicated to travel, having grown in popularity since its inception. By the end of Q3 2017, yelpers had written more than 142 million reviews.</p><p>The Yelp dataset initially included all types of businesses, such as restaurants, hotels, dentists, hair stylists or mechanics. The data was grouped into five main single-object types: business, review, user, check-in and tip, of which only the first three contain information about reviews and social attributes. By filtering business records whose category contains "Hotels", reviews were identified by states and cities. As the Yelp dataset is imbalanced with regard to location, the city of Las Vegas (Nevada) was selected as a case study because of its competitive advantage in entertainment driven by tourism and gambling pleasure <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Douglass and Raiento, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Rowley, 2015)</ref>. Las Vegas is the third largest city in the United States in terms of tourism spending and GDP contribution, and each year attracts around 40 million tourists <ref type="bibr">(World Travel and Tourism Council, 2017)</ref>, which is reflected in the high number of Yelp reviews. Moreover, Las Vegas brands itself as being able to generate controversial feelings that can affect tourists' perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Griskevicius et al., 2009)</ref>. *Please insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> here* *Please insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> here*</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Data cleansing process</head><p>To avoid bias, and to keep the language variable consistent across texts, our research firstly applied the textcat package based on the R 3.4.1 statistical tool to recognize English in the reviews (cf. also <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hornik et al., 2013)</ref>. This returned 41,413 reviews and 33 hotels with more than 590 reviews per hotel and fewer than 1,940 -corresponding to the second and third quartiles. Our research also evaluated the readability of reviews using the reliable Flesch-Kincaid score (here 5.7), among others, to gauge the understandability of the reviews.</p><p>Our dataset transformed and converted the data into an acceptable format; from freeform text into a structured form that is suitable for analysis (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Krippendorff, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Raychaudhuri et al., 2002)</ref>. Our research discarded punctuation, capitalization, digits and extra whitespace; it tokenized and depluralized the terms; removed selected common stop words (e.g., determiners, articles, conjunctions and other parts of speech) to filter out overly common terms, which carry no useful information; and eliminated non-English characters. Furthermore, our research cleansed the corpus by omitting terms below a pre-set minimum length (&lt; 3 characters) and reduced terms to their stem/root form using the Porter Stemming Algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Terms extraction</head><p>Our dataset comprises independent documents consisting of non-structured review texts, associated with a specific business id and user id, and in particular, contains noise and uninformative content. Term selection aims to identify the most relevant explanatory input terms to improve the performance of text analytics and to increase the comprehensibility of the results. Our research selected a dictionary whose tf-idf values are higher than the median (with the addition of the terms bed and staff, to adequately contextualize the extracted topics). A tf-idf value therefore (a) assigns a low score to terms that are either very rare or very frequent, (b) proportionally increases the number of times a term appears in the document and which is therefore (c) offset by the frequency of the term in the corpus to balance out its general popularity, providing a total vocabulary of 424 terms and 41,413 documents.</p><p>Accordingly, our research does not process texts directly, but calculates the relationships between terms and documents through a text-mining algorithm to discover hidden semantic structures in the corpus (cf. <ref type="bibr">Blei et al., 2003, among others)</ref>. It builds a so-called document-term matrix (DTM) extracted from pre-processed reviews. DTM is a "bag of words" representation of text, and is defined as "a structured table of numbers that can in principle be analyzed using standard techniques" <ref type="bibr">(Han et al., 2016, p.6)</ref>. The tm package was selected for its text-mining procedures <ref type="bibr">(Feinerer and Hornik, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>, a summary graph based on a term-term adjacency matrix created by calculating the linear relationships between terms, shows a network structure of relatedness terms based on frequency correlations higher than 0.1. In this graphical context, our results concur with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Sparks and Browning (2011)</ref>. The majority of hotel reviews concern either the core functions of the hotel (e.g., clean/dirty rooms or small bathrooms) or customer service (e.g., interactions with staff based on how respectfully they were treated). *Please insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref> here *</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Data mining: Features and RQ extraction</head><p>Data mining is defined as a sophisticated data search capability that uses statistical algorithms to discover patterns and relationships in data (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Rygielski et al., 2002)</ref>. While "the tf-idf reduction has some appealing features -notably in its basic identification of sets of terms that are discriminative for documents in the collection-the approach brings a relatively small reduction in description length and reveals little in the way of inter-or intra-document statistical structure" <ref type="bibr">(Blei et al., 2003, p.994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blei, 2012)</ref>. The extraction and selection of distinct topics and their semantic communities are therefore essential.</p><p>Likewise, star ratings and sentiment analysis (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Das and Chen, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Tong, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Nasukawa and Yi, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Pang et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Turney, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Yi et al., 2003)</ref> become key tools for summarizing satisfaction, affective trust and affective commitment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1.">Extracting topics</head><p>Topic models provide an algorithmic solution to managing, organizing and annotating large unstructured text data relating to hotel reviews that identify latent patterns of term occurrence from their distribution in the corpus. Topic models are highly flexible and widely used tools that semantically identify related documents through the topics they address and are therefore essential for summarizing documents and corpora <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Blei, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Our research applies the probabilistic topic model of LDA (cf. <ref type="bibr">Blei et al., 2003, among others)</ref>, an unsupervised (and efficient) generative probabilistic method. The topicmodel package was selected for topic modeling with the LDA (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Grün and Hornik, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>By applying LDA, all reviews share the same topic set, but each review exhibits a different probabilistic mixture of those topics. LDA, like other topic modeling algorithms, is based on two outputs: a matrix of term-probabilities, which indicates for each term the probability of its belonging to each topic -the P(term|topic); and a document composition matrix, which is a probability mass distribution of topic proportions within the document P(topic|review). <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Griffiths and Steyvers (2004)</ref> suggest an α value of 50/K as the parameter of the prior distributions for the topic distribution of documents, and 0.1 as the δ value for the parameter of the prior distribution of the term across topics, using the Gibbs sampling algorithm (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Steyvers and Griffiths, 2006)</ref>. K is the number of selected topics.</p><p>Our research also proposes a λ relevance-value based on logarithmized parameters of the term distribution for each topic. λ relevance-values determine the specificity of the term within the topic, where  belongs to (0, 1) (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Sievert and Shirley, 2014)</ref>. λ = 0 ranks the terms according to their probability in the entire document collection. λ = 1 ranks the words according to their topic-specific probabilities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Sievert and Shirley (2014)</ref> suggest a λ value of 3/5 as an optimal value for identifying the topics associated with the top terms that are more likely to appear within that topic than in the other documents. For brevity, our research omits an additional detailed explanation, and recommends previously cited research that describes the standard process.</p><p>By analyzing the variation of statistical perplexity during topic modeling -comparable to goodness-of-fit measures for statistical models-a heuristic approach is proposed to estimate the most appropriate number of topics K, based on an n-fold cross-validation.</p><p>In order to determine the ideal number of topics, our research first applied the Rate of Perplexity Change (RPC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Zhao et al., 2015)</ref>, and then trained and tested the algorithm using 10-fold cross-validation (on perplexity) at different values of K (from 5 to 150 topics). <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Zhao et al. (2015)</ref> conclude that the approach is stable and accurate. Lower values In particular denote more predictive power -i. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2.">Extracting topic communities</head><p>Once the term distributions for each topic had been identified, our study employed network analysis to research the bonds between topics, based on the term distribution for each one. Network analysis provides an accurate set of methods and tools to produce structures (and sub-structures), showing how topics are organized and providing a deeper understanding of a system. Nodes (topics) might be related to higher constructs yet have no causal relation with them (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Guyon et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Marsman et al., 2017)</ref>. Community detection was therefore employed to examine the underlying semantic structure and further reduce the number of topics into meaningful groupings, making them easier to interpret.</p><p>In particular, our research proposes the identification of communities of topics with similar connectivity patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fortunato, 2010)</ref> by maximizing the modularity measure over all possible partitions (cf. also <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brandes et al., 2008)</ref>. Modularity is one of the most important measures of a partition's quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Radicchi et al., 2004)</ref>, being (1) the standard objective function used in network cluster analysis, and (2) the fraction of within-community edges minus the expected value of the same quantity for a randomized network <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Newman and Girvan, 2004)</ref>. Modularity is thus a fit-measure of the internal density of clusters compared to the external density of a network. Modularity values usually range from about 0.3 to 0.7: empirically, a value above 0.3 is a good indicator of the significant community structure in a network <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Clauset et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The igraph package was selected for community-detection based on network analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Grün and Hornik, 2011)</ref>. By maximizing the modularity measure over all possible partitions, its value here is equal to 0.653, based on a gini correlation-index above 0.20, and pvalues &lt; 0.001. As can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7</ref>, the proposed network contains 53 nodes out of the final 80 topics, and nine communities. The largest community comprises less than 20% of the vertices.</p><p>Each community is named according to the semantic space represented by the topics in the specific community. The first community, with five topics, is hybrid, and represents distinct groups of topics that describe different hotel guest experiences. The second community identifies the impact of the appraisal of hotel ambiance, based on ambient conditions in the hospitality environment (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Jani and Han, 2014)</ref>. The third community refers to food/beverage services. The fourth community is amenities, relating to topics such as the microwave oven, TV, gym, spa, and other features provided by the hotel.</p><p>The fifth community is associated with staff and service quality, "reflecting the level of staff performance, and personalization, and the interactions between staff and guests, that is, the empathy of the staff" <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Sánchez-Franco et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, p. 1177)</ref>. The sixth community, family friendliness, suggests that when guests share their story about staying at a hotel with their family members, "their experience is likely to be linked with the need for a large room or attractions they want to visit" <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Xiang et al., 2015)</ref>. Here guests employ terms associated with an overall experience based on positive descriptions. The seventh community is night-life, and contains topics associated with spectacles provided by the city of Las Vegas. The eighth community, containing six topics, is named hybrid, representing a wide variety of different experiences. The ninth community, with three topics, represents the experiential aspects of the hotel stay relating to core product (e.g., dirty, clean or wet). *Please insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7</ref> here*</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Extracting RQ-dimensions</head><p>Our research uses hotel ratings for the customers' assessment of/sentiments regarding the hospitality provider's overall performance in their encounters (satisfaction), and It also proposes a sentiment analysis to detect, extract and classify opinions, based on (1) approximations of a user's psychological state, demonstrating affective trust (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Geyskens et al., 1996)</ref>; and (2) affective and emotional attachments to the service, i.e., affective commitment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allen and Meyer, 1990)</ref>. Our proposal refers to a dictionary of opinion terms classified into categories, each expressing a specific sentiment. As <ref type="bibr">Han et al. (2016, p.6)</ref> recommend, "these [dictionaries] are created to summarize the opinions within online customer reviews and to perform tonal analysis of social media blogs". The syuzhet package <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Jockers, 2017)</ref> was chosen for the opinion-mining procedures and our research refers to two dictionaries in particular: ▪ The National Research Council Canada (NRC) sentiment dictionary (developed by <ref type="bibr">Mohammad and</ref><ref type="bibr">Turney, 2010, 2013)</ref> estimates the presence of eight different emotions (trust -faith and integrity-among others; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) and their corresponding valences.</p><p>▪ AFINN: this lexical-based approach using a metric developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Nielsen (2011)</ref> in the microblogging space, estimates that the sentiments relating to the guest's expected outcomes are a result of them enacting the behavior. AFINN contains a list of 2,477 English word forms rated for semantic orientation, ranging from -5 (negative) to 5 (positive).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the descriptive statistics for the RQ dimensions. The average review star rating is 3.21 (sd = 1.41), with an average text length of 178 terms. The rating distributions are slightly skewed towards the 4-and 5-star ratings (see Table1). Although the majority of reviews give high scores -over 20,795 4-and 5-star reviews were submitted, compared to fewer than 13,269 1-and 2-star reviews-the proportion of 1-and 2-star reviews has been increasing over time (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">8</ref>). The average affective trust rating (based on NRC scores) is 3.92 (sd = 3.26). The median sentiment (trust) is 3.00 with a minimum of 0.00 and a maximum of 28. There is no linear relationship between the mean of trust scores by date (adjusted R-squared = 0.03; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">9</ref>). The AFINN sentiment average is 7.82 (sd= 9.80). The median sentiment (AFINN) is 7.00 with a minimum of -45 and a maximum of 80.</p><p>The distribution of sentiments is skewed towards the positive end. The average sentiment by date has decreased (linearly) slightly over time (adjusted R-squared = 0.147; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">9</ref>). Apparently, contrary to <ref type="bibr">Raguseo's et al.'s (2017)</ref> conclusions, hotels have not been learning how to effectively manage online visibility through social network sites, or to improve their hospitality services, despite the increased market transparency provided by the UGC-aggregator of tourism-related content. *Please insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1 here</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.1.">Data analysis</head><p>To aid interpretation, our research uses the logarithm of topic distributions to correct a skewed distribution, and has logarithmized all topic-based variables, except for RQ scores. To analyze the relationships between constructs and their respective indicators, a composite approach was adopted. All constructs represent a mixture of aspects, combined to form new objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Nitzl and Chin, 2017)</ref>. This composite approach is appropriate since our research uses archival data, which usually lacks comprehensive substantiation in measurement theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Sarstedt et al., 2017)</ref>. Latent variables were modeled as composites -formed as linear combinations of their respective indicators <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2017a)</ref>. SmartPLS 3.2.7. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Ringle et al., 2015)</ref> Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used, a component-based structural equation modeling technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Rigdon, 2013)</ref>. The choice of PLS-SEM is appropriate as the main objectives of this study are exploration and prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hair et al., 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Henseler, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Khan et al., 2018)</ref>. All constructs follow a composite measurement model <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Sarstedt et al., 2016)</ref>, and with regard to distribution data <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gefen et al., 2011)</ref>, our dataset does not meet the special requirements for covariance-based SEM (CBSEM) analysis.</p><p>PLS-SEM analysis is divided into three stages. The first requires the evaluation of the measurement model (the outer model), and assesses the relationships between observable variables and composite constructs. The exogenous and endogenous composites are estimated in Mode B (regression weights) <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Rigdon, 2016)</ref>. Given that composite 2 (hotel ambiance) consists of positive and negative topics, and assuming that, in the semantic space that represents the hospitality experience, these two topic groups belong to two different sub-contexts, our research divides composite 2 into two sub-composites (hotel ambiance 2a -positive valence; and 2b -negative valence) to improve the interpretation of results.</p><p>Our research also evaluates the structural model (inner model) to assess the sign, magnitude, and relevance of the relationships between composites <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Roldán and Sánchez-Franco, 2012)</ref>. The path coefficients are the most important result of the structural model. Bootstrap percentile confidence intervals of the path coefficients help to assess the relevance of the estimated parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chin, 1998)</ref>. Finally, in the third stage, our research assesses the predictive performance of our PLS-SEM model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cepeda-Carrión et al., 2016)</ref> using holdout samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Shmueli et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.2">Preliminary analysis</head><p>Although our network analysis identifies nine composites (communities), a preliminary (exploratory) PLS analysis concluded that only four of these reached effect size f 2 values higher than the recommend base value of 0.02 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cohen, 1988)</ref>. These four composites were therefore retained for the final analysis since they affect the RQ variable above the minimum level. Our final exploratory and predictive model consists of four composites linked to RQ. It should be noted that the available data was used to develop, modify, and test the model, which is the essence of the exploratory feature of PLS. Consequently, the model itself could to some extent be considered as a random variable, and both the parameter estimates and their confidence intervals should be interpreted with caution since they are the result of an exploration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.3.">Outer model assessment</head><p>Our research evaluates the nomological (external) validity of the composites through a confirmatory composite analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Henseler et al., 2014)</ref>. The standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) index for the saturated model was estimated <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Henseler et al., 2016)</ref>, achieving a SRMR value of 0.0267, which is well below the usual threshold of 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hu and Bentler, 1999)</ref>. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Henseler (2017)</ref>, this means that the composites of our model would behave within a nomological net rather than as isolated manifest variables.</p><p>A critical issue for composites estimated in Mode B is the potential multicollinearity of their manifest variables. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values for the range of those items are below 2.058 (see Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) and individual items of the composites exhibit no issues of multicollinearity. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chin (2010)</ref>, our research reports the loadings, weights and the significance of the weights of individual items for each composite in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. *Please insert Table <ref type="table">2 here*</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.4.">Inner model assessment</head><p>The final exploratory model explains the 38.3% variance (R 2 ) in RQ, and suggests an appropriate predictive power (in-sample prediction) for the dependent variable, since it is above the moderate effect value (0.33) indicated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chin (1998)</ref>. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> includes the percentage variance in the dependent variable explained by each independent variable. See also Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10</ref>.</p><p>As <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Henseler et al. (2009)</ref> comment, the use of bootstrapping (5,000 resamples) generates t-statistics and confidence intervals for the standardized regression coefficients, which allows the relevance of each direct effect to be identified. In this regard, all path coefficients in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> appear to be relevant for explaining the RQ variable. The four direct effects also return f 2 values above the low effect value (0.02) indicated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chin (1998)</ref>. We would highlight the key role of composite 5 (relating to staff appearance), which explains 23.19% of the variance of RQ. *Please insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10</ref> here* *Please insert Table <ref type="table">3 here*</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.5.">Predictive performance of the model using holdout samples</head><p>Our research assesses the predictive power of our model (out-of-sample prediction) using the PLS predict algorithm developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Shmueli et al. (2016)</ref>, included in SmartPLS software version 3.2.7, and conducts a cross-validation process using holdout samples. This evaluation indicates whether our model is able to generate accurate predictions of new interpretable observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Shmueli and Koppius, 2011)</ref>. Our research applies a benchmark developed by the SmartPLS team (SmartPLS, 2017), particularly the Q 2 value. This index compares the prediction errors of the PLS path model against simple mean predictions. A positive Q 2 means the prediction error of the PLS-SEM results is smaller than the prediction error simply using the mean values. In our case, the model shows a satisfactory predictive performance both for the endogenous composite (RQ) and for its manifest variables. See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4</ref>. *Please insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4</ref> here* Finally, our research also assesses the predictive validity of our model, focusing on the overfitting issue i.e., is the model fit geared too much towards training data or will it perform comparably with new data. To answer this question, we followed the guidelines suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Danks et al. (2017)</ref>, which were applied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Felipe et al. (2017)</ref>. Thus, insample versus out-of-sample predictions were compared to actual composite scores.</p><p>The composite RQ resulting from this approach returned the following metrics: in-sample root mean squared error (RMSE) (IS) = 0.833151, and out-of-sample RMSE (OOS) = 0.833023. RMSE can be interpreted as a standard deviation since component scores are normalized (mean 0 and variance 1). The difference between in-sample and out-ofsample RMSE is 0.000128, which is practically zero. Given that the difference in RMSE is not substantial, overfitting is not a problem for this study. The density plots of the in-sample and out-of-sample residuals are set out in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">11</ref>, showing an extreme overlap. *Please insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">11</ref> here* In conclusion, both prediction analyses show that our model has sufficient predictive power (out-of-sample prediction) to predict values for a new dataset. The four composites therefore appear to predict RQ in additional samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion and conclusions</head><p>Hotel firms offer essentially homogeneous services, and try to serve guests' interests by standing out from their competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Xiang et al., 2015)</ref>. Guest reviews or comments expressed in natural language allow customers to describe their (latent) opinions and experiences of hospitality services. This study is therefore not restricted to quantitative variables and consequently identifies performance issues that are subtle yet difficult to diagnose, and which may damage the hotel's reputation if left unaddressed.</p><p>The objective of our research is to extract the latent dimensions from 41,413 online guest reviews with the aims of (1) offering new insights into the determinants of a guest's affective state by evaluating all aspects of their relationship with an urban hotel; ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) understanding what makes guests return to a hotel or not, which is key to its success and long-term competitiveness; and (3) incorporating managerial results into the customer decision-making process. Urban tourism is one of the most popular forms of tourism but it has received "a disproportionately small amount of attention from scholars of either tourism or of the city" <ref type="bibr">(Ashworth and Page, 2011, p.1)</ref>.</p><p>The topics (and their communities) explored here and their predictive contributions to RQ are identified by applying topic-modeling algorithms, network analysis and PLS-SEM. The application of text analytics provides a summarized structure of UGC, by grouping comments into topic communities. Topic modeling is indeed an important field for summarizing and understanding ever-expanding online information archives, and contributes to tourism research. Furthermore, by using techniques for NLP and LDA as an unsupervised learning model, our analysis confirms and addresses more specifically the results of the previous literature concerning hotel features. Its results should be even more reliable and accurate than prior statistical results based solely on guests' scores (customer satisfaction) and insights obtained from traditional satisfaction surveys based on small data samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Theoretical implications</head><p>Our research (based on a larger, unstructured, and complex dataset) enables hotels to allocate resources according to the areas that matter to guests and in particular (1) to identify the guests' specific perceptions; (2) to identify topic communities around which guests evaluate hospitality; and (3) to explore and assess their (predictive) influence on the strength of a relationship in order to meet their guests' needs.</p><p>One of the primary proposals of this research is to seek a deeper understanding of how to construct a satisfaction-trust-commitment model in the hospitality industry by (1) exploring the semantic space that represents the hospitality experience reported by guests, (2) applying sentiment analysis techniques, and (3) applying PLS-SEM. On the one hand, the application of techniques such as LDA, sentiment extraction and network analysis are a growing area of academic research and have not yet been systematically studied. On the other hand, although textual reviews have been widely studied in the literature, there has been very little research into knowledge extraction based on this type of comment and their influence on non-economic satisfaction, customer sentiments related to affective commitment and affective trust.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Managerial implications</head><p>If a hotel company is to maintain a truly-loyal relationship with its guests, managers must take into account both types of features of their hotel -the tangible and intangible cueswhen allocating their marketing efforts. Hotels that provide the most appropriate combination of intangible and tangible features are most likely to achieve competitive advantage.</p><p>Firstly, there is a negative connotation when guests refer to their hospitality experiences relating to composites 5, 6 and 9. The attributes or benefits based on staff experiencecomposite 5 (intangible cues based on the non-physical nature of services, such as interactions with friendly employees)-and professionalism are essential features in the evaluation of hotel quality, i.e., the highest standardized coefficient path (in absolute terms) and consequently the most influential composite associated with RQ. Likewise, core tangible and experiential topics -composite 9 (based on the room's poor layout or maintenance)-become essential drivers -the second most influential standardized coefficient path. Moreover, the family-friendliness construct (composite 6, related to the need for a special room or attractions they want to visit, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Xiang et al., 2015)</ref> has the third most influential standardized coefficient path. Events in Las Vegas, such as festivals, concerts, trade shows, conventions, and sporting events are also key marketing features in the promotion of Las Vegas hotels (and their hospitality experience), given their increasingly global ability to attract visitor spending. Tourist attractions on the Las Vegas Strip should complement their gaming offerings with activities for families that are easily accessible from the street. eWOM makes it possible for consumers to post negative comments online, "thereby making their complaints public, and shifting the intended audience to include both the business as well as other consumers" <ref type="bibr">(Zhang and Vásquez, 2014, p.63)</ref>. Guests' negative opinions of poor hospitality service are capable of suppressing their favorable sentiments towards good service <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Han et al., 2016)</ref>. Our research finds that topics with stronger negative connotations are associated with lower RQ, and those with more positive connotations have higher RQ. Conversely, negative opinions have a greater influence on RQ than positive opinions. The signs of the coefficients are quite revealing. Guests may tend to write more about staff appearance (e.g., poor behavior, negative attitude, lack of knowledge or skills) and core products such as furnishings when they are dissatisfied or do not trust hotel services, and may write more about the hotel ambiance and experience when they are more satisfied or have a greater trust in the hotel services.</p><p>Similarly, the negative value for the family-friendliness composite based on 'travel party' suggests that this key decision cue, represented by experience-related topics, has a negative connotation for RQ. If guests' have negative perceptions of casino gambling, sightseeing, dining, and nightlife entertainment, this creates dissatisfied guests, triggering negative hotel eWOM, and reducing the likelihood of their booking the same hotel again. To summarize, negative reviews are harmful to companies (Bambauer-Sachse and Mangold, 2011), and in fact have a greater weight in the decision-making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Herr et al., 1991)</ref>. Negative reviews here are stronger, more influential, and are more difficult to resist than positive reviews.</p><p>Thirdly, composite 2a is positively related to (hotel) ambiance as a part of the sensory servicescape, associated with light, sound, smell, décor, and air quality, etc. Composite 2a could be defined as 'experience', i.e., the guests' overall experience that includes positive descriptive terms, such as great, excellent, and recommend. Hotel ambiance (composite 2a) influences interactions with the exchange partner -which create fulfilling, gratifying, and easy interactions-and increases guests' desire to stay (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Simpeh et al., 2011)</ref>. This in turn generates positive reviews about the service <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Jani and Han, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Other features of the hotel that are reported as essential include the following (ordered from the highest to lowest influence on RQ): ▪ Composite 5: Relational (operational) aspects based on staff and service quality, reflecting the level of staff performance; personalization; and demonstrating the interactions between staff and guests, i.e., staff empathy (friendliness, respectful behavior and treatment, or understanding the customer). While some cues such as staff, core product, festivals, concerts or trade shows, are essential for the guests' experience, others do not have a significant impact on the semantic space related to their experience. Although location is highly relevant when choosing a hotel (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Radojevic et al., 2015)</ref>, our research reveals only a minimal (explicit) influence of hotel location on RQ (cf. also <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Sánchez-Franco et al., 2016)</ref>. One possible explanation is that guests may have already considered the hotel's location when booking a room and it is not therefore explicitly elicited when evaluating their hospitality experience. Moreover, price is no longer an essential antecedent here when guests select a hotel. In summary, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Smith et al. (1999)</ref> note, service failures are perceived as losses and receive a more negative weighting from customers. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Clemons and Gao (2008)</ref> suggest, this is because guests are seeking reasonable rather than optimal levels of satisfaction and the negative comments suggest that the quality threshold will not be met. This is a perceptual bias in which negative content concerning attractions at the destination carries more weight and has a greater effect on an impression than other positive evaluations. Negative comments related to room style and negative staff treatment also have an important (highest) (predictive) impact (based on f 2 ; cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cohen, 1988)</ref>. As Xiang et al. <ref type="bibr">(2015, p.122</ref>) note, "hygiene factors like cleanliness and maintenance do not positively contribute to satisfaction, although dissatisfaction results from their absence". <ref type="bibr">Han et al. (2016, p.16</ref>) note that it could be better for hotels "to provide guests with a moderately good overall experience (…), because in terms of ratings the weight of the terrible service will swamp the good feelings from the stay's excellent aspects".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Limitations</head><p>Firstly, our research does not analyze the infrequent terms in the long tail of the distribution (cf., tf-idf). A second limitation lies in the self-selection bias when guests post their reviews.</p><p>For instance, "disappointed guests may have a stronger impulse to publicly share their impressions than satisfied customers" <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Sánchez-Franco et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, p.1183)</ref>. As our research notes in Section 3.3.3, the proportion of reviews with 1-and 2-star reviews has been increasing over time. Thirdly, a topic-network structure may also change over time.</p><p>In particular, latent topics represent a dynamic that potentially shifts across themes, and reviews are not written independently of each other (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Piramuthu et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dellarocas 2006</ref>). Fourthly, our research is focused on reviews of urban hotels in Las Vegas and may reflect certain biases of guests who visit Las Vegas. For instance, the relative importance of hotel features may be influenced by the location-based environment.</p><p>Moreover, average star scores may be affected by a culture-conditioned response style <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dolnicar and Grün, 2007)</ref>.
