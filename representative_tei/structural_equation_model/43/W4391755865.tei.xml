<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study was an endeavor to discover the roles of self-regulated learning (SRL), and perfectionism in predicting foreign language learners' listening anxiety. In so doing, 350 EFL learners were selected by cluster random sampling to complete the three reliable and valid questionnaires of the study. (i.e., SRL, perfectionism, &amp; listening anxiety). To analyze the SEM model and answer the questions, after data collection, a SEM approach was utilized. Based on the ndings, a signi cant linear relationship was found among variables and their components. The results also indicated that although SRL and perfectionism had a signi cant effect on listening anxiety, perfectionism was a stronger predictor of listening anxiety. In terms of predictive power, SRL was in the next rank.</p><p>To put it more clearly, students with higher levels of perfectionism experienced higher listening anxiety. Furthermore, those students with higher levels of selfregulation experienced lower levels of listening anxiety, and those with low levels of self-regulation experienced higher levels of listening anxiety. The ndings of this study may be bene cial for materials developers and EFL teachers. They should pay more attention to the affective and cognitive variables of English learners because they are known to be important factors in in uencing listening anxiety.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Second language (L2) listening seems to be a determinant skill in learning which provides easy access to foreign language input for students. It also provides the opportunity for verbal exchange with second language speakers in real life <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chen &amp; Ren, 2021)</ref>. Various studies con rmed that listening is in uenced by different psychological factors namely SRL, and perfectionism (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pishghadam &amp; Akhondpoor, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Wu et al., 2022)</ref>. Evidence showed that in the process of interaction with others, EFL learners may experience different types of anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Simsek &amp; Capar, 2024)</ref>. Listening anxiety as one of them, needs more attention and may feel when a non-pro cient user of language needs to communicate by L2 in different contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ji et al., 2022)</ref>. Fear of failure in comprehension of oral input or speech, unfamiliarity with the speci ed tasks by the teacher in the classroom, and unintelligibility of oral input are among those important factors that can cause listening anxiety in L2 communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Liu &amp;Xu, 2021)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rahimi and Fathi (2022)</ref> asserts that individual differences have mutual effects on each other, and different people may show different reactions in the process of language learning. Thus, learners with different characteristics may show different levels of anxiety. Researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rahimi &amp; Fathi, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Zhang et al., 2023)</ref> mentioned that in the L2 learning process, individual differences can be a very good predictor of learners' failure or success. Thus, individual differences such as learners' perfectionism, the situation in which a person de nes perfect performance with a high standard for themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Frost et al., 1990)</ref>, and SRL, students are enthusiastic in their process of learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Zimmerman, 1989)</ref> seem to be very important factors and can predict learners' success. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zheng et al. (2023)</ref> also emphasized on the predictive nature of individual differences in language learners' performance.</p><p>In the EFL context namely in Iran, learners have less willingness to participate in oral activities due to low listening pro ciency. It seems that in terms of level of pro ciency, all skills have not developed equally. Listening pro ciency as a building block of communication plays a signi cant role to understand the meaning and messages in any conversation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Wang &amp; Cha, 2019</ref>). Thus, it must be the focus of the researchers in the EFL context. Evidence from the literature (e.g., Chen &amp; Ren, 2021; Wang &amp; Cha, 2019) revealed that learners with low or high levels of listening pro ciency may experience different levels of listening anxiety in different situations which can be due to the variety of their psychological factors and lack of knowledge. Perfectionism as an effective factor can cause anxiety when students trying to improve their both listening and speaking pro ciency. Learners who have higher levels of perfectionism want to achieve better achievement which leads to anxiety. Self-regulation as another important psychological factor seems to be effective in the process of learning. Therefore, searching their predictive nature as the source of anxiety is valuable to help those persons namely researchers, teachers, and educators, who are responsible for learning of EFL pupils to manage their students' listening anxiety. In fact, nding a way to predict learners listing anxiety can be a promising tool to overcome this problem (i.e., fear of listening in the process of communication).</p><p>Evidence from different research proved the effective nature of self-regulation on anxiety which was con rmed by some theoretical works (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Morosanova &amp; Fomina, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Saaidin et al., 2023)</ref>. Moreover, empirical evidence revealed that the higher degree of L2 learners' self-regulation may reduce their listening anxiety experience in different situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fukuda, 2022)</ref>. They are convinced that self-regulation as a psychological construct has predictive power in L2 listening. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zeng and Goh (2018)</ref> released a piece of evidence that learners' degree of self-regulation may have a possible effect on their listening performance. They cited that students with high levels of self-regulation sound to have a positive attitude toward listening. Lately, some practitioners and researchers endorsed that self-regulation has a positive effect on the listening performance of L2 learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Saaidin et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>With regard to perfectionism, L2 experts in the literature provide evidence for the effect of perfectionism as another psychological construct on listening. The results of some empirical studies in the literature showed that perfectionism and its components are considered as important predictors of affective factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hewitt et al., 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Razmi et al. (2020)</ref> found the interplay between perfectionism and listening performance. Amini and Shamlou (2014) examined the possible interrelationship among perfectionism, different strategies used for language learning, and L2 listening. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zafarani et al. (2022)</ref> in their study focused on the predictive nature of perfectionism for learning in different educational contexts. From the theoretical point of view, it was understood that students who have high levels of perfectionism perform differently from those who have lower levels of different language skills. Despite the existence of different research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amini &amp; Shamlou, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Rahimi &amp; Fathi, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Razmi et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Saaidin et al., 2023)</ref> on the predictive nature of the psychological aspect of learners, insu cient amount of research has been done on the interaction among EFL learners' self-regulation, perfectionism, and listening anxiety in the L2 listening class. It seems that such constructs (i.e., self-regulation, perfectionism &amp; listening anxiety) have an unpredictable and complex relationship. In fact, current research was conducted with the aim of revealing more information about the role of SRL, and perfectionism in predicting Iranian EFL learners' listening anxiety. To that end, a structural equation modeling was adopted to design a regression model to test learners' SRL, and perfectionism as the predictors of listening anxiety. Particularly, current research was pursued to reach different objectives. As the rst goal, this investigation was to probe the relationship among learners' SRL, perfectionism, and listening anxiety. The second and third objectives of this research were to probe the direct and indirect effects of perfectionism and SRL on listening anxiety. As a last objective, current research aimed at determining the extent to which SRL and perfectionism can predict students' listening anxiety.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Background and the Conceptual Framework</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Listening Anxiety</head><p>Listening is a necessary and signi cant skill for communication and EFL/ ESL learners usually have a di cult time when they are going to communicate with each other in the target language ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ji et al., 2022)</ref>. In fact, the sources of this di culty (i.e., listening for communication) could be different and depend on individual differences that may have negative or positive impacts on the L2 learning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rahimi &amp; Fathi, 2022)</ref>. Anxiety as one of those individual differences could have negative impacts on the performance of foreign language learners and was de ned as an individual's feeling of nervousness, apprehension, and worry in a special situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Wang &amp; Cha, 2019)</ref>. Such a bad sense is called foreign language anxiety (FLA). Based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Horwitz et al. (1986)</ref> perspective, FLA is the feeling, emotion, and learners' point of view on their behavior which is caused by learning the language in special conditions. Listening comprehension may lead to high anxiety if learners cannot comprehend the discourse. Thus; it can be said that as a kind of anxiety, foreign language listening anxiety (FLLA) may arise in the classroom or other contexts that need listening for communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Wu et al., 2022)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Nushi and Orouji (2020)</ref> believe that among all types of anxiety, the importance of listening anxiety has been neglected which can cause people to lose their focus and thus make communication fail. To solve this problem, the source of listening anxiety must be found. According to Chen and Ren (2021), due to the fact that mastering listening in the target language is very di cult and time-consuming, when students are communicating with each other may feel anxious for several reasons including unrelated noises in the environment, authenticity, unintelligibility of the listening text, lack of visual support, the di culty level of speech, and worry about embarrassing results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Serraj and Noordin (2013)</ref> found a negative association between FLA and listening comprehension which con rmed the problematic nature of anxiety in the Iranian context. In addition, a reverse correlation was reported between FLA and listening comprehension, and learners with a higher level of FLA experienced a higher level of listening anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Elkhafai , 2005)</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Golchi (2012)</ref> in a correlational investigation reported that the correlation between students' low anxiety and their high listening comprehension in the process of communication is statistically signi cant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perfectionism</head><p>Perfectionism is a multidimensional concept that renders maladaptive and adaptive dimensions and could have an effect on the way persons meet their perceived standards (Solomon-Krakus et al., 2022). Perfectionism is de ned as having standards beyond one's ability, trying to reach those unattainable goals, and de ning the value of a person based on reaching those standards or goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Pacht, 1984)</ref>. Based on the traditional view, perfectionism is a negative psychological construct that leads to negative results in the process of learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gilabert, 2022)</ref>. Therefore, from this point of view, perfectionism can be used for people with low self-con dence, which can create a negative and bad sense that they must always improve their current achievements. In fact, the traditional view offers a one-dimensional view of perfectionism.</p><p>Solomon-Krakus et al. (2022) mentioned that perfectionism is an important personality construct that entails having a rigorous critical self-evaluation, having excessive expectations of yourself to perform better, and trying for perfection with excellent and awless performance. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Frost et al. (1990)</ref> mentioned that fear of failing, trying to be excellent, equating self-worth with success, and organization are among other key components of perfectionism. In fact, perfectionism in language learning can be described as the learners' excessively high expectations beyond their ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Frost et al., 1990)</ref>. Thus, lack of satisfaction with performance leads to experience more listening anxiety for this group of learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amini &amp; Shamlou, 2014)</ref>. As mentioned by Al-Mahrooqi et al. (2016) parental involvement can affect psychological status. If parents set a high standard for their children and criticize them for lower grades, it causes high learning anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Mcneal Jr, 2014)</ref>. In fact, the inclination for perfection among teachers, parents, and students drives them to attain awless accomplishments, resulting in elevated levels of learning anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Hashemi, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The relationship between perfectionism and L2 learning in general and language learning anxiety in speci c was the focus of some researchers. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pishghadam and Akhondpoor (2011)</ref> in their research con rmed the existence of a positive correlation between anxiety and perfectionism. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sönmez and Kurtoğlu (2021)</ref> in their study found that perfectionism has a positive effect on FLA and people with higher levels of perfectionism experienced higher anxiety. Moreover, the association between trait anxiety and dimensions of perfectionism was con rmed by <ref type="bibr">Wan et al. (2022)</ref>. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Roohafza et al. (2010)</ref> found that students' positive perfectionism can be a predictor of higher anxiety.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-regulated Learning</head><p>Self-regulation seems to be a signi cant predictor of learners' success in different situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Zeng &amp; Goh (2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Zimmerman (1989)</ref> provides a practical de nition of self-regulation based on the theory of social cognitive learning. He de ned SRL as the degree to which students participate actively in their own learning process motivationally, metacognitively, and behaviorally. Thus, self-regulation as an important personality trait, refers to learners' pre-planned selfmade feelings, beliefs, thoughts, and behaviors and can help them to reach their desired goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Zimmerman, 2002)</ref>. In a similar vein, Schunk and Zimmerman (2012) de ne SRL as self-created actions, enthusiasm, thoughts, motivation, and feelings in the process of learning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Junaštíková (2023)</ref> claims that SRL as an effective construct can represent evidence for the prediction of several in uential components in learning. Actually, through self-regulation, EFL learners can monitor their learning progress, and determine their objectives clearly which leads to applying self-created learning activities to enhance their learning opportunities and competencies (Şahin Kızıl &amp; Savran, 2018). Thus, it can be inferred that self-regulated learners are more responsible and have a high commitment to do an activity in the process of learning.</p><p>As mentioned by Park and Yun (2018), EFL learners with a higher degree of self-regulation levels are better learning managers which enables them to have more control over their learning and both affective factors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Khoshravesh et al. (2016)</ref> emphasized on self-regulated learners' better performance in terms of self-e cacy, information processing and controlling their own learning. Seker (2016) also emphasized on development of learners' self-regulation levels in the early stages of L2 learning since they will be better evaluators, planners, and managers who take responsibility for their language learning. In addition, researchers (e.g., Jerath et al., 2015; Shores &amp; Shannon, 2007) believed that language learners who had a lower level of self-regulation had a higher potential to experience higher listening anxiety. So, they can use be better decision maker to reduce <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Pintrich, 2004)</ref> Much research has been done on the effect of SRL on learners' language pro ciency. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Morosanova and Fomina (2017)</ref> in their study concluded that self-regulation is primarily linked with anxiety and can be an important predictor of different types of anxiety namely listing anxiety. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Yazdizadeh et al. (2020)</ref> found that the employment of self-regulation can help students improve their capabilities for learning and provide them with a pleasant environment for reaching their desired learning goals with low anxiety. Finally, in terms of the sub-construct of SRL (i.e. cognitive strategies, meta-cognitive strategies &amp; motivation), researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nordahl et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rahimirad, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sun et al., 2023)</ref> found that metacognitive strategies are a strong predictor of anxiety.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relationship among LA, SRL, and Perfectionism</head><p>The concepts of anxiety and SRL have been examined for more than three decades, and they identi ed as crucial factors in EFL learners' success <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chen et al., 2020)</ref>. Theoretically, the existence of a correlation between anxiety and SRL has been discussed which can in uence students' English learning outcomes. It means that learners' self-regulation can increase their self-e cacy and decrease other negative affective factors namely anxiety in the process of learning Regarding the connection between perfectionism and LA, Zafarani et al. (2022) believed that perfectionist EFL learners are often anxious, as they strive to act perfectly in personal and social terms and so creating a high sense of anxiety in them. Anxious and non-anxious FL learners' revealed that they are different from each other's in terms of perfectionist tendencies. The former, always are worried about being judged by others and de ned by a high standard for their learning achievements, and the latter usually are more relaxed and have less worry over the ideas of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gregersen &amp; Horwitz, 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Khosravi et al. (2023)</ref> asserted that the relationship between perfectionism and LA is de nite and learners with a high level of perfectionism experience a greater level of FL anxiety.</p><p>As a result, those learners who feel higher degrees of perfectionism have higher fear or anxiety which can affect their L2 learning and communication. To emphasize the importance of perfectionism, other researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kilbert et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wang et al., 2018)</ref> examined the relationship between perfectionism and anxiety and found a connection between them.</p><p>The scarcity of research investigating the notion of SRL and perfectionism as predictors of listening anxiety based on the SEM model in the EFL context, and the lack of research on this concept in Iran convinced us to design and conduct the current research. So, the current investigation is an attempt to ll the gap in the literature and answer the raised research questions based on the following hypothesized model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesized Model</head><p>The main purpose of this research is to probe the conceptual model of perfectionism and SRL to predict the listening anxiety of learners. For this purpose, rst, the relationship among different variables of the study was investigated. Then, the indirect and direct effect of each predictor variable is examined. To achieve these goals, the SEM approach was utilized as a hypothetical model. The following gure clari es the interconnections among the observed and latent variables based on the SEM framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure1 The Standardized Regression Weights for the Structural Regression Model</head><p>With the intention of testing the hypothetical model, the following questions were raised: Q1: What is the nature of relationship among SRL, perfectionism, and listening anxiety? </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The population of this investigation was all EFL learners who have learned English at different language institutes in Tehran, Iran in the spring term 2022-2023 year. Among them, 350 female (n = 203) and male (n = 147) learners, within the age range of 20 to 33 (M = 28.5; SD = 1.31) were selected as the main sample size by cluster random sampling method at the multistage cluster level. First, among 3 distinct of Tehran, 3 regions were randomly selected. Then, 20 institutes including 60 clusters (i.e., classrooms) including 350 participants were randomly selected. The participants' native language was Persian and all of them had 4-8 years of experience in learning English. They were required to ll out the questionnaires of the current research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection Procedure</head><p>In order to run current research, the SEM approach was adopted. In fact, current research was run in two different phases. In the rst phase (i.e. pilot phase) the reliability of the instruments was calculated on 90 EFL learners with similar characteristics to the participants of the main study. In the second phase (i.e. degree, age, gender, and learning experience. Then, they were required to answer all items of the questionnaires. They had no time limit for completing the questionnaire. Nevertheless, the average time computed for lling out the form was 39 minutes. Initially, the objective of the study was explained to all the participants, and their consent to participate in the study was taken. Speci cally, they were informed that their reply to the link provided indicates their consent to take part in the study. To collect valid data, the participants were assured that the responses would be con dential and would be sent to them via email if they wished. Having the questionnaire administered, invalid respondents, missing data, or falsely lled questionnaire was carried out. It was thus found that 21 questionnaires administered were considered invalid because 5 of them had not completely been lled, 12 participants had lled the questionnaire hastily because they had lled one code in successive 60 items, and 4 participants had submitted the questionnaire not lling in the demographic section of the questionnaire. On the whole, out of the 350 questionnaires distributed, 329 questionnaires (94%) were returned completely lled. After data collection, they were analyzed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments and Measures</head><p>Self-Regulatory Questionnaire Learners' self-regulation was evaluated by a revised version of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bouffard et al. (1995)</ref> ve-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. It included 14 items for measuring students' cognitive strategies, metacognitive strategies, and motivation. The rst dimension included 5 items and refers to necessary activities for learning such as repetition, memorization, elaboration, and understanding. The second dimension included 6 items and concerns learners' metacognitive strategies use which refers to planning, monitoring, and evaluating task success. The third dimension is motivation including 3 items and refers to the amount of effort needed to execute these strategies. Students were required to answer all items on this scale. A high-reliability index (alpha = .86) was reported for the self-regulation scale in a pilot study (n = 90) in general. Furthermore, the Cronbach alpha reliability for the subscale was reported as follows: cognitive strategies = .76, metacognitive strategies = .86, and motivation = .73.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Foreign Language Listening Anxiety Scale (FLLAS)</head><p>To measure learners' FLLA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kim (2000)</ref> scale was employed. This ve-point Likert scale included 33 items and comprised lack of con dence (7 items), tension and worry (10 items), and problems encountered (16 items) as three dimensions of L2 listening anxiety. The reliability of the scale was calculated in a pilot study in the Iranian EFL context (n = 90). High-reliability indices (alpha = .93) were reported for The scale in a pilot study (n = 90) in general. Furthermore, the Cronbach alpha reliability for the subscale was reported as follows: tension and worry=. 89, lack of con dence=. 85, and problems encountered .92.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale</head><p>To measure learners' perfectionism, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Frost et al. (1990)</ref> scale was employed. The scale is Likert type including 35 items ranging from 1 to 5 measuring six underlying subscales including personal standards (7 items), concern over mistakes (9 items), parental criticism (4 items), parental expectations (5 items), organization (6 items) and doubts about actions (4 items). The reliability of the scale was 0.83 and was calculated in a pilot study before starting the main study in the Iranian EFL context (n = 90). In addition, the reliability results for the subscale were as follows: .74 for doubts about actions, .84 for Organization, .88 for concern over mistakes, .87 for personal standards, and .82 for parental expectations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>After data collection, they were analyzed at different phases. First, the reliability of the scales was calculated by Cronbach's Alpha in the pilot study. Then, in the main phase, normality assumptions were calculated. After that, as the design of the study was correlational, Pearson correlation was run to check the nature of the relationship among variables. Furthermore, the SEM model was tested. Different reports namely root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), x2/df (chi-square to degrees of freedom ratio), comparative t index (CFI), and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) were provided to check whether the model enjoys good t or not. In addition, standard and unstandardized regression weights were calculated to check the predictive power of the latent and observed variables.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Statistical Assumptions for Normality of Variables</head><p>In order to reach the objectives of this study and answer the questions, in the rst step, the normality assumptions of the collected data were checked and reported. As mentioned by Byrne (2010), SEM requires observed variables to enjoy univariate and multivariate normality. The results revealed acceptable ranges of ± 2 (George &amp; Mallery, 2020) for skewness and kurtosis indices of univariate normality, and the assumption of univariate normality was retained. In addition, SEM requires a linear combination of the observed variables to enjoy normality; i.e. multivariate normality. The assumption of multivariate normality was checked using Mardia's index. Based on the results, Mardia's index of -5.107 was smaller than ± 272; hence multivariate normality of the present data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Answer to the First Question</head><p>In order to probe the nature of relationship among SRL, perfectionism, and listening anxiety, Pearson correlations were run among the constructs and the subfactors.  <ref type="table">1</ref>, a signi cant linear relationship was found among variables and their components. The nding indicated that there is a signi cant negative relationship between EFL learners' SRL and listening anxiety (r = .23, p &lt; .01). In addition, the results indicated that there is a signi cant positive relationship between perfectionism and their listening anxiety (r = .26, p &lt; .01). More precisely, based on the results, EFL learners' SRL will help them to reduce their listening anxiety. In contrast, perfectionism will increase learners' listening anxiety. Furthermore, ndings indicated that the correlation coe cient between perfectionism and listening anxiety was stronger than the correlation between self-regulation and listening anxiety.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Answer to the Second, and Third Research Questions</head><p>In order to estimate the effects predictive nature of perfectionism and SRL (i.e. independent variables) on the listening anxiety (i.e. dependent variable), and to probe the overall model t, various GFIs have been examined. In fact, SEM was run to check the model in which the two constructs of SRL and perfectionism were considered predictors of listening anxiety. In so doing, rst, the Fit of the Structural Regression Model (SRM) was tested. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> displays the standardized regression weights for the SRM.</p><p>As mentioned by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hair et al. (2020)</ref> in the SEM approach, different indices, compromising RMSEA, x2/df, GFI, and TLI, must be reported. Therefore, for each index, the preference value was considered for assessment. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> presents the results of t indices for SRM for different variables of the current research. As indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, the SRM enjoyed a good t due to absolute and incremental reports. Concerning the absolute report in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, the chi-square indices of the badness of t were non-signi cant (χ 2 (114) = 130.033, p = .145). In addition, the ratio of chi-square over the degree of freedom (i.e. 130.033 / 114 = 1.141) was lower than 3. Moreover, the SRMR of .080 was lower than .10. Furthermore, the RMSEA was .000. Its 90 percent con dence intervals (i.e. .000, .035) were all lower than .10 (Byrne 2010). Finally, the PCLOSE of 1 was higher than .05 and the GFI of .957 was higher than .90.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> also presents the incremental t indices to prove the t of the model. To have a good t model the criterion value of .90 for all t indices is needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Byrne, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Collier, 2020)</ref>. Therefore, based on the results of incremental t indices (i.e. RFI = .913, TLI = .988, CFI = .990, IFI = .990, NFI = .927) good t was also proved for the model.</p><p>The results con rmed the good t index for SRM and so, the suitability of the model was proved for subsequent analyses. After con rmation of the model, SEM examined the regression analysis and coe cients for the exogenous (i.e., SRL and perfectionism) and indigenous variable (i.e. listening anxiety). To determine the predictive nature of the two mentioned independent variables, SEM examined the Standardized Regression Weights. Standardized regression coe cients allow the researchers to compare the strength of relationships between variables that are measured on different scales and can help them to identify which variables are the most important predictors in the model.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the standardized regression weights for the effect of SRL, and perfectionism on listening anxiety. Based on the results presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, SRL had a negative signi cant and direct effect on listening anxiety (Beta = - .384, p = .000), and the second null hypothesis was rejected. That is to say; if SRL increased by one standard deviation, listening anxiety decreased by .384 standard deviations. Since the sign of the standardized regression weight is negative, an increase in SRL results in a decrease in listening anxiety.</p><p>And nally; perfectionism had a signi cant and direct effect on listening anxiety (Beta = .417, p = .000), and the fourth null hypothesis was rejected. That is to say; if perfectionism increased by one standard deviation, listening anxiety increased by .417 standard deviations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Answer to the Fourth Research Questions</head><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, the p-value for SRL and perfectionism as two predictor variables was lower than 0.05. Put differently, the response value is sensitive to any changes in the exogenous/predictor variables. Notably, the coe cient for exogenous variables (i.e., SRL and perfectionism) is as follows: self-regulated learning (Beta = - .384) and perfectionism (Beta = .417). Since the p-value is smaller than .05, statistically signi cant differences were found for both comparisons. The results indicated that SRL and perfectionism are the robust predictors of listening anxiety. Based on the ndings it can be said that compared to SRL, perfectionism is a stronger predictor of listening anxiety.</p><p>In terms of sub-constructs of perfectionism, ndings revealed that concern over mistakes (Beta = .696), parental standards (Beta = .702), and parental criticism (Beta = .707) had more predictive power on listening anxiety. In terms of the predictive power of other remaining sub-constructs of perfectionism, parental expectation (Beta = .672), doubt (Beta =. 638), and Organization (Beta = .524) were in the next rank respectively.</p><p>Considering the sub-constructs of SRL, ndings revealed that metacognitive strategies (Beta = .670) had more predictive power than cognitive strategies (Beta = .663) and motivation (Beta = 643) on the listening anxiety of the learners. Accordingly, the last null hypothesis (i.e., self-regulated learning, and perfectionism, cannot predict students' listening anxiety) was rejected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The current research investigated the effects and predictive nature of SRL, and perfectionism on EFL learners' listening anxiety in Iran. The ndings of the rst question indicated that there is a signi cant negative relationship between EFL learners' SRL and listening anxiety which is in agreement with the ndings of the researchers (e.g., Abbasi &amp; Javanmard, 2022; Wu et al., 2022) who found negative relationship between learners' SRL and anxiety in the classroom and believe that learners' SRL will help them to reduce their anxiety. The ndings also follow the ndings of the researchers (e.g., Kareshki et al., 2017; Tarazi &amp; Khademi, 2013) who emphasized the reverse correlation between two variables. In explaining these ndings, it can be said that individuals with different levels of self-regulation showed different abilities to manage and control their learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Wu et al., 2022)</ref>. In fact, learners who use self-regulation learning strategies have different positive abilities namely better processing of information, higher self-e cacy, more con dence in their memory function, and more supervision of their learning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Khoshravesh et al., 2016</ref>). Thus, it can be implied that they experience less listening anxiety.</p><p>In addition, the relationship between learners' perfectionism and listening anxiety was reported to be signi cant and positive which aligns with the ndings of the researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zafarani et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pishghadam &amp; Akhondpoor, 2011)</ref> who found an association between learning anxiety and perfectionism and believe that as an important personality trait, perfectionism will increase learners' anxiety in general and listening anxiety in speci c. It means that more perfectionist students experience higher levels of listening anxiety in the EFL context which can be due to different features of perfectionism. To justify these ndings, it can be said that as perfectionists believe that they must reach perfect performance in the learning process (i.e. higher level of listening pro ciency), performance lower than excellent is not satisfactory for them and they worry about their mistakes in the learning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Roohafza et al., 2010)</ref>. Therefore, a lack of satisfaction with performance causes this group of learners to experience more listening anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amini &amp; Shamlou, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Considering to the second question, the ndings indicated that SRL as an important psychological construct had a signi cant negative and direct effect on listening anxiety. An increase in SRL results in a decrease in listening anxiety. These results conform with the ndings of the researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Apridayani et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Morosanova &amp; Fomina., 2017)</ref> who concluded that self-regulation has a direct effect on students learning anxiety. In addition, the results align with the notion that self-regulated learners, who employ proactive approaches such as goal setting, monitoring, and re ection, may possess a greater ability to manage and cope with anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Zheng et al., 2023)</ref> speci cally related to listening tasks The inverse relationship implies that as individuals become more adept at regulating their own learning processes, they concurrently experience a reduction in the anxiety associated with listening activities. One possible interpretation is that those who exhibit self-regulated learning behaviors might approach listening tasks with a more con dent and controlled mindset. By setting goals, planning their learning strategies, and monitoring their progress, these individuals could develop a sense of mastery and competence in their listening abilities, leading to a diminished experience of anxiety.</p><p>Regarding the third question, the results revealed that perfectionism had a signi cant and direct effect on listening anxiety. That is to say; if perfectionism increased, listening anxiety increased. In fact, this nding underscores the intricate interplay between perfectionism and the emotional state of listening anxiety. Individuals characterized by higher levels of perfectionism might exhibit a heightened sensitivity to the performance expectations associated with different tasks <ref type="bibr">(Wan et al., 2022)</ref> namely listing tasks. Consistent with the ndings of this study, researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kilbert et al., 2005</ref>; Zafarani et al) found that perfectionism has a signi cant effect on anxiety. Perfectionist EFL learners are often anxious, as they strive to act perfectly in personal and social terms. So, they experience a high sense of anxiety. This agrees with the results of the previous study proposing that those language learners pursuing an idealized rather than a realistic pro ciency level have more potential to experience higher language learning anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Khosravi et al., 2023)</ref>. The positive beta coe cient implies a direct and proportional relationship, suggesting that the more perfectionistic tendencies an individual possesses, the greater the likelihood of elevated listening anxiety. One interpretation of this result is rooted in the inherent pressures perfectionists place on themselves to meet exceedingly high standards. In the context of listening tasks, the fear of making errors, misinterpreting information, or not fully grasping the content may contribute to heightened anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Sönmez &amp; Kurtoğlu, 2021)</ref>. Perfectionists' constant pursuit of awlessness may amplify the perceived stakes of these activities, leading to an increased susceptibility to anxiety.</p><p>With regard to the last question, ndings revealed that all the exogenous variables (i.e., SRL and perfectionism) are robust predictors of listening anxiety. In respect to SRL and anxiety, ndings are consistent with the ndings of Morosanova and Fomina (2017) who concluded that self-regulation is primarily linked with anxiety and can be an important predictor of different types of anxiety namely listing anxiety. As it was found in the current research, language learners who had a lower level of self-regulation had a higher potential to experience higher listening anxiety. This outcome con rmed the ndings of earlier research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Jerath et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Shores &amp; Shannon, 2007)</ref>. Furthermore, from theoretical perspective, self-regulation can help learners to accept or control their emotional states, to become more self-aware, and to avoid unhelpful behavior while remaining calmer under pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Park &amp; Yun, 2018)</ref>. In this situation, learners may then make a decision about what actions to take to reduce anxiety symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Pintrich, 2004</ref>) which leads to higher self-e cacy in the learning process. Therefore, more self-regulated language learners experience lower levels of listening anxiety. This is why self-regulation can be a good predictor of listening anxiety from the theoretical perspective too.</p><p>Considering the sub-constructs of SRL, ndings revealed that metacognitive strategies had more predictive power than cognitive strategies and motivation on listening anxiety of EFL learners. These ndings are in agreement with the ndings of  <ref type="bibr">, 2011)</ref>. A positive correlation between the two variables indicates that learners with a higher level of perfectionism experienced higher listening anxiety in the process of communication. This means that perfectionism can signi cantly predict listening anxiety. In addition to empirical evidence, the ndings were also con rmed by the theoretical perspective. As mentioned by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gregersen and Horwitz (2002)</ref>, different symptoms of perfectionism seem to have a negative effect on students' achievement. Symptoms such as fear of negative evaluation, error phobia, and high-performance standards may be seen in students' behavior which is obvious in their performance in terms of higher anxiety and competence in the target language. Due to higher anxiety caused by perfectionism symptoms such as not participating in class activities, being quiet in the classroom, and withdrawing from classroom activities, perfectionist learners can hardly improve their language skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Wang et al., 2018)</ref>. In addition, as they want to have high standards with the best performance, fear of committing errors and wrong pronunciation can lead to anxiety in the process of communication <ref type="bibr">(Gregerson &amp; Horwitz, 2002)</ref>. As a matter of fact, perfectionist learners spend their energy on avoiding mistakes rather than presenting their ability in the language class.</p><p>In terms of sub-constructs of perfectionism, ndings revealed that concern over mistakes, parental standards, and parental criticism had more predictive power on listening anxiety. To justify these ndings, it can be said that the perfectionist tendency of teachers, parent, and students lead them to reach perfect achievement which creates high learning anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Hashemi, 2011)</ref>. With regard to concern over mistakes, the ndings are in line with the idea of Horwitz et al.</p><p>(1986) who mentioned that making mistakes in front of classmates and getting feedback from the teacher in front of others can cause high anxiety and affect learning achievement, especially for those learners who have de ned high standard for themselves and were considered as perfectionist learners.</p><p>Roohafza et al.) 2010) also believed that fear of making mistakes in class creates high anxiety and can be a strong predictor of language learning. Therefore, it can be implied that students' concentration on absolute accuracy to achieve outstanding test scores can lead to stress and higher listening anxiety in the EFL context. Considering parental standards and parental criticism the ndings are in agreement with the ndings of Al-Mahrooqi et al. (2016) who found that parental involvement can affect students' learning outcomes and psychological status. If parents set a high standard for their children and criticize them for lower grades, it causes high learning anxiety in them <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Mcneal Jr, 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and Implications</head><p>The current research sought to investigate the nature of two variables (SRL, and perfectionism) on EFL learners' listening anxiety. To reach the objectives, SEM modeling was adopted. There was found signi cant negative relationship between SRL and listening anxiety. In addition, ndings showed that perfectionism and listening anxiety have a signi cant positive relationship with each other. Overall, it was found that SRL and perfectionism had signi cant effects on listening anxiety. However, in comparison to the SRL, perfectionism has more predictive power in nature for listening anxiety. Therefore, focus on perfectionism in L2 listening classrooms can be a simple conclusion of this study. It can be concluded that a higher level of perfectionism can increase the listening anxiety of English language learners and a higher level of SRL reduces the listening anxiety of the learners.</p><p>Concerning the pedagogical implications of this study, EFL teachers should support self-regulation in reducing learners' listening anxiety. In addition, they should focus on a way to reduce learners' levels of perfectionism as a psychological obstacle for learning in L2 listening classes. Accordingly, language teachers and materials developers are suggested to foster learners' listening and SRL by designing practical materials and actions for listening activities in the EFL context which can help them to manage stressful situations and reduce other psychological factors in the listening process. In the current research, just quantitative data were collected. To enhance the generalizability of the ndings future researchers can be conducted to use other research designs namely qualitative or mixed-method to provide more information about the predictors of listening anxiety in the EFL context. In conducting any research, some limitations may emerge regarding the participants and the setting of the study. Time limitation was the only limitation of this research. In conducting such research, a large number of participants is needed but due to time limitations, 350 participants were selected which might have in uenced the obtained results and the generalizability of the ndings.</p></div>
