<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Many studies have focused on the relationship between vegetation biomass and environmental factors in grassland. However, several questions remain to be answered, especially with regards to the spatial pattern of vegetation biomass. Thus, the distributed mechanism will be explored in the present study. Here, plant biomass was measured at 23 sites along a transect survey during the peak growing season in 2006. The data were analyzed with a classification and regression tree (CART) model. The structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to explicitly evaluate the both direct and indirect effects of these critical environmental elements on vegetation biomass. The results demonstrated that mean annual temperature (MAT) affected aboveground biomass (AGB) scored at 20.811 (P,0.05). The direct effect of MAT on belowground biomass (BGB) was 20.490 (P,0.05). The results were determined by SEM. Our results indicate that AGB and BGB in semi-arid ecosystems is strongly affected by precipitation and temperature. Future work shall attempt to take into account the integrated effects of precipitation and temperature. Meanwhile, partitioning the influences of environmental variations and vegetation types are helpful in illuminating the internal mechanism of biomass distribution.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Vegetation biomass, which is usually illustrated by aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB) and ratio of root to shoot (R/S), is regarded as an important parameter in indicating the carbon cycles of terrestrial ecosystems and in global climate models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In particular, the majority of CO 2 in the atmosphere was fixed by grassland ecosystems, which account for 1/4 of the land surface and 1/10 of global carbon storage <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Changes in environmental conditions will produce rapid and profound influences on vegetation biomass <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Furthermore, the spatial patterns of biomass shape the dynamics of the grassland's carbon cycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the mechanisms of how biomass distributed patterns respond to environmental variation and climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Hulunbuir grassland, with one hundred thousand square kilometers of total grassland area, its large tracts of grassland make this area very suitable for research along the different ecological gradients.</p><p>The spatial pattern of vegetation biomass is severely shaped by environmental elements. There are many studies examining the relationship between vegetation biomass and environmental conditions. For instance, Peng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> found that net primary production responds non-linearly to increased vs. decreased rainfall in semi-arid grassland ecosystem, Inner Mongolia. Chang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> also documented that annual precipitation and air temperature are the key factors affecting the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in temperate grasslands, and hold that ANPP increased with the increasing of precipitation, and declined with the air temperature. Fan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> reported that the proportion of belowground biomass increased as temperature decreased in Inner Mongolia, and was distributed more deeply in desert grassland owing to the aridity of the grassland types. Meanwhile, changes of AGB and BGB were examined in relation to gradients of temperature and precipitation. Total biomass was negatively correlation with temperature, but positively weak correlation with mean annual precipitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. As a matter of fact, the complex change of biomass was caused by the meteorological factors and soil properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. However, the studies regarding the magnitude of the concrete influence of the main environmental elements on vegetation biomass, especially along the gradients of precipitation and temperature across Hulunbuir grassland, remain few. The principal purposes of the present study were to explore the spatial distribution pattern of AGB, BGB and R/S along the gradients of precipitation and temperature using data investigated from 23 sites across Hulunbuir grassland; examine the relationships of AGB, BGB and R/S with the relevant environmental factors and to screen out the main factors using the classification and regression tree (CART) model; and to identify the concrete effect magnitude of the key elements on the AGB, BGB and R/S using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The final objective was to indicate the internal controlling factors of vegetation biomass along the gradients of precipitation and temperature.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics Statement</head><p>For each site, no specific permits were required for the sample collected and the field studies did not involve endangered or protected species in Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Area</head><p>The study area is situated in the western portion of Mt. Daxing'anling, Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia, China (115u319-126u049E, 47u059-53u209N). The mean annual precipitation is 339 mm and the mean annual temperature is 2.2uC <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. The topographic features in the area are relatively changeless and the maximal difference in elevation is not more than 50 m. Chernozem and chestnut soil are the main soil types <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. It is provided with broad precipitation and temperature gradients that are strongly related to the spatial patterns of grassland biomass in the Hulunbuir zone <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection and Sample Analysis</head><p>In 2006, 23 sites crossing from west to east and from south to north were surveyed in Hulunbuir grassland during the vegetation growth period (June, July and August). Sampling sites were established along the gradients of precipitation and temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). From each site, we harvested AGB and BGB in five plots (1 m61 m) of similar topography and environmental conditions every 10 m intervals along a transect. AGB was determined by clipping the plants at ground level and oven-drying them at 65uC until they reached a constant weight. BGB was collected from soil depths of 0 cm to 30 cm, where most of the belowground biomass is located <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The root samples were obtained from the blocks using 5 cm diameter soil cores, soaked in water to remove the residual soil via a 0.5 mm sieve, and dried at 65uC to a constant weight. Meanwhile, soil samples were collected from five replicate soil profiles to determine soil properties at the 30 cm soil depth. After being air-dried and sieved (using 2 mm mesh), the soil samples were carefully handpicked to extract the surface organic materials and fine roots for soil chemical properties analysis. Each mixed soil sample was divided into two parts. One sub-sample was oven-dried at 105uC to a constant weight to measure gravimetric soil water content (SWC) and soil bulk density (BD). The remaining soil was ground in a ball mill for soil total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP) and available phosphorous (AP) analysis. Soil properties were determined following all standard protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Meteorological factors were obtained using spatially interpolated methods from the records of 28 weather stations (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Annual mean temperature (MAT)and annual mean precipitation (MAP) <ref type="bibr">(2003)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2004)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2005)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2006)</ref> were regarded as climate factors, and the data of longitude and latitude for each sampling site was determined using the Global Positioning System (GPS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>The entire document was analyzed according to the followings three steps. First of all, the data regarding MAP, MAT, TOC, TP, AP, TN, BD, SWC, AGB, BGB and R/S were handled through Spearman correlation analysis after normal distribution testing. Secondly, we used classification and regression tree (CART) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> to screen out the crucial variables influencing vegetation biomass from all samples of environmental factors along gradients of precipitation and temperature according to the data collected across various studied sites. The CART method facilitates determination of the possible interactions and adjustments necessary for making decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, as it can identify the critical variables that significantly influence the response variables. The specific operating process has been described in Sun's report <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and the R guideline book (R Development Core Team, 2011). Finally, structural equation modeling (SEM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> was conducted to explicitly evaluate both the direct and indirect effects of these critical environmental elements on vegetation biomass (AGB, BGB and R/S). SEM has been used in recent studies to exactly assess the causal relationships among multiple interacting variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In this study, statistical analysis and plotting were performed using the R software (version 2.15, R Development Core Team, 2011).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Statistic of AGB, BGB and R/S</head><p>AGB, BGB and R/S all exhibited large variations along the sampled transect, ranging from 8.37 to 201.96 g m -2 for AGB, 105.99-2586.50 g m -2 for BGB and 1.01-131.98 for R/S (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The mean values were 62.01 g m -2 , 974.21 g m -2 and 28.67 for AGB, BGB and R/S, respectively. The standard deviation values of AGB, BGB and R/S were 48.87, 513.72 and 27.46, in sequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlationship of AGB, BGB and R/S with Environmental Factors</head><p>The Spearman correlation analysis method was adopted to analyze the correlation of AGB, BGB and R/S with environmental factors (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The results demonstrated that AGB was positively related to MAP, TOC and TN across the sampling sites, with correlation coefficients of 0.562, 0.613 and 0.511, respectively. By contrast, AGB was negatively related to MAT, AP and BD, with correlation coefficients of 0.661, 0.579 and 0.650, respectively, while its relation with SWC and TP was nonsignificant. BGB was positively related to the MAP, TOC and TN at the 0.05 level, with correlation coefficients of 0.406, 0.434 and 0.359, respectively. The relationships of BGB with SWC, TP, AP and BD were non-significant. Meanwhile, R/S was positively related to AP and BD, with correlation coefficients of 0.446 and 0.557, while it had negative correlations to MAP, TOC and TN, with correlation coefficients of 20.328, 0.368 and 0.312 (P,0.05). The relationships of R/S with SWC and AP were non-significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of Critical Factors by the CART Model</head><p>The impacts of all kinds of environmental factors on vegetation biomass (AGB, BGB and R/S) were observed using the CART model. The optional tree was developed. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>, the analysis indicated that MAP, MAT, AP, TN, SWC and BD are most closely associated with large-scale variations in AGB. For the second tree (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), three critical environmental factors containing MAT, AP and TOC were obtained, having a significant influence on BGB. For the third tree (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>), R/S was influenced mainly by MAP, TOC and AP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Equation Modeling to Explain the Effects of Environmental Variables on AGB, BGB and R/S</head><p>The critical variables (MAP, MAT, AP, TN, SWC and BD) were inter-correlated, and these apparent relationships combined both direct and indirect correlations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Thus, we further used SEM to explicitly evaluate the causal relationships among these interacting variables.</p><p>From the SEM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), it is evident that, MAT, TN, SWC and BD affected AGB (direct effect), scored at 20.811 (P,0.05), 2 0.608, 0.424 and 0.532, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>). The direct effects of AP and MAT on BGB were 0.280 and 20.490 (P,0.05), respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>). AP had significantly positive direct effects on R/S at 0.408 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>). The rank of total effects on AGB, in decreasing order, was: TN, MAT, SWC, BD and MAP. MAT had the strongest negative effects on both AGB and BGB among all predictors (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>), whereas no significant effect of MAP on AGB was found. AGB and BGB responded similarly to MAT. The standardized total effect of MAT on AGB was 20.381, consisting of direct effects (path coefficient = 20.811, P,0.05) and indirect effects through soil variables (path coefficient = 0.43). Among soil variables, TN and BD had significant negative effects on AGB, with path coefficients of 20.608 and 20.532 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>), whereas SWC had a positive effect on AGB (path coefficient = 0.424). The total effect of AP on R/S was 0.389, consisting of direct effects (path coefficient = 0.408, P,0.05) and indirect effects through soil variables (path coefficient = 20.019). However, neither the direct nor indirect effects of MAP on R/S were significant (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characteristics of Vegetation Biomass across all Samples in the Temperate Grassland</head><p>The values of vegetation biomass exhibited large variations along the sampled transect. The mean value of AGB in the present study was found to be lower than that in the temperate grasslands of Inner Mongolia (135.3 g m -2 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. By contrast, BGB and R/S in the temperate grassland of Hulunbuir was found to be higher than it is in the temperate grasslands of Inner Mongolia (775.2 and 6.3 g m -2 ). Meanwhile, BGB was far larger than AGB across Hulunbuir grassland, which was approximately 15 times greater than AGB. This result indicated that vegetation biomass in the temperate grassland of Hulunbuir was present to a greater degree below ground than above. Similar results were detailed in Ma's report <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, which described how BGB was approximately 6 times greater than AGB in the temperate grasslands of Inner Mongolia. The average value of R/S in Hulunbuir moderate grassland is far larger than that observed in global temperate grasslands (4.2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The higher R/S in Hulunbuir grasslands might be associated with the comparatively slow depletion of carbohydrates in roots, resulting from low respiration rates in the extremely cold winters there, and might also be due to slower root turnover in the colder environment relative to the mean level of the global temperate grasslands <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In addition, R/S values found in the present study ranging from 1.01 to 131.98 were consistent with results reported by Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, who performed a field investigation from 2001 to 2004, discovering that R/S values have the potential to vary greatly as a result of climate change and anthropogenic activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. For example, long term grazing in grasslands may result in the reduction of AGB and ultimately higher R/S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of critical factor on Spatial Pattern of AGB, BGB and R/S</head><p>Moreover, based on the Spearman correlation analysis between biomass and environmental factors, we found that most environmental factors showed a significant correlation at 0.05 levels (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). This may be a result of the degree of multicollinearity with respect to the effect of environmental factors on vegetation biomass, consistent with Sun's report <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>We used the CART model and SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> as new approaches to conduct variable selection and quantify its effect so as to screen out the critical factors associated with AGB, BGB and R/S and then to identify direct and indirect factors while determining the extent to which these factors may constrain vegetation biomass. To our knowledge, the efficiency of these approaches has not been evaluated empirically in vegetation biomass research simultaneously. Traditionally, stepwise selection and linear regression are used to identify and rank the limiting factors in grassland biomass studies. However, when performing stepwise selection, closely covariate parameters cannot be selected simultaneously in the final model, because the explanatory power does not increase when a closely related variable is included <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Field studies examining ecosystem responses to climatic and other environmental changes typically use naturally occurring climatic gradients. Nevertheless, Burke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> raised the issue that there are inherent problems with utilizing simple statistical relationships of spatial variability as foundations for understanding ecosystem function, because complex covariance along the gradient occurs across large spatial scales, leading to the problem that actual and apparent controlling factors may be confounded. SEM, however, is an appropriate option <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The quantitative procedure in the current study demonstrated that the strongest direct factors influencing AGB at the regional scale were MAT, TN, SWC and BD. While the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Coefficient of correlation between biome and environmental factors (Spearman). largest total element impacting R/S was AP, AP and MAT both had major direct influences on BGB. This holistic approach is appropriate in across-site comparisons of ecosystem structure and function. Additionally, we discovered that longitude and latitude, which indicated the gradient of precipitation and temperature accordingly, were almost the main determinants on biome with a comparatively larger magnitude of total effect than that of all other relevant environmental factors. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the mechanism of biomass distribution along the gradient of precipitation and temperature. Precipitation and temperature are considered to be the limiting factors for the growth and distribution of vegetation over the long term <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Previous studies precipitation has large impacts on grassland ecosystems biomass in Inner Mongolia <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> However, in the present study, AGB and BGB showed a decreasing trend with increasing temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>), while R/S demonstrated a reverse change (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The spatial pattern of vegetation biomass in Inner Mongolia in this dry area is associated with temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Under drought conditions high temperatures may further restrain plant photosynthesis. This was shown by Xu and Zhou <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, who reported that high temperatures resulted in the reduction of photosynthetic rate and biomass of L. chinensis steppe. Furthermore, higher temperatures will result in increased evaporation, intensifying drought and reducing biomass <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>In our case, when MAP is retained in the model, MAT will not be selected. Therefore, our results showed temperature to be a significant influence on AGB and BGB, while precipitation was not shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. As a matter of fact, precipitation also had the strongest positive effect on AGB and BGB (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). This phenomenon indicates that there is an integrated effect between   temperature and precipitation on plant growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Our findings reinforce the idea that precipitation is major limiting factor that control the functions of ecosystems in terrestrial biomes, particularly in arid and semi-arid ecosystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. In addition, we found that TOC and TN are also positively related to precipitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and negatively related to temperature (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Kirschbaum <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> holds that warming will have the effect of reducing soil organic carbon by stimulating decomposition rates more than NPP. On the other hand, some scholars hold the opposite view <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, suggesting that adequate precipitation and temperatures that are not too high can be used to create good soil nutrient conditions for plant growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Relevant to the above statement, the spatial pattern of vegetation biomass was influenced by soil nutrient level (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>), and soil nutrient levels were affected by the conditions of water and heat. Soil nutrient levels can be improved by more litter being returned to soil resulting from more plant biomass with the addition of well water and ideal heat conditions.</p><p>Soil nitrogen has been found to be a limiting factor for AGB and BGB in most terrestrial ecosystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. Nevertheless, others have reported limited or no influence of soil nitrogen on ecosystem production <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. In the present study, we found that there was negative relationship of AGB with total nitrogen content. Thus, we concluded that the different responses of plants to nitrogen content are a result of different nitrogen deficiency levels of the local systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Soil phosphorous, generally regarded as the most critical factor for plant growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, the biomass was related with available phosphorous (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Meanwhile, the previous studies suggested that soil water content play an important role on biomass allocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, and the soil physical structure (e.g soil bulk density) might be more important for determining BGB than other factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0102344.g004</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Our results indicate that precipitation and temperature strongly affect aboveground and belowground biomass in semi-arid ecosystems. Future work shall attempt to take into account the integrated effects of precipitation and temperature, which could possibly explain the spatial variance of AGB, BGB and R/S better than MAP or MAT alone. Meanwhile, partitioning the influences of environmental variations and vegetation types is helpful in illuminating the internal mechanism of biomass distribution along the gradient of precipitation and temperature.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .Figure 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
