<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Innovations in economic development have highlighted the role of talent, and focusing on employees' work stress and its impact on employees' health contributes to the continued development of employees and companies.This article aims to propose the work stress-employee health model and hypotheses under the moderation of perceived organizational support (POS) and self-efficacy. We select appropriate scales; collected 428 responses from questionnaire survey and explored the different effects of challenging/hindrance stress (CS/HS) on the employee's physical/mental health, and the mechanism of POS and self-efficacy. The results indicated that: (1) CS has a significant positive impact on employees' mental health; (2) HS has a significant negative impact on employees' physical and mental health; (3) POS and selfefficacy have moderating effect on the relationship between CS and employees' mental health, HS and employees' physical and mental health.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In today's environment of advocating economic innovation, on the one hand, human resources play an increasingly powerful role in the development of enterprises and society. Therefore, paying attention to the pressure of employees and the impact of work pressure on employees' health is of great significance. On the other hand, the development requirements of economic innovation have put forward higher work requirements for enterprises and their employees, and in the face of high work requirements, employees' work stress naturally increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> . Therefore, it is very important and necessary to explore the mechanism of the impact of work stress on employees' health.</p><p>Work stress can not only affect the mental health of employees, but also have a direct impact on the physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> . More and more employees say that they are under considerable stress at work. Work stress such as heavy workload, unclear responsibilities, and chaotic organizational structure will cause serious negative effects on employees' mental and physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> . At the end of the last century, most studies focused on the negative effects of work stress on employees' health, and seldom considered the positive effects of work stress. However, just as the phrase "stress generates motivation", whether all work stress has only negative impact on employees' physical and mental health, the answers given by existing research are not completely consistent, and there is no consensus on the relationship between work stress and employees' health in academia <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> . With the gradual deepening and expansion of work stress research, how to distinguish different work stress from the attributes of "positive" and "negative", reduce the negative impact of work stress on employees' physical and mental health, and strengthen the positive impact of work stress with positive attributes on the physical and mental health of employees is very necessary.</p><p>On the basis of Cavanaugh's challenging-hindrance binary stress model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> , many scholars have studied the results of binary stress such as job performance and job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> , but studies on the effects of binary stress on employees' health are relatively rare. Therefore, this paper will explore the effect of binary stress on employees' physical-mental health.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Literature review</head><p>Employee health refers to the personal health in organizations, mainly manifested in the subjective satisfaction and objective health of employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> ; Work stress refers to factors that cause abnormal mental, physiological, and behavioral performance between members of the organization, and have an impact on the work <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> . Cavanaugh divided work stress into challenging and HS based on the positive and negative properties of work stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> . Self-efficacy refers to how confident people are that they can use all their skills to accomplish a task <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> . POS is a general belief in that how organizations value employees' contributions and care for their interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Hypotheses development</head><p>Because of the "positive" attribute of CS, employees often show positive work attitude and behavior, and their physical and mental state is positively affected, while the "negative" attribute of hindering stress makes employees' physical and mental state be suppressed. Thus, we put forward the following hypothesis:</p><p>H1a/b: CS has a positive effect on employees' physical/mental health.</p><p>H2a/b: HS has a negative effect on employees' physical/mental health.</p><p>Employees with high POS return the organization's superior pay or other material and spiritual support through the completion of challenging and high-level work tasks and this social exchange process is easier for employees to produce positive feelings for the organization, which is beneficial to the physical and mental health of employees. Self-efficacy-aware employees are more confident and optimistic when faced with challenging work tasks, which not only provides emotional resources, but also helps them stay in good physical condition. The hypotheses are thus made:</p><p>H1c/e: POS has a significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between CS and employee's physical/mental health.</p><p>H1d/f: Self-efficacy has a significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between CS and employee's physical/mental health.</p><p>H2c/e: POS has a significant negative moderating effect on the relationship between CS and employee's physical/mental health.</p><p>H2d/f: Self-efficacy has a significant negative moderating effect on the relationship between HS and employee's physical/mental health.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Method</head><p>Challenging and Hindrance Stress. The 11-items CS-HS questionnaire developed by Cavanaugh and others in 2000 was used, which was scored by the Likert 5-point scoring method.

In this study, the coefficient α was 0.908.</p><p>Control variables. The control variables in this study include the gender, age and management level of the employee.</p><p>In this study, data were collected by questionnaire research and online distribution of questionnaires. The respondents were staff members of different positions in different industries. A total of 428 valid questionnaires were received, excluding 41 responses from school or un-formal staff, as well as 10 responses with less than 120 seconds answering time. The effective rate is 89.35 percent.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>CS can bring rewards and benefits for employees' work performance and personal development and will have a positive impact on employees' health. The CS felt by employees does not lead bad psychological state to employees, but more work motivation to enhance the control of the work, so it will promote the mental health of employees. CS has no significant effect on employees' physical health. The possible reason is that heavy responsibilities and workload can stimulate employees' progress, but on the other hand, it can also lead to overwork. Long term physical loss and fatigue can offset the positive impact of "positive" connotation of CS on physical condition. HS not only leads to depression, inferiority, anxiety and other negative emotions, but also leads to physical tension and fatigue, which has a negative impact on the physical and mental health of employees. This study found that POS and self-efficacy play a moderating role in the relationship between CS and mental health, HS and physical health, and HS and mental health. Combined with the theory of POS, POS, as a positive social support resource, shows the support and care of the organization and life of employees, promotes the growth and progress of employees, and is also conducive to the physical and mental health of employees. The negative impact on employees' self-efficacy and mental health can be alleviated. Self-efficacy can enhance the positive impact of CS on the mental health of employees and alleviate the negative impact of HS on the mental health of employees.</p><p>This is a strong practical inspiration for enterprises in the era of economic innovation. Enterprise development is inseparable from employees. Only when employees are regarded as valuable resources, care for them, support them and recognize their work, employees are more able to cope with the work pressure and maintain personal physical and mental health. The innovative development of the economy today has put forward higher requirements for the work of enterprises and employees. Under the high work requirements, employees can easily feel the work pressure. If employees perceive a high level of organizational support, employees are more likely to effectively complete their work tasks and goals and create good performance for enterprises <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>This paper focuses on the theoretical relationship among work stress, physical and mental health, organizational support and self-efficacy. By using structural equation model, hierarchical linear regression and other methods to analyze the data, this paper makes a response to the theoretical relationship between the above variables: challenging stress has a significant positive impact on employees' mental health, organizational support and self-efficacy have a positive moderating role in it, but no significant impact on employees' physical health; Hindrance stress has a significant negative impact on physical and mental health of employees, and organizational support and self-efficacy have a buffer effect. This result leads us to think about talent management in the environment of economic innovation. Innovation in the sense of economics is more the result of entrepreneurial activities. Entrepreneurs use their insight and personality charm to attract excellent technical talents, so that the accumulation of rich and novel knowledge becomes one of the important sources of enterprise economic innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> . The competitive stress brought by economic innovation is also easy to destroy the physical and mental health of employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> . Therefore, enterprises should pay attention to the stress of employees, use the positive nature of challenging stress to improve their self-efficacy and organizational support, and promote their mental health; It is necessary to alleviate the hindrance stress in time to avoid adverse effects on employees' self-efficacy, organizational support and physical and mental health, so that employees can invest in the enterprise's innovative construction with healthy body and full spirit.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
