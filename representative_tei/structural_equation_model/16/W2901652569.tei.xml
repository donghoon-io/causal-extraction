<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Research on culinary tourism lacks empirical examination of the relationship between motivation, experience, satisfaction and loyalty. Drawing on the extant literature, this paper examines the relationships between antecedents and outcomes of culinary tourist participation in cooking classes using a structural equation modelling approach. Based on a convenience sample of 300 international tourists at cooking schools in Chiang Mai, Thailand, the structural model confirmed direct and indirect interrelationships among four main constructs of the study. It was found that culinary tourists' motivation positively influences both the culinary experience and satisfaction; and that the culinary tourist experience is positively associated with both culinary tourist satisfaction and loyalty, suggesting that the more tourists are motivated to participate in cooking classes, the more experiential value and satisfaction are perceived. Moreover, the more experiences encountered at the cooking class, the more satisfied and loyal the tourists become. Understanding the key motivators and elements of satisfaction in cooking classes can contribute to the achieving of sustainable destination loyalty. The findings are relevant to Destination Management Organisations (DMOs) as part of developing sustainable strategies that are in line with specific culinary needs and experiences of cooking class participants, in order to promote satisfaction and loyalty to food tourism destinations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The broader tourism literature has been replete with discussions and questions of which factors are meaningful in influencing leisure travel decision making and postexperience evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Agyeiwaah, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Caber &amp; Albayrak, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fodness, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Guttentag, Smith, Potwarka, &amp; Havitz, 2017)</ref>. One of the growing considerations for tourists in destination decision is food <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Hu &amp; Ritchie, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Jenkins, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Okumus, Okumus, &amp; McKercher, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Food serves both as a biological necessity and an experiential aspect of destinations' cultural appeal. The food tourism or culinary tourism product, as variously referred, can become an attraction and an impediment to travel <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cohen &amp; Avieli, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Kim, Eves &amp; Scarles, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Torres, 2002)</ref>. Accordingly, food bridges tourism and destinations as a matter of necessity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Björk &amp; Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Nelson, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Okumus,et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Richards, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Richards, , 2015;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Santich, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Scholars have proposed that various aspects of culinary tourism can engineer a positive destination experience and consequently, a more positive overall destination image <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Duarte Alonso, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hjalager &amp; Corigliano, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Pestek &amp; Nikolic, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Quan &amp; Wang, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">, Suntikul, 2017)</ref>. Specifically, the art of cooking is in itself becoming a common tourist attraction across the Western world <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cohen &amp; Avieli, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Jiménez Beltrán, López-Guzmán, &amp; Santa-Cruz, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Mitchell &amp; Hall, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Santich, 2004)</ref>. Some Asian upmarket resorts and hotels as well as small local restaurants are also engaged in this market <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bell, 2015)</ref>. Thus, the current study focuses on cooking classes as a unique niche under food tourism or culinary tourism.</p><p>Cookery schools provide a hands-on experience for tourists seeking novel and exotic destination experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Long, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kivela, &amp; Crotts, 2006)</ref>. They also offer tourists a participatory experience with the opportunity to purchase local ingredients, utensils, and other food processing equipment <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Hjalager, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Walter, 2017)</ref>. It can be contended that not all culinary tourists are motivated by the desire to consume food alone. For some participants, it is more meaningful to engage in the preparation of food, as opposed to simply the consumption. Such meaning emerges because cooking classes offer opportunities to interact with various stakeholders in the local community including residents, retailers, farmers, and service providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Björk &amp; Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Pearson, Henryks, Trott, Jones, Parker, Dumaresq, &amp; Dyball, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>While the potential addition of culinary tourism to destination marketing promotion has been articulated in literature, there remain significant research gaps in this area. First, only few studies have generated theoretical and empirical support for cookery schools as a part of culinary tourism promotion and marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bell, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Wijaya, King, Morrison, &amp; Nguyen, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Okumus et al. (2007)</ref> for example argued that empirical evidence on the extent to which food is marketed by destination is still scarce. As a consequence, there has been a dearth of knowledge among academia and industry on tourists' food-related travel decisions and how these translate into actual travel and destination loyalty.</p><p>Second, although theoretical connectedness exists for tourists' motivation, satisfaction, and future intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agyeiwaah, Adongo, Dimache, &amp; Wondirad, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Caber &amp; Albayrak, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Crompton, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hasegawa, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Hui et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Heung &amp; Quf, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Jang &amp; Feng, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Mak, Lumbers, Eves, &amp; Chang, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Song, Li, van der Veen, &amp; Chen, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Quintal &amp; Polczynski, 2010)</ref>, no study has empirically identified the relationship between motivation, experience, satisfaction and loyalty among tourists participating in cooking classes, nor generally culinary food tourists.</p><p>Emerging studies have nonetheless argued for an understanding of the complex interrelations in tourists' food experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Andersson &amp; Mossberg, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Andersson, Mossberg, &amp; Therkelsen, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Suntikul, 2017)</ref>. Knowledge of this relationship is important because the extent of customer satisfaction is a function of perceived overall experience of the destination, beginning from motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Buhalis, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Jang, &amp; Feng, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hasegawa, 2010)</ref>. Meanwhile, it remains unclear whether the experience of a destination's culinary offerings can be classified as a peak touristic experience that generates destination loyalty.</p><p>Consequently, culinary tourism researchers have only investigated tangential aspects of culinary tourists' experience, image, satisfaction, motivation, and loyalty; or at best between two constructs. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kim, Suh, and Eves (2010)</ref> investigated the influence of food-related personality traits on satisfaction and loyalty; <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Namkung and Jang (2007)</ref> asked whether food quality satisfaction impacted behavioural intentions; and <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Seo et al. (2017)</ref> considered food image and intention to eat. The absence of a thorough connection linking motivation to on-site experiences and post-experience evaluation, including satisfaction and loyalty is a valuable lead for this study. Altogether, this aspect of culinary tourism, and its interrelation with other constructs, has rarely been the focus of researchers.</p><p>Furthermore, culinary tourism research has been dominated by a wide Western bias with the few existing empirical pieces of evidence emerging from Australia, France, and the USA (Duarte Alonso, 2010; <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Mitchell &amp; Hall, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Santich, 2004</ref>).</p><p>Yet Asia is an important tourism region whose culinary uniqueness warrants further research examination. Thailand, for instance, has distinguished itself as a culinary leader due to massive government promotion of Thai food internationally (Tourism Authority of <ref type="bibr">Thailand, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">, Suntikul &amp; Tang, 2014)</ref> but current research examining the Thai culinary strength in the international market is still limited.</p><p>Against this backdrop, the purpose of the present study is to investigate decision making processes of culinary tourists within the context of cooking classes in Thailand. Specifically, the study addresses five research objectives: (1) to examine the motivations of culinary tourists for participating in Thai cooking classes; (2) to examine the effect of motivation on culinary tourists' experience, satisfaction and loyalty; (3) to investigate the influence of culinary tourists' experiences on satisfaction and loyalty; (4) to examine the effect of tourists' satisfaction on loyalty to Thailand as a destination; and (5) to examine the indirect relationships between motivation, experience, satisfaction and loyalty.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interest and growth in the culinary niche</head><p>Food has a manifest presence on the tourist itinerary even where no overt intentions exist. Aside from the obvious importance of food as a means of physiological sustenance, increasing research point to visitors' culinary interest as enhancing their larger destination experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Kim et al., 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Richards (2012)</ref> believes that hospitality can be achieved through the offering of cuisine traditional to the destination visited. Thoughts like Richards' are found among erstwhile researchers who have investigated among other things the influence of food as a destination choice determinant <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cohen &amp; Avieli, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hall &amp; Sharples, 2003)</ref>, destination image and expectation <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Karim &amp; Chi, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Quan &amp; Wang, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Seo et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Smith &amp; Costello, 2009)</ref> and cultural lure <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Allen, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Fields, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hegarty &amp; O'Mahony, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Long, 2004)</ref>. But in order to understand the culture of a particular country, it is important to experience the country's food <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(O'Halloran &amp; Deale, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Suntikul, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Culinary tourism has evolved both in interest and typology. <ref type="bibr">Smith and Xiao (2008, p. 289)</ref> have argued for a demand sided definition of culinary tourism based on "activities of persons rather than as a set of products". The International Culinary Tourism Association (ICTA) however adopts a more inclusive conceptualization of the term as "the pursuit of unique and memorable eating and drinking experiences" <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Wolf, 2006)</ref> with the notion that food is indispensable for life. Arguing against the broad scope of the definition by ICTA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Smith and Xiao (2008)</ref> proposed a mid-point definition between demand and supply, suggesting that such an understanding "recognizes cuisine as part of a tourism experience and as reflective of the locale visited, but without a prerequisite of the exotic or foreign" <ref type="bibr">(Smith &amp; Xiao, 2008, p. 289)</ref>. While distinctions exist between the terms "culinary" and "gastronomy", with the former (.i.e. culinary) emphasizing the 'styles' and the latter (i.e. gastronomy) pertaining to consumption of food and beverage generally <ref type="bibr">(Horng, &amp; Tsai, 2010, p. 75)</ref>, both point to aspects of culinary tourism and are used interchangeably; often without distinction.</p><p>A review of past studies reveal three broad categories of food tourists; the experiential/consumption-driven food tourist <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Fields, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Jolliffe, 2003)</ref>, the observational/'wow-factor' food tourist <ref type="bibr">(Mitchel &amp; Hall, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Quan &amp; Wang, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Park, Reisinger, &amp; Kang, 2008)</ref> and the participatory/'hands-in' food tourist <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Richards, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Santich, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Walter, 2017)</ref>. We depict the above discussion diagrammatically in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Experiential food tourists travel to experience or consume the cuisine of destinations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Types of food tourists</head><p>These consumers are driven by accidental or intentional interests for destination cuisine <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Jolliffe, 2003)</ref>. Observational food tourists are driven by a 'wow-factor'; the desire to be amazed, and are more purposeful towards a specific event, object or place. A particular place, restaurant, and cooking skill of an expert are the main pull factors for such travels <ref type="bibr">(Mitchel &amp; Hall, 2003)</ref>. More recently, a growing sub-group of food tourists who travel for cooking lessons are emerging <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Suntikul, Ng, Ho, Luo, Lam, &amp; Chan, 2015)</ref>. This third group, the participatory culinary tourists, are motivated to learn by participating in indigenous cooking styles and ingredients used. <ref type="bibr">Walter (2017, p. 366)</ref> writes that in Thailand cooking school "tourists do not just eat food, but also learn to identify and shop for raw ingredients in open air markets, to master techniques of preparation and cooking, and to understand many of the cultural beliefs behind Thai foodways". The latter participatory culinary tourist group is of particular interest as it is rarely the focus of previous research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivation for culinary tourism</head><p>The question of what motivates tourists to travel is a fundamental first step to generating an understanding of travel phenomenon, albeit only a few empirical studies have critically surfaced in culinary tourism. Supporting such claims, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Kim and</ref><ref type="bibr">Eves (2012, p. 1458)</ref> argue that "despite an awareness of the need for tourist motivation theories regarding local food experiences, they have not been developed to empirically evaluate tourist motivations to taste local food."</p><p>The importance of culinary art as a motivation for tourism is evident in many regions. In Hong Kong for example, <ref type="bibr">Enright and Newton (2004, p. 784</ref>) note that apart from safety, gastronomy is the second most attractive aspect of visitation (28%); above nightlife, visual appeal, and climate. In many other destinations; Canada, Australia, South Africa, France and so on, the desire for gastronomy is considered more important than visitations to tourists' attractions <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Mitchell &amp; Hall, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Santich, 2004)</ref>. Such strong motivations are also exhibited among people with a strong commitment to food and travel. Even here, not every trip to an eatery constitutes culinary tourism. Echoing the words of <ref type="bibr">Mitchel and Hall (2003, p. 10)</ref>, "the desire to experience a particular type of food or the produce of a specific region or even to taste the dishes of a particular chef must be the major motivation for such travel". While general motives for travellers' interest in food exists, research interests on specific aspects and activities are yet to be developed. There are those tourists with latent interests in specific culinary activities and vice versa. About the former, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Jolliffe (2003)</ref> avers the insufficiency of information.</p><p>While many perspectives of travel motivations exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Crompton, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Dann, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Ross &amp; Iso-Ahola, 1991)</ref>, motivations are broadly grouped into behavioural or cognitive constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(McCabe, 2000)</ref>. The current study address behavioural motivations-which relate to the drive to learn, know, join, or actively partake in the culinary art <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alant &amp; Bruwer, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fodness, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Kim &amp; Eves, 2012)</ref>. Cooking classes as a sub-domain of culinary tourism essentially requires participation.</p><p>Therefore, any motivation to this form of tourism should be examined in the light of tourists' desire to engage in the culinary behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experience as a function of motivation</head><p>While a previous study of <ref type="bibr">Yoon and Usyal (2005)</ref> provides valuable information on the linkages from motivation to loyalty, it appears silent on the experiential aspect of travel to and within destinations. Meanwhile, motivation, ipso facto, has a more direct influence on experience. This important connection has however eluded tourism researchers; yielding few substantive studies. As with the works of <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Huang and Hsu (2009)</ref>, experience has been operationalized as the past or previous experience other than actual experience. While previous experience may influence expectations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Arnould and Price (1993)</ref> cited in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Buhalis (2000)</ref> have argued that the most satisfactory experiences are not constructed on expectations. Rightly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Huang and Hsu (2009)</ref> acknowledge the blur and arguable scope within which experience is operationalized. As stated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Björk and Kauppinen-Räisänen (2016)</ref>, the distinctiveness of tourists' food experiences is related to the fact that these are context driven. In essence, researchers often fail to investigate an actual experience.</p><p>Nonetheless, a few studies provide bases for the theoretical hypothesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Prebensen, Woo, Chen, and Uysal (2013)</ref>, for instance, found that not only does motivation affect tourists' experience, it relates to their level of involvement or engagement. The authors upon such insight recommended an industry recognition of motivation (and involvement) as indispensable to the value chain of tourist memorable experiences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Mitchell and Hall (2003)</ref> reiterate the research by Environmental Planning Group of Canada (EPGC) in 2001 that visitors who are highly interested in wine and cuisine-based holidays had pursued experiences related to this interest. We hypothesize that experience is a direct outcome of motivation.</p><p>Thus, this study posits that: H1= Culinary tourist motivation of cooking class is positively associated with cooking class experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experience and satisfaction</head><p>Research indicates that the outcome of lived experience may result in either positive or negative perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Dubé &amp; Le Bel, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Otoo &amp; Amuquandoh, 2014)</ref>. Visitors' experiences at destinations have largely been used to assess satisfaction with destination encounters via post-purchase constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Truong, &amp; Foster, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bramwell, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Buhalis, 2000)</ref>. By definition, satisfaction sums up pre-travel expectations or motivation and experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Truong, &amp; Foster, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Pizam, Neumann, &amp; Reichel, 1978)</ref>.</p><p>It is axiomatic, even fanciful, to conclude that tourists' positive experience with destination attractions (at least in the traditional sense of a tangible natural or manmade resource) connotes an overall level of satisfaction. There is however evidence to suggest that certain aspects of on-site experiences such as ease and comfort are not in themselves forecasters of optimum satisfaction albeit their absence may result in displeasure <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Ryan, 1994)</ref>. In concurrence with this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Quan and Wang (2004)</ref> illustrate that despite an overall positive tourist experience at attractions, satisfaction of consumers may be ruined should there be negative ancillary consumer experiences. As discussed earlier, food is a major component of destination experience. It therefore stands to reason that displeasure with food experience can adversely affect overall satisfaction with the destination.</p><p>There are scholarly bases pointing to a direct and positive relationship between tourists' experience with food and their disposition towards satisfaction. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Chi, Chua, Othman, and Karim (2013)</ref> found that in Malaysia, tourists' satisfaction with food experience directly and positively influences perceived quality of their culinary experience and behavioural intentions. Using regression model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Namkung and Jang (2007)</ref> also found taste and presentation to be the largest determinants of customer satisfaction and consequently behavioural intentions. Similar findings have been noted in different food settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kim et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adongo, Anuga, &amp; Dayour, 2015)</ref>. Tying these researches together, we anticipate a direct positive influence of experience on satisfaction. Hence, this study posits that: H2 = Culinary tourist experience of cooking class is positively associated with satisfaction of cooking class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influence of motivation on satisfaction</head><p>The hypothesized causal relationships between tourist motivation and satisfaction is examined in tourism literature. Individuals perceive a travel activity as a potential satisfier of an intrinsic need <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Ross &amp; Iso-Ahola, 1991)</ref>. Therefore, an examination of satisfaction should reveal the accomplishment of a tourist's initial set goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Yoon &amp; Uysal, 2005)</ref>. Some researchers have looked at how satisfaction with tourism consumption has been informed by motivations. Applying the expectationdisconfirmation model, <ref type="bibr">Oliver (1980)</ref> is of the persuasion that consumers' develop expectations as a reflection of intrinsic needs prior to consumption of a product.</p><p>Where such expectations are achieved, consumers achieve satisfaction. However, dissatisfaction comes into play as a result of disconfirmation with actual experience.</p><p>Meanwhile, <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Yoon and Uysal (2005)</ref> found that different dimensions of motivations have varying effects on satisfaction with pull motivations negatively influencing satisfaction. In a recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Battour, Ismail, Battor, and Awais (2017)</ref>, different dimensions of motivations were found to positively influence satisfaction.</p><p>Nonetheless, mediating factors between motivation and satisfaction are rarely examined within the food context (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Kim, Kim, &amp; Goh, 2011)</ref>. Given that mediation is relevant to understanding how causal changes in variable relations are transmitted through one or more intervening variables, resulting in direct and indirect effects on an outcome variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Little, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Pearl, 2014)</ref>, examination of mediation is pertinent. Building theoretically from the expectation-disconfirmation theory, satisfaction can only be achieved upon experiencing the reality of the tourism product <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Yüksel &amp; Yüksel, 2001)</ref>. This view stems from the basic definition of satisfaction, which states that satisfaction is a function of the degree of congruence between aspirations and perceived reality of experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Howard &amp; Sheth, 1969</ref><ref type="bibr">, as cited in Yüksel &amp; Yüksel, 2001)</ref>. Thus, because experience translates motivation into actual consumption, it is reasonable to postulate that cooking class experience will positively mediate motivation and satisfaction. To investigate these varying conclusions within the culinary tourists' cooking class experience, the following hypotheses are </p></div>

Although loyalty has broad phases of cognitive, affective, conative and action in the broader consumer behaviour literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Oliver, 1999)</ref>, the concept is often measured by specific conations to repeat visit, repeat purchase, repeat sale and recommendation within the tourism and hospitality literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agyeiwaah et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adongo et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The value of motivational elements to researchers, industry and destinations are logically seen in their connection to overall tourism experience, and ultimately, loyalty.

The authors argued that such linkages could help improve and engineer an understanding of the relationships among these constructs, as well as providing a "solid psychological process" for the development of destination loyalty. However, other studies found that the mediating role of satisfaction better predicts the influence of motivation on loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Lee &amp; Hsu, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yoon &amp; Usyal, 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Battour, Battor and Ismail (2012)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tourist experience and loyalty</head><p>As espoused in previous studies on tourism marketing experience, loyalty is an important construct in destination marketing to achieve long-term viability.

Consequently, it is expected that adverse cooking class experience will result in a lack of interest in this culinary tourism product. Yet, a number of studies have noted that the relationship between tourist experience and tourist loyalty is not necessarily direct <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Cole &amp; Scott, 2004)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study site and target participants</head><p>The study presented in this paper was conducted in Chiang Mai, a principal city of northern Thailand, located 700 km from Bangkok. Chiang Mai is endowed with a stunning natural beauty which has won it the accolade "The Rose of the North". Its renowned traditions are among the unique features of the city which attract many tourists. The city boasts of a range of cooking schools for international tourists seeking to know the culinary culture and traditions of the Thai people (Tourism Authority of Thailand, 2013). For instance, the country remains an iconic leader in its introduction of the "Thai Kitchen of the World" program which constitutes a concerted and coordinated national governmental initiative to promote Thai food <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Chapple-Sokol, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Rockower, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">, Suntikul &amp; Tang, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Suntikul, 2017)</ref>.

These centres are used as medium for spreading Thai culture and way of life to promote creative tourism <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Singsomboon, 2014)</ref>. Consequently, cooking class in Chiang Mai, is a good way to flourish Thai culinary tourism as owners focus on usage of local ingredients, the quality of primary materials, and the preservation of traditional cooking methods and delivering the enjoyment of the end product to tourists (López-Guzmán &amp; Sánchez-Cañizares, 2012). Accordingly, it is for the above reasons that Chiang Mai serves as an appropriate study site for examining cooking motivation, experiences, satisfaction and loyalty. Consequently, the target population of the current study was participants of cooking classes in Chiang Mai, Thailand who were identified individually through 15 cooking schools. Previous studies confirm that participation in cooking classes have gained momentum among international tourists to Thailand <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Singsomboon, 2014)</ref>. For that reason, international tourists were the main target for the current study. In choosing the cooking schools for data collection, criteria for registration with the government was used to facilitate identification and reliability of the food training schools in the region; after which a convenience sampling followed since the approach allows respondents to be selected based on the researcher's convenience <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Saunders et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>As part of conducting SEM, it has been suggested that the key concepts in the model should be conceptually and operationally defined which require clear measurement instruments that have a clear meaning to participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Blunch, 2008)</ref>. Accordingly, having conceptualized the key constructs in the literature section, multi-measurement items were used for each latent construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Churchill, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Hinkin, 1998)</ref> including motivation, experience, satisfaction and loyalty to help operationalize the issues appropriately using a 5-point Likert Scale (1=Strongly disagree to 5 = Strongly agree).</p><p>First of all, it was important to specify motivation measures that focus on cooking class as a behavioural activity which is different from food consumption motivations as found in previous food studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Kim &amp; Eves, 2012)</ref>. Since cooking class is perceived as part of the tourism activity destination, it was important to adopt general travel motivations literature such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fodness (1994)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Yoon and Uysal (2005)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fodness (1994)</ref>, knowledge motivation involves the need to know more about different destinations (e.g. I would like to know more about Thai cuisine); utilitarian reflects the need to join an enjoyable activity by getting away while social-adjustive function reflects the need to learn about the destination through interaction with others. The fourth dimension, value-expressive function reflects the importance of the activity to participants. Given the behavioural-oriented nature of the cooking class, motivation was measured based on four statements using Fodness (1994) functional dimensionality leisure items including knowledge, utilitarian, valueexpressive and social-adjustive. These four motivational components reflect the major drive for engaging in cooking classes in Chiang Mai. Nonetheless, as would be explained later in the principal component analysis (PCA) section of the results, one of the motivation on value-expressive item received poor loading and was as a result omitted to focus on three indicators (.i.e. knowledge, utilitarian and social-adjustive functions) of motivations (𝛼𝛼 = 0.82) that were relevant to participants similar to what has been suggested in the cooking class literature. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Singsomboon (2014)</ref> asserts that knowledge acquisition is an important part of culinary tourism in Thailand as "Cook Book" with basic explanation is created for tourists to use. In terms of utilitarian, tourists are given the chance to be greeted with Thai smiles amid several social interactions at the destinations. Other activities common among international tourists include shopping with tourists at the fresh market, cooking a variety of Thai foods such as Pad Thai and Gang Kiew Wan (green curry).The unique characteristics of the Thai cooking schools in terms of the content could be well explained by the motivational items chosen.</p><p>Given the activity based nature of the cooking class phenomenon, culinary tourist experience was measured based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Pine and Gilmore's (1998)</ref> conceptualization of experience into four domains of education, entertainment, escapism and esthetic. While each domain offers a unique experience at a destination, four statements were used to measure experience with each reflecting the four domains of education, entertainment, escapism and esthetic. Yet in the end, only two main domains (i.e. escapism and esthetic) loaded well at the PCA stage (𝛼𝛼 = 0.78) and were used as the key experiential domains among cooking class participants. For example, two statements focusing on experiences that allow individuals to immerse themselves as different characters (e.g. I felt a different character since I was able to immerse myself more meaningfully in Thai culture through this cooking class) and those that are perceived pleasant to participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Oh, Fiore, &amp; Jeoung, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, satisfaction in the current study was measured based on three items ( 𝛼𝛼 = 0.80) adapted from a number of studies that have examined satisfaction including <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kim et al. (2010)</ref> who measured satisfaction using statements that encapsulate visitors' expectation and overall satisfaction with food and beverage at a specific festival. Based on such existing statements, a modified statement of cooking class expectation and overall satisfaction was used in the current study (e.g. I am satisfied with joining a "must-do" activity as I expected it to be). The final construct loyalty which has received numerous studies in existing literature was measured by two items ( 𝛼𝛼 = 0.69) which mostly include repeat activity and recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Yoon, Lee, &amp; Lee, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Song et al., 2012</ref>). Hence, an example of a statement used to measure this construct include "I would like to join more cooking classes in Thailand again."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection</head><p>Prior to the actual data collection, after pilot testing the instrument on a smaller sample of cooking school participants, a screening question was used to select only international tourists given the dearth of study on international tourists participation in cooking classes in Asian destinations such as Thailand <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cohen &amp; Avieli, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Indeed, cooking classes are mostly attracted to foreigners to Thailand and they were most appropriate for data collection <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Singsomboon, 2014)</ref>. Each of the tourists surveyed was approached based on a convenient sampling procedure in selected cooking schools in Chiang Mai (TripAdvisor, 2018) after a consent was sought from both owners and tourists of the cooking class. Prior to visiting each school for the actual data collection, it was important to ensure that questionnaires are understandable for tourists. In the current study and given that the cooking class teaching medium is English, the original design of the questionnaire in English was appropriate for all international tourists. Consequently, all respondents from England, Germany, United States of America, China, Asian countries excluding China (e.g. Singapore, Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Indonesia) and Australia had a good proficiency in English.</p><p>Having sought owner consent with further tourists consent, the survey instrument (i.e. questionnaire) was personally administered with the help of field research assistants who were assigned to each of the identified schools to obtain a representative sample. Within each school, a convenient number of survey instrument was administered personally to tourists. In administering the questionnaire, all 15 schools were listed in accordance with which one would be collected first. Once a particular school respondents are exhausted, the field work assistants move on to the next cooking schools on the list. This procedure followed until all 15 schools were visited. Overall, 336 questionnaires were sent out to respondents participating in cooking classes in Chiang Mai. One advantage of questionnaire administration is that it allows participants to attend to the instruments based on their own convenience <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Kozak, 2001)</ref> and given the use of research assistants any ambiguity could be easily clarified. The data collection took place over a period of one month within the chosen sites. Of the 336 questionnaires received from respondents, 300 were useful and hence, coded for analysis. While sample sizes play a major role in estimating SEM results, there is no perfect rule for sample size estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Reisinger &amp; Turner, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>For that reason, recommendations have been made in the literature for sizes ranging from 100-200 for SEM analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hoyle, 1995)</ref>. Consequently, the current sample size of 300 was appropriate for SEM analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hair, Black, Babin, &amp; Anderson, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>The IBM SPSS Amos has been variously used in the implementation of data analysis known as structural equation modelling (SEM). The SEM method "includes, as special cases, many well-known conventional techniques, including the general linear model and common factor analysis" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Arbuckle, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">p.1)</ref>. The application of this has gained momentum in tourism research <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Nunkoo, Ramkissoon &amp; Gursoy, 2013)</ref> where it has been variously used to measure and test relationships (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Ko &amp; Stewart, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Dedeoğlu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Liu, 2016)</ref> as well as develop and fit models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Dolan, et al., 1999)</ref>. One advantage of Amos is that it allows testing relationships and fitting of models for two or more groups simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bacon &amp; Bacon, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Prior to hypothesis testing, simple descriptive statistics that sought to analyse the demographic characteristics were computed using the SPSS software (Version 20). It must be emphasized that respondents who participated were tourists who come with either friends or families or alone from diverse countries. While all countries are presented, Asian countries excluding China yielded values that required merging this category as one (.i.e. Asia excluding China). Further principal component analysis was also computed using the SPSS software <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Pallant, 2013)</ref>. The authors analyzed the rest of the data using the IBM SPSS Amos (Version 25) for direct paths (inner and outer models) and indirect path using bootstrapping. While the traditional <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Baron and Kenny (1986)</ref> approach has been used extensively to test mediation, it has been criticized that the use of the Sobel test is low in power in comparison to a bootstrap test <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2004)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Cheung and Lau (2008, p. 300</ref>) reiterate the weakness of Baron and Kenny's approach in the following statements: "Although hierarchical regression models have been commonly used for mediational analysis, they are subject to measurement errors. If the variables are measured with errors, then the significance of the mediation effect is likely to be underestimated because the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable without the mediator is likely to be underestimated…" However, bootstrap "produces a test that is not based on large-sample theory, meaning it can be applied to small samples with more confidence" <ref type="bibr">(Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2004, p. 722)</ref>. For further justification for the use of bootstrap for this study, a preliminary <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Baron and Kenny (1986)</ref> approach was undertaken (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Baron and Kenny's (1986)</ref> approach in testing mediation, there are three steps to follow:</p><p>Step 1: Computing a simple regression analysis between the dependent variable and the independent variable and confirming that the independent variable affects the dependent variable. In case, there is no effect, then mediation is impossible.</p><p>Step 2: Computing a simple regression analysis between the mediator and the independent variable. For this step, the independent variable must affect the mediator.</p><p>Step 3: Computing a multiple regression analysis between the dependent variable, independent variable and the mediator. In this case, the mediator must influence the dependent variable.</p><p>Step 4: It is then expected that if all conditions are met, "the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable must be less in the third step than in the first step" Satisfaction Loyalty Loyalty <ref type="bibr">(Usakli &amp; Baloglu, 2011, p. 124)</ref>. In instances where the inclusion of the mediator in the model nullifies step 1, there is full mediation. If not, mediation is partial or perhaps absent.</p><p>This approach was applied with confirmation that mediation existed, but partially, for all three hypotheses since the effect value of the independent variable on the dependent variable decreases but remains significant when the mediator is included in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, &amp; Tatham 2005)</ref>. For instance, a quick glance at However, the bootstrap approach revealed that one of the mediation effects was not partial but full since the direct path remained insignificant when the model is run together (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>). Thus, while two out of the three mediation models were congruent with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Baron and Kenny's (1986)</ref> approach, one was not (H6). Three explanations are given. The first is the fact that SPSS regression uses Generalized Least Square (GLS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Reis, Stedinger, &amp; Martins, 2005)</ref> whereas AMOS employs a Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Arbuckle, 2010)</ref>. Second, AMOS software runs all models together unlike regression analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Arbuckle, 2010)</ref>. Third, simple regression uses composite variables as against latent variables in AMOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Blunch, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Cheung &amp; Lau, 2008)</ref>. It is argued that the effect when using latent variables is bigger than composite variables since such latent variables exclude errors associated with the measure. For these reasons, it is argued that the MLE is much more reliable and efficient than GLS and for that reason bootstrap using AMOS is chosen for the current study <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to the above, the variance inflation factor (VIF) test was undertaken using regression analysis as a diagnostic test of multi-collinearity recognizing the high correlation of some of the constructs (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). However, the results proved successful with VIF less than 10 indicating no multicollinearity among Given the purpose of the current study that sought to examine and clarify the relationships between antecedents and outcomes of culinary tourist participation in cooking classes using a structural equation modelling approach, only four main variables were of interest (i.e. motivation, experience, satisfaction and loyalty). As a result, there were no control variables as found in previous food tourism literature.</p><p>For instance, previous studies such as those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Kim, Kim, and Goh (2011)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Mason and Paggiaro (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Seo, Yun &amp; Kim (2017)</ref>, and Tsai and Wang (2017) that examined food tourists' behaviour with seemingly related variables argue for the need to understand factors that attract food tourists as well as maintain those tourists across all age, gender, education and country of origin. For example, based on a modified theory of reasoned action, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Kim, Kim, and Goh (2011)</ref>, examined the effect of food tourists' behavior using perceived value and satisfaction on their intention to revisit among a sample of visitors of a food event in the southwestern part of United States with the results that food tourists' intention to revisit could be explained and predicted by the perceived value and satisfaction. While their study had no control variables, the outcomes clarify the factors that explain food tourists' behaviour. The current study follows such similar approaches with no control variables.</p></div>

Given the dominant bachelor degree and vocational level of education, it is perhaps seen that cooking schools are used as skill development centers for those in the food and catering sub-sector of the hospitality industry. Moreover, respondents were predominantly single (40.70%) and are perceived to have ample leisure time to travel around independently than their opposite counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Gronau, 1976)</ref>. First time visitors were in majority (62.70%) as against repeat visitors (37.30%). The countries of origin for respondents were varied including those from Asian countries excluding China such as Singapore, Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Indonesia who were in majority (27.30%). Other countries included England (20.30%), USA (14.0%), China (7.30%), Canada (7.00%), Germany (5.00%) and Australia (4.80%). Other respondents chose not to specify their country of origin (14.3%).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.4">Hypothesis testing of direct paths using Structural Equation Models</head><p>As shown in both Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>, further path analysis was used to evaluate the proposed relationship in the model among variables. The results revealed a significant relationship between latent constructs in the model having passed the model fit test reported earlier (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>). Essentially, five out of six direct hypothesized relationships were significant based on the coefficients that confirmed that motivation of participants was a strong predictor and antecedent of experience (H1) in cooking class (β=.65; p=0.000). Supporting H2, experience was also found to influence satisfaction of participants of cooking class (β=.44; p=0.000) with H3 confirming the hypothesis that motivation is a predictor of satisfaction (β=.32; p=0.000). In addition, three indirect paths were supported both fully and partially as experience was found to partially mediate the relationship between motivation and satisfaction (H4) as both direct and indirect effects were significant (β=.36; p=.001).</p><p>Implying that conceptually motivation explains some variance in satisfaction that is not explained by experience even though experience explains a lot of the variance that motivation explains in satisfaction. This implies that for a given motivation within the cooking class adventure, satisfaction is in part determined through the nature of experience. The direct relationship between motivation and loyalty (H5) was found to be insignificant (β=.05; p=.614) even though the indirect relationship (H6) between motivation and loyalty was significant (β=.56; p=.001) providing support for the full mediation role of satisfaction. Conceptually, the entire amount of variance that motivation explains in loyalty is actually explained through satisfaction and as a result the ability for motivation to yield loyalty could be explained through satisfaction. In the context of cooking class participation, the results imply that being motivated alone to participate in cooking classes does not in itself lead to loyalty unless respondents are satisfied with the cooking class activity. In support of H7, experience was found to influence loyalty (β=.36; p=.002) in addition to a partial mediation (H8) of this relationship by satisfaction (β=.15; p=.001). Finally, the positive relationship between satisfaction and loyalty (H9) was also confirmed (β=.40; p=.000).</p><p>These confirmed relationships provide evidence that experience engages individuals in a personal way <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Pine &amp; Gilmore, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bigne &amp; Andreu, 2004</ref>) such that each individual evaluate their experience based on their motivations for travelling and for that matter the outcome of positive or negative experience is based on the need of the visitor which when met can translate into satisfied respondents.</p><p>Significantly, satisfaction emanates from visitor assessment of how the service rendered meets expectation and also the overall satisfaction of the experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Kim et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agyeiwaah et al., 2016)</ref> such that when there is a positive assessment individually by participants, the intentions to repeat the activity and recommend to other visitors is highly activated through satisfied assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Song et al., 2012)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and conclusion</head><p>Applying previous works on motivation, experiences, satisfaction and loyalty, this study has tested the relationships among the above constructs within the cooking class context where a lacuna of research has been noted <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cohen &amp; Avieli, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hall &amp; Sharples, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Richards, 2012)</ref>. Specifically, the current study contributes to the under-researched topic of international cooking class tourists as part of understanding the complex relationships between their motivations, experiences, satisfaction and loyalty. The study results provide empirical evidence to support eight out of nine of the study's hypotheses, offering significant points for discussion.</p><p>First, culinary tourists' cooking class motivation was noted to influence both experience (H1) and satisfaction (H3) of culinary cooking class tourists. This finding not only enriches the perspectives of previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Battour, et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Mitchell &amp; Hall, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Prebensen, et al., 2013)</ref>, but shows that the more motivated tourists are to engage in cooking classes, the greater their experiences and subsequent satisfaction. Particularly, because motivation for this type of tourism requires behavioural enactment rather than merely cognitive desires <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(McCabe, 2000)</ref>, the active and participatory destination engagement by this set of patrons provides experimental learning and knowledge for participants. Consequently, the outcome of the mediating influence of experience on the relationship between motivation and satisfaction (H4) could only partially be accounted for by the structural model. From these findings, the current study suggests that given that the drive to join cooking classes revolves around the desire to engage in an enjoyable activity, learn and know the destination culture, DMOs and cooking schools seeking to attract more tourists should design and market cooking class products with significant content not only on just learning but also on Thai traditional culture with significant inclusion of extra fun ancillary activities related to the cooking activities. For instance, marketing content emphasizing that, as part of learning how to cook, extra activities such as visiting Thai farms and markets to interact with farmers as well as to have a practical feel of the food ingredients and how they could be properly selected for a particular cuisine can draw such experience-motivated tourists to Thai cooking classes. Moreover, DMOs can develop a chain of attractions by combining cooking schools with other cultural attractions (such as temples and museums) that highlight the roots of Thai food culture.</p><p>In addition to the above findings, motivation was not found to directly influence loyalty (H5), meaning that the ability of DMOs to package a product with learning, culture and enjoyable-based activity to induce travel does not ultimately warrant repurchase intentions unless the actual marketed content of cooking classes is delivered in a manner that meets the tourists' expectations. Certainly, satisfaction becomes a potent mediator (H6) for repeat engagement in the cooking class activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Battour et al. (2012)</ref> similarly found that the overall satisfaction among Muslim tourists fully mediated the relationship between tourist motivation and destination loyalty.This result suggests that DMOs must ensure that attention is given to highquality cooking class service delivery by cooking school owners to meet customer expectations for the viability of this activity. For the most part, we observe that satisfaction plays a necessary role in achieving loyalty to a destination (H9). Similarly, cooking class tourists' experience was found to positively associate with loyalty (H7) indicating the significant role of positive experience in repeat engagement. Yet only a partial association was recorded for satisfaction as a mediator of experience and loyalty (H8) <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Otoo &amp; Amuquandoh, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Quan &amp; Wang, 2004)</ref>. There is a good argument to be made for the marketing and promotion of cooking classes as an aspect of culinary tourism in Thailand. Unlike the observational and experiential culinary tourists who emphasize the "wow-factor" of food destinations and the consumption of food <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Jolliffe, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mitchel &amp; Hall, 2003)</ref>, cooking class culinary tourists are in search of practical skills and experience of local cuisine. While it is usual for culinary tourists to desire the consumption of local cuisine <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cohen &amp; Avieli, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Jolliffe, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Karim &amp; Chi, 2010)</ref>, knowledge, learning by interaction, and joining Thai cooking classes seems more meaningful to cooking class patrons than merely consuming. Certainly, the attractiveness of food tourism destinations transcends consumption alone; the experience and satisfaction of which reinforces destination loyalty. The study thus suggests the need for cooking school owners to market the non-consumption aspect of cooking classes. In addition, the core attainable cooking skills could be promoted by DMOs to prospective tourists since such skill information is currently scarce. In addition, by participating in cooking class activities, certification could be issued as a memorable experience product of this activity by the cooking class owners.</p><p>Many of the exciting experiences surrounding the culinary tourism movement in Asia arise from the fact that such tourism often provides some access to authentic local culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Horng &amp; Tsai, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Suntikul &amp; Tang, 2014)</ref>. Therefore, the inclusion of this niche for promotion of culinary tourism in the Asian region should provide deeper meaning for tourists since understanding a destination's culture, in part, involves the experience of the country's food <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Björk &amp; Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">O'Halloran &amp; Deale, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Suntikul, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Walter, 2017)</ref> Depending on the level of satisfaction, there are positive outcomes of repeating cooking class participation either at the destination or in tourists' country of origin.</p><p>Unlike other tourism products where loyalty is all about returning to the previous product, cooking class culinary tourists could be counted as loyal in a different way when they practice and share the cooking techniques learned in the cooking schools with family and friend in their countries. By repeating such techniques at home, they contribute to the marketing of food products in their own country to those who may not necessarily visit the country of origin of the cuisine. This internal loyalty plays a key role in creating a positive image of the destination in the minds of prospective travelers. Since satisfaction involves assessment of expectation/perception as against performance, projecting an appropriate image is critically linked with a degree of satisfaction, and cooking class products have the potential of being used to show a realistic image of the destination, its food, people and culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Morgan &amp; Pritchard, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Allen, 2017)</ref>. Yet this process could only be initiated among culinary tourists who possess the desire for food-related adventures. Thus, the whole cooking class activity follows a continuous process that begins with the desire to participate and leads to the repetition of those activities.</p><p>Ultimately, the study findings also suggest implications for tourism stakeholders, notable among which are governments, DMOs, private organizations and academics.</p><p>For governments and DMOs, the promotion of cooking classes to tourists adds to its destination tourism inventory. Particularly for Thailand, where culinary tourism is an effective lure for tourists, this inclusion may correspond to greater length of stay and increased tourist spending <ref type="bibr">(Joliffe, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Dodd, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Suntikul, et al., 2015)</ref>. For private organizations such as food enterprises, the prospects of additional income through the organization of cooking classes cannot be overemphasized. Yet for all these institutions, culinary cooking class tourists' motivation, experience, satisfaction, and loyalty are crucial. Given the rather scant existing research, this is an area worthy of further research exploration. Some limitations of this study are worth highlighting. Firstly, additional constructs could have been included during the questionnaire development stage to offer a more sophisticated model, but for the sake of focus and clarity, constructs were limited to concentrate on issues of critical importance to the central goal of the research, to examine the key constructs in travel decision-making among culinary tourists in cooking classes. Given that experience engages individuals in a personal way, future studies can use open-ended question to qualitatively explore participants' experiences. It is also suggested that the moderation effects on the explored variables be examined in future studies of culinary tourists. Finally, other variables could be controlled to illuminate additional relationships not explored in the current paper.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>tourist motivation of cooking class is positively associated with satisfaction of cooking class.
