<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>The coronavirus (COVID-19) disease has spread worldwide, generating intense fear of infection and death that may lead to enduring anxiety. At the same time, quarantine and physical isolation can intensify feelings of dispositional loneliness that, by focusing on thoughts of disconnection from others, can trigger intense anxiety. Anxiety, generated by both fear of COVID-19 and dispositional loneliness, can activate negative expectations and thoughts of death, potentially generating alarming depressive symptoms. However, the anxiety-buffer hypothesis suggests that self-esteem acts as a shield (buffer) against mental health threats -fear and loneliness -thus hampering anxiety and depressive symptoms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The novel coronavirus  is a new severe and potentially mortal disease threatening to infect the entire human population given that there is no prior immunity and not even a well-established cure or vaccine yet <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baud et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>COVID-19 displays a variety of clinical features ranging from asymptomatic presentations (20-50%), fever (&gt;90%), cough (75%), shortness of breath (50%), up to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Byambasuren et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Jiang et al., 2020)</ref>. Categories of people at higher risk of developing severe complications of COVID-19 are older adults and people with previous underlying medical conditions, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Liu et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Armitage and Nellums, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Zheng et al., 2020)</ref>. The contagion occurs from an infected person, even without obvious symptom manifestation, via respiratory droplets that can be inhaled or can land on surfaces which are later in contact with other people.</p><p>Due to its high transmissibility, since December 2019 COVID-19 has been rapidly spreading worldwide causing the current pandemic (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020). Across the world, strict preventive policies were adopted to contain the outbreak of COVID-19 -including social distancing and social isolation. Nevertheless, the magnitude of this pandemic has generated serious concerns about its social and economic consequences both in the short and long-term <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Cerami et al., 2020)</ref>. Thus, COVID-19 represents an epochal economic, physical, and biological threat to everyone's lives.</p><p>Therefore, beyond threatening people's physical conditions, COVID-19 is accompanied by remarkable psychological burdens heavily affecting people's mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Brooks et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Torales et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Wang et al., 2020)</ref>. Similar to other physical diseases, COVID-19 represents a specific dangerous trigger activating a "fight or flight" reaction of (functional) fear focused on illness and death <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Schaller et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Harper et al., 2020)</ref>. The COVID-19 pandemic-related fear also led to counterproductive and detrimental behaviors for the whole society (i.e., demanding unnecessary medical care, excessively protecting against the virus, and overstocking certain supplies) <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Lin, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, fear of illness and death commonly lead to chronic vigilance for potential threats, thus contributing to the development of anxiety (i.e., the anticipation of a feared threat without a stimulus) that is future-oriented, unfocused, diffused, and extended to non-threatening situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barlow, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Harding et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In turn, anxiety might trigger and catalyze depressive symptoms via the activation of processes including persistent preoccupations, negative expectations, thoughts about death (of themselves or significant others), and pervasive pessimism <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Thompson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Starr and Davila, 2012)</ref>. Depressive symptoms include feelings of sadness and loss, a negative view of the self, of the world, and of the future, thought and behavior are slowed down, and positive emotions are absent <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beck, 1979)</ref>. Noteworthy, depressive symptoms spread widely during the COVID-19 pandemic, representing an alarming predictor of suicide-behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(McIntyre and Lee, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Thakur and Jain, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>At the same time, quarantine and physical distancing generated widespread feelings of isolation and lonelinessdespite that fact that human connections were facilitated and granted by the use of communication technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Russell, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Usher et al., 2020)</ref>. Indeed, the dispositional trait of loneliness may have a crucial role in perceiving and amplifying feelings of isolation, thus exacerbating the adverse psychological impact of the outbreak <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Boffo et al., 2012)</ref>. Indeed, dispositional loneliness is characterized by perceived disconnection from others and unpleasant feelings of isolation. Dispositional loneliness activates distressing thinking processes focusing on comparisons between the actual and the desired socio-relational situation. This contributes to the increase of unpleasant feelings and leads to the development of symptoms of anxiety that -in turnlead to depressive symptomatology <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Cacioppo et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cacioppo et al., , 2014;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Santini et al., 2020)</ref>. In other words, by activating (maladaptive) mechanisms and by influencing the brain and behavior, loneliness makes people more susceptible to the onset of anxious and depressive symptoms -thus representing an important risk factor for poor mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Fiese et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Heinrich and Gullone, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Hossain et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Lunn et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Zhou et al., 2020)</ref>, long-term morbidity (i.e., cardiovascular), and mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cacioppo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Leigh-Hunt et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Rico-Uribe et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, both a fear of COVID-19 and dispositional loneliness could be considered as predictors of severe psychological symptoms of anxiety and depression, potentially leading to dismal effects, including extreme life-threatening behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Santini et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Thakur and Jain, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>However, self-esteem -that is the individuals' attitudes, beliefs, and evaluations toward the self -may buffer these adverse patterns. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Becker (1971</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Becker ( , 1973))</ref>, selfesteem is built on deep-rooted personal values derived from a given social, relational, and cultural context, and it is reinforced by social validation and the feeling of being a valuable human being with a meaningful role in society given by meeting the standards of a given culture and worldview <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Pyszczynski et al., 2004)</ref>. More recently, the terror management theory (TMT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Greenberg et al., 1986)</ref> postulated that individuals' awareness of mortality -in this case elicited by COVID-19 -conflicts with the human intrinsic desire for life and tendency to survive, thus generating terrifying fears of death and then anxiety. In this framework, the anxiety-buffer hypothesis (ABH; <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Greenberg et al., 1992)</ref> theorizes that, by reconnecting the individual with an enlarged universe of meanings and values, self-esteem could act as a protecting shield (buffer) against the detrimental psychological effects of life-threats and stressors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aims and Hypotheses</head><p>Considering this background, the present study aimed at testing the anxiety-buffer hypothesis during the COVID-19 pandemic. More in detail, self-esteem should buffer the relationships from both a fear of COVID-19 and dispositional loneliness to anxiety symptoms -that in turn lead to depressive symptoms. Moreover, specific hypotheses about each path (relationship) between variables were formulated: H1: fear of COVID-19 and dispositional loneliness are positively associated with depressive symptomatology; H2a: fear of COVID-19 predicts depressive symptomatology through anxiety symptoms (simple mediation) -without considering the buffering effect of self-esteem; H2b: dispositional loneliness predicts depressive symptomatology through anxiety (simple mediation)without considering the buffering effect of self-esteem; H3: fear of COVID-19 and dispositional loneliness predict depressive symptomatology through anxiety symptoms (mediation) -without considering the buffering effect of self-esteem; H4: fear of COVID-19 and dispositional loneliness predict depressive symptoms through self-esteem (buffering effect) and anxiety symptoms (multiple mediation).</p><p>In other words, it was hypothesized that a fear of COVID-19 and loneliness are associated with depressive symptomatology, but this relationship should be mediated by both anxiety and self-esteem. In particular, self-esteem should play a buffering role.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>An online survey was developed and disseminated using the Qualtrics software for data collection.</p><p>Firstly, the survey was administered to 20 participants -not included into analysis (A) to ensure whether the items were understandable by the general population and (B) to estimate an acceptable time for its fulfillment (8'-20'), so as to deal adequately with potentially biased responses: too fast -random answersor too slow -in which the subject could have been interrupted during the completion.</p><p>Then, the snowball sampling method <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Fricker, 2008)</ref> was used to recruit participants from the general population through personal invitations or materials advertised via social media platforms (i.e., Facebook, Twitter).</p><p>The recruitment materials provided details of what was required for participation in the study and a weblink to access the online questionnaire. The weblink directed potential participants first to further information on the research project in order to make an informed decision about study participation. Participants were informed that their responses were anonymous as well as that no economic payment was offered for their voluntary participation. Those who provided their consent online proceeded to the online questionnaire.</p><p>Inclusion criteria for the participants into the study were: (A) being a native Italian speaker; (B) being over 18 years old; and (C) providing informed consent. We excluded participants from the study who: (D) did not answer all the questions in the survey and (E) spent less than 8 min or more than 20 min completing the survey.</p><p>Data were collected in their entirety in a single week interval during the Italian quarantine to avoid confounding effects due to pandemic fluctuations. The study was approved by the Ethic Committee of the University of Padua in accordance with the Ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Size Determination</head><p>Considering the statistical analyses used in this study (see designated section), the sample size was calculated a priori according to the "n:q criterion": where n is the number of participants and q is the number of (free) model parameters to be estimated <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Hu and Bentler, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Muthén and Asparouhov, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Yu, 2002)</ref>. Consequently, ten subject per free parameter (10:73; n minimum = 730) were guaranteed <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bentler and Chou, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Marsh et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Hu and Bentler, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Boomsma and Hoogland, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Muthén and Asparouhov, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Yu, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Flora and Curran, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Tomarken and Waller, 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>According to the inclusion criteria, 62 respondents were excluded from the study due to incomplete surveys (n = 35) and inappropriate completion times (n = 27).</p><p>The final sample was composed by 1200 participants [217 males (23.3%) and 713 females (76.7%), aged from 18 to 81 years (mean = 39.59, SD = 12.334)], the average time competing the survey was 11'0.27" (SD = 3'0.02"). A total of 965 respondents were from Northern Italy (80.4%), 165 were from central Italy (13.8%), and 70 participants were from Southern Italy and the islands (5.8%). Descriptive statistics of this sample are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Socio-demographic information included sex, age, education, employment, Italian region of residence, number of persons living with, and confirmed positive COVID-19 diagnosis of the respondent and of his/her significant others.  In addition, the following self-report measures were administered.</p></div>

Respondents are asked to indicate their degree of agreement to each statement on a 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging from 1 = "strongly disagree" to 5 = "strongly agree") that provides a single-factor structure. Higher values indicate greater fear of COVID-19. In this study, the FCV-19S showed a high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.881).</p></div>

In addition, a general dimension of "dispositional" loneliness is assumed.</p><p>Respondents are asked to rate how often they feel the way described by each sentence on a 4-point Likert-type scale (ranging from 1 = "never" to 4 = "always"). Higher values indicate the presence of a greater feeling of loneliness. In this study, the UCLA-LS3 showed a high internal consistency for each dimension (A -Isolation: Cronbach's alpha = 0.805; B -Relational connectedness: Cronbach's alpha = 0.822; C -Trait loneliness: Cronbach's alpha = 0.869) and for the general dimension (Cronbach's alpha = 0.913).</p></div>

It consists of 10 positively and negatively worded statements evaluating feelings about one's self. Respondents are asked to express their degree of agreement to each statement on a 4-point Likert-type scale (ranging from 1 = "not at all" to 4 = "always"), and it provides a single-factor structure. Higher values indicate a greater sense of global self-esteem. In the present sample, the RSE showed a high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.869).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Recently, the potential negative impact that the adverse psychological consequences of COVID-19 further had on the disease itself have been highlighted in the literature (Center for Disease <ref type="bibr">Control and Prevention, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Lima et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Parola, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Parola et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Thakur and Jain, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Wind et al., 2020)</ref>. Indeed, the advent of COVID-19 generated intense fear and anxiety about contagion, disease, and thoughts of death in the general population. At the same time, the sense of isolation was amplified by dispositional loneliness during the COVID-19 lockdown, with a consequent increase of anxiety symptoms. Therefore, both a fear of COVID-19 and dispositional loneliness represent major risk factors for the development of symptoms of anxiety and following symptoms of depression.</p><p>This study highlighted the buffering-effect of self-esteem on the relationships between negative psychological constructs, such as a fear of COVID-19 and dispositional loneliness feelings (predictors), and their consequent adverse psychological correlates -anxiety and depression (outcomes) during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>In line with the scientific literature showing that (prolonged) fear can lead to depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bowman, 2001)</ref>, this study revealed that a fear of COVID-19 and loneliness might lead to depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Santini et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Thakur and Jain, 2020)</ref>. Indeed, the first model that has been tested (Model 1 -predictors only) showed a positive relationship between a fear of COVID-19 and depressive symptomatology, with higher fear predicting higher depressive symptomatology. Indeed, when controlling for loneliness, an increase of 1 point in fear of COVID-19 was associated with an increase of 0.537 points in depression. At the same time, loneliness was positively associated with depressive symptoms: an increase in 1 point in dispositional loneliness was associated with an increase of 0.932 points in depression. These results suggest that a prolonged state of fear and dispositional feelings of loneliness might lead to the development of adverse psychological symptoms -thus representing major risk factors for the onset of symptoms of depression.</p><p>However, when controlling for anxiety activation (Model 3), fear (of COVID-19) and depression showed a negative association, probably due to the different nature of these emotional states. Indeed, on one hand, fear represents an activating emotion prompting the organism to react with the well-known "fight or flight" response. On the other hand, depression is characterized by a generalized de-activation, reflected in slowed-down behavior and thinking as well as flattened affectivity and pleasure <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beck, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Harper et al., 2020)</ref>. At the same time, fear was positively strongly associated with anxiety symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barlow, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Harding et al., 2008)</ref>, which might lead to depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bowman, 2001)</ref> -thus suggesting a partially mediated model starting from fear up to depression through anxiety.</p><p>Simultaneously -when controlling for anxiety -dispositional loneliness was positively associated with depressive symptoms, further highlighting the existence of a strong relationship between these two constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cacioppo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Santini et al., 2020)</ref>. Also, dispositional loneliness was positively associated with anxiety symptoms leading to depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Thompson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Starr and Davila, 2012)</ref> -suggesting, a partially mediated model (Model 3).</p><p>However, in line with the hypotheses, the final model (Model 4) highlighted the buffering role of self-esteem: despite positive associations held between fear of COVID-19, dispositional loneliness, and anxiety, the effect of self-esteem slowed down these negative adverse paths. Indeed -in line with the ABH and the TMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Greenberg et al., 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Greenberg et al., , 1992</ref>) -self-esteem had negative relationships with all the other psychological constructs (negative β values) due to its buffering effect hampering the relationships between adverse psychological variables. A partial mediation model was, therefore, suggested given that the relationship between fear of COVID-19, dispositional loneliness, anxiety, and depression held even when their paths were buffered by self-esteem.</p><p>Summarizing, results showed that self-esteem had a buffer effect protecting against anxiety symptoms triggered by a fear of COVID-19 and dispositional loneliness. Thus, these findings confirmed the validity of the ABH in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Results also highlighted that both a fear of COVID-19 and dispositional loneliness were able to trigger unbearable feelings of anxiety that, in turn, were strongly linked to depressive symptomatology.</p><p>The strict interconnection between self-esteem and loneliness was probably due to the fact that loneliness is often related to negative self-evaluations, and feelings of being worthless, inferior, or unlovable <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Heinrich and Gullone, 2006)</ref>.

Indeed, according to the ABH, if self-esteem provides protection against stressors, such sources of stress should increase the need for self-esteem to relieve psychological burden <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Harmon-Jones et al., 1997)</ref>. Consequently, increased self-esteem should function as a buffer toward anxiety, reducing the adverse psychological issues in response to threats or stressors. Thus, psychological interventions targeting self-esteem can represent an effective strategy to attenuate the distressing psychological responses to COVID-19 fear and dispositional feelings of loneliness -particularly among populations most susceptible and vulnerable to the negative psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including people with psychiatric disorders, those at risk of domestic violence, elderly people, and health-care practitioners <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Lai et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Armitage and Nellums, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Yao et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, given that loneliness derives from the perceived discrepancy between the actual and desired quality of relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Peplau and Perlman, 1982)</ref>, these results highlight the importance of perceived social support and positive relationships for people <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Ratti et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Panzeri et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Duan and Zhu, 2020)</ref>.

However, due to the small male sample size, multi-group mediation analyses would not be able to provide an accurate estimation of model parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Hoyle, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Kline, 2016)</ref>. Future studies should, therefore, further test potential effects of sex on the suggested models. Moreover, all participants were Italian and possible effects of cross-cultural differences cannot be considered. Even though the ABH was successfully replicated in various countries as well as in different contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Pyszczynski et al., 2004)</ref>, future studies specifically examining the impact of COVID-19 on people's lives should compare these results among different countries thus increasing the generalizability of these findings.</p><p>Finally, a mediation model was preferred to a moderation one for both theoretical and statistical reasons. Indeed, from a theoretical perspective a mediation-based approach is closer and more related to the original ABH and the TMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Greenberg et al., 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Greenberg et al., , 1992))</ref>, conceptualizing self-esteem as an intermediating buffer between life-threatening stressors and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Pyszczynski et al., 2004)</ref>. In fact, self-esteem not only is able to influence individuals' levels of anxiety and depression, but it is itself influenced by negative psychological experiences -such as fear and loneliness -activating negative cognitions and emotions that significantly affect the idea of oneself <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Greenberg et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Heinrich and Gullone, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Sowislo and Orth, 2013)</ref>. Research show that fear can threaten self-evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Greenberg et al., 1986)</ref>, and that people experiencing higher feelings of loneliness also have a worse self-evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Heinrich and Gullone, 2006)</ref>. More in detail, negative experiences can activate both negative cognitions and emotions that significantly affect the idea of oneself (i.e., "I am a failure", "I am worthless") <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beck, 1979)</ref> -thus, leaving scars in the self-concept, as well as persistently threatening and reducing self-esteem and selfefficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Mannarini, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Sowislo and Orth, 2013)</ref>. Thus, a moderation approach would not suit the theoretical background of this study, and would not allow us to properly take into account the complexity of relationships among the considered psychological constructs. Regarding the strengths of the present study, it relies on a well-grounded theoretical basis supported by several experimental and longitudinal studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Greenberg et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Brage and Meredith, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Pyszczynski et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Heinrich and Gullone, 2006)</ref>.

Moreover, the hypothesized models resulted in having a good fit, even if other solutions would have been possible but with lower fit indexes.</p><p>Given that individuals faced similar problems during past epidemics, findings from this study could also be generalized and applied to support people still coping with the negative consequences that previous disease outbreaks had on their mood (i.e., Ebola, SARS, MERS, and tuberculosis) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Brown and Lees-Haley, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Betancourt et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Huremović, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Chew et al., 2020)</ref>.
