<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Statistical mediation analysis is, in a nutshell, about quantifying the indirect effect of an independent variable (X) on the dependent variable (Y) through a third variable called the mediator (M). Examining indirect effects (in addition to direct effects) has been an increasingly popular approach adopted by scholars in the social sciences. One major factor that has facilitated this adoption is the readily available statistical packages developed for this purpose.</p><p>Many of these packages are programmed by the users of different statistical software themselves. Two such packages available through Stata are sgmediation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ender, 2012)</ref> and medeff <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hicks and Tingley, 2012)</ref>. Another package (a macro) implemented in SAS and SPSS is process <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Hayes, 2012)</ref>. One final contribution is the R package mediation developed for conducting mediation analysis. While these packages are all very useful, there was still a need for a package enabling mediation analysis within the framework of structural equation modelling (SEM).</p><p>More specifically, we needed a package which could estimate all the regression models simultaneously (as opposed to the traditional series of sequential regression analyses) including observed or/and latent variables (as opposed to models including only observed variables). In this paper, I would like to present the medsem command (developed using Stata's programming language) which does exactly this task. This is a post estimation command typed in after the estimation of a mediation model using the Stata's built-in sem command for SEM.</p><p>The paper is structured in the following way. First, in the subsequent Section 2, mediation analysis is defined and explained based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baron and Kenny's (1986)</ref> approach including the two procedures based upon which the medsem command is programmed. In Section 3, applications of two relatively simple and a rather complex mediational model are presented to demonstrate the performance of the medsem command. Finally, in the conclusion section, the benefits, limitations, as well as future development possibilities associated with the command, are mentioned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Mediation analysis</head><p>Social scientists typically adopt <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baron and Kenny's (1986)</ref> approach (from here on referred to as BK approach) explained also recently elsewhere by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kenny (2016)</ref> to conduct a mediation analysis. The BK approach consists of four distinct steps to be followed in establishing complete mediation. These steps are explained below and accordingly shown diagrammatically in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Step 1: Regress Y on X to estimate path c, which must be statistically significant implying that there is an effect to be mediated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(a)). 0 . Y c X β ε = + + (1)</formula><p>Step 2: Regress M on X to estimate path a, which must be statistically significant providing evidence of a relationship between the independent and mediator variable (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(b)). 0 . M a X β ε = + + (2)</formula><p>Step 3: Regress Y on M (by controlling for X) to estimate path b, which must be statistically significant. X is controlled for as Y and M may be correlated because X causes both (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(c)). This estimation provides us with path c′ as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>0</head><p>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Y b M cX</head><formula xml:id="formula_2">β ε ′ = + + + (3)</formula><p>Step 4: Path c′ must be zero, 1 a situation indicating that the magnitude of path c′ is reduced to zero after controlling for the mediator.</p><p>If all the four steps above are met, then one can claim that M completely mediates the relationship between X and Y. However, if the first three steps are met but the step 4 is not met, one can assert that M partially mediates the relationship. Partial mediation here implies a reduction in path c, which according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baron and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kenny (1986, p.1176</ref>) is more realistic to encounter. The question that arises then is how big this reduction (c -c′) should be to claim that there exists a partial mediation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jose, 2013)</ref>. The BK approach is thus commonly followed by the Sobel's (1987) z-test 2 testing the statistical significance of this reduction using the following formula providing us with the standard error 3 of c -c′. Since testing the reduction is equivalent to testing the mediated path (a * b), the numerator includes the latter <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Iacobucci et al., 2007)</ref>. s (standard error of b) come from step 3 of the BK approach described above. If z &gt; ±1.96, then the mediation (c -c′ or a * b) is statistically significant at 0.05. This final procedure completes the BK approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Modifying the BK approach</head><p>The original BK approach suggests that one estimates the first three steps separately using the regression technique. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Iacobucci et al. (2007)</ref> have however through a series of Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that using the regression (REG) technique suffers from a serious drawback (even in the simplest mediation model including X, M and Y) when compared with the SEM technique. Their simulations show that the REG technique consistently produces larger standard errors for the path coefficients than does the SEM technique (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) as a result of the fact that the latter estimates all the model parameters simultaneously. A further advantage of the SEM technique is that it inherently can facilitate mediation analysis including multi-item scales (also referred to as latent variables). 4 The conclusion is then that the SEM technique should be the standard framework for conducting mediation analysis.</p><p>Consequently, <ref type="bibr">Iacobucci et al. (2007, p.153)</ref>, by modifying the BK approach, propose a series of steps for conducting mediation analysis via SEM.</p><p>Step 1: Fit one model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(d)</ref>) via SEM so the direct and indirect paths are fit simultaneously so as to estimate either effect while partialling out, or statistically controlling for, the other.</p><p>a If either one is not significant (or both are not significant) there is no mediation and the researcher should stop.</p><p>b Some mediation is indicated when both X → M and M → Y coefficients are significant and the researcher goes to the next step.</p><p>Step 2: Compute the Sobel's z to test explicitly the relative sizes of the indirect (mediated) vs. direct paths. Conclusions hold as follows:</p><p>a If the z is significant and the direct path X → Y is not, the mediation is complete.</p><p>b If both the z and the direct path X → Y are significant, the mediation is partial.</p><p>c If the z is not significant but the direct path X → Y is, the mediation is partial in the presence of a direct effect.</p><p>d If neither the z nor the direct path X → Y are significant, the mediation is partial in the absence of a direct effect.</p><p>Step 3: The researcher can report the results:</p><p>a Categorically: 'no', 'partial' or 'full' mediation. The authors caution that the differences in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> are admittedly small, so researchers might think they could defensibly use the REG technique. However, the differences are systematic, thus the SEM technique consistently will be more powerful in detecting a mediation result when it is present in the population. Source: <ref type="bibr">Iacobucci et al. (2007, p.144)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Alternative to the BK approach</head><p>Zhao et al. ( <ref type="formula">2010</ref>) do agree with <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Iacobucci et al. (2007)</ref> that the SEM technique is an optimal framework for conducting mediation analysis. They, however, go a step further and suggest the BK approach (i.e., three regression estimations + Sobel's test) be replaced with only one test: the bootstrap test of the indirect effect a * b (paths shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(d)</ref>). They argue that to establish mediation, all that matter is that the indirect effect is statistically significant based on the bootstrap test (p.204). Based on this reasoning, the following steps are recommended by the authors for testing mediation hypotheses.</p><p>Step 1: If neither the bootstrap test of the indirect effect (a * b) nor the X → Y coefficient (c) is significant, then there is no effect non-mediation (i.e., no mediation).</p><p>Step 2: If the bootstrap test of the indirect effect (a * b) is not significant but X → Y coefficient (c) is significant, then there is direct-only non-mediation (i.e., no mediation).</p><p>Step 3: If the bootstrap test of the indirect effect (a * b) is significant and X → Y coefficient (c) is not significant, then there is indirect-only mediation (i.e., full mediation).</p><p>Step 4: If both the bootstrap test of the indirect effect (a * b) and X → Y coefficient (c) are significant and their coefficients point in the same direction, then there is complementary mediation (i.e., partial mediation).</p><p>Step 5: If both the bootstrap test of the indirect effect (a * b) and X → Y coefficient (c) are significant and their coefficients point in opposite direction, then there is competitive mediation (i.e., partial mediation).</p><p>The reason why Zhao et al. ( <ref type="formula">2010</ref>) categorically suggest the use of the bootstrap test of indirect effects is due to the fact that the Sobel's test has low power because it by default uses a normal approximation presuming a symmetric distribution when the sampling distribution of a * b is known to be highly skewed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kenny, 2016)</ref>. This is still the case even when a and b per se are normally distributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Jose, 2013)</ref> as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>Bootstrapping is a technique of generating an empirical sampling distribution of a statistic (which in our case is the mediated/indirect effect). This empirical distribution comes about by computing and collecting the indirect effects from each of the n samples 5 (e.g., 1000, 2000, 3000 etc.) drawn with replacement from the original sample data (see Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). From this bootstrap/empirical distribution, the standard error and accordingly a confidence interval 6 are obtained to test the statistical significance of the indirect effect. As used for significance testing of any regression coefficient, the rule is that if the confidence interval of the indirect effect does not include the value of zero one can conclude that the indirect effect is statistically significant.</p><p>Although bootstrapping the indirect effect (a * b) to obtain the standard error of its sampling distribution is certainly a better option than the Sobel counterpart, it is, however, a time-consuming estimation procedure and thus not a very practical option for researchers. A good alternative procedure to bootstrapping is the Monte Carlo approach to testing of the indirect effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Jose, 2013)</ref>. This procedure starts with the two coefficients a and b and their respective standard errors based upon which random normal variables 7 for a and b are generated to create a distribution of a * b value <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kenny, 2016)</ref>. Then, as in the case of bootstrapping, the standard errors and accordingly a confidence interval can be computed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Effect size of the mediation</head><p>One way of determining the effect size of an indirect effect is to examine the completely standardised coefficient. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kenny (2016)</ref>, a small effect size would be 0.01, a medium effect would be 0.09, and a large effect would be 0.25. He further notes that if X is a dichotomous variable, the effect size would resemble Cohen's d and thus a small effect size would be 0.02, a medium effect would be 0.15, and a large effect would be 0.40.</p><p>A second way of gauging the effect size of an indirect effect is to take the ratio of the indirect effect to the total effect (RIT) reflected by the formula below.</p><p>( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">* RIT . * a b a b c = +<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Say for instance that the figure obtained from equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">5</ref>) is about 0.40. We can then interpret this as that a mediated effect explains 40% of the total effect of the independent variable (X) on a dependent variable (Y) or that 40% of the effect of the independent variable (X) on (Y) is mediated by the mediator variable (M) (see <ref type="bibr">MacKinnon, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In cases in which the mediated effect and direct effect have opposite signs, a remedying option is to take the absolute values of the quantities to go into equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">5</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alwin and Hauser, 1975)</ref>.</p><p>A third and final measure to use to evaluate the effect size of an indirect effect is to take the ratio of the indirect effect to the direct effect (RID) as shown in the following formula.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">* RID . a b c = (6)</formula><p>Suppose that the number resulting from equation ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) is about 2. The researcher can then interpret this as that the mediated effect is about 2 times as large as the direct effect <ref type="bibr">(MacKinnon, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>3 The medsem package medsem is a post-estimation command that is run after estimating a mediation model using the built-in sem command of Stata for SEM. In the following, the syntax is explicated and then put to work through some applications. medsem can readily be installed from the statistical software components (SSC) archive by typing 8 ssc install medsem, replace The independent variable (X) will be the varname for indep, the mediator variable (M) will be the varname for med, and dependent variable (Y) will be the varname for dep.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Examples of mediation analysis using medsem</head><p>This section will include some examples of the application of medsem using Stata's example datasets that can be obtained within Stata.</p><p>Example 1: A single mediator with observed variables sysuse nlsw88, clear describe age ttl_exp wage</p><p>The mediational hypothesis here is that ttl_exp (M) will mediate the relationship between age (X) and wage (Y). Diagrammatically, this model is equivalent to the one illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(d). Before using the medsem command we need to estimate the whole mediation model using the sem 9 command as follows.</p><p>sem(ttl_exp &lt;-age)(wage &lt;-ttl_exp age)</p><p>The sem command will provide us with the output (some parts are omitted) below in which we can observe the path coefficients on a (X → M), b (M → Y) and c (X → Y).</p><p>Based on the above estimation, we can use the medsem command to test the mediational hypothesis. The command and the output it produces are shown below respectively. The mediational hypothesis in this example is that that the latent variable Alien67 (M) will mediate the relationship between the latent variable SES (X) and the latent variable Alien71 (Y). Diagrammatically, this model is also equivalent to the one illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(d)</ref>. Prior to using the medsem command, as usual, we estimate the mediation model using the sem command first.</p><p>As you see in the above output, the coefficients provided are the standardised ones. Furthermore, we get both RIT and RID values added to the default output. The mediational hypothesis in this example is that the latent variable Appearance will mediate the relationship between the latent variable Attractive and the latent variables Muscle and Weight as well as the relationship between the observed variable age and the latent variables muscle and weight. Due to its complexity, we also provide a diagrammatical representation of this model in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Prior to using the medsem command, we estimate the mediation model using the sem command first. The sem command will provide us with the output (some parts are omitted) below in which we can observe the path coefficients at the top.</p><p>Let us now use the medsem command to test the four mediational hypotheses. medsem, indep(Attractive) med(Appearance) dep(Muscle) stand</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>One of the primary benefits of medsem is that it can contribute to estimating mediational models in an optimal way using the structural equation framework as well as doing the analysis more properly and completely than it typically has been done. 11 Since medsem is based on the estimations from the sem command of Stata, its second benefit is that it can facilitate mediational analysis using observed or latent variables as well as combinations of observed and latent variables. 12 A third benefit is that medsem can enable the researcher to test several mediational hypotheses within a single complex model (i.e., multiple X, M, and Y variables). This is partly facilitated by the postestimation command (estat teffects) of sem in Stata in that the total indirect effect through all the mediator variables are computed. However, medsem provides indirect effects via each mediator variable separately as well as the associated Sobel and Monte Carlo tests. As such, in a sense, medsem supplements the estat teffects command of Stata. Finally and hopefully, medsem can prove to be a useful pedagogical tool for teaching mediation analysis.</p><p>One reminder when using the medsem command is that any mediational model should include the links not only from X → M → Y but also the link X → Y in a structural equation model as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(d)</ref>. The author, is however, considering developing the current package in the next version in such a way to allow for mediational hypothesis test without the additional requirement of the X → Y link. Another reminder is that medsem works as a post-estimation command after the sem command built for estimating SEM models including continuous outcome variables. The author considers developing a similar package that can be used as a post-estimation command that can be used after the gsem command used for fitting categorical outcome variables.  <ref type="formula">4</ref>). 4 Taking the means/sums of multi-item scales and thereafter using the REG technique to estimate a mediation model with these aggregated means will lead to inaccurate estimates due to the measurement error contained in the items (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Keith, 2006)</ref> in addition to the already mentioned larger standard errors due to separately estimated models. 5 Each sample drawn from the original sample must be the same size as that of the original sample. 6 If the bootstrap/empirical distribution is not a normal one, an alternative confidence interval (i.e., BCa) is suggested to be computed instead of the normal confidence interval and percentile confidence interval <ref type="bibr">(Moore et al., 2009)</ref>. 7 If a and b are correlated, variables for a and b can be generated from random bivariate normal distribution. 8 The package will be made available at SSC after the review process is complete. For the reviewers, the package is available through the ado-file named medsem. The help file is also submitted to the journal. 9 For more about sem type in help sem in Stata.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Diagrammatic representation of statistical mediation analysis</figDesc><graphic coords="3,119.10,148.44,355.74,200.16" type="bitmap" /></figure>
