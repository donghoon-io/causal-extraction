<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Latent variable modelling has become increasingly popular in medical research. By latent variable model we mean any model that includes unobserved random variables which can alternatively be thought of as random parameters. Examples include factor, item response, latent class, structural equation, mixed effects and frailty models.</p><p>Areas of application include longitudinal analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> , survival analysis 2 , meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , disease mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , biometrical genetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , measurement of constructs such as quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , diagnostic testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , capture-recapture models <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , covariate measurement error models <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and joint models for longitudinal data and dropout. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Starting at the beginning of the 20th century, ground breaking work on latent variable modelling took place in psychometrics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> The utility of these models in medical research has only quite recently been recognized and it is perhaps not surprising that medical statisticians tend to be unaware of the early, and indeed contemporary, psychometric literature.</p><p>In this paper we review classical latent variable models, namely common factor models and structural equation models (with continuous observed and continuous latent 6 S Rabe-Hesketh and A Skrondal variables), item response models (with categorical observed and continuous latent variables) and latent class models (with categorical observed and categorical latent variables) and demonstrate their usefulness in medical research using real data. We focus on classical latent variable models for several reasons: 1) the classical models can be fruitfully applied in medical research without modifications, 2) familiarity with classical latent variable models can help standardize terminology and thereby facilitate communication and perhaps more importantly, prevent misguided applications, 3) familiarity can reduce the risk of 'reinventing the wheel' and wasting resources on developing programs for problems that can be readily handled by standard software and 4) the classical models are important because they typically serve as building blocks for more advanced latent variable models. Although we consider mixed effects models <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> to be latent variable models, we do not include them here since they are so well known in medical statistics.</p><p>The plan of the paper is as follows. In Sections 2-5, we introduce classical latent variable models. In each of these sections we present examples using real data, mention common uses of the models in medical research and recommend further reading. Finally, we close the paper with some remarks regarding recent developments. A brief overview of useful software for latent variable modelling is given in an appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Common factor models 2.1 Unidimensional factor models</head><p>Consider j = 1, . . . , N independent subjects. The classical measurement model from psychometric test theory, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> also called the parallel measurement model, assumes that repeated measurements y ij of the same true score β + η j for subject j are conditionally independent given η j with conditional expectation β + η j ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y ij = β + η j + ij , E(η j ) = 0, E( ij ) = 0, Cov(η j , ij ) = 0,</formula><p>where β is the population mean true score, η j are independently distributed random deviations of subjects' true scores from the population mean with variance ψ and ij are independently distributed measurement errors with constant variance θ. The corresponding standard deviation √ θ is called the standard error of measurement. This model is appropriate if the repeated measurements are exchangeable. However, if y ij are not merely replicates, but measurements using different instruments or raters i, it is likely that the instruments or raters use different scale origins and units. This situation is accommodated by the so-called congeneric measurement model 17</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y ij = β i + λ i η j + ij ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where the measure-specific mean, scale and measurement error variance are given by β i , λ i and θ ii , respectively. The reliability ρ i , the fraction of true score variance to total variance, for a particular instrument i becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ρ i ≡ (λ i ) 2 ψ (λ i ) 2 ψ + θ ii</formula><p>Without any parameter constraints the model is not identified (several sets of parameter values can produce the same probability distribution) because multiplying the standard deviation √ ψ of the common factor by an arbitrary positive constant can be counteracted by dividing all factor loadings by the same constant. Identification is achieved either by anchoring, where the first factor loading is fixed to one, λ 1 = 1, or by factor standardization, where the factor variance is set to one, ψ = 1.</p><p>There are several important special cases of the congeneric measurement model. The essentially tau-equivalent measurement model is obtained if the scales of the instruments are identical λ i = 1, the tau-equivalent measurement model if λ i = 1 and the origins are identical β i = β, and the parallel measurement model if λ i = 1, β i = β and the measurement error variances are identical θ ii = θ.</p><p>It should be noted that the congeneric measurement model is a unidimensional factor model with factor loading λ i , common factor η j and unique factors ij for indicators y ij . Spearman 11 introduced this model, arguing that intelligence is composed of a general factor, common to all subdomains such as mathematics, music, etc., and specific factors for each of the subdomains. The common factor can represent any hypothetical construct, a concept that cannot even in principle be directly observed, intelligence and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> being prominent examples. In this case the measures i are typically questions or items of a questionnaire or structured interview.</p><p>The expectation of the vector of responses y j = (y 1j , . . . , y nj ) for subject j is β = (β 1 , . . . , β n ) and the model-implied covariance matrix, called the factor structure, becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">≡ Cov(y j ) = ψ + ,<label>( 2 )</label></formula><p>where = (λ 1 , . . . , λ n ) and is a diagonal matrix with the θ ii on the diagonal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Estimation, goodness-of-fit and factor scoring</head><p>For maximum likelihood estimation, it is invariably assumed that the common and unique factors are normally distributed, implying a multivariate normal distribution for y j . Replacing the β in the likelihood by their maximum likelihood estimates, the sample means ȳ• , gives a profile likelihood</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">l M ( , ψ, ) = |2π | -n 2 exp(- 1 2 N j=1 (y j -ȳ• ) -1 (y j -ȳ• )</formula><p>In the case of complete data, the empirical covariance matrix S of y j is the sufficient statistic for the parameters. It can be shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> that instead of maximizing the likelihood we can equivalently minimize the fitting function</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">F ML = log | | + tr(S -1 ) -log |S| -n,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>with respect to the unknown free parameters. The fitting function is non-negative and zero only if there is a perfect fit in the sense that the fitted equals S. When there are missing data, the 'case-wise' likelihood is maximized giving consistent estimates if data are missing at random (MAR). <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> Treating the unstructured covariance matrix as the saturated model, a likelihood ratio goodness-of-fit test can be used. Under the null hypothesis that the restricted model of interest is correct (and suitable regularity conditions), the likelihood ratio statistic or deviance has a chi-square distribution with n(n + 1)/2p degrees of freedom, where p is the number of parameters in the restricted model (after eliminating the intercepts), equal to 2n in the congeneric measurement model. Since most parsimonious and hence appealing models are rejected in large samples, more than a hundred goodness-of-fit indices <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> have been proposed that are relatively insensitive to sample size. Some of these indices (e.g., root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> ) are based on a comparison with the saturated model, but most (e.g., comparative fit index (CFI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> ) are based on a comparison with the unrealistic null model of uncorrelated items, and are thus analogous to the coefficient of determination in linear regression. Arbitrarily, fit is typically considered 'good' if the RMSEA is below 0.05 and the CFI and TLI are above 0.90.</p><p>Often the purpose of factor modelling is to investigate the measurement properties of different raters, instruments or items i by comparing the fit of congeneric, tau-equivalent and parallel models and estimating reliabilities. Another purpose is measurement itself, that is assigning factor scores to individual subjects j after estimating the model. The most common approach is the so-called regression method,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">η j = ψ -1 ( y j -β).</formula><p>This can motivated as the expectation of the posterior distribution of the common factor given the observed responses with parameter estimates plugged in, known as the empirical Bayes predictor or shrinkage estimator in statistics. An alternative approach is the Bartlett method,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">η j = ( -1 ) -1 -1 ( y j -β),</formula><p>which maximizes the likelihood of the responses given the common factor with parameter estimates plugged in.</p><p>In the classical measurement model, factor scores using either the regression or Bartlett method are perfectly correlated with the simple sum score i y ij . For this model, Cronbach's α, a commonly used measure of internal consistency of a scale, can be interpreted as the reliability of the sum score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Example: Forced expiratory flow</head><p>In the Health Survey of England 2004 (National Centre for Social Research and University College London, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health 25 ), a sample of children between 7 and 15 years of age had their lung function assessed using a Vitalograph Micro Spirometer. Here, we consider forced expiratory flow which was measured five times for 89 of the children. The nurse also recorded at each occasion whether or not the technique used was satisfactory. If not satisfactory, we treat the measurement as missing.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows maximum likelihood estimates for the classical, essentially tauequivalent, tau-equivalent and congeneric measurement models. Using likelihood ratio tests at the 5% level, the essentially tau-equivalent measurement model is selected. This model also has the best fit indices, but the RMSEA is larger than the desired 0.05. Note that the estimated mean increases over time are consistent with a practice effect and that the estimated measurement error variance is very low at the third measurement. The estimated reliabilities range between 0.82 at the first measurement and 0.96 at the third.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Multidimensional factor models</head><p>Hypothetical constructs are often multidimensional, comprising several related aspects. An example is fatigue, for which Nisenbaum et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> argue that, there are three correlated aspects or common factors defined as 'fatigue-mood-cognition', 'flu-type', and 'visual-impairment'. Denoting the common factors as η j = (η 1j , η 2j , . . . , η mj ) , the multidimensional common factor model can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">y j = β + η j + j ,<label>( 4 )</label></formula><p>where is now a n × m matrix of factor loadings with element pertaining to item i and latent variable l denoted λ il and j a vector of unique factors. We define ≡ Cov(η j ) and assume that E(η j ) = 0, E( j ) = 0, and Cov(η j , j ) = 0. Note that the structure of the model is similar to a linear mixed model where is replaced by a covariate matrix Z j . <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> The results presented in Section 2.1 from Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">2</ref>) apply also to the multidimensional factor model after substituting for ψ.</p><p>It is important to distinguish between two approaches to common factor modelling; exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory factor analysis</head><p>Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> is an inductive approach for 'discovering' the number of common factors and estimating the model parameters, imposing a minimal number of constraints for identification. The standard identifying constraints are that = I, and that and</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">-1</formula><p>are both diagonal. Although mathematically convenient, the one-size-fits-all parameter restrictions imposed in EFA, particularly the specification of uncorrelated common factors, are often not meaningful from a subject matter point of view.</p><p>Methods of estimation include maximum likelihood using the fitting function in (3) and principal axis factoring. However, due to confusion between factor analysis and principal component analysis, the latter is often used. In a second step, the restrictions imposed for identification are relaxed by rotating the factors to achieve equivalent models that are more interpretable by different criteria, such as varimax. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confirmatory factor analysis</head><p>In CFA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> restrictions are imposed based on substantive theory or research design. This approach was illustrated for the unidimensional factor model in Section 2.1.2. In the multidimensional case an important example of a restricted model is the independent clusters or sets of congeneric measures model where has many elements set to zero such that each indicator measures one and only one factor. Such a configuration makes sense if one set of indicators is designed to measure one factor and another set of indicators to measure another factor. A path diagram of a two-factor independent clusters model with three variables measuring each factor is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Circles represent latent variables, rectangles represent observed variables, arrows connecting circles and/or rectangles represent regressions and short arrows pointing at circles or rectangles represent residuals. Curved double-headed arrows connecting two variables indicate that they are correlated.</p><p>For identification the scales of the common factors are fixed either by factor standardization or by anchoring. Elements of j may be correlated, but special care must be exercised in this case to ensure that the model is identified. It is typically assumed that the common and unique factors have multivariate normal distributions to allow maximum likelihood estimation as outlined in Section 2.1. Although routinely used, the standard likelihood ratio test is invalid for testing dimensionality since the null hypothesis is on the border of parameter space and thus violates the regularity conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> For this reason fit indices become important.</p><p>For further reading on classical test theory and common factor models we recommend Streiner and Norman, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> Dunn <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and McDonald. 28,37</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Example: Brain scans</head><p>It has been observed in a number of studies that people suffering of schizophrenia have enlarged brain ventricular volumes. Computerized Axial Tomography scans of heads of 50 psychiatric patients were performed to determine the ventricle-brain ratio from measurements of the perimeter of the ventricle and the perimeter of the inner surface of skull. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> In a method comparison study a standard method involving a hand-held planimeter on a projection of the X-ray image was compared with a new method using an automated pixel count based on a digitized image. Both methods were replicated twice. The log-transformed measurements for the standard method are denoted 'Plan1' (y 1 ) and 'Plan3' (y 2 ) and the log-transformed measurements for the new method 'Pix1' (y 3 ) and 'Pix3' (y 4 ).</p><p>The analyses presented here are similar to those by Dunn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> Initially, a one-factor model (1) was considered giving the first set of estimates in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The factor loadings and measurement error variances for the Plan measurements seem to be different from the loadings and measurement error variances for the Pix measurements. We also note that the estimated measurement error variances are small for all four measures and perhaps not surprisingly, smaller for the automated Pix measurements than for the standard method. The deviance statistic is 29.36 with 2 degrees of freedom leading to rejection which is reinforced by small and large TLI and RMSEA, respectively.</p><p>The Pix measurements are sometimes consistent with each other but very different from the Plan measurement which suggests that there may be some 'gross error'. Dunn and Roberts 34 discuss such phenomena in method comparison data and refer to them as random matrix effects or method by subject interactions. To investigate this, we extend the one-factor model to include correlated measurement errors for the Pix measurements (see left panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), giving the second sets of estimates in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The parameter θ 43 , representing the covariance between the measurement errors 3 and 4 , is estimated Another way of capturing the notion of gross error is to introduce a 'bias factor' η 2j which induces extra dependence among the Pix measurements. The bias factor has factor loadings of one for the two Pix measurements and zero for the two Plan measurements and is uncorrelated with the original factor (see right panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Maximum likelihood estimates with standard errors for this model are presented in the last columns of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Note that the estimated measurement error variance for [Pix1] is inadmissible since it is negative, a so-called Heywood case, which casts some doubt on the validity of this specification. Interestingly, the deviance statistic for this model is identical to that for the measurement model with correlated measurement errors. It can be shown that the two models are equivalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> in the sense that the models are one-to-one reparameterizations of each other, and there is consequently no way to empirically distinguish between the models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Some applications of factor analysis in medical research</head><p>Classical test theory is used implicitly every time a test-retest or inter-rater reliability is reported. Classical test theory and factor models have been used for psychiatric rating scales for a long time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> Bland and Altman 41 popularized these ideas in medicine, but without referring to the vast measurement literature. It is standard practice to report Cronbach's α whenever forming a sum score to assess the 'internal consistency' or intercorrelatedness of the items. This is done regardless of the measurement level of the items and without being aware of the underlying model assumptions.</p><p>EFA and CFA are often used to explore the dimensionality of constructs, particularly in psychiatry <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> and related fields. In EFA the factor structure is usually simplified into an independent clusters model by effectively setting small factor loadings to zero (after rotation) without considering the deterioration in fit. In contrast, arbitrary but 'well established' thresholds applied to a couple of goodness-of-fit indices usually serve to purge uncertainty from model selection in CFA.</p><p>where the responses are assumed to be conditionally independent given ability η j , a property often called local independence. This model is called a one-parameter model because there is one parameter, the item difficulty -β i , for each item.</p><p>Ability η j can either be treated as a latent random variable or as an unknown fixed parameter, giving the so-called Rasch model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> However, estimating the 'incidental parameters' η j jointly with the 'structural parameters' β produces inconsistent estimators for β, known as the incidental parameter problem. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> Inference can instead be based on the conditional likelihood <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> constructed by conditioning on the sufficient statistic for η j , which is the sum score n i=1 y ij . This conditional logistic regression approach is also commonly used in matched case control studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> Alternatively, if η j is viewed as a random variable, typically with η j ∼ N(0, ψ), inference can be based on the marginal likelihood obtained by integrating out the latent variable</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">l M (β, ψ) = N j=1 Pr(y j ; β, ψ) = N j=1 ∞ -∞ n i=1 Pr(y ij | η j ) g(η j ; ψ) dη j = N j=1 ∞ -∞ n i=1 exp(β i + η j ) y ij 1 + exp(β i + η j ) g(η j ; ψ) dη j ,</formula><p>whereβ is the vector of item difficulties and g(•; ψ) is the normal density with zero mean and variance ψ.</p><p>An appealing feature of one-parameter models is that items and examinees can be placed on a common scale (according to the difficulty and ability parameters) so that the probability of a correct response depends only on the amount η j -(-β i ) by which the examinee's position exceeds the item's position. Differences in difficulty between items are the same for all examinees, and differences in abilities of two examinees are the same for all items, a property called specific objectivity by Rasch.</p><p>One of the main purposes of item response modelling is to derive scores from the item responses. The most common approach is to use the expectation of the posterior distribution of η j given y j with parameter estimates plugged in. This empirical Bayes approach is analogous to the regression method for common factor models and is referred to as expected a posterior (EAP) scoring in IRT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Example: Physical functioning</head><p>The The possible responses to these questions are 'yes, limited a lot', 'yes, limited a little' and 'no, not limited at all'. Here we analyse the dichotomous indicator for not being limited at all. Then -β i can be interpreted as the difficulty of activity i and η j as the physical functioning of subject j.</p><p>The ten most frequent response patterns and their frequencies are shown in the first two columns of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. Note that about a third of subjects are not limited at all in any of the activities whereas 6% are limited in all activities. Using conditional maximum likelihood (CML) estimation with the identifying constraint β 1 = 0 gives the difficulty estimates shown under 'CML' in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>.</p><p>For marginal maximum likelihood estimation it seems unrealistic to assume a normal distribution for physical functioning since such a large proportion of people is not limited at all on any of the items.

The value of physical functioning corresponding to a probability of 0.5 is the difficulty of the task. Not  surprisingly, bathing and dressing oneself are easier than vigorous activities. Wilson <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">59</ref> advocates plotting a so-called Wright map, a histogram of the ability scores on the same vertical scale as positions of the items. Such a graph is given together with the estimated ability distribution in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> gives the observed and expected frequencies for the ten most frequent response patterns for the model with a discrete latent variable discussed here, the 1-PL model assuming a normal distribution, and the 2-PL model discussed in the next section.

Importantly, a conditional likelihood can no longer be constructed since there is no sufficient statistic for η j and the marginal likelihood assuming that η j ∼ N(0, 1) is hence used. Since there is no closed form of the marginal likelihood, Bock and Lieberman 60 introduced the use of numerical integration by Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Here, we use a refinement of this approach called adaptive quadrature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">61</ref> For the PF-10 example, item characteristic curves for the 2-PL model, assuming a normal distribution for physical functioning, are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> for the same four items as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. For the items shown here, Vigorous Activities is the least discriminating whereas One Flight Stairs is the most discriminating. Note that the 2-PL model does not share the specific objectivity property of the 1-PL model. An item can be easier than another item for low abilities but more difficult than the other item for higher abilities due to the item-subject interaction λ i η j . This property has caused some psychometricians to reject the use of discrimination parameters because they 'wreak havoc with the logic and practice of measurement'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">62</ref> For dichotomous responses, it is often instructive to formulate models using a latent continuous response y * ij underlying the dichotomous response with</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">y ij = 1 if y * ij &gt; 0 0 otherwise.</formula></div>

Ninety-six female subjects were randomly assigned to the two levels of each of the experimental factors in a full factorial design. All subjects were exposed to the same male counsellor.</p><p>It was important to assess the degree to which the experimental manipulations had been accurately perceived by the clients. In the measurement part of model, three latent variables, each corresponding to an experimental factor, were thus considered as 'manipulation checks': 'Perceived experience (P-E)' η 1j , measured by the items y 1j , y 2j and y 3j ; 'Perceived value similarity (P-VS)' η 2j , measured by the items y 4j , y 5j and y 6j ; and 'Perceived formality (P-F)' η 3j , measured by the items y 7j , y 8j and y 9j . An independent clusters confirmatory factor model (akin to that shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> but with three latent variables) was thus specified for the items, only allowing the items to measure the latent variables they were supposed to measure.</p><p>Clients' satisfaction was construed as a two-dimensional latent variable: • 'Relationship-centered satisfaction (RS)' η 4j , representing the client's sense of closeness to the counsellor, measured by four items each scored from 0 to 6: -'Personalism' y 10,j : A likert item (from 'agree strongly' to 'disagree strongly') with question wording 'I think that the counsellor is one of the nicest persons I've ever met' -'Warmth' y 11,j : A semantic differential format (from 'cold' to 'warm') -'Friendliness' y 12,j : A semantic differential format (from 'friendly' to 'unfriendly') -'Concern' y 13,j : A semantic differential format (from 'unconcerned' to 'concerned') • 'Problem-centered satisfaction (PS)' η 5j , representing the client's perception of the counsellor's ability to help, measured by four items each scored from 0 to 6: -'Thoroughness' y 14,j : A Likert item (from 'agree strongly' to 'disagree strongly') with question wording "The counsellor was very thorough. I was left with the feeling that nothing important had been overlooked" -'Skillfulness' y 15,j : A semantic differential format (from 'unskilled' to 'skilled') -'Impressiveness' y 16,j : A semantic differential format (from 'impressive' to 'unimpressive') -'Success in bringing clarity to the problem' y 17,j : A Likert item (from 'agree strongly' to 'disagree strongly') with question wording 'I felt that the nature of my problem had been clarified, that is that the counsellor had helped me to understand exactly what was troubling me' This specification encodes a number of hypotheses regarding the investigated processes. The matrix prescribes that a given experimental factor affects only the corresponding perception and not the perception of other experimental factors. Moreover, the experimental factors are not permitted to have direct effects on the the satisfaction constructs.</p><p>The B matrix prescribes that there are no relations among the perception factors but that all three perception factors are allowed to affect both satisfaction factors. Finally, the matrix prescribes that the disturbances for the perception factors are uncorrelated but that the disturbances for the satisfaction factors may be correlated. A path diagram for the structural part of the SEM is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. Maximum likelihood estimates for the structural part of the model are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref> (the estimates for the measurement part are omitted). Interestingly, the estimates suggest that the major determinant of relationship-centered satisfaction (RS) is the formality of the interview situation, whereas similarity with the counsellor has only a moderate effect and experience of the counsellor has a negligible effect. In contrast, the experience of the counsellor appears to be the major determinant of problem-centered satisfaction (PS) whereas similarity has only a moderate effect and formality a negligible effect. The estimates thus indicate that there are two distinct kinds of client centered satisfaction in initial interviews and that they depend on the features of the interview situation.</p><p>The maximized log-likelihood is -1674.09 and the deviance is 285.22 with 160 degrees of freedom, suggesting rejection of the model. However, the CFI is 0.94, the TLI is 0.93 and the RMSEA is 0.09, indicating reasonable fit. The validity of the restrictions imposed by Alwin and Tessler can be investigated by assessing the improvement in fit obtained by relaxing them.</p></div>

Interestingly, the measurement error variances are now much larger for the Pix measurements than for the Plan measurements. The deviance statistic for this model is 2.57 with 1 degree of freedom, giving a P-value of 0.10. Although the RMSEA remains somewhat high, the CFI and TLI are now very satisfactory. Thus, it seems reasonable to retain the measurement model with correlated measurement errors for the Pix measurements.</p></note></figure>
