<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Egypt is currently one of the leading nations especially in the Middle East region with a well-established e-commerce environment and advanced IT infrastructure, but rapid growth of e-commerce will soon occur in other nations with similar consumption patterns. This study tests a model of antecedents (consumer experience, propensity to trust, reputation, perceived website size, ease of use, perceived usefulness, and website quality) and consequences of consumers' trust toward online travel websites. Trust is expected to predict consumer attitude, perceived risk, and intention to purchase travel online. Data of 1,431 users of online travel websites were selected from the Supreme Council of Universities Database-Egypt (SCU) and analyzed through structural equation modeling. The findings show that all the aforementioned factors with the exception of consumer experience influence consumer trust toward online travel websites. Trust influences consumers' attitude, perceived risk, and intention to purchase travel online.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Keywords</head><p>intentions to purchase, online travel shopping, online trust, attitude, perceived risk A survey research reveals that the success of online shopping is determined mostly by consumer intentions to purchase (Park 2010). Unlike Internet consumers in Egypt and other emerging economies, however, Egyptian consumers are well known for fickle consumption patterns and lack of e-commerce trust, both of which pose major challenges to online shopping businesses (El-Ansary and Roushdy 2013).</p><p>E-commerce can increase the value of an Internet network in many respects but there are still some obstacles to overcome. First, the problems related to fraud on the internet are increasing every year. Second, the problems caused by spyware and other security vulnerabilities make consumers feel worried about their information provided on this network (Wang and Lin 2008). To avoid these uncertainties, some online shoppers are more inclined to buy from traditional stores <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Moyano, Fernandez-Gago, and Lopez 2012)</ref>. Moreover, lack of touch and feel in online shopping can also lead to hesitation among the shoppers. They can feel more risk when interacting with online stores than traditional ones (Gefen and Straub 2003). In order to reduce the possibility of interaction with ineligible vendors, online shoppers need to rely on their experience and other evidences to determine which websites can be trusted (Gefen and Straub 2003;   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The rapid development of information and communication technology (ICT) has largely changed the hospitality and tourism industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Ho and Lee 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Ip, Law, and Lee 2011)</ref>. Operations in hospitality and tourism have been significantly influenced by the advent of the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Amaro and Duarte 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Gregori, Daniele, and Altinay 2014)</ref>. The Internet is an effective marketing tool that facilitates information communication between sellers and customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Buhalis and Law 2008)</ref>. Thus, websites have become a platform for promoting products and services and another channel to generate revenue by attracting more customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Chiou, Lin, and Perng 2010)</ref>. With the rapid development and the increasing use of websites for information seeking and electronic commerce (e-commerce), trust has become a crucial factor in attracting customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Beldad, de Jong, and Steehouder 2010)</ref>. Internet has come as a new way of communication and selling for travel companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Law and Wong 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Llach, Mariomon, and Alonso-Almeida 2013)</ref>. In recent years, Egypt travel companies have faced massive challenges because of the changing character of the travel industry. For decades, hotels sector, airlines, and cruise lines industry had been dependent on intermediaries to sell their products to consumers. Internet as a new distribution channel will help travel providers to reach consumers directly and help travel providers to save money <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">(Zhou 2004</ref>). Furthermore, the emergence of the Internet brought lower prices and time savings for consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Heung 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The Internet is now a paramount distribution channel for travel companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Lee and Morrison 2010)</ref>. Travel business on the Internet accounts for 15 per cent of overall travel sales <ref type="bibr">(US Census Bureau 2003)</ref>. A forecast from the Market Intelligence Centre (MIC) <ref type="bibr">(2009)</ref> reported that the online travel product category is the Internet's largest commercial area (48.9%), generating a worldwide revenue more than 446 billion U.S. dollars (USD) in 2014. Sales of online travel worldwide grew 10% between 2011 and 2014, and predictions until 2016 have shown that sales of online travel worldwide will grow at 8% yearly <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Statista 2015)</ref>.</p><p>that most of the research on consumer trust focuses on consumers in English-speaking countries and newly industrialized countries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Law, Leung, and Buhalis (2009)</ref> also noted that relationship marketing research in the tourism and hospitality industry focuses mainly on the supplier marketing activities of firms, and less attention has been paid to the consumer side of the exchange process. Research addressing online travel shopping presents contradictory results and is typically fragmented <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Amaro and Duarte 2013)</ref>.</p><p>This research adopts a distinctive way to analyze the factors that influence consumers' trust toward online travel websites and the influence of trust on consumer attitude, perceived risk, and intentions to purchase travel online, by proposing and empirically testing an integrated model, with contributions from well-grounded theories, namely, the technology acceptance model (TAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Davis 1986</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Beldad, de Jong, and Steehouder's (2010)</ref> model, and the theory of reasoned action (TRA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Fishbein and Ajzen 1975)</ref>, contributing to the current literature since, to the best of knowledge, this has not been done in any other study. Therefore, the current study aims to contribute the following to the literature of tourism and hospitality: (1) identify the determinants that affect consumers' trust toward online travel websites; (2) by integrating the TAM, TRA, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Beldad, de Jong, and Steehouder's (2010)</ref> model, this study helps to understand consumers' trust toward online travel websites; (3) investigate the effect of trust on consumer attitude, perceived risk, and intentions to purchase travel online. The findings will help online travel companies' managers to evolve strategies that enhance consumers' trust toward online travel websites; consequently, attitude and intentions to purchase travel online.</p><p>Our study is organized as follows: the next section represents literature pertaining to the study variables and theories as well as the hypotheses development. Then we demonstrate our data collection and measures operationalization. Finally, study results, discussion, and managerial implications have been explained as well as demonstrating the limitations and future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tourism in Egypt: Brief Background</head><p>Egypt, although often considered to be Middle East, is located in Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Libya and the Gaza Strip, and the Red Sea north of Sudan, and includes the Asian Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is part of the Mediterranean basin, the world's top destination area, which attracts one out of every three tourists traveling in the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Morakabati 2007)</ref>. Tourism is one of the most important parts of Egypt's economy. At its peak in 2013 the sector employed about 12.6% of Egypt's workforce, serving approximately 14.7 million visitors, and providing revenues of nearly $19 billion (Egyptian Ministry of Tourism 2014). Tourism is the country's second biggest source of income after the revenue received from the Suez Canal and accounted for 11.3% of GDP and 14.4% of foreign currency revenues (Egyptian Ministry of Tourism 2014).</p><p>The main attraction for tourists to Egypt are the site of ancient Egypt, Cairo, and its environs, Luxor, Karnak, Abu Simbel, temples and tombs along the Nile River, and the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria. However, the Egyptian tourism industry has actively promoted other destinations within Egypt, including Hurghada on the Red Sea, the Sinai Peninsula, and parts of the western desert. The completion of Israel's removal from Sinai in 1982 led to considerable private and government tourist investment, which facilitated the development and establishment of several high-quality tourism resorts in the Sinai, which are popular among tourists from Europe and neighboring Israel <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Beirmann 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The Egyptian economy depends mainly on agriculture, media, Suez Canal, tourism, the transferred income of more than 5 million Egyptians working abroad (mainly in Saudi Arabia, the Gulf area, and Europe) and petroleum and gas exports (El-Gohary 2012). In the last 30 years, the Egyptian government has started reforming the highly centralized economy from the sixties and med seventies era into a totally market liberalization economy. But regardless of that, the high level of political, social, and economic corruption within the country did not allow any chance of improving the country poor economic performance. As a result, the people of Egypt turned against the Hosni Mubarak regime and got rid of his corrupted regime through the 25th of January 2011 revolution. Although the revolution was demanded and conducted by the people, it led to major chaos in the whole country, which badly affected all sectors, including the tourism and travel sector. The industry has been losing $25 million per day since the 1st of February 2011 (El-Gohary 2012). Building online trust by Egyptian travel organizations can be a very important tool in solving the current problems associated with Egyptian travel industry as a result of the political unrest not only in Egypt but also in the Middle East.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Model and Hypotheses</head><p>In traditional commerce, the trust-building process is affected by the characteristics of customers, salespersons, the company, and interactions between the two parties involved. This is also true in the context of electronic commerce. Numerous studies have identified several drivers of trust, and most of these studies concentrated on transacting websites <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Beldad, de Jong, and Steehouder 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Kim, Ferrin, and Rao (2008)</ref> conceptualized the key antecedents of consumer trust into four groups: cognition-based, affect-based, experiencebased, and personality-oriented antecedents. The cognitionbased trust antecedents are the antecedents that relate to the capability that shoppers perceive the target website (e.g., privacy concern, security protection, system reliability, information quality). The affect-based trust antecedents are regarded as indirect interactions from other parties (e.g., reputation, preferences of third-party seals, word of mouth, social feedback). The experience-based trust antecedents are associated with shopper experience (e.g., familiarity, Internet experience, e-commerce experience). And lastly, the personality-oriented trust antecedents are related to personal characteristics (e.g., disposition to trust, shopping style). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Beldad, de Jong, and Steehouder (2010)</ref> classified the antecedents of trust into three main categories: companybased antecedents, like company reputation; consumer-based antecedents, for instance, consumer experience with the technology; and website-based antecedents, for instance the information quality used by the website.</p><p>This study adapts <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Beldad, de Jong, and Steehouder's (2010)</ref> framework in order to investigate the drivers of trust toward online travel websites in the travel and tourism industry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Beldad, de Jong, and Steehouder's (2010)</ref> framework has been adapted in this study because it is an online trust-building framework that suits both profitable and nonprofitable firms; furthermore, it has not yet received empirical validation for online travel websites, and includes a number of links that have not been tested in a single model, which increases the originality of the current study.</p><p>To summarize, the key antecedents of consumer trust have been conceptualized into three categories: consumerbased antecedents (e.g., Consumer experience and propensity to trust), company-based antecedents of trust (e.g., company reputation and perceived size), and website-based antecedents of trust (e.g., perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and website quality). Moreover, the current study also investigates the consequences of consumer trust toward online travel websites, for example, perceived risk, attitude, and intention to purchase travel online. Therefore, this study examines the influence of consumers' trusting beliefs on their attitudes to the online travel provider and their risk perception. Consumers' attitudes to the online travel provider and their perceived risk, in turn, affect their willingness to purchase travel online. The research model and hypotheses are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> Consumer-Based Trust Antecedents Consumer Experience and Proficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Beldad, de Jong, and Steehouder (2010)</ref> pointed out that the level of user experience in using online shopping is an important aspect to consider when examining the antecedents of trust. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Aiken and Boush (2006)</ref> indicated that higher levels of experience lead to low levels of trust in online stores. An explanation is that consumers with high levels of experience have sufficient skills and knowledge of possibilities that things online may go wrong any time <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Aiken and Boush 2006)</ref>. Nevertheless, some studies found that levels of user experience influence consumers' propensity to trust the Internet, thus improving their trust in Internet-based transactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Corbitt, Thanasankit, and Yi 2003)</ref>.</p><p>In the current study, it has been supposed that consumers who have sufficient experience with using online travel websites may feel more confident of not being deceived by unreliable websites. Experienced consumers may have sufficient knowledge and skills that enable them to spot unreliable websites. While first-time consumers have no knowledge about online travel websites and may be more cautious of online travel websites, they will not know how to distinguish between reliable and unreliable websites. In the online travel context, research has supported the positive and significant relationship between users' experience and trust toward online travel websites <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Filieri 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Li-Ming and Wai 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Brakus et al. 2009)</ref> . Therefore, in the travel sector, the following hypothesis has been proposed.</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Consumers' experience with using online travel websites positively influences trust toward online travel websites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Propensity to Trust</head><p>Propensity to trust plays an important role in economic transactions because it decreases the perceived risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Humphrey and Schmitz 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Mukherjee and Nath 2007)</ref>. This is especially true in the online context, where the consumers and sellers are physically separated. Some studies suggested that customers with low propensity to trust tend to have negative views when faced with risky situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Falcone, Singh, and Tan 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Graziano and Tobin 2002)</ref>. Such propensity reduces their desire to try new things. On the other hand, customers with a high propensity to trust tend to have positive views and are willing to try new things <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Graziano and Tobin 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman (1995)</ref> pointed out that consumers vary in the amount of trust that they extend to their sellers. In the online context, some consumers are more likely to trust online service providers despite the limited information they have about them, while others need more information about their online service providers to form trusting beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Salam et al. 2005)</ref>. However, prior studies of the influence of individuals' propensity to trust on the formation of online trust present contradictory results <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Beldad, de Jong, and Steehouder 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Prior studies have found a direct and positive link between the propensity to trust and the formation of online trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Gefen 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Teo and Liu 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Beldad, de Jong, and Steehouder 2010)</ref>. The influence of propensity to trust is directly related to trust formation based on the system's trust attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Beldad, de Jong, and Steehouder 2010)</ref>. In this study, it is argued that online travelers with a high propensity to trust perceive the risk to be less and therefore have more trust in online travel websites. Based on these arguments, the following hypothesis is posited:  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Company-Based Trust Antecedents</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Company Reputation</head><p>Company reputation has been suggested frequently as an important factor that contributes to customer trust. Some studies have pointed out that a positive company reputation results in a trusting relationship between the consumers and the company, while the existence of a negative company reputation results in a less trusting relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Smeltzer 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Beldad, de Jong, and Steehouder 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Herbig, Milewicz, and Golden 1994)</ref> and that when the company fails to fulfil the consumers' intentions, it results in the destruction of its reputation.</p><p>In the electronic commerce context, reputation can be defined in two ways. First, it can be seen as a collective measure of trustworthiness according to members' ratings in a community <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Josang, Ismail, and Boyd 2007)</ref>. Second, it can be a measure of a company's credibility, which results from the relationship among the company's promises and fulfilments <ref type="bibr">(Casalo, Flavian, and Guinaliu 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Toms and Taves (2004)</ref> pointed out that a positive online company reputation can be formed through the assessment of a third party like the rating services on the website and indirectly through linking of the website. <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Vermeulen and Seegers (2009)</ref> revealed that consumers' feedback influence the reputation of the hotel and the attitudes toward it.</p><p>Numerous empirical studies revealed that the positive reputation of online service providers significantly influenced consumers' trust in online vendors <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Chen 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Teo and Liu 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Gregori, Daniele, and Altinay 2014)</ref>. Consumers who don't have an experience with an online service provider rely on the reputation of that online provider in order to assess the trustworthiness of that online service provider <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Chen 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Koufaris and Hampton-Sosa 2004)</ref>. Empirical evidence of the relationship between reputation and consumer trust has been provided by previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Kim, Xu, and Koh 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Teo and Liu 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hsu et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Han, Nguyenb, and Lee 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Chen (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">de Ruyter, Wetzels, and Kleijnen (2001)</ref> have pointed out that online travelers are more likely to trust websites owned by well-known and well-respected companies. Thus, the authors propose the following hypothesis:</p><p>Hypothesis 3: Website reputation positively influences consumers' trust toward online travel websites.</p><p>Perceived Size <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Doney and Cannon (1997)</ref> defined a website size as the market share and its overall size. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Griffin and Hauser (1993)</ref> revealed that large market share and overall size of a firm suggest that it keeps the promises it makes to its customers and that many customers tend to trust it. Firms that do not keep their promises to the customers will not be able maintain their position <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Doney and Cannon 1997)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Chow and Holden (1997)</ref> pointed out that a large-sized firm can encourage consumers to trust it. <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Teo and Pian (2003)</ref> revealed that larger organizational size is also related to a more developed website that encourages transactions with customers. In the context of e-commerce, an e-vendor with a large size can reduce product risk and compensate consumers accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Jarvenpaa, Tractinsky, and Vitale 2000)</ref>. E-vendors' size positively influences consumers' trust toward it <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Jarvenpaa, Tractinsky, and Vitale 2000)</ref>. Consumers can deduce trustworthiness from a website size since larger website size means that the website can handle any failure and losses incurred during the transaction process and compensate the consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Beldad, de Jong, and Steehouder 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Jarvenpaa, Tractinsky, and Vitale 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hsu et al. 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, some studies have pointed out that vendor size is positively associated with customer trust in that vendor <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Kim and Ahn 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Ku 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Hsu, Chuang, and Cheng-Se 2014)</ref>. Hence, it follows that Hypothesis 4: The perceived size of an online travel website positively influences consumers' trust toward online travel websites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Website-Based Trust Antecedents</head><p>Perceived Ease of Use According to the literature, numerous studies have applied various theoretical perspectives to explain and understand consumers' acceptance and use of new technology. Of these, the TAM considers the most effective approach to investigating consumer acceptance and use of technology-related applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ayeh 2015)</ref>. The TAM, initially proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Davis (1986)</ref>, postulates that individuals' perceptions about ease of use and usefulness are two cognitive factors that determine their acceptance of the information system. TAM has received substantial empirical support in explaining consumer acceptance of various types of technology, for example, technology-based services <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Zhu and Chan 2014)</ref>, smartphones <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Joo and Sang 2013)</ref>, and the new media <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Workman 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In tourism and hospitality context, numerous studies applied TAM to understand and explain consumer acceptance of new technology including hotel front office systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Kim, Ferrin, and Rao 2008)</ref>, consumer intention to shop travel online <ref type="bibr">(Amaro and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Duarte 2015 and</ref><ref type="bibr">Casaló, Flavián, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Guinaliu 2010)</ref>, biometric systems adaption in hotels <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Morosan 2012)</ref>, and restaurant computing systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Ham, Kim, and Forsythe 2008)</ref>. The findings of these studies show that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are crucial determinants of consumer acceptance of new technology.</p><p>Perceived ease of use has been defined as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort" <ref type="bibr">(Davis 1989, 320)</ref>. In the current study, perceived ease of use is defined as the extent to which travelers believe that an online travel website is easy to use. Research has supported the positive and significant relationship between perceived ease of use and consumer trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Gefen, Karahanna, and Straub 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Tung, Chang, and Chou 2008)</ref>. Thus, the authors propose the following hypothesis:</p><p>Hypothesis 5: Perceived ease of use positively influences consumers' trust toward online travel websites.</p><p>Perceived Usefulness <ref type="bibr">Davis (1989, 320)</ref> conceptualized perceived usefulness as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance." In our study, perceived usefulness refers to the extent to which the consumer believes that using online travel websites improves his or her travel planning.</p><p>While some researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Palvia (2009)</ref> proposed "perceived usefulness" as an antecedent to transaction intention based on TAM, to our knowledge, no existing study specified perceived usefulness as an antecedent to trust. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Gefen, Karahanna, and Straub (2003)</ref> suggested it would make more sense to postulate that perceived usefulness is a consequence, not an antecedent, of trust in an e-commerce firm. A business relationship developed based on trust provides a measure of subjective guarantee that the e-commerce firm will behave with good will and that the outcome of a transaction will be fair and favorable, and thus increase the benefits of transacting on the e-commerce website that consumers come to perceive as more useful <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Gefen, Karahanna, and Straub 2003)</ref>. In support of this notion, <ref type="bibr">Agag and</ref><ref type="bibr">El-Masry (2016a, 2016b)</ref> found a significant path from perceived usefulness and consumer trust toward online travel community websites. Therefore, it is decided to rule out perceived usefulness as a trust antecedent from our model. Hence, the hypothesis: Hypothesis 6: Perceived usefulness positively influences consumers' trust toward online travel websites.</p></div>

Therefore, because of the difficulties regarding measuring consumers' real behavior, this study focuses on behavioral intentions as the best predictor of consumers' actual behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consumer Trust, Attitude, and Intention to Purchase</head><p>The TRA examines the relationships between attitudes, beliefs, intentions, and behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ajzen and Fishbein 1980)</ref>. The theory emphasizes that consumers' intention is determined by their attitudes toward the behavior, and their attitudes are affected by their beliefs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling and Data Collection</head><p>A positivist research philosophy was utilized with a quantitative approach to validate the proposed framework, and quantitative data were collected using survey questionnaires to address different levels of the study. The target population of the current study comprises all consumers who had purchased travel products online at least once in the last one year (e.g., an airline ticket, a hotel accommodation, a car rental, a cruise reservation, transportation reservations, and a travel package). The travel consumers who participated in this study had recent experience in the use of online travel websites for tourism-related products and services (e.g., an airline ticket, a hotel accommodation, a car rental, a cruise reservation, transportation reservations, and a travel package), which was assessed in different ways: first, the e-mail sent to potential respondents clearly stated that only people with recent experiences with online travel websites could participate in this study; second, the respondents were asked to write the name of the website where they have made online purchases and indicate how frequently they used this website before. However, since there was no list of Internet shoppers across Egypt, it was impossible to select our sample from the population directly. Thus, convenience sampling was used to collect data (San Martín and Herrero 2012).</p><p>The first step in the process was to get permission from Egyptian tertiary institutions in order to send the surveys to their students. In total, 5 tertiary institutions out of 27 agreed for their students to participate in this study. These institutions were Cairo University, Alexandria University, Sadat City University, Assiut University, and the American university in Cairo. The second step involved universities sending an informed consent e-mail explaining the study purpose, with an attached URL hyperlink to all students. The final step was to send a follow-up e-mail to remind students to complete and submit the survey 1 week and then 1 month after the informed consent e-mail in order to achieve a higher response rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Richardson 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Egypt has been chosen to implement the empirical part of this research for a number of reasons. First, to the researcher's best knowledge, this is the first research to be conducted in Egypt on online travel in the tourism sector, in which no previous empirical or conceptual work exists. Thus, this research represents an empirical contribution in that regard. Second, studying a developing country like Egypt represents a valuable extension to online travel studies that have been primarily focused on developed countries. E-commerce is highly successful in developed countries in comparison with developing countries, where information and communications technology (ICT) application is still in its early stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Aldhmour and Shannak 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Bhuasiri et al. 2012)</ref>; this led to the digital divide between developed and developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Aldhmour and Shannak 2009)</ref>. This was obvious when revising the literature, which confirmed that ICT diffused rapidly in developed countries but slowly in developing countries, leading to an ICT gap or digital divide between developed and developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Aladwani 2003)</ref>, which explains why developing countries always are latecomers to ICT. Businesses in developing countries face different challenges from those in developed countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Molla and Licker 2005)</ref> and it would be really useful to discover whether the same factors influence consumers' trust in online travel websites as in developed countries. Third, Egypt is one of the top countries worldwide in terms of the growth potential of tourism, and thus it is expected to make large benefits by investigating drivers and outcomes of consumers' trust toward online travel websites. It is therefore important to consider what factors can lead travelers in Egypt to trust online travel websites. Gaining knowledge of the drivers and outcomes of consumers' trust in online travel websites could provide valuable information that would help enhance the competitiveness of the tourism industry in Egypt.</p><p>Data were collected using a Web-based survey. The use of such a uniform data collection method helps to minimize social desirability bias and controls for response styles (de Leeuw 2008). Besides, online surveys have been applied successfully in recent hospitality and tourism research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Gardiner, King, and Grace 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Eid and El-Gohary 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Zhang, Wu, and Mattila 2016)</ref>. Furthermore, an online method of distribution was appropriate for this study as it facilitated a national geographic dispersal of the survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aaker, Kumar, and Day 2007)</ref>.</p><p>In July 2015, recruitment e-mails were sent directly to faculty members at the five tertiary institutions in Egypt asking students to complete the online survey. A screening question was formulated in the first section to identify eligible respondents; the screening question asked whether the respondent had made online purchases of travel products in the past 6 months. Positive answers enabled respondents to proceed with the survey. College students were chosen because they not only represent a vulnerable and significant Internet user but are also an important cohort, Generation Y, to online retailers <ref type="bibr">(National Retail Federation 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Jai, Burns, and King 2013)</ref>. They have the highest Internet usage of any other cohort, and their online buying and purchasing behavior is representative of technology-savvy users <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Fox and Madden 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Larose and Rifon 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Jai, Burns, and King 2013)</ref>. Student samples have often been used in online shopping research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Kim, Fiore, and Lee 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ashraf, Thongpapanl, and Auh 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Jai, Burns, and King 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Elbeltagi and Agag 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Agag and El-Masry 2016b)</ref>. This is justifiable as students have few troubles in using new technology and are computer literate <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ashraf, Thongpapanl, and Auh 2014)</ref>. Students have actual online experiences and are potential consumers of electrical goods <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Yoo and Donthu 2001)</ref>, and their technological advances and innovativeness qualify them as a suitable sample for online shopping research <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Yoo and Donthu 2001)</ref>. The e-mail invitations provided respondents with information on the purpose of the study, the approximate time to fill out the questionnaire, and a banner with a hyperlink connecting to our web survey.</p><p>A pilot test was conducted to assess the validity and reliability of the research instrument. The instrument was given to a group of 50 postgraduate students at Sadat City University in Egypt who mentioned that they had used and were familiar with online travel websites. Their comments resulted in refinement of the instrument in terms of its length, format, readability, and clarity. Twenty online travel managers were also asked to review the questionnaire. This review resulted in elimination of a specific item measuring perceived risk. The exclusion of this item did not pose a major threat to construct validity, since there were three additional items assessing perceived risk. Some wording changes were also made.</p><p>The participants in this study were randomly selected from the Supreme Council of Universities Database-Egypt (SCU). The participants from the SCU were not self-selected but were recruited using probability sampling methods where e-mail addresses were randomly picked by a generated sampling system, similar to random-digit dialing (RDD).</p><p>The questionnaire was available online between July 20 and September 15, 2015. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, the initial e-mails were sent to 3,800 respondents, randomly picked by the system from the SCU. Probability sampling takes place when the probability of the selection of each respondent is known. With this, statistical inferences on the chosen sample of Internet shoppers could be made in this study. The selected respondents from the SCU could represent the total population of Internet shoppers, and this approach also permits generalization. These e-mails were sent with a link to a simple multiple-choice screening question asking about the types of products that the respondents had purchased over the Internet in the last year. A total of 3,250 respondents replied to the question stating the various types of travel products they had purchased online at least once in the last one year (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). From this number, only 1,860 respondents indicated that they had purchased travel services online. This means that 1,860 respondents were qualified for the actual survey, which also indicates the sample size for the study. In the actual survey, e-mail invitations were sent to all 1,860 respondents, and a total of 1,463 responses were obtained. The total number of responses was large; hence, the complete case approach was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Hair et al. 2010</ref>) and all responses with missing values (32) were eliminated. Therefore, a total of 1,431 responses were considered to be valid for further analyses. This actually meets the suggestion by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bartlett, Kotrlik, and Higgins (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Barclay, Higgins, and Thompson (1995)</ref> that when determining the sample size for PLS estimation, 10 cases per predictor were used as a cut-off sample size. In our model, the most complex regression involved the number of paths to the trust construct, which was seven. Therefore, according to this rule, 70 responses would be necessary as the minimum sample size for our study. Since 1,431 cases were collected, the current research sample size is a very good and practically acceptable size for the use of PLS. Another test has been conducted using the following equation suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Westland (2010)</ref>, n ≥ 50r 2 -450r + 1,100, where n is sample size and r is the ratio of indicators to latent variables. Since 1,431 cases were collected, the current research sample size satisfies the lower sample size threshold for structural equation modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Westland 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaire and Measurements</head><p>The questionnaire for the present study was divided into two main sections. The first section contained questions to measure each construct based on existing measures or adapted from similar scales. It should be noted that all constructs have a reflective measurement. The last section of the questionnaire consisted of questions regarding respondents' demographic characteristics, for example, gender, age, and education level. To prevent duplicate responses, the option to control and remove duplicate responses by IP was used. The research model has 11 constructs, each having items that are gauged by a Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree).</p><p>The scale used to measure trust toward online travel websites was similar to a scale adopted in previous studies <ref type="bibr">(Morgan and Hunt 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Kim, Chung, and Lee 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Corbitt, Thanasankit, and Yi 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Filieri 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Kim, Ferrin, and Rao 2008)</ref> and modified based on a pilot study. The scale used to measure consumers' experience with online travel websites was adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Smith, Menon, and Sivakumar (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Filieri (2015)</ref>. The measured scale of propensity to trust was generated based on related studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Teo and Liu 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Cheung and Lee 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Bianchi and Andrews 2012)</ref>. The variables of reputation and perceived size in this study were operationalized with three items each as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Teo and Liu (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Doney and Cannon (1997)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">and Jarvenpaa, Tractinsky, and Vitale (2000)</ref>. The variables of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in this study were operationalized with three items each as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Davis (1989)</ref> scales and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Cheng, Lam, and Yeung (2006)</ref>, Moore and Benbasat (1991), <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">and Castaneda, Munoz-Leiva, and Luque (2007)</ref>. Perceived usefulness items reflected the consumer's belief that using online travel websites improved his or her travel planning. Perceived ease of use items reflected the ease of using online travel websites, while website quality was measured by a scale used in previous studies of online travel <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Filieri 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hsu et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Teo, Srivastava, and Jiang 2009)</ref>.

Partial least squares (PLS-SEM) were applied, and the Warp PLS 3.0 program was used to validate the measures and test the hypotheses. First, PLS minimizes the endogenous variables' residual variances, and it is also an appropriate technique to address multiple relationships at the same time <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Hair, Ringle, and Sarstedt 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Henseler, Ringle, and Sinkovics 2009)</ref>. Second, a PLS approach does not require a normal distribution, as opposed to covariance-based approaches, which requires a normal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Henseler, Ringle, and Sarstedt 2012)</ref>, Finally, PLS is also recommended for testing complex frameworks (e.g., multiple mediators) <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Magnusson et al. 2013)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Statistics</head><p>A total of 1,431 respondents were surveyed online. Of these 1,431 participants, 920 were men (64.0%) and 511 were women (36.0%). The majority of respondents were aged between 18 and 29 (41.0%) years, had postgraduate education (master's and doctorate) (60.0%), and had engaged in online shopping between three and six times within the previous year (62.0%). Although the percentage of participants with master's and doctorate is high (60% of online travel product shopping population), it actually represents only 26% of the online shoppers. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the respondents' demographics.</p><p>The data show that for the most part, these respondents have made online purchases from well-known domestic travel websites, such as Egyptair.com (largest domestic airline), Almrsal.com (largest domestic accommodation and hotel), Cairo360.com (largest domestic transportation), Selaheltelmeez.com (domestic accommodation and hotel), and Agoda.com (domestic accommodation and hotel).</p><p>Respondents have also purchased from foreign travel websites predominantly at Booking.com and Tripadvisor.com. Furthermore, the most frequently purchased online travel products by respondents are hotel reservations (41%), air flight tickets (29%), transportation reservations (18%), and a car rental (12%).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model</head><p>Tests of normality were conducted to satisfy the criterion of multivariate normality, namely, skewness, kurtosis, and Mahalanobis distance statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bagozzi and Yi 1988)</ref>, for all the constructs (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>; see appendix). These indicated no departure from normality. The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient was calculated in order to assess the psychometric properties of the constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Nunnally and Bernstein 1994)</ref>.</p><p>The first step in evaluating a research model is to present the measurement model results to examine the indicators of internal consistency reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Hair, Ringle, and Sarstedt 2011)</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, Cronbach's alpha for all measures exceeds the recommended threshold value of 0.70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Hair, Ringle, and Sarstedt 2011)</ref>. Therefore, all measures are robust in terms of their reliability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Henseler, Ringle, and Sinkovics (2009)</ref> pointed out that composite reliability is more suitable for PLS-SEM.

Finally, all indicator loadings exceed the recommended threshold value of 0.60 <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Henseler, Ringle, and Sinkovics 2009)</ref>.</p><p>To assess convergent validity, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref>, AVE was calculated for each construct in our proposed model (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). Since all constructs' AVE are above the 0.50 cut-off, the results support convergent validity.</p><p>Discriminant validity is considered in two steps. First, the Fornell and Larcker criterion is used to test whether the square root of a construct's AVE is higher than the correlations between it and any other construct within the model. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>, each construct shares more variance with its own block of indicators than with another latent variable. Second, the factor loading of an item on its associated construct should be greater than the loading of another nonconstruct item on that construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Chin 2010)</ref>. The results, presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>, indicate that all indicators loaded on their own construct more highly than on any other, supporting that the constructs are distinct.</p><p>In order to assess potential nonresponse bias, following the method proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Armstrong and Overton (1977)</ref>, we tested whether there were significant differences among the early and late respondents. A total of 550 respondents completed the survey during the early stage and 438 completed the survey during the late stage. The chi-square test did not reveal any significant differences between early and late respondents at the 5% significance level. Therefore, the possibility of nonresponse bias was excluded.</p><p>A principal components factor analysis was conducted, and the results excluded the potential threat of common methods bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Podsakoff et al. 2003)</ref>. The first (largest) factor accounted for 36.42% (the variances explained ranges from 18.05% to 36.42%), and no general factor accounted for more than 50% of variance, indicating that common method bias may not be a serious problem in the data set. In addition, following the method proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Liang et al. (2007)</ref>, the results indicate that the substantive variance of indicators is 0.7, the average method-based variance is 0.006, and all the method factor loadings are not significant. Therefore, we may contend that common method bias may not be a serious problem in the data set.</p><p>Multicollinearity tests were performed because of the relatively high correlations among some of the constructs. All constructs had variance inflation factor (VIF) values less than 2.1, which is within the cut-off level of 3.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Hair, Ringle, and Sarstedt 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model Assessment</head><p>Since the measurement model evaluation provided evidence of reliability and validity, the structural model was examined to evaluate the hypothesized relationships among the constructs in the research model <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Hair et al. 2013)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Henseler, Ringle, and Sarstedt (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Hair et al.'s (2013)</ref> recommendations, the structural model proposed in the current study was evaluated with several measures, The model explains 79% of variance for perceived website trust, 37% of variance for consumer attitude, 53% of variance for perceived risk, and 59% of variance for intentions to purchase travel online. To test hypotheses 1-13, the structural equation model was tested in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. The global fit indicators were acceptable, APC = 0.182 (P &lt; 0.001), ARS = 0. 784 (P &lt; 0.001), AARS = 0. 719 (P &lt; 0.001), AVIF = 2.629, and GOF = 0.708. The results show that all hypothesized relationships are supported except hypotheses 1, 4, and 11.</p><p>Based on the results, the strongest predictors of perceived website trust were: perceived ease of use (β = 0.61, P &lt; 0.001), website quality (β = 0.48, P &lt; 0.001), website reputation (β = 0.42, P &lt; 0.001), and perceived usefulness (β = 0.39, P &lt; 0.001). Contrary to our predictions, consumer experience and proficiency (β = 0.08, P &lt; nonsignificant) and website size (β = 0.08, P &lt; nonsignificant) did not exhibit a significant predictive power in their relationship with the dependent variable (website trust); thus, the results support hypotheses 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7, while hypotheses 1 and 4 are rejected.</p><p>Findings also show that website trust is a significant and strong predictor of consumer attitude (β = 0.51, P &lt; 0.001), perceived risk (β = -0.74, P &lt; 0.001), and intentions to purchase (β = 0.04, P &lt; 0.05). Finally, the influence of attitude on intention to purchase travel online (β = 0.69, P &lt; 0.001) and perceived risk on intention to purchase (β = -0.43, P &lt; 0.001) is found to be strong and highly significant, while perceived risk (β = 0.06, P &lt; nonsignificant) has no influence on attitude; thus, hypotheses 9, 10, 12, and 13 are accepted, while hypothesis 11 is rejected.</p><p>To check for the mediating indirect effects of the variables on consumer intentions to purchase travel online through trust, perceived risk, and attitude, a separate analysis was performed based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Baron and Kenny's (1986)</ref> procedure. The results revealed that the influence of user experience, reputation, and website quality on intention to purchase travel online are completely mediated through trust, perceived risk and attitude, and the influences of propensity to trust, perceived ease of use, website size, and perceived usefulness are partially mediated. Attitude and perceived risk completely mediates the impact of website trust on consumer intention to purchase travel online.</p><p>Furthermore, the <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Cohen (1988)</ref> effect size f 2 , defined as "the degree to which the phenomenon is present in the population," was used to further examine the substantive effect of the research model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Cohen (1988)</ref> suggested 0.02, 0.15, and 0.35 as operational definitions of small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively. Thus, our model suggested that both website trust (f 2 = 0.71) and intentions to purchase travel online  (f 2 = 0.58) have large effect sizes whereas perceived risk (f 2 = 0.24) and attitude (f 2 = 0.27) have medium effect sizes.</p><p>The study tests the predictive validity of the structural model following the Stone-Geisser Q 2 . According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Roldán and Sánchez-Franco (2012)</ref>, in order to examine the predictive validity of the research model, the cross-validated construct redundancy Q 2 is necessary. A Q 2 greater than 0 implies that the model has predictive validity. In the main PLS model, Q 2 is 0.69 for website trust, 0.51 for attitude, 0.46 for perceived risk and 0.62 for consumer intention to purchase travel online that is positive and hence satisfies this condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and Conclusions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion of Findings</head><p>The aim of this study was to propose and empirically test a comprehensive model of antecedents and consequences of consumer's trust toward online travel websites. Seven factors are proposed for building consumer trust toward online travel websites: consumer experience, propensity to trust, reputation, perceived size, ease of use, perceived usefulness, and website quality. Perceived risk, attitude, and intention to purchase travel online act as consequences to website trust. Findings from Internet users (N = 1,431) indicated that perceived ease of use, website quality, website reputation, and perceived usefulness are key indicators for building website trust. Trust is a key performance indicator for online travel organizations that influences perceived risk, attitude, and consumer intentions to purchase travel online.</p><p>Overall, the results provide support for the proposed model of consumer trust toward online travel websites. As expected, characteristics of both consumers (propensity to trust), online vendors (perceived reputation), and website (ease of use, perceived usefulness, and website quality) are found to be determinants of consumer trust toward online travel websites.</p><p>In terms of the antecedents of website trust, the SEM results show that propensity to trust has significant influence on website trust but consumer experience is not related to website trust; the findings highlight a positive relationship that is consistent with previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Gefen 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Teo and Liu 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Beldad, de Jong, and Steehouder 2010)</ref>. It was found that the level of consumer experience in terms of using online travel websites was not a significant predictor of trust toward online travel websites. This means that trust toward online travel websites will be almost the same between experienced and inexperienced consumers. However, on average, consumers with more experience with online travel websites will tend to trust online travel websites less than novice consumers.</p><p>The findings of this study revealed that perceived reputation is positively related to website trust but perceived website size is not related to website trust. One possible explanation for the lack of support for the relationship between perceived website size and website trust could be that the perceived size of website does not affect consumers' trust toward website as heavily as the perceived size of a physical store does. Online provider size is less easily perceived on the website than a physical store size. In the traditional business, consumers can easily assess an organization size themselves by its presence. But in the online environment, it is hard to assess the online vendor size through its website. Therefore, customers may not care much regarding the online vendor size. Furthermore, recognizing perceived reputation as a driver of website trust validates <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Yang et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Teo and Liu (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Hsu et al. (2014)</ref> findings in online context.</p><p>The results also indicate that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are two relevant antecedents in order to form a website trust. Therefore, the TAM holds true for Egypt (i.e., a culture that is high in uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and masculinity and low in individualism). Prior studies have indicated concern regarding the applicability of the TAM in a culture that is high in uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and masculinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(McCoy, Galletta, and King 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Straub, Keil, and Brenner 1997)</ref>. However, the current study results reveal useful insights regarding the applicability and generalizability of TAM in a culture that is high in uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and masculinity. The results of this study are consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams, Nelson, and Todd (1992)</ref>, which pointed out that PEU plays a critical role in the early adaption stages. Perceived website quality emerged as a strong predictor of website trust. Therefore, the higher the perceived quality of online travel website, the more users will trust in online travel website. Therefore, the current study shows that website quality is an important predictor of trust toward online travel websites, which is consistent with previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Filieri 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Kim, Chung, and Lee 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Wang et al. 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Results regarding consequences of website trust are consistent with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Teo and Liu (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Jarvenpaa, Tractinsky, and Vitale (2000)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Amaro and Duarte (2015)</ref>. The findings of this study acknowledge that trustworthy relations between the consumer and online travel provider have a significant and positive effect on customer attitude toward online travel websites and between consumers' attitude and their intention to purchase travel online. Consumers' attitude toward online travel websites is the most relevant determinant of intentions to purchase travel online. The results of this study are consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Amaro and Duarte (2015)</ref>, which pointed out that consumers' attitude is the most relevant determinant of consumers' intentions to purchase travel online. Finally, website trust reduces consumers' perceived  risk associated with purchasing travel online. Although perceived risk has no influence on consumer attitude toward online travel websites, since it has a negative influence on consumer intentions to purchase travel online, it may discourage consumers from purchasing. The TRA is confirmed by the results of the current study, which revealed that customers' trust toward online travel websites is significantly positively related to their attitude toward the online travel websites, and consumers' attitude is positively related with customers' intentions to purchase travel online. This result is consistent with prior empirical studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Teo and Liu 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Amaro and Duarte 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Jarvenpaa, Tractinsky, and Vitale 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial Implications</head><p>Trust has become a top concern for online travel websites as evidenced by prior studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Kim, Chung, and Lee 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ayeh, Au, and Law 2013a)</ref>. This study was couched on the premise that prior studies have largely ignored the factors leading to consumers' trust toward online travel websites as well as the consequences of consumers' trust toward online travel websites, especially in a developing country. As such, a strong empirical inquiry on analyzing the antecedents and consequences of customers' trust toward online travel websites as identified by the literature was needed. The present study's findings have revealed some important implications for online travel providers and academic researchers as well as making a significant contribution to the body of knowledge in a number of different ways. The results of this research have relevant practical implications for marketing practitioners and managers who design strategic plans and implement tools to improve the performance of online travel shopping websites.</p><p>First, knowledge of the antecedents and consequences of consumer trust and the influence of these factors on intentions to purchase travel online are useful for managers who should develop strategies and actions aimed at increasing the consumer trust in their websites and, consequently, the consumers' intentions to purchase travel online. The current study has provided empirical validation of a model that can help online travel providers to understand the antecedents and consequences of trust toward online travel websites. Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness emerged as crucial success factors for building trust toward online travel websites and consequently, attitude and intentions to purchase travel online; therefore, actions can be taken by managers to increase perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Online travel providers can utilize the advances of technology to facilitate convenience in selling travel online. For instance, online travel providers can provide apps for mobile devices to purchase travel.</p><p>Second, our study findings have important implications for international marketers who want to target the Egyptian market. Our study reveals that PEU plays a critical role in influencing consumer trust toward online travel websites. In other words, Egyptian consumers are likely to be more worried about their ability to use the website than the online travel shopping benefits when making decisions about e-commerce adaption.</p><p>Third, another recommendation for online travel providers to keep high levels of trust would be to improve technical features such as service quality, information quality, and service quality. For instance, online travel providers can provide consumers with information systems with safe payment mechanism, privacy protection mechanism, and high transmission quality. Furthermore, online travel providers should encourage consumers to enter their personal information to utilize customized and personalized services. In addition, online travel providers can increase their websites' reputation through publicity and advertising.</p><p>Finally, this study revealed that consumers' attitude toward online travel websites is the most relevant determinant of consumers' intention to purchase online. Thus, online travel providers need to pay attention to the aspects that build a favorable attitude. The current study evidenced some of those aspects, for example, trust. Perceived risk influences consumer intentions to purchase online, and actions can be taken by online travel providers to reduce the perceived risk through, for instance, a strong website reputation, providing fulfilling transactions, providing consumers with information about consumer rights and money-back guarantees, and using security approval symbols.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>The findings of this study contribute to the literature by expanding the extant literature on online trust by assessing the drivers and outcomes of trust toward online travel websites in an emerging Middle East context. These results are important because they empirically test theories predominantly developed in developed countries, in the context of a vigorous emerging Middle East marketplace, which increasingly attracts international marketers who want to target the Egyptian market. Therefore, the theoretical implications of this study are that consumer trust toward online travel websites depends on three main drivers: (1) those related to consumers' experience and proficiency and propensity to trust;</p><p>(2) those related to the reputation of the website and the perceived size of the website; and (3) those related to the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and website quality. Furthermore, previous studies have often not adequately distinguished between consumer trust, attitude, and perceived risk and concomitantly have not understood their relationships with each other or how they influence purchase intentions. Therefore, distinguishing between these concepts both empirically and conceptually will provide important insights into their distinct roles in the online context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research Directions</head><p>Like any other study, ours is bound by certain limitations that also provide fertile grounds for further research. First, this study employed a convenience sample. Although being a strong sample in terms of diversity and size, generalizations of the results must be made with caution. Therefore, future studies can use random sampling of general consumers. Second, this study did not consider cross-cultural issues; any comparative study of developed and developing countries would make a worthwhile contribution to the body of knowledge. Third, another limitation of the current study is related to online travel purchase definition. In this study, online travel purchase definition is a little broad; therefore, the results maybe not suitable to all online travel product categories. Therefore, future studies should examine the validity of the proposed model on a specific travel product or service. Fourth, the variables of this study have been measures at a single point of time. Thus, future studies should use longitudinal analysis in order to validate the proposed model. Finally, although the antecedents of consumer trust toward online travel websites explained a substantial amount of its variance, there are some other important dimensions that have not been included in the research model, representing opportunities for further research (e.g., consumers' satisfaction with previous experience and perceived source credibility).  <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Teo and Liu (2007)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Doney and Cannon (1997)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Jarvenpaa, Tractinsky, and Vitale (2000)</ref> This online travel website has a good reputation in the market (REP2).</p></div>
