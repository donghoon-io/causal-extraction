<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This research aims to investigate the adoption gap in mobile payment systems between Italy and China, focusing on users' intention to adopt mobile payment. The theoretical framing considers both drivers and barriers when combines the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) with innovation resistance theory (IRT). To empirically verify the proposed model, this study gathers primary data through a web-based, self-administered survey. To analyze the data, we use structural equation modeling, and to test for significant differences between the two groups we run multi-group analysis. The respondents in Italy and China present different behaviors. Social influence plays a significant role in cultures with high uncertainty avoidance, such as Italy. The tradition barrier is the only significant barrier to the adoption of mobile payment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The Financial Times devoted a special report to the future of payment in October 2020, 1 central banks in China 2 and Europe 3 plan to launch digital versions of their currencies in the coming years, and COVID-19 has triggered a rapid surge in the portion of card and contactless payments in face-to-face purchases. Mobile payment combines contactless payment systems with mobile devices, enabling users to initiate, authorize, and complete financial transactions that move money through mobile networks or wireless communication technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Chandra et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Lu et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Oliveira et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In recent years, mobile payment systems have not been adopted equally quickly in various geographic locations. Notably, the European market generally appears to be slower to integrate mobile payment than other economies, despite a large degree of heterogeneity on the continent <ref type="bibr">(Deloitte, 2019)</ref>. Although the share of the population connected to mobile internet is greater in Europe than in the Asia-Pacific region (68% and 56%, respectively) (GSMA, 2019), only 31% of Europeans mentioned using mobile payment services in the previous month as compared to 37% of Asians <ref type="bibr">(Global Web Index, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>This study limited its research scope to mobile payment adoption in two countries: China and Italy. China is an attractive setting as it had the highest adoption rate of mobile payment worldwide in 2019 <ref type="bibr">(eMarketer, 2019)</ref>. Despite this already high adoption rate, opportunities remain for the implementation of new features in mobile payment in China. Also, the dynamism of the Chinese market requires constant investigation of the factors influencing the adoption of mobile payment <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Miao &amp; Jayakar, 2016)</ref>. In Italy, the number of daily cash transactions per person is among the highest in Europe, while the use of digital payments is among the lowest <ref type="bibr">(European Central Bank, 2017)</ref>. Empirical research has highlighted the need to investigate the barriers that retard the adoption of mobile payment technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Moroni et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The mobile payment penetration rate among Chinese smartphone users is 81.1% as opposed to 21.1% among Italian users <ref type="bibr">(eMarketer, 2019)</ref>, so the contrast in mobile payment adoption between the countries is even starker than that between the European and Asian markets as a whole. Previous research suggests possible reasons for this difference. Notably, Chinese society puts greater emphasis on economic and technological progress as a means of achieving and maintaining the nation's leadership position; at the personal level, it establishes an individual's position within the hierarchical structure of the society <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Qi Dong, 2009)</ref>. By contrast, Italian society faces less political pressure regarding technology adoption. In their study comparing Italy's and China's e-commerce adoption, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Capece et al. (2013)</ref> identified lack of trust and uncertainty avoidance as potential barriers in Italy in contrast to a stronger aspiration to progress and improvement in China. The influence of culture on the differing adoption of technologies between countries has also been widely investigated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Hofstede's (2001)</ref> research and subsequent contributions building upon it studies the influence of cultural dimensions on the classic models of technology adoption. These dimensions of cultural influence have been analyzed in diverse contexts and countries, yielding important conclusions that explain cultural differences in technological contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Alcántara et al., 2018)</ref>. However, cross-cultural studies on mobile payment adoption using Hofstede's cultural dimensions remain scarce. To the authors' knowledge, there is still no comparative study of mobile payment adoption comparing China and a European country.</p><p>This research investigated the reasons for the mobile payment adoption gap between China and Italy by analyzing individuals' propensity and resistance to technology adoption. The study implements a model that includes both drivers and barriers to adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Zhou, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Gao &amp; Waechter, 2017)</ref>. Accordingly, the conceptual framework draws upon two complementary theories: the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref> and innovation resistance theory (IRT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Ram, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Ram &amp; Sheth, 1989</ref>). The resulting model was empirically tested with primary data retrieved from a web-based, selfadministered survey.</p><p>The contribution of this research is threefold. First, it addresses a gap in the recent scholarly literature by integrating UTAUT2 and IRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Leong et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Tamilmani et al., 2021)</ref>. Notably, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Lin et al. (2019)</ref> and, more recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kaur et al. (2020)</ref> called for further investigation of the factors contributing to consumer resistance in the adoption of mobile payment and used IRT to frame the study of mobile payment adoption. However, IRT has not been considered as an explanatory framework in a cross-country comparison of mobile payment adoption yet. Second, an analysis of the results of this study suggests that IRT may not be suitable to identify and investigate the current barriers to the adoption of mobile payment in cross-cultural studies. Third, we contribute through the distinct findings for Italy and China; social influence plays a significant role in cultures with high uncertainty avoidance, and the tradition barrier is the only significant barrier to the adoption of mobile payment.</p><p>Section 2 of this article defines the key terms used in the research, summarizes previous relevant research, and outlines the theoretical framework. The proposed research model and hypotheses are introduced in Section 3, and Section 4 describes the data collection methodology, questionnaire design, and analysis. Sections 5, 6, and 7 provide, respectively, the results of the analysis, the main findings and discussion, including limitations and suggestions for future research.</p><p>2 Theoretical Framework: Consumer Mobile Payment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Baron et al. (2006)</ref> emphasize that technology adoption is propelled by two components: (1) embedding the technology in the society and (2) acceptance by potential users. The first component is addressed in this study's design by the antecedents of image, tradition, risk, and value barriers in the IRT framework, and the second is reflected in the classical UTAUT2 antecedents capturing individual motives and the amplifiers of technology adoption. Mobile payment is an activity performed on an electronic device connected to the mobile internet that enables the completion of a financial transaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, 2020)</ref>. From the consumer perspective, mobile payment refers to "all payments for goods, services, and bills authorized, initiated, or realized with a mobile device" <ref type="bibr">(Schierz et al., 2010, p. 210)</ref>. Regarding the device, mobile payment refers to transactions to acquire goods and services or make payments conducted on a cell phone, smartphone, or personal digital assistant using wireless communication technology <ref type="bibr">(Singh et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Dahlberg et al., 2008)</ref>. Based on these definitions, this study defines mobile payment as all payments carried out by consumers through an application on a mobile device (rather than using cash, checks, or bank cards).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Previous Research on Mobile Payment Adoption</head><p>Researchers began investigating the adoption of mobile payment in the early 2000 s. Seminal studies focused on connection protocols and on the main drawbacks to mobile payment <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Wang et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Kreyer et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Hassinen et al., 2006)</ref> as well as on the interconnectivity of mobile payment systems and on their individual adoptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Mezgec et al., 2008)</ref>. The first proposals on the barriers and drivers of mobile payment adoption were made in <ref type="bibr">Mallat's qualitative study in 2007.</ref> Based on this first round of studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Dahlberg et al. (2008)</ref> conducted a review of the literature on mobile payment systems, analyzing the various factors affecting mobile payment services and suggesting directions for future research. In this context, mobile payment referred to the use by individuals of mobile devices, including wireless phones, personal digital assistants, radio frequency devices, and near field communication-based devices (NFC), to make payments for goods and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Alkhowaiter, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Patil et al., 2020)</ref>. Several studies have analyzed the intention to use various mobile payment systems. Among the outstanding research are the studies on the use of short message service (SMS) as a mobile payment system <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2014)</ref>, on NFC technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Brumercikova &amp; Bukova, 2020)</ref>, and on quick response codes (QRs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Gao et al., 2018)</ref>, as well as on P2P payment <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2021)</ref>, biometric payment <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Pal et al., 2017)</ref>, and even wearables <ref type="bibr">(Singh &amp; Sinha, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Mobile payment adoption has been widely investigated in various countries. Fourteen studies have analyzed mobile payment adoption in European countries and 19 in greater China <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Liu et al., 2019)</ref>, but cross-country comparison emerged only recently. Mobile adoption in China has been compared with mobile adoption in Malaysia <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Ting et al., 2016)</ref>, the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Zhang et al., 2018)</ref>, and Pakistan <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Akhtar et al., 2019)</ref> but not in any European country. Research on mobile payment remains interesting for academia and the business sector, and most current research is based on the extension of classical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Tamilmani et al., 2021)</ref>. Thus, our research proposes the UTAUT2 model as its fundamental basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use</head><p>of Technology 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref> reviewed eight theories used to study how and why individuals adopt new information technologies. All the reviewed theoretical models employed intention and/or use as the key dependent variable. These theories were the theory of reasoned action <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975)</ref>, the TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Davis, 1985)</ref>, the motivational model <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Davis et al., 1992)</ref>, the theory of planned behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>, the combined TAM and theory of planned behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Taylor &amp; Todd, 1995)</ref>, the model of personal computer utilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Thompson et al., 1991)</ref>, the innovation diffusion theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Moore &amp; Benbasat, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Rogers, 2003)</ref>, and social cognitive theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bandura, 1986)</ref>. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), proposed by Venkatesh, synthesizes these older technology acceptance theories, and the resulting model has been employed in various studies on technology adoption. The constructs included in UTAUT are performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions moderated by gender, age, experience, and voluntariness of use. The UTAUT theory has been refined up to very recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Dwivedi et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The fact that technology adoption had been studied only within organizations represented a shortcoming of all the previous models. Given the increasing necessity of investigating the determinants of technology adoption among consumers, a revision of UTAUT was published in 2012 as UTAUT2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>, which incorporated three new constructs: hedonic motivation, price value, and habit. The voluntariness of use moderator was excluded. Recently, UTAUT and UTAUT2 have been the preferred theoretical approaches to investigating mobile payment adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Morosan &amp; DeFranco, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Slade et al., 2014)</ref>, including mobile payment adoption in the Chinese context <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Hongxia et al., 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Innovation Resistance Theory</head><p>Negative factors can inhibit consumer intention to adopt innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Laukkanen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Talke &amp; Heidenreich, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Heidenreich &amp; Kraemer, 2015)</ref>. The IRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Ram, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Ram &amp; Sheth, 1989)</ref> states that innovation means "change" to consumers and that resisting change is an expected response that must be overcome at the first stages of technology adoption. The authors suggest that users resist innovation because it represents possible changes to a satisfactory status quo or because it conflicts with the consumer's belief structure. They divide the barriers to innovation into functional and psychological barriers. The functional barriers include usage, value, and risk, while the psychological barriers include image and tradition.</p><p>Resistance is a natural response to innovations that provoke changes to lifestyles and previous behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Ram &amp; Sheth, 1989)</ref>. Organizations that offer innovative solutions urgently need to better understand the phenomenon of resistance to innovation as a crucial factor in failure or success when innovations are introduced to the market <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Heidenreich &amp; Kraemer, 2016)</ref>. Resistance to adoption can be divided into passive and active resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Heidenreich &amp; Handrich, 2015)</ref>. Active resistance responds to the characteristics of innovations, with the barriers to adoption arising from behavioral contradictions associated with the use, costs, and risks perceived in adopting an innovation. The functional barriers proposed by the IRT are suitable for studying active resistance. By contrast, passive resistance (associated with conflicts related to existing beliefs) can be studied by considering the psychological factors of image and tradition barriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Yu &amp; Chantatub, 2015)</ref>. The breadth of the IRT makes it suitable for the research proposed in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Kaur et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Several studies have examined the importance of barriers to the adoption of technological innovations. IRT has been adopted as a sole theoretical model for empirical investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Borraz-Mora et al., 2017)</ref> and also combined with other, complementary theoretical approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Lian &amp; Yen, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Oktavianus et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Moorthy et al., 2017)</ref>. Only recently has IRT been employed as the theoretical basis of mobile payment adoption, so studies seeking evidence on consumer resistance remain scarce <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Lin et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kaur et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Research Model and Hypotheses Development</head><p>The proposed research model assumes that both drivers and barriers to adoption impact the adoption of mobile payment and that they complement each other. A model comparing the adoption of technology in two countries with different adoption rates needs to consider both positive and negative factors to explain the phenomenon and provide more relevant results than a model that considers only one type of factor. Consequently, this study's research model integrates IRT and the UTAUT2. Four reasons support the decision to integrate the two models: (a) to increase our knowledge of consumer adoption, it is necessary to use broader theoretical models rather than a single adoption model <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Dahlberg et al., 2015)</ref>; (b) no single model is sufficiently comprehensive to cover all aspects of new technology adoption behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Shen et al., 2010)</ref>; (c) an integrative perspective provides a fuller account of a relationship's causal mechanism as well as unique insights that cannot be obtained from a single theory-driven model <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Jackson et al., 2013);</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">and (d)</ref> an integrated model ensures greater significance and predictability of results <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Oliveira et al., 2016)</ref>. The UTAUT2 and IRT have recently been integrated in other studies in fields close to mobile payment adoption; <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Soh et al. (2020)</ref> investigated the factors affecting perception, acceptance, and willingness among older adults in Malaysia in regard to online shopping, and Sivathanu (2019) studied the adoption of digital payment systems in India.</p><p>In the proposed research model, the UTAUT2 and IRT analyze, respectively, the drivers and barriers to adoption. Based on the UTAUT2, the proposed drivers include performance expectancy (PE), social influence (SI), facilitating conditions (FCs), hedonic motivation (HM), and price value (PV). The habit construct is not included in the model, as mobile payment systems have not been on the Italian market long enough and are not sufficiently widespread to generate a habit <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Oliveira et al., 2016)</ref>. Additionally, the UTAUT2's effort expectancy (EE) and IRT's usage barrier have a common origin, namely, the concepts of the complexity and ease of use of innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Venkatesh et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Laukkanen et al., 2008)</ref>. Therefore, only EE is included, as it belongs to the more empirically tested model. Based on IRT, the proposed barriers include the value barrier (VB), risk barrier (RB), tradition barrier (TB), and image barrier (IB). The first two barriers are functional barriers (VB, RB), whereas the other two (TB, IB) are psychological barriers. A reverse scale is used for some of the indicators of these variables. <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Venkatesh et al. (2012)</ref> used the behavioral intention (BI) to adopt mobile internet as a first-order dependent variable, whereas Laukkanen (2016) used the consumer decision to adopt mobile banking. Given the similar meaning of the two dependent variables, all the constructs of the proposed research model are defined as positive or negative determinants of BI.</p><p>The first six hypotheses derive from the UTAUT2 and reflect factors with a positive effect (drivers) on the BI to adopt mobile payment. The subsequent four hypotheses stem from IRT and deal with factors with a negative effect (barriers) on the BI to adopt mobile payment. In addition, the moderating effect of culture (using Hofstede's dimensions) is proposed to analyze differences in intention between Italian and Chinese users.</p><p>The research model is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">UTAUT2 Hypotheses</head><p>PE is "the degree to which using technology will provide benefits to consumers in performing certain activities" <ref type="bibr">(Venkatesh et al., 2012, p. 159)</ref>, and it is likely to exert one of the stronger influences on BI <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Venkatesh &amp; Zhang, 2010)</ref>. The utilitarian benefits offered by mobile payment are expected to be important drivers of adoption, as they offer a convenient way to complete financial transactions with virtually no spatial restrictions. The positive effect of PE on BI has been confirmed in research in the context of mobile payment <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Slade et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Teo et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Thakur, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Wang &amp; Yi, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>H1. PE positively influences the BI to adopt mobile payment.</p><p>SI indicates "the extent to which consumers perceive that important others (e.g., family and friends) believe they should use a particular technology" <ref type="bibr">(Venkatesh et al., 2012, p. 159)</ref>. Although SI has been widely tested in the context of mobile payment, the obtained results are mixed. Its impact on BI has been supported <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Slade et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Tan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Yang, 2012)</ref> as well as rejected <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Teo et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Wang &amp; Yi, 2012)</ref> across diverse empirical studies. Here, we assume that, when consumers recognize that mobile payment is important to their acquaintances and when their opinion is positive, consumers are encouraged to adopt mobile payment.</p><p>H2. SI positively influences the BI to adopt mobile payment.</p><p>FCs refer to "consumers' perceptions of the resources and support available to perform a behavior" <ref type="bibr">(Venkatesh et al., 2012, p. 159)</ref>. Using mobile payment requires infrastructure, such as reliable internet coverage, and personal attributes, such as a feeling of confidence when using a smartphone for payments. The BI to adopt mobile payment increases within a supporting operational infrastructure, and research on mobile payment supports the significant effects of FCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Teo et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Yang, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>H3. FCs positively influence the BI to adopt mobile payment.</p><p>HM is understood as "the fun or pleasure derived from using technology" <ref type="bibr">(Venkatesh et al., 2012, p. 159)</ref>. As a new form of payment, mobile payment has the potential to be enjoyable to users <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Oliveira et al., 2016)</ref>. If it is, in fact, enjoyable, they are more likely to adopt it.</p><p>H4. HM positively influences the BI to adopt mobile payment.</p><p>PV is defined as "consumers' cognitive tradeoff between the perceived benefits of the applications and the monetary cost for using them" <ref type="bibr">(Venkatesh et al., 2012, p. 159)</ref>. It may include factors such as device cost, mobile carrier costs, and transaction fees <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Baptista &amp; Oliveira, 2015)</ref>. Adoption increases when the perceived benefits of innovations are greater and when the perceived monetary value is low.</p><p>H5. PV positively influences the BI to adopt mobile payment.</p><p>EE is the "degree of ease associated with consumers' use of technology" <ref type="bibr">(Venkatesh et al., 2012, p. 159)</ref> and is strongly connected with the perceived ease-of-use concept in the TAM, from which also stems the usage barrier construct of IRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Laukkanen, 2016)</ref>.

Ten experts reviewed the methodology and the measurement scales to ensure content validity and the appropriateness of the questions' wording. We used 7-point Likert scales ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree" to measure the construct items.</p><p>The resulting questionnaire has three sections. After choosing the language and reading a brief introduction, the respondents were presented with questions on the measurement items of the research model, with one construct per page. Table 1 lists all the measurement items and their sources. All the questions in this section were mandatory, so the respondents could not proceed to the next page without answering all the questions on a page. For all the constructs, responses without an answer were deleted before analysis. To avoid order-effect bias, two-level randomization was applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Perreault, 1975)</ref>. The construct pages (except the page for BI) and the measurement items on each construct's page were randomized. The second section asked questions about sociodemographic data, including age, gender, education, experience, and income. In the Chinese questionnaire, income was expressed in renminbi, with amounts close to the corresponding euro values.</p><p>The questionnaire was originally written in English. It was translated into Chinese and Italian by native speakers (other than the authors) and then translated back into English by a different native speaker to ensure translation equivalence and consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Brislin, 1970)</ref>. If the original version of the questionnaire differed in meaning from the translation, necessary changes were made. This step was necessary for the Chinese translation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Measurement Model: Reliability and Validity</head><p>To verify the suitability of the measurement scales, we applied various forms of analysis: reliability, validity, exploratory (using the SPSS 15.0 program), and confirmatory (using AMOS 18 software). This research followed the two-step approach recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</ref>. First, the measurement model was tested for reliability and validity, and, second, the structural model was analyzed. The measurement model tested whether the indicators correctly measured the latent variables to which they were bound. Next, the structural model tested the relationship between the exogenous factors (PE, SI, FCs, HM, PV, EE, VB, RB, TB, IB) and the endogenous factor (BI) in the research model. Measurement and structural models were first run for the two countries pooled together. Next, differences between the countries were outlined through multi-group analysis (MGA).</p><p>We then performed an exploratory factor analysis of the principal components to assess the scales' degree of unidimensionality (Appendix 1). The analysis proved suitable for the variables under study given that: (a) the proportion of variance of all the variables (based on the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin coefficient) always exceeded the value of 0.5, indicating sampling adequacy; (b) Bartlett's test of sphericity showed a significance or p-value of 0.000, thus rejecting the null hypothesis of no difference between the correlation matrix and the identity matrix; and (c) the correlation coefficients of the anti-image correlation matrix of the main diagonal presented lower values <ref type="bibr">(Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2014b)</ref>.</p><p>The scales' reliability was assessed by the Cronbach's alpha indicator (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>), with 0.7 as the reference value. To test the convergent and divergent validity of the scales, a confirmatory factor analysis was performed. In this analysis, the items that contributed least to the explanatory power of the model were eliminated (R 2 &gt; 0.5). Convergent validity was evaluated using the factor loadings of the indicators. The coefficients were significantly different from zero, and the loadings between latent and observed variables were high in all cases (λ &gt; 0.7) (variables BI6, FCs3, and VB2 were eliminated). Consequently, we can deduce that the latent variables adequately explain the observed variables.</p><p>In our model, all the exogenous factors were measured through reflective indicators. In contrast to the behavior of formative indicators, changes in the latent construct were reflected in the indicators, which were represented with arrows heading toward the latent variable. By contrast, changes in the formative indicators caused a change in the latent construct, and these relationships were represented with an arrow heading toward the indicator <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> reports the average values and standard deviation of all the measurement items.</p><p>The PLS algorithm was used to analyze the constructs' measurement properties. To assess the reflective outer models, the following were analyzed: (a) indicator reliability, (b) construct reliability, (c) convergent validity, and (d) discriminant validity. Indicator reliability tests whether the indicators effectively reflect the latent variable and requires factor loadings to be greater than 0.7, and indicators of newly tested items with a factor loading between 0.4 and 0.7 are considered acceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Hulland, 1999)</ref>. Construct reliability estimates a construct's internal consistency and verifies that all the indicators measure the same construct. It is acceptable if the composite reliability and Cronbach's α are higher than 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 1988)</ref>. Average variance extracted (AVE) was used to test convergent validity. The AVE should be higher than 0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 1988)</ref>, meaning that the latent variable explains more than half of the variance of its indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hair et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Finding a weak correlation between the two items assessing the VB, we reverted to single item measurement, which enabled us to take advantage of a sound predictive validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bergkvist &amp; Rossiter, 2007)</ref>. Notably, the VB meets the condition of being a concrete attribute <ref type="bibr">(Rossiter, 2002)</ref>. Finally, the discriminant validity was analyzed to examine the various dimensions measured by each construct. The methods used in PLS are: (a) a cross-loading analysis to determine whether the average variance shared between a dimension and its items is higher than the variance shared with the model's other dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Barclay et al., 1995)</ref>; (b) the Fornell-Larcker criterion analysis, testing whether the correlations between the various dimensions are lower than the value of the square root of AVE <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>; and (c) heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio analysis, measuring whether the correlations between pairs of constructs reach less than 0.9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Henseler et al., 2015)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> gives the results of the second and third methods. In the present study, the values were close to the values recommended in the scientific literature. In light of these findings, the discriminant validity of the model was considered satisfactory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Evaluation of the Structural Model</head><p>First, the coefficient of multiple correlations to the square (R 2 ) was assessed, as it reliably indicates the amount of variance of the construct that was explained by the model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Falk and Miller (1992)</ref> posit that a suitable value should be higher than or equal to 0.100. In the present study, the value of R 2 with regard to BI was 0.689, so the recommended threshold was sufficiently exceeded. Second, we examined the standardized regression weights showing the relative weight of the factors in the endogenous variables. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Cohen (2013)</ref>, values higher than 0.2 are recommended. In this research, the effect of some variables did not exceed the established threshold, although the values obtained were significant. Among the significant relationships of the model are SI, FCs, HM, EE, and TB, which presented a value below the recommended values. <ref type="bibr">Falk and Miller (1992, p. 80</ref>) introduce a less exhaustive guideline and propose standardized regression weights of 0.15, whereby the predictor variable would explain at least 1.5% of the variance of a predicted variable. <ref type="bibr">Chin (1998a)</ref> also considers that values between 0.1 and 0.2 may be considered as moderate influence. Q 2 and f 2 were used to report predictive relevance and effect size <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hair et al., 2016)</ref>. Q 2 values above zero indicate that the model has predictive relevance. As Table <ref type="table">5</ref> demonstrates, BI had adequate predictive relevance. In effect sizes (f 2 ), values of 0.02-0.15, 0.15-0.35, and ≥0.35 indicate that an exogenous latent variable has a small, medium, or large effect, respectively <ref type="bibr">(Chin, 1998a)</ref>. Again, SI, FCs, HM, EE, and TB had a small-to-medium impact on BI, and PE had a medium impact on BI.</p><p>Finally, the value of the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Henseler et al., 2015)</ref> was used to compare the difference between the observed correlation and the predicted correlation as an indicator of model fit. A value below 0.08 is considered acceptable. The model in this research yielded a value close to that threshold (SRMR = 0.03). Therefore, the fit of the proposed model was considered to be adequate (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</p><p>After the global model was analyzed and we had verified whether there were differences at the level of the indicators in terms of the moderating variables, we checked whether those differences also existed at the structural level. To do so, we conducted an MGA <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Henseler et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Sarstedt et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Higueras-Castillo et al., 2019)</ref>. To this end, the sample was divided into two groups by nationality (Italy = 278; China = 227). Specifically, for each variable, the path coefficients of the two resulting structural models were compared, and we evaluated whether significant differences existed using a Student's t-test for independent samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Goodman &amp; Blum, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Molinillo et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>As a preliminary step, we explored the measurement invariance between the groups, following the three steps of the measurement of composite model invariance (MICOM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Henseler et al., 2016)</ref>  mean values and variances. To perform the second and third steps, we conducted a non-parametric test with 5,000 permutations. The MICOM analysis of the respondents' country variable found no significant differences in compositional scores between the two groups, but the third step yielded significant differences in the SI and BI variable measurements. Therefore, the MICOM results show a partial invariance of the measurement that was sufficient to merit applying MGA with the aim of comparing the groups' path coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Henseler et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Frías-Jamilena et al., 2019)</ref>. The results of the MGA confirm both reliability and convergent validity for both countries (see Appendices 2, 3, and 4).</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>, in the case of the Chinese respondents, the results reveal that only the relationships of BI with PE (H1) (β = 0.344; p &lt; 0.05), FCs (H3) (β = 0.147; p &lt; 0.05), and PV (H5) (β = 0.136; p &lt; 0.05) were significant. In this case, the model explains 63% of the BI to adopt mobile payment, demonstrating a sound explanatory power.</p><p>By contrast, in the sample of Italian respondents, the hypotheses derived from the relationships of BI with PE (H1) (β = 0.400; p = 0.000), SI (H2) (β = 0.149; p &lt; 0.050), and TB (H9) (β = -0.177; p = 0.000) were significant.

Furthermore, hypotheses H1a and H1b, proposing that the relationship between PE and BI is moderated, respectively, by the dimensions of individualism and long-term orientation, yielded no significant differences (H1a: p = 0.699; H1b: p = 0.699), although the path coefficients verify this relationship (β CHINA = 0.344; p = 0.016; β ITALY = 0.400; p &lt; 0.001). Hypotheses H3a and H6a, proposing respectively that the relationship between FCs and BI is moderated by power distance and that the relationship between EE and BI is moderated by long-term orientation, did not yield significant differences (H3a: p = 0.677; H6a: p = 0.483), and the path coefficients did not verify the relationship.</p></div>

This implies that respondents value the useful and advanced functions in mobile payment. SI is significantly divergent in the two countries, with a positive, significant influence for Italian respondents and a negative, non-significant effect for Chinese respondents (H2). This result supports previous findings, namely, that SI significantly differs between potential adopters and post-adopters <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Yang et al., 2012)</ref>. The divergent results can be explained by the fact that Italy is behind China in this technological adoption, leading people to rely more on their peers' opinions before using the new technology. The existing literature has found both a significant, positive influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2015)</ref> and a non-significant relationship between SI and BI <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Wang &amp; Yi, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Chen et al., 2019)</ref>. PV's influence on BI (H5) reflects a positive, significant relationship for Chinese respondents and no significant relationship for Italian respondents. This finding fits the divergent adoption patterns in the two countries; late adopters are usually less price sensitive (as holds in this study for the majority of Italian respondents) than early adopters <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Frank et al., 2015)</ref> (represented in this study by the Chinese sample). Respondents in China evaluated mobile payment in terms of costs and benefits, probably due to the wide use of the technology. FCs significantly influence the intention to use mobile payment for respondents in the Chinese sample but not for respondents in the Italian sample (H3), a result in line with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Baptista &amp; Oliveira, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Chopdar et al., 2018)</ref>. HM (H4) had no significant influence in either sample, which confirms the results of some previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Oliveira et al., 2016)</ref> but diverges from others <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Baptista &amp; Oliveira, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Chopdar et al., 2018)</ref>. HM may not be an appropriate construct for measuring the adoption of technologiesincluding mobile payment-that consumers use for utilitarian reasons, such as more effectively or efficiently performing a given task <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Tamilmani et al., 2019)</ref>. In line with the previous literature, EE (H6) had no significant influence in either sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Baptista &amp; Oliveira, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Oliveira et al., 2016)</ref>, implying that the respondents' decision-making in both countries is not affected by mobile payment's ease of use.</p><p>The results show differences between the two countries' samples when analyzing the moderating effect of culture. The Chinese users exhibited a stronger relationship in the hypotheses derived from FCs, PV, EE, VB, and IB, while the Italians had a stronger relationship in the hypotheses related to PE, SI, HM, RB, and TB. Significant differences were found only in the hypothesis derived from the effect of SI on BI, with Italian respondents showing a stronger relationship than the Chinese.</p><p>Finally, in relation to the hypotheses derived from the moderating effect of the individualism, uncertainly avoidance, power distance, and long-term oriented dimensions proposed by Hofstede, only the uncertainly avoidance dimension showed significant differences between SI and BI. This relationship is stronger in cultures with a high level of uncertainty avoidance (Italy) than in those with a lower value (China) as proposed by previous research. The other three dimensions could not be empirically verified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Theoretical Contributions</head><p>Our study investigated the reasons for the mobile payment adoption gap between China and Italy by analyzing individuals' propensity and resistance to technology adoption. We contribute to the literature first by proposing an integrated model based on UTAUT2 and IRT that aims to provide a holistic and comprehensive understanding of what triggers and inhibits mobile payment adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Leong et al., 2020)</ref>. As discussed in Section 3, an integrated perspective provides a fuller account of the causal mechanism underlying a relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Jackson et al., 2013)</ref>. This proved to be the case, as the R 2 value of the global model with regard to BI was 0.689, distinctly higher than the values of previous studies based only on drivers or barriers to adoption, resulting in R 2 values in the range of 0.5-0.6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Slade et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">, Kaur et al., 2020)</ref>. We also answer <ref type="bibr">Kaur et al.'s (2020)</ref> call for further investigation of the factors contributing to consumer resistance in the adoption of mobile payment solutions; those researchers proposed IRT as a theoretical framework meriting further investigation. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Tamilmani et al. (2021)</ref> conducted a systematic review of existing UTAUT2 studies, analyzing 650 articles. We close a gap in the literature by applying the UTAUT2 constructs to examine the association between the individual and demographic attributes in a cross-country context.</p><p>Our findings indicate that IRT has a weak explanatory power on BI when compared with the UTAUT2. To our knowledge, this study is the first to integrate UTAUT2 and IRT in a cross-country comparison of mobile payment adoption. Our findings demonstrate that IRT may not be suitable for analyzing the current factors of consumer resistance that inhibit the adoption of mobile payment in some contexts (e.g., cross-cultural studies). This conclusion is in line with others in the literature. As an illustration, the VB had no impact on intention to use in previous investigations of mobile banking <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Laukkanen, 2016)</ref> and mobile payment <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Upadhyay &amp; Jahanyan, 2016)</ref>. A possible explanation is that most mobile payment applications do not charge for processing transactions; thus, VB does not play a central role in the adoption decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Khanra et al., 2021)</ref>. RB also had no significant effect on the adoption of mobile banking (Laukkanen, 2016) or mobile payment systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Khanra et al., 2021)</ref>, and similar results were found in our samples from Italy and China. The IB findings conflict with the extant literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kaur et al. (2020)</ref> found no significant impact of IB, in contrast to prior studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Moorthy et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Oktavianus et al., 2017)</ref>. The authors argue that, when the respondents' level of technological orientation is high, IB is less likely to play a significant role in the intention to adopt mobile payment applications.</p><p>Combining the results of the cross-country comparison, three culture-related drivers are identified: (1) individualism and (2) long-term orientation enhance the effect of PE, and (3) power distance amplifies the effect of SI. The latter indicates that mobile payment users signal their superior social status by means of technical literacy. This result perfectly aligns with previous research by <ref type="bibr">Steenkamp et al. (1999, p. 66)</ref>, who argue that "[in] collectivistic countries, marketing communication for a new item should emphasize that it is accepted socially and allows consumers to express societal or group values." From their perspective, the new is useful to demonstrate wealth and performance. Not surprisingly, PE also appears to be propelled by underlying cultural dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Practical Implications</head><p>Constructs such as SI and TB behaved significantly differently in the two samples. SI had a positive influence on respondents in Italy but no influence on respondents in China. Consequently, app designers in Italy are encouraged to facilitate higher social interaction in the use of mobile payment through features such as sharing buttons that allow users to connect with friends when using mobile payment <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Tan et al., 2014)</ref>. Encouraging word of mouth, both offline and online, can also persuade consumers who have not yet adopted mobile payment <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Kaur et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>TB had no significant influence on Chinese respondents but significantly influenced Italian respondents, presumably because cash is now barely used in China, whereas it remains the preferred payment method in Italy. Mobile payment providers, together with public authorities when possible, should enhance the transition to mobile payment by increasing users' awareness of the benefits of cashless payment. Additionally, to reduce the impact of the TB, mobile payment providers must identify and measure the elements that affect the routines and habits in consumers' daily lives. One possibility is to offer free, simplified mobile payment services so that users can experience the solution and gradually change their payment pattern. Another possibility is to associate mobile payment with monetary rewards (e.g., lower charges) to encourage the use of this payment method <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Leong et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, aspects of China's cultural, infrastructural, and digital experience can be offered to users in Italy and other countries with lower levels of mobile payment adoption. A main reason that mobile payment is so popular in China may be that it has the support and promotion of the biggest digital players: e-commerce platforms and chat apps. Over the past few years, mobile payment has become available for most daily expenses. Means of transport (taxis, trains, and airplanes) accept mobile payment, making the Chinese population comfortable with a cashless routine. Policy makers and mobile payment providers in Italy must act together to promote quality information and ways for consumers to interact with one another. Consumers who avoid uncertainty place great value on the information they receive from other consumers in their circle of contacts. Therefore, recommendation from peers, in a digital or traditional form, will reduce uncertainty and increase mobile payment adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Tarhini et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Limitations and Future Research</head><p>One limitation relates to the sample. The Italian and Chinese samples differed in age distribution, and in both cases more women than men answered the questionnaire. Better sampling methods and dedicated agencies are available and should be used when resources allow. Second, this study adopted a cross-sectional rather than a longitudinal approach as in the original UTAUT2. Longitudinal research accounts for changes in consumers' BI to adopt a technology over time and is particularly useful for populations that are in an early stage of adoption, such as Italy's adoption of mobile payment. Third, this study used the data on national cultural dimensions available on Hofstede's official website. In the future, it would be more accurate if the data on cultural dimensions were gathered through the questionnaire's answers.</p><p>Future research should focus more closely on cross-country studies and differences in adoption patterns. The model presented in this study can be tested in various countries, especially those with different economic situations (developing countries such as Malaysia and India and developed countries such as European countries and the USA) or different cultures (for example, China and the USA). Further studies focusing on the European Union should be conducted to investigate whether drivers and barriers to adoption work similarly or differently in countries with the same currency but different cultural contexts.</p><p>Another potential direction for research is improving the proposed model, including mediator effects, such as considering the impact of age, gender, and experience with mobile payment. The model can be improved by considering other technologies (e.g., China used QR codes, whereas Italy mainly used NFCs). Previous research on the role of technology (Ramos de <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Luna et al., 2018)</ref> could be included in cross-country studies.</p></div>
