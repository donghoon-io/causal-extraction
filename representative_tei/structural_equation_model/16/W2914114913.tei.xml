<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Mobile payments have become one of the technological revolutions of modern times, and they have disrupted and dominated markets in both the developing and the developed world. In 2014, it was estimated that global mobile payment services would have 450 million users by 2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Slade et al., 2014)</ref>, and now the future projections point to an estimated 720 million subscribers by 2020 <ref type="bibr">(GSMA, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>While it is believed that mobile payments are the key to driving economic development in developing countries, mobile payments continue to create opportunities to earn money, and even to create new business ventures, thus empowering the general populations in developing countries <ref type="bibr">(GSMA, 2016)</ref>. South Africa is one of the three largest markets in Africa in terms of mobile subscribers (GSMA, 2016) so that understanding the usage of South African users of mobile payment apps is important, in order to grow the mobile payment market. Furthermore, research shedding light on the reasons for the slow uptake and more importantly, how to enhance the uptake of mobile payment apps is very sparse.</p><p>There is abundant literature examining the factors that impact on the initial adoption of information technology services <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Liebana-Cabanillas et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mallat, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pham and Ho, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Slade et al., 2014)</ref>. The majority of these adoption studies have been conducted in developed countries, with little evidence to suggest mobile payment adoption studies focusing on developing countries. Similarly, there also seems to be growing academic attention being paid to consumer's continued use of information technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kim and Crowston, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mouakket and Bettayeb, 2015)</ref>, including mobile payment apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Zhou, 2011)</ref>, but only in developed countries. Both Greenland and Kwansah-Aidoo (2012)'s argument support the notion that international academic journals still neglect research in emerging markets, especially in the less developed countries of Sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>There have also been conflicting reports in the adoption of mobile payments between developing and developed countries. Some reports indicate that mobile payments gained more traction in developed nations because of plentiful possibilities to shop on mobile phones <ref type="bibr">(Statistica, 2018</ref>). Yet, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Flood et al. (2013)</ref> reported that mobile payments initiated by short message service (SMS) occurred in developing countries well ahead of developed countries because the mature payment systems eroded the need for payments initiated by SMSs. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kshetri and Acharya (2012)</ref> reported that mobile payments in developing countries spread rapidly due to limited alternatives to cash, such as credit cards and cheque accounts as well as due to the fact that mobile payment apps may be the panacea for the financially excluded communities in Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Makina, 2017</ref>). Yet, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gupta and Garg (2015)</ref> indicated that South African consumers are not ready to adopt mobile payments because of the sophisticated banking industry.</p><p>Despite these inconsistent reports, experts tend to agree that the future of traditional payments such as cash, debit and credit cards, is on the demise and as a result banks, retailers, and mobile network operators are entering the mobile payment space to facilitate the mobile based consumption of their services <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Shrier et al., 2016)</ref>, often with limited information, as little attention has been paid to understanding the factors that predict the adoption and the intention to continue to use the ensued mobile payment apps.</p><p>Furthermore there seems to be a lack of consensus among researchers regarding a clear distinction between the factors that influence adoption and the intention to continue to use various mobile technologies. Previous adoption studies have studied consumers' continued use of various information technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kim and Crowston, 2011)</ref>. Constructs such as perceived cost, perceived risk, perceived ease-of-use and perceived usefulness have been studied to examine both consumers' adoption and intention to continue to use various new technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cho, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hung et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liebaña-Cabanillas et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Makanyeza and Mutambayashata, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Parasuraman, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Setterstrom et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, other scholars, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Eriksson and Nilsson (2007)</ref>, argue that researchers need to clearly delineate between the adoption and the continuance factors because consumer adoption and the intention to continue to use any new technology are influenced by different factors. Support for this argument is offered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Schuster et al. (2015)</ref>, who reported that consumers' attitudes and perceptions change after experiencing a service. These contradictions require further research to provide a better understanding of the extent to which factors that lead to adoption can also lead to the continued use of the new technology.</p><p>Since adoption can be viewed as the initial step for continued use to take place, this suggests that the two phenomena should be studied collectively. However, a review of the literature shows that studies examining the initial adoption and the continuance intention have been conducted separately, thereby leading to a siloed or compartmentalised approach for doing research and this in turn, leads to a fragmented view instead of a more integrated and holistic perspective.</p><p>From a business perspective, examining user adoption and the intention to continue to use is important because "the irregular and ineffective long-term use of new technologies often contributes to corporate failure" <ref type="bibr">(Bhattacherjee, 2001, p.352)</ref>. Thus, until the continued usage of an information technology, such as mobile payments can be established, one cannot classify its adoption as a success <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Thong et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>To supplement the dearth of empirical studies on the topic, and to provide a more integrated approach, this study examines both the initial adoption and the continued use of mobile payment apps concurrently in a single study, and in the context of an emerging economy, which researchers believe has not been covered in depth to date. Drawing on the technology readiness index (TRI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Parasuraman, 2000)</ref> and the extended expectation-confirmation model in the context of information technology (E-ECM-IT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Thong et al., 2006)</ref>, this study proposes and empirically tests a conceptual model using structural equation modelling (SEM) to predict the adoption and the intention to continue to use mobile payment apps.</p><p>Firstly, the integration is intended to build a theoretical framework that can enhance the understanding of the factors that impact on adoption and continuance intention. Secondly, the study aims to empirically validate the proposed integrated model in the context of mobile payment apps. Thirdly, and from a practical perspective, the study may help service providers such as banks to appropriately invest the required resources in the development and provision of mobile payment services <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kim, Mirusmonov and Lee, 2010)</ref> that not only attract new users, but also retain existing ones for the realisation of their financial investments. Lastly, "a combination of theories can collectively provide a better and more comprehensive understanding of consumer behaviour regarding their IT usage than when each theory is considered alone" <ref type="bibr">(Chong, 2013, p.24)</ref>.</p><p>In the light of the above, there seems to be sufficient motivation to create a hybrid model.</p><p>Hence, the TRI and E-ECM-IT constructs have been integrated to ground this study, in order to better explain and broaden this sparsely researched perspective. <ref type="bibr">-Cabanillas et al. (2015)</ref> describe mobile payments as a convenient, safe and simplified payment transaction that uses a mobile device. From a consumer's perspective, mobile payments refer to purchases that are instigated and processed via a mobile phone <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Schierz et al., 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dahlberg et al. (2008)</ref> describe mobile payments from a device point of view as the payments that use a mobile phone or a tablet that utilises wireless communication technologies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Liebaña</head><p>Based on the above conceptualisations, mobile payments are described in the context of this study, as a payment form that utilises an app-enabled mobile phone instead of cash, cheque or bank card to pay for goods and services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Development of a theoretical framework</head><p>The technology readiness index (TRI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Parasuraman, 2000)</ref>, was used as theoretical underpinning for adoption because it relates to an individual person's predisposition to use new technology, as well as the general thoughts and feelings about the new technology, and it is especially relevant to marketing settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lin et al., 2007)</ref>. Furthermore, the TRI considers the individual differences between the drivers and the inhibitors of technology adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Parasuraman, 2000)</ref>, which is congruent with our study that seeks to determine the factors that influence an individual to adopt mobile payment apps.</p><p>The E-ECM-IT, on the other hand, is suited to further our understanding of the continued use of mobile payment services as it examines the salient factors that affect the user's post-adoption usage of a new technology. It uses consumers' affective and cognitive beliefs experienced during consumption in order to predict satisfaction and the intention to continue to use the new technology. The model is applicable to a wide range of information systems service repurchasing and continuance and it has gained widespread acceptance in the literature to predict satisfaction and continuance intention <ref type="bibr">(Hsu et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>As noted earlier, the proposed framework for this study is a combination of two perspectives of the TRI and the E-ECM-IT in order to provide a holistic explanation of adoption and continuance intention behaviour in the context of mobile payments, as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>It is therefore hypothesise that consumers' technology readiness significantly influences their cognitive and affective evaluations of mobile payment apps. Given the significant changes in the mobile technological developments and their impact on people's lives, the updated 16-item TRI 2.0 has become a relevant theoretical basis to understand consumers' reactions to the new technologies. In streamlining the original TRI, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Parasuraman and Colby (2015)</ref> concluded that the TRI 2.0 has wider applicability because it is concise and thus makes it more robust for use across different contexts. More so, the TRI 2.0 can be used to assess technology readiness within a particular demographic group and is useful in understanding consumer dynamics behind technology adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Parasuraman and Colby, 2015)</ref>. The TRI comprises four constructs: optimism and innovativeness as drivers and discomfort and insecurity as inhibitors of adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Parasuraman, 2000)</ref>. To reflect the changing landscape and specific factors pertaining to the mobile payment context to improve the predictive ability of the TRI, four additions were made to the TRI: convenience, compatibility, perceived cost and perceived risk. Prior studies have reported positive relationships between convenience (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kerviler et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Liao et al., 2012)</ref> as well as compatibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kwasawneh and Irshaidat, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Liebana-Cabanillas et al., 2015)</ref> and the adoption of mobile banking. In a similar fashion, perceived risk and cost have also been identified as significant inhibitors of new technology adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chong et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mallat, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pham and Ho, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Drivers of the technology readiness</head><p>Optimism refers to a positive attitude and the confidence that the new technology will improve users' personal lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Parasuraman and Colby, 2015)</ref>, while innovativeness is a consumer's predisposition to try out new information technologies rather than remain using previous choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kim et al., 2010)</ref>. Prior studies have shown that both optimism and innovativeness positively influence the adoption of new technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Parasuraman, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kim et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The ability of mobile payments to eradicate multiple cards <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Tan et al., 2015)</ref>, making payment transactions, viewing balances, initiating and authorising transactions, regardless of time and location <ref type="bibr">(Herzberg, 2003)</ref>, makes mobile payments more convenient when compared with the traditional forms of payment. Another possible driver of adoption is the compatibility of the new technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kwasawneh and Irshaidat, 2017)</ref>. If users perceive a technology as being consistent and in harmony with their behaviour, habits, values and needs <ref type="bibr">(Liebaña-Cabanillas et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mallat, 2007)</ref>, this would enhance their adoption levels.</p><p>In the light of the above, it can be hypothesised that:</p><p>H1-4: Drivers (optimism, innovativeness, convenience and compatibility) have a positive effect on the adoption of mobile payment apps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Inhibitors of technology readiness</head><p>Insecurity, described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Parasuraman and Colby (2015)</ref> as the suspicions that consumers have regarding the new technology, in terms of its possible failure to deliver the expected benefits and its possible harmful effects, could inhibit the adoption of mobile payment apps.</p><p>Additionally, discomfort, the perceived feeling of uneasiness regarding whether the consumer would be able to use and control the new technology to their advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Parasuraman and Colby, 2015)</ref>, could also slow down the adoption of an innovation.</p><p>Users who experience discomfort in using the new technology feel overwhelmed by the use thereof <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Walczuch et al., 2007)</ref> so that they would be less receptive of new technology. Several studies have found a negative relationship between high levels of discomfort and insecurity and the adoption of the new technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Walczuch et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Parasuraman, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>In a study done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mallat (2007)</ref>, the cost of using mobile payments negatively impacted consumers' willingness to adopt mobile payments. The results of their study indicated that consumers resent mobile payments that transfer the transaction costs to consumers, without any added advantages. In the same way, the probability of a loss or injury (perceived risk) that might be caused by the use of the new technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Pham and Ho, 2015)</ref>, could also jeopardise the chances of adopting the new technology.</p><p>Prior studies have considered the perception of risk as a deterrent factor in the adoption of mobile payments <ref type="bibr">(Mallat, 2007, Pham and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Ho, 2015)</ref>. Consequently, we hypothesise that:</p><p>H 5-8 Inhibitors (discomfort, insecurity, perceived cost and perceived risk) have a negative effect on the adoption of mobile payment apps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Adoption vis-a-vis confirmation</head><p>Adoption theory explains why an individual accepts or rejects an innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Straub, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Adoption thus takes place if the mobile payment app is appropriate for the task at hand in terms of convenience and compatibility with user values, beliefs and lifestyle, and whether their pre-use expectations are met or confirmed. If a consumer encounters obstacles, such as cost, risk, insecurity or discomfort in mobile payment app transactions, this could lead to disappointment, resulting in the rejection of the mobile payment app.</p><p>In a similar fashion, confirmation of expectations are realised if the product meets or exceeds the consumers' prior expectations, but when the product or service falls short of expectations, there would be disconfirmation, leading to rejection of the product or service <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Oliver, 1980)</ref>.</p><p>This study describes confirmation as the perception of consistency between the drivers and inhibitors in using the mobile payment app and in the actual adoption thereof. From the above, it can be observed that the conceptualisation between confirmation (the performance of the product as expected) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bhattacherjee, 2001)</ref> and adoption (a choice to accept or reject an innovation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Straub, 2009)</ref> suggests that confirmation and adoption are terms that can be used interchangeably because both of these measure consumers' experience after using a new technology.</p><p>In other words, both adoption and confirmation take into account the actual experience of using the mobile payment app to confirm/adopt, or refute the initial expectations of the service. As a consequence, we argue that the modified TRI predicts adoption. The adoption of the new technology reflects the confirmation of expectations that serve as an antecedent (indirectly through satisfaction) to the continued use thereof.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Continuance intention to use mobile payment apps</head><p>The E-ECM-IT proposes that confirmation, perceived ease-of-use and perceived usefulness, positively predict satisfaction and the intention to continue to use mobile payment apps. The impact of confirmation (adoption) on satisfaction, perceived ease-of-use, and on perceived usefulness has been reported in various contexts, such as online banking <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bhattacherjee, 2001)</ref>, general information-technology behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Hong et al., 2006)</ref> and smartphone-banking services <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Susanto et al., 2016)</ref>. Each of these constructs will now be discussed in detail. <ref type="bibr">Davis (1989, p.320)</ref> defines perceived usefulness as "the belief that using a particular innovation or technology would improve one's job performance". In the context of our proposed model, perceived usefulness represents the practical benefits that an individual experiences when using mobile payment apps. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Hong et al. (2006)</ref> reported that user's perceived usefulness of a new technology is a key determinant of satisfaction and continuance intention.</p><p>Many studies have pointed to the direct effects of the perceived ease-of-use on perceived usefulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cho, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kim et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liebaña-Cabanillas et al., 2015)</ref>. A new technology regarded as being easy to use facilitates the accomplishment of more individual tasks than a new technology with lower perceived ease-of-use <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ashraf et al., 2014)</ref>. According to these authors, systems that are easy to use are more accessible and they would influence the perceived usefulness. It stands to reason that mobile payment apps that are easy to use will be more accessible and therefore, they would influence the perceived usefulness thereof.</p><p>Given that user satisfaction is a type of an emotion, if mobile payments are considered easy to use, consumers' level of satisfaction with the new technology would be enhanced <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Thong et al., 2006)</ref>. Prior studies have also indicated that the perceived ease-of-use can have an indirect effect on the continuance intention through usefulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cho, 2016)</ref>. This implies that when an individual realises that few resources are needed to learn a new mobile technology, he or she may perceive the technology as being useful, which leads to the continued use thereof.</p><p>Satisfaction is one of the positive emotions experienced by the consumer from using the mobile payment app. Satisfied customers can provide not only an effective channel to attract new users via word-of-mouth communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Thong et al., 2006)</ref>, but they can also act as a steady and reliable source of revenue, resulting from repeated business <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Hong et al., 2006)</ref>. However, more importantly, previous studies have demonstrated that satisfaction is a fundamental driving force for continued use <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Eriksson and Nilsson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mouakket and Bettayeb, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Thong et al., 2006)</ref>. Continuance intention can be defined as the degree to which an individual currently using a mobile phone to purchase products or services has developed conscious plans to continue using it in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Setterstrom et al., 2013)</ref>. Consumers' continuance intentions are determined by their satisfaction with prior use and this association has been corroborated in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Hong et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the above, it can be hypothesised that:</p><p>H9 Adoption of mobile payment apps has a positive effect on satisfaction.</p><p>H10 Adoption of mobile payment apps has a positive effect on usefulness.</p><p>H11 Adoption of mobile payment apps has a positive effect on ease-of-use.</p><p>H12 Perceived ease-of-use of mobile payment apps has a positive effect on usefulness.</p><p>H13 Perceived ease-of-use of mobile payment apps has a positive effect on satisfaction.</p><p>H14 Perceived ease-of-use of mobile payment apps has a positive effect on continuance intention.</p><p>H15 Perceived usefulness of mobile payment apps has a positive effect on satisfaction.</p><p>H16 Perceived usefulness of mobile payment apps has a positive effect on continuance intention.</p><p>H17 Satisfaction with mobile payment apps has a positive effect on continuance intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>The participants of the survey were adults aged 18 years and older, who had downloaded a mobile payment app prior to participating in the study. Convenience sampling was used to distribute a self-administered questionnaire via an online South African consumer panel hosted by an international research firm, resulting in a sample of 426 respondents. Existing scales were adopted from literature and slightly adapted to reflect the mobile payment app content and 7-point Likert scales points were used with 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree).</p><p>The questionnaire consisted of three sections. Section A pertained to mobile payment app usage while section B contained statements measuring the extent of adoption and the continuance intention to do so. Section C pertained to the demographic information of the respondents. The 4-item scales measuring optimism, innovativeness, discomfort, and insecurity, were all adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Parasuraman and Colby (2015)</ref>. Scales measuring convenience (4 items) and perceived ease-of-use (5 items) were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kim et al. (2010)</ref>. Perceived cost (3 items) were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kim (2010)</ref> while compatibility (3 items) were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Schierz et al. (2010)</ref>. Perceived risk consists of three scale items and were taken from Ramos-de-Luna et al.</p><p>(2015). Adoption, continued intention and perceived usefulness scales were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bhattacherjee (2001)</ref>, while the four-item satisfaction scale were taken from Susanto et al.</p><p>(2016). The questionnaire was pre-tested before it was distributed.</p></div>

Overall, the presence of drivers seem to be stronger predictors of the adoption of mobile payment apps than do the absence of inhibitors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>Previous studies on mobile payment services have not fully investigated both the factors that influence consumers' intention to adopt and the continuance use of various mobile payment apps in a single study. This study attempts to fill this research gap, by introducing a new integrated model, combining the constructs derived from the modified TRI and the E-ECM-IT.</p><p>Firstly, the results challenge some of the basic dimensions of the TRI as several of the original TRI relationships were not confirmed in our context. Optimism, innovativeness and discomfort were insignificant in predicting the adoption of mobile payment apps in South Africa. These unforeseen results are contrary to the findings of previous studies in developed countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gupta and Garg, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Meng et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Walczuch et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>A plausible explanation could be the fact that the TRI was developed from an American perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Meng et al., 2009)</ref> such that it requires further testing in other Sub-Saharan countries as individuals could differ in their personality traits and their acceptance of a new technology. The result suggests that some of the American/Western theories are not always significant in the context of developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Duh, 2015)</ref>, thereby highlighting the importance of conducting research, such as that of our study to test the applicability of Western theories in the context of Africa. Despite that, the results are supportive of the majority of hypotheses and they provide a better understanding of what influences consumers to initially adopt mobile payment apps as indicated in the variance explained (81.8%) in the adoption of mobile payment apps.</p><p>The overall indication is that banks and other service providers should focus more on the driving factors than on the inhibiting factors. Convenience and compatibility emerged as strong contributors to the adoption of mobile payment apps. This implies that consumers' perception of convenience and compatibility with their life style enhances their intention to adopt and use mobile payment apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mallat, 2007)</ref>. Thus, the convenience of being able to use mobile payment apps anytime and in any situation, and the execution of mobile payment services befitting consumers' purchase behaviours are important considerations.</p><p>A key measure of success of a mobile payment service is its adoption by the intended users <ref type="bibr">(Makanyaza and Mutambayashata, 2018)</ref>. Therefore, service providers ought to craft tangible solutions based on the fundamental driving forces affecting the adoption of mobile payment apps if they are to realise the economic value that can be derived from mobile payments. This is important, particularly in developing countries experiencing growth in the ubiquity of mobile phones and broadened financial access, from which mobile payments are expected to create more opportunities for financial inclusion.</p><p>This study corroborates the findings of Kalan ( <ref type="formula">2016</ref>), who underscored the impact of risk as a deterrent to the adoption of mobile payment apps in South Africa. Our study revealed that the perception of apps being risky and costly, reduces consumers' propensity to embrace them.</p><p>Unless service providers can reduce the transaction costs and improve the transparency of mobile payment transactions, consumers' perception of the high costs associated with mobile payments would hinder the adoption process <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Zhou, 2011)</ref>. This finding was also corroborated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chong (2013)</ref>, who cautioned service providers against pricing their services beyond those of the competition as some of the competitors offer the services without requiring any payment at all.</p><p>In terms of the intention to continue to use mobile payment apps, the findings validate the majority of the hypothesised paths of the E-ECM-IT, except H15 and H16, challenging previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Hong et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Thong et al., 2006)</ref>. However, they corroborate other previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bhattacherjee, 2001</ref><ref type="bibr">, Hsu et al., 2006)</ref> indicating that confirmation (adoption) exerts a strong effect on satisfaction. Thus, meeting or exceeding users' expectations such as accurate billing and transaction records in mobile payments are crucial elements in effecting high satisfaction levels. Ease-of-use was a significant predictor of satisfaction and the intention to continue to use mobile payment apps but it showed an inverse relationship. This result warrants further investigation, in order to determine whether indeed the importance of ease-ofuse diminishes with experience.</p><p>Usefulness was also found to be a significant predictor of satisfaction but it was not found to directly affect the intention to continue to use mobile payment apps. It seems as if usefulness could have a more indirect effect through satisfaction on the intention to continue to use the mobile payment apps. Although not expected, this result supports the findings by Hung et al.</p><p>(2012), who reported that consumers are not motivated by past benefits, but rather by future benefits. No matter how good the mobile payment system was in the past, its future use is based on the expectations of future benefits. Therefore, the motivation to continue using mobile payment apps is dependent on the anticipated future benefits rather than on the usefulness thereof.</p><p>Satisfaction emerged as the strongest predictor of the intention to continue to use mobile payment apps. It is important to ensure that customer experiences are consistent in order to strengthen their continuance intention; because satisfaction is a result of meeting customers' expectations of the service (confirmation/adoption), as well as the usefulness and the ease-ofuse of the app.</p><p>The emphasis should be placed on important issues, such as reliable connectivity and security to bring about a sense of satisfaction that would lead to the continued use of mobile payment apps. Since the majority of the E-ECM-IT relationships were confirmed, this suggests that the model could be suitable for use in the African context. Overall, the results thus provide empirical evidence for the proposed integrated model's predictive capabilities in terms of mobile payment app adoption and continued use, and they suggest that it is generic enough to apply to various new technology adoption and continuance intention studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6</head><p>Implications of the study</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Theoretical implications</head><p>The first theoretical contribution of this study is the development of a synthesised model, based on the TRI and E-ECM-IT in order to explain users' the adoption and their intention to continue to use mobile payment apps. The study theorised that technology readiness significantly influences continuance intention through the direct and indirect effects of ease-of-use, usefulness and satisfaction. And indeed, the findings of this study show that mobile payment readiness significantly influences consumers' intention to continue using the mobile payment apps.</p><p>Our second contribution lies in the expanding of the original TRI by including four additional constructs taken from the existing literature, namely convenience, compatibility, cost and risk, which are found to be useful in the context of mobile payments. Because some of the relationships in the original TRI were not confirmed, the modified TRI 2.0 might be a more applicable model for investigating the adoption of mobile payment apps in developing countries, than the original one.</p><p>Overall, the model explained 78.5% of the variance in the intention to continue to use mobile payment apps, a percentage much higher, when compared with the variance explained in previous related studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bhattacherjee, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Hong et al., 2006)</ref>, thereby signifying the robustness of the proposed integrated model. The results indicate that the proposed model is suitable enough and it now needs validation through additional research, in order to confirm its ability to predict the adoption and the intention to continue to use new technologies.</p><p>Thirdly the study contributes to the growing body of literature on mobile payments, and specifically on payment apps in Sub-Saharan economies, as not much had been done in the context of emerging economies, such as that of South Africa, where local market factors are conducive to mobile payment systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Managerial implications</head><p>It emerged that ease-of-use and usefulness are prerequisites for customer satisfaction, and ultimately the intention to continue using mobile payment apps. Ease-of-use plays a vital role in customers' interaction with a mobile payment app, and is regarded as an important 'moment of truth' to cement the foundation for a lasting relationship. For any mobile payment experience to be memorable, not only has it to be compatible with users' lifestyle but also be more convenient and safer (less risks and insecurity) than traditional payment methods. However, for consumers to continue to use mobile payment apps, compatibility and convenience may not be enough. Service providers should craft sustainable and distinct value propositions based not only on convenience and compatibility, but also emphasising the ease-of-use, and usefulness benefits of the safe, single payment method offered by mobile payment apps. Unfortunately, currently marketing communications depicting these benefits of mobile payments apps in South Africa are scarce. Proactive marketing communications creating awareness of these benefits as well encouraging downloads of these apps using special discounts, friend referrals, encouragement by retailers and assistance for first time users, are needed to enhance adoption.</p><p>Furthermore, marketing strategies such as customer alerts, notifications, reminders via tailored messages to customers and loyalty rewards could enhance the intention to continue to use mobile payments apps.</p><p>It is also evident that the key obstacles to adoption revolve around the issue of security and risk involved in the download and first time use of mobile payment apps. One way to address the problem is to provide training and assistance to first time users of mobile payment apps to demonstrate how to use the app and showcase the safety features. This could be facilitated via short YouTube videos or instructions on mobile service providers and banks' websites, stepby-step instructions printed on invoices or retail staff such as waiters. Due to an increase in mobile payment options, consumers store their personal details on a variety of mobile payment platforms, which increases the risks of hacking and fraud. Therefore, security features such as encryption, biometrics, and authentication should be given due consideration, as they offer safety benefits to consumers and merchants <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Delloite and Touche, 2015)</ref>. More importantly, service providers need to offer consumers sufficient documentation and avoid any transaction errors that may arise during the process. Security is especially relevant to South Africans as they are considered to be risk averse <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Babin and Harris, 2014)</ref>, which could result in the slow adoption of unfamiliar technologies. To prevent any scepticisms about mobile payments, service providers must provide greater amounts of mobile payment app information and educate consumers on how value is obtained by using these apps. The banking sector could play an important role in reducing the insecurity of users by more publicly supporting mobile payments apps and even work more closely with mobile payment app developers.</p><p>The relationship between satisfaction and the intention to continue to use mobile technology has long been proven <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Singh et al., 2017)</ref>. If consumers prefer doing transactions via mobile payments apps and are satisfied with the service, their usage will increase over time. Thus, service providers should constantly measure the satisfaction level of users with short surveys via the app, to identify and rectify service failures.</p><p>In South Africa, popular mobile payment apps such as SnapScan and Zapper are not linked to debit cards but are compatible with credit cards. This can lead to a loss of customers due to transaction costs associated with the use of credit cards, as well as excluding the unbanked population. Therefore, service providers should devise mobile payment apps that are compatible with multiple bank cards or no cards at all to ensure that more consumers can utilise mobile payment apps. South Africa is reflective of other developing economies because it is estimated that 7 million people in South Africa are on payrolls yet they do not own any bank account <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Vodacom, 2015)</ref>. With this sizeable unbanked population that depend on cash, mobile payments are expected to fill an important gap. Mobile payment apps could provide an opportunity for the unbanked population to 'leapfrog' past the 'card stage' directly to mobile payment apps.</p><p>Convincing consumers to convert from traditional payment methods to mobile payment apps requires the collaboration of several role-players. Although the customer is an important player, other stakeholders such as government, financial institutions such as banks, mobile providers and merchants' collaboration is needed. Government, banks and network operators need to provide and enabling environment to push mobile payment apps while merchants need to pull customers towards mobile payment adoption and use, creating a seamless customer experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Limitations and direction for future research</head><p>The primary objective of this study was to test the applicability of the proposed integrated model in the context of a developing country. As mobile technology continues to advance and diffuse into society, it is hoped that the findings reported in this study have contributed to the understanding of the mobile technology adoption and the continued use thereof.</p><p>This research has limitations worth noting such as a single country context and the convenience sampling technique which was employed to collect data. Due to the fact that not all hypotheses in the study were confirmed, future replication studies are needed to determine whether similar results would be obtained, and whether a more parsimonious model exists.</p><p>In conclusion, we argue that mobile payment apps are becoming more prevalent and possibly they hold the key to unlocking economic growth in Africa. We urge other researchers to explore future research avenues across different cultures, in order to increase the momentum in the uptake of mobile payment apps to ensure economic growth in Africa.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Technology readiness and extended expectation-confirmation measurement model in the context of mobile payments</figDesc><graphic coords="7,72.00,107.60,451.29,202.05" type="bitmap" /></figure>

This result (78.5% of variance explained) is thus better compared to similar studies as the model explains more variance. Hong et al. (2006), reported only 67% of the variance explained in their e-services study, and the study of Hsiao and Chang (2014), reported only 54% of variance in a mobile advertising study, both of which only employed the E-ECM-IT in isolation to predict continued technology usage behaviour. The improved variance explained could be due to the combination of the TRI and EECM-IT into one comprehensive model, further indicating the importance of investigating adoption as the first step in the intention to continue to use mobile payments.</figDesc></figure>
