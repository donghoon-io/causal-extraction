<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fast fashion retailing is leading consumers towards an increased rate of purchasing and the trend to keep clothing for an ever shorter time with the resulting rise in clothing disposal.</p><p>The aim of this paper is to empirically explore antecedents of two methods of sustainable clothing disposal behaviour in two countries: donating to charities and giving away to family and friends. Using data from females located in Australia and Chile, the authors test the proposed model with structural equation modelling (SEM). The results of this study show that consumer recycling behaviour is a strong and direct driver of donating to charity. In addition, results find that consumer awareness of the environment and consumer age affect donating behaviour. The findings have value for fast fashion retailers, marketers, environmental activists, ecological researchers, charity institutions and public policy makers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Fast fashion retailers such as H&amp;M, Zara and Topshop are introducing new lines every two to three weeks at very low prices, to maximise sales through impulse purchasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McAfee et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Foroohar and Stabe, 2005)</ref>. As a result, many consumers expect constant change so new products have to be available on a frequent basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bruce and Daly, 2006)</ref>. With the advent of small but frequent collections of merchandise, these fast fashion retailers are encouraging consumers to visit their stores and dispose of their clothing more often, following the idea of "here today, gone tomorrow" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bhardwaj and Fairhurst, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>During the 1970's and 1980's, there was increased concern with environmental and ethical issues among marketing scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson and Cunningham, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Doane, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Sanne, 2002)</ref>. This has encouraged new areas of research related to the effect of the environment on consumer behaviour. In addition, several international conferences provided a forum for discussion <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Strong, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Robins and Roberts, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kalafatis et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Jones et al., 2005)</ref>. One of the main themes that emerged from this was that of sustainable consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jackson, 2004)</ref> which is defined as 'consumption that supports the ability of current and future generations to meet their material and other needs, without causing irreversible damage to the environment or loss of function in natural systems' <ref type="bibr">(Jackson and Michaelis, 2003, p. 14)</ref>. Creating meaningful progress towards sustainable consumption requires the acceptance of responsible and sustainable consumption and disposal behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Peattie and Peattie, 2009)</ref>. This applies both to industrialised as well as less industrialised countries that have rapid growing populations.</p><p>Despite the interest in environmental issues, little empirical research has addressed the effect of environmental attitudes on the purchasing process of clothing and textiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Butler and Francis, 1997)</ref>. This aspect of consumer behaviour is a new area of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Holbrook, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">de Coverly et al., 2003)</ref>, and involves the pre-purchase and post-purchase components <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jacoby et al., 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hiller, 2010)</ref>. Post waste is defined as any type of garment that the owner no longer needs and decides to discard <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chen and Burns, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hawley, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The post-purchase component of the clothing consumption process involves whether clothing is re-used, recycled or simply discarded or destroyed <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ha-Brookshire and Hodges 2009)</ref>.These textile products are sometimes given to charities or passed on to family or friends, but are also discarded and end up in municipal landfills. Although macro marketing advocates sustainable consumption as a means for sustainable development, there is little consensus as to how this is to be achieved.</p><p>Textile disposal is an increasing problem in the world. For example, during 1995 the denim industry generated more than 70 million kilos of scrap in landfills in the U.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(McCurry, 1996)</ref>. Furthermore, unrecovered textile waste contributed to approximately 4.5% of U.S. landfills <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hammer, 1993)</ref>. In the UK, there are annually more than 100 million tons of waste resulting from households and commerce <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Defra, 2007)</ref>. Of these, one million tons of textiles end up in landfill sites every year. In other industrialized countries such as Australia, a significant amount of textile waste from manufacturers and consumers is sent to landfill every year at great cost to the industry and tax payers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Caulfield, 2009)</ref>. Furthermore, the retrieval of post-consumer textile waste (mainly used clothing) is predominantly undertaken by charities in Australia, in contrast to other developed countries, where there are more private textile waste collectors, merchants and traders <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Caulfield, 2009)</ref>. Clothing is disposed through donation bins located across the country, as well as drop-offs direct to charity shops. Once collected, the textiles are sorted and sent to those in need in the community, or sold through shops to generate capital to fund social problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Caulfield, 2009)</ref>. However, there is estimation that 12.5 million kilos in Australia are sent to landfill. Specifically in the marketing field, concern about the environment and sustainable marketing among academics and consumers has been increasing since 1970s <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Van Dam and Apeldoorn, 1996)</ref>. Over the years, consumers have realised that their purchasing behaviour can have a direct impact on several elements of the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Montoro-Rios et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>As a result, some consumers are considering environmental issues when shopping such as checking for labels that use recycled materials and purchasing sustainable products <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Laroche et al., 2001)</ref>. Concern for the environment has also been integrated into the marketing discipline by incorporating environmental elements into the marketing strategy to remain competitive (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Drumwright, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Menon and Menon, 1997)</ref>. Moreover, previous studies have examined consumer recycling behaviour of paper, glass and plastic <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Jahre, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderson and Brodin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fraj and Martinez, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Moczygemba and Smaka-Kincl, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>However, the literature has neglected important issues to make consumption more sustainable, including the importance on non-purchase elements of consumer behaviour such as product use and disposal <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Peattie and Peattie, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Although some studies have assessed consumer product disposal tendencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Harrell and McConocha, 1992)</ref>, and the effects of environmental attitudes on apparel purchasing behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Butler and Francis, 1997)</ref>, only a small number of studies have examined the disposal behaviour of clothing <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Shim, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Domina and Koch, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Birtwistle and Moore, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Morgan and Birtwistle, 2009)</ref>. According to these studies, methods by which consumers dispose of their clothing are donating to charity, giving away to family or friends, selling through second hand shops or eBay, and throwing away into rubbish bins <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Domina and Koch, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Birtwistle and Moore, 2006)</ref>. Specifically, donating to charities and giving away to family and friends are considered by consumers the most common methods of sustainable clothing disposal <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Birtwistle and Moore, 2006)</ref>. These methods avoid the punitive cost of landfills, and move clothing to areas of the world where it is most needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hawley, 2006</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shim's (1995)</ref> study looked at the relationship between consumer environmental attitudes and clothing disposal patterns. The author found that the environmental attitude of consumers had a strong influence on disposal methods such as recycling. Other studies have also found that consumer knowledge of disposal options and waste-recycling have an impact on recycling methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Daneshvary et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Domina and Koch, 1999)</ref>. However, it is still not clear which are the main drivers that lead consumers to choose different methods of disposal behaviour, and if these vary across countries with different levels of industrialization. Thus, the main objective of this study is to explore antecedents of the two methods of sustainable clothing disposal behaviour mentioned above: donating to charity or giving away to family or friends. This study is conducted in two countries with different levels of industrialization in order to identify plausible country differences on clothing disposal behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bekin et al., 2007)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> presents our conceptual model and the next section will discuss the hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Insert Figure 1 here</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses Development</head><p>Concern about waste disposal has inspired a substantial amount of academic research and several studies have tried to determine how to encourage consumer recycling behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Biswas et al., 2000)</ref>. However, recycling behaviour of clothing may differ from recycling paper, glass or aluminium, and researchers have found that disposal methods vary significantly across product categories implying that studies should be product specific <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jacoby et al., 1977)</ref>. For clothing products, recycling behaviour is found to be closely linked to donating to charities <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Morgan and Birtwistle, 2009)</ref> and curb side textile recycling <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Daneshvary et al., 1998)</ref>. This means that consumers that usually recycle plastic, glass, or paper, are more likely to recycle their fashion garments by donating to charities and charity bins. However, it is not clear if general recycling behaviour is also related to giving away to family or friends, which is another sustainable method of recycling clothing products. This needs to be tested, thus we propose the following hypotheses:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 1a: Consumer recycling behaviour is positively related to disposing of clothing by 'giving away' to family or friends.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 1b: Consumer recycling behaviour is positively related to disposing of clothing by 'donating to charities'.</head><p>Authors agree that knowledge and attitudes are better predictors of sustainable behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chan, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fraj and Martinez, 2006)</ref>. For example, people that emphasize respect and concern towards the environment are more ecological in their behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fraj and Martinez, 2006)</ref>. For clothing disposal, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Morgan and Birtwistle (2009)</ref> found a significant positive relationship between consumer awareness of the environment and textile donation. This implies that consumers that are worried about the environment are more likely to make an effort to dispose of their garments in a way that does not damage the environment. Furthermore, awareness of the environment has also been found an antecedent of general recycling behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Morgan and Birtwistle, 2009)</ref>. Thus, the following hypotheses are stated:</p><p>Hypothesis 2a: Consumer awareness of the environment is positively related to disposing of clothing by 'giving away' to family or friends.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 2b: Consumer awareness of the environment is positively related to disposing of clothing by 'donating to charities'.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 2c: Consumer awareness of the environment is positively related to consumer recycling behaviour.</head><p>The literature suggests that demographic factors may affect environmental concern <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Butler and Francis, 1997)</ref>. Previous studies have attempted to profile recyclers and non-recyclers using demographic variables such as age, education, and gender. In general, a positive relationship has been found between age and donation to charities. Drawing on the literature on consumer environmental behaviour, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Burke et al. (1978)</ref> profiled consumers based on their general disposal behaviour, and found that younger consumers were more likely to dispose of products with little reference to further use or environmental impact. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Butler and Francis (1997)</ref> found that age had a positive relationship with pro-recycling behaviour. Thus, the following hypotheses need to be tested:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 3a: Consumer age is positively related to disposing of clothing by 'giving away' to family or friends.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 3b: Consumer age is positively related to disposing of clothing by 'donating to charities'.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 3c: Consumer age is positively related to consumer recycling behaviour.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>We collected data through a survey instrument which was administered to female respondents in two countries: Australia and Chile. These countries were chosen because they are fashion leaders in their own regions but comprise different levels of industrialisation.</p><p>Moreover, females were targeted because women purchase fashion garments more frequently than men <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bhardwaj and Fairhurst, 2010)</ref>. Primary data was collected during 2008 using a snowball sampling procedure. This sampling approach has been used in previous research due to the difficulty in obtaining samples in countries with an infrastructure that does not support the collection of data using probability-sampling approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cleveland et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In Australia, an online survey was sent to a convenience sample of 360 females located in Brisbane, which led to 239 usable questionnaires, with a 66 per cent response rate. In Chile, an online survey was sent to a convenience sample of 450 females living in Santiago, resulting in 249 questionnaires being analysed, a 53 per cent response rate. The response profile is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Insert Table 1 here</head><p>The questionnaire included four sections with measurement scales indicating respondents answer from one indicating 'never' or 'strongly disagree' and five indicating 'very frequently' or 'strongly agree'. All the scales were adopted from previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Domina and Koch, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Morgan and Birtwistle, 2009)</ref>, which explains the differences in the number of items measuring each construct. Regarding the independent variables, consumer recycling behaviour was measured through a five item scale, and consumer awareness of the environment was measured by a seven item scale. Concerning the dependent variables on clothing disposal behaviours, give away to family members or friends was measured by a three item scale, and donating to charity was measured by a three item scale. The next section of the questionnaire asked open ended questions regarding how respondents usually disposed of their fashion clothing. Finally, demographic information of respondents was collected in terms of age, status, gender, education, income and the occupation of the main provider.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>For the analysis of the data, descriptive statistics, factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted. Descriptive statistics, construct reliabilities, items, means and standard deviations are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Insert Table 2 here</head><p>The Australian data set (n = 239) and Chilean data set (n = 249) were analysed statistically and both data sets revealed normality of the data. The scale reliability test of the measures revealed that two items concerning awareness of the environment had very low inter-item correlation with other items in the scale; therefore these two items were deleted from the measurement before conducting confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The remaining 16 items of four constructs were subjected to CFA using AMOS-16 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Byrne, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>The χ 2 values for the CFA model were significant for data from Australia (246.00, d.f. 112, p = .000) and Chile (271.06, d.f. 112, p = .000), and the overall fit in both contexts was reasonable with satisfactory values in the incremental fit index (IFI; 0.93 for Australia and 0.91 for Chile), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI; 0.90 for Australia and 0.88 for Chile), comparative fit index (CFI; 0.93 for Australia and 0.91 for Chile), χ 2 /d.f. (2.19 for Australia and 2.42 for Chile), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; 0.071 for Australia and 0.076 for Chile). The AMOS-16 reliabilities of the coefficient alpha <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Nunnally, 1978)</ref> for respective scales are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The reliability and validity of the construct measures were measured using Cronbach's alpha reliability and Pearson correlations. Scales exhibited relatively high reliability coefficients with most Cronbach alpha scores over 0.6 in both countries: consumer awareness of the environment scale (α=0.683 in Australia; α=0.562 in Chile), general recycling behaviour scale (α=0.927 in Australia; α=0.946 in Chile), give away to family or friends scale (α=0.776 in Australia; α=0.639 in Chile), and the donating to charity scale (α=0.726 in Australia; α=0.687 in Chile). As seen in Tables <ref type="table">3a</ref> and<ref type="table">3b</ref>, the analyses reveals that no correlations between constructs exceeds the lowest alpha reliability score, confirming the discriminant validity of the constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gaski, 1984)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Insert Tables 3a and 3b here</head><p>To check and reduce the common method bias variance, the questionnaire included mixed positive and negatively worded items. Using <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Podsakoff and Organ's (1986)</ref> procedure, factor analysis was conducted for all constructs and this demonstrated that there was no single factor or any general factor that accounted for most of the variance in the independent and dependent variables. Thus, no common method bias variance issues were identified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Analysis</head><p>Mean scores on consumer recycling behaviour were higher for the Australian sample (mean = 3.22, sd. = 0.97) compared to the Chilean sample, (mean = 2.80, sd. = 1.31) indicating that Australian females consumers recycle more than Chilean female consumers. Regarding consumer awareness of the environment, the mean score was similar for the Australian sample (mean = 3.73, sd. = 1.00) compared to the Chilean sample (mean = 3.76, sd. = 0.96), therefore in both countries the scores were moderately high indicating that most respondents have a good awareness of environmental issues. Regarding the dependent variable giving away to family and friends, the mean score was similar for the Australian sample (mean = 2.84, sd. = 1.20), compared to the Chilean sample (mean = 2.83, sd. = 1.26). Finally, mean scores of the variable donation to charity were higher for the Australian sample (mean = 3.46, sd. = 1.05) compared to the Chilean sample (mean = 3.26, sd. = 1.18), signalling that Australian female consumers donate more to charity than Chilean female consumers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We tested our proposed hypothesises through structural equation modelling (SEM) technique. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Insert Table 4 here</head><p>The results of Hypotheses 1a suggests that general recycling behaviour is not significantly related to giving away to family and friends in Chile (β = 0.017, p = 0.463), or in Australia (β = 0.028, p = 0.456). Therefore, Hypothesis 1a is not supported. The results of Hypothesis 1b indicates that general recycling behaviour is significantly related to donating to charities in Chile (β = 0.203, p = 0.007), and in Australia (β = 0.493, p &lt; .001). Therefore,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 1b is fully supported.</head><p>The results of Hypothesis 2a suggests that awareness of the environment is significantly related to giving away to family and friends in Australia (β = 0.168, p = 0.005), but not in Chile (β = -0.007, p = 0.855). Therefore, Hypothesis 2a is supported only in Australia.</p><p>The results of Hypothesis 2b shows that general awareness of the environment is not related to donating to charities in Chile (β = 0.079, p = 0.555), or in Australia (β = 0.148, p = 0.158).</p><p>Therefore, Hypothesis 2b is not supported. The results of Hypothesis 2c shows that general awareness of the environment is significantly related to donating to general recycling behaviour in Chile (β = 0.597, p &lt; .001), and in Australia (β = 0.296, p &lt; .001). Therefore,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 2c is fully supported.</head><p>The results of Hypothesis 3a suggests that age is not related to giving away to family and friends in Australia (β = -0.047, p = 0.078), or in Chile (β = -0.004, p = 0.818). Therefore, Hypothesis 3a is not supported. The results of Hypothesis 3b shows that age is significantly related to donating to charities in Australia (β = 0.251, p &lt; .001), but not in Chile (β = 0.079, p = 0.555). Therefore, Hypothesis 3b is supported only in Australia. The results of Hypothesis 3c shows that age is significantly related to general recycling behaviour in Chile (β = 0.373, p &lt; .001), and in Australia (β = 0.213, p &lt; .001). Therefore, Hypothesis 3c is fully supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The SEM analysis shows similarities and differences between the Chilean and Australian samples regarding antecedents of the two methods of clothing disposal behaviour: giving away to family or friends and donating to charity. According to the findings, in both countries consumers that have a positive attitude towards recycling are more likely to dispose of their clothing by donating to charity, rather than giving away to family or friends. This is consistent with a previous UK study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Morgan and Birtwistle (2009)</ref> which find that general recycling behaviour is positively related to donating to charity. The insignificant relationship with giving away to family and friends is an interesting contribution to this area. This finding suggests the need to identify specific drivers for this method of clothing disposal, which may be less related to recycling behaviour and perhaps more related to helping others or sharing valuable belongings, as suggested by respondents in the qualitative part of the survey.</p><p>Moreover, the findings show that Australian female consumers with higher levels of environmental awareness are more likely to give away their clothing to family and friends, rather than donate to charity organizations. Nevertheless, in Chile, consumer awareness of the environment does not have any impact on either donation to charity or giving away to family or friends. Although both samples have similar levels of awareness of the environment, the outcome of this attitude differs across countries. This is consistent with previous studies that find that people that are environmentally conscious do not necessarily behave proenvironmentally if they see that other people don't behave in this way <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ohtomo and Hirose, 2007)</ref>. Nevertheless, in both countries, consumer awareness of the environment is positively related to consumer recycling behaviour, implying an indirect effect on donating to charities.</p><p>Finally, the findings demonstrate that in both countries, consumer age is not related to giving to family or friends, but positively related to donating to charity in Australia, and positively related to consumer recycling behaviour in both countries. This implies that older people in Australia are more likely to give their clothing to charity organizations, but not in Chile. This finding may be explained by the fact that donating to charities is a relatively recent phenomenon in developing countries, and very few charity organisations exist. This is supported by previous studies with mixed results in terms of the effect of age on donation behaviour (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Butler and Francis, 1997)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The increase in fast fashion retailing has led to large amounts of clothing being disposed of or destroyed. To safeguard our environment consumers can make sustainable responsible decisions at the time of clothing disposal. However, the disposal stage is often overlooked in consumer and marketing research. Thus, the main goal of our study was to examine antecedents of sustainable clothing disposal behaviour in two countries with different levels of industrialization: Australia and Chile. The study confirms previous work, that the strongest driver of consumer donating behaviour is attitude to recycling. In both countries, consumers that have a positive attitude towards recycling are more likely to dispose of their clothing by donating to charity, rather than giving away to family or friends. Moreover, in both countries a positive recycling behaviour is enhanced by consumer age and greater levels of awareness of the environment. This implies that to achieve higher rates of clothing donation by consumers, educators, the media and charities as well as fashion retailers must emphasise and encourage consumers to engage in recycling behaviours. Thus, effective communication strategies are fundamental to achieving sustainable forms of clothing disposal. For example, if more collection points or home collections were set up by charities, more people would be willing to donate their clothing and less would be thrown out.</p><p>In addition, a growing number of companies are looking to recognize the role of consumption sustainability as an integral component of their business strategy. Consumers will reward businesses that treat the environment fairly. Thus, fast fashion retailers that are perceived as supporting the environment will receive more patronage from consumers. This can provide opportunities for fashion retailers to develop strategic alliances with charities where donated clothing could provide incentives to repurchase from the named retailer.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1: Conceptual model of consumer clothing disposal behaviour</figDesc></figure>
