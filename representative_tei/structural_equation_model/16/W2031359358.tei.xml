In health care settings this is particularly important in light of an aging workforce combined with increasing health care demands of an aging population. Nurses are the largest regulated healthcare provider group in Canada, representing almost one half of all healthcare workers <ref type="bibr">(CIHI, 2005)</ref>. Thus attention to workplace factors that promote retention of newcomers to the profession is important for sustaining the nursing workforce and indeed the future of health care. Workplace factors that empower employees to optimize work performance within a supportive workgroup are known to enhance employee well-being and retention <ref type="bibr">(Kanter, 1977)</ref>. Yet recent studies have shown that new graduate nurses are reporting frequent exposure to workplace bullying <ref type="bibr">(Laschinger, Grau, Finegan, &amp; Wilk, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">McKenna, Smith, Poole, &amp; Coverdale, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Simons, 2008)</ref>, high levels of burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cho, Laschinger, &amp; Wong, 2006)</ref>, and job turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Beecroft, Kunzman, &amp; Krozek, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bowles &amp; Candela, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Brewer, Kovner, Greene, Tukov-Shuser, &amp; Djukic, 2011)</ref>. Recently, the World Health Organization (2010) identified workplace bullying as a serious public health threat in light of evidence that workplace bullying is reaching epidemic levels worldwide <ref type="bibr">(International Labour Organization, 2003)</ref>. Leadership is required to address this disturbing trend.</p><p>Destructive interpersonal experiences at work result in negative feelings among employees that hinder personal <ref type="bibr">(Hogh &amp; Mikkelsen, 2005)</ref> and organizational productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Sliter, Sliter, &amp; Jex, 2012)</ref>. Understanding the mechanisms through which bullying can lead to burnout and subsequent turnover is important for preventing and managing this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hauge et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nielsen &amp; Einersen, 2012)</ref>. Research has shown that positive leadership practices are important determinants of nurses' job satisfaction and turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Giallonardo, Wong &amp; Iwasiw, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Weberg, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">van der</ref> </p></div>

Psychosocial characteristics of work settings have an important impact on employee's experiences with their work and subsequent job and health-related outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cummings, et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Maslach &amp; Leiter, 2004)</ref>. Either implicitly or explicitly, leaders communicate the core values that shape the behaviors of employees. On the other hand, when leaders fail to communicate positive values or fail to act on situations that violate them, the quality of the psychosocial work environment deteriorates and employee performance and wellbeing suffer <ref type="bibr">(Ingersoll, Olsan, Drew-Cates, DeVinney &amp; Davies, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kelloway &amp; Day, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Stouten et al., 2010)</ref>. Positive supportive leadership is critical to promoting effective working relationships among employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Burke et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kuoppala, et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Wendt, Frisina, &amp; Rothgang, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Authentic leadership (henceforth, AL) is a strength-based approach to leadership derived from the field of Positive Organizational Psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Avolio &amp; Gardner, 2005)</ref>. AL fosters positive self-regulated behaviors in both leaders and their followers. Although the link between AL and workplace bullying has not been studied, it is reasonable to expect that authentic leaders are likely to create work environments that foster positive employee relationships, and therefore discourage counterproductive work behaviors, such as bullying. Despite the importance of retaining the new generation of nurses, we could find no studies of the effect of AL on new graduate nurses' experiences of bullying and its' detrimental outcomes. Therefore one of the aims of this study was to address the gap in the literature by testing a theoretical model linking AL to new graduate nurses experiences of workplace bullying and burnout over a 1-year time frame in Canadian healthcare settings. Furthermore, although bullying has been linked to burnout in cross-sectional studies <ref type="bibr">(Laschinger et al., 2010)</ref>, few studies have examined the effects of bullying on burnout and retention issues over time, making it difficult to attribute cause and effect. Therefore a second aim of this study was to examine the process by which workplace bullying leads to burnout (emotional exhaustion and cynicism), and subsequently to job and career turnover intentions over a one year timeframe.</p><p>We believe this study contributes to the literature by further illuminating the role of leadership in addressing workplace bullying and its' negative effects. We found no research linking AL to bullying, burnout, and job and career retention outcomes. In addition, studying these relationships over time provides stronger evidence of the causal nature of relationships among these variables and strengthens previous cross-sectional findings. This knowledge may inform management strategies to support early career transitions of new graduate nurses and increase retention of new members of the largest health professional group in the healthcare workforce. Finally, this study adds to the body of knowledge of positive organizational behavior (POB) by examining the extent to which positive organizational leadership behaviors, in this case AL, may mitigate the effects of negative organizational behaviors, and therefore serve as an important protective strategy for employee wellbeing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Authentic Leadership</head><p>AL is a model empirically supported in both the general management and nursing literature (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Giallonardo et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Walumbwa, Avolio, Gardner, Wernsing, &amp; Peterson, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Walumbwa, Wang, Wang, Schaubroeck, &amp; Avolio, 2010)</ref>. This is a relationship-focused leadership style that is characterized by self-awareness, honesty and transparency, behavioral integrity, and consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Avolio &amp; Gardner, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Wong &amp; Cummings, 2009)</ref>. AL is "a pattern of transparent and ethical leader behavior that encourages openness in sharing information needed to make decisions while TURNOVER INTENT IN NEW NURSES 7 accepting input from those who follow" <ref type="bibr">(Avolio, Walumba, &amp; Weber, 2009, p. 424)</ref>. Authentic leaders engage followers through four types of behaviors: balanced processing, relational transparency, internalized moral perspective, and self-awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Walumbwa et al., 2008)</ref>. Balanced processing involves gathering relevant information and varying perspectives, both positive and negative, before making important decisions. Relational transparency involves sharing thoughts and feelings and encouraging others to share their ideas and opinions. Internalized moral perspective refers to congruence between a leader's behaviour and his/her moral standards and values. Finally, self-awareness refers to acknowledging one's strengths and weaknesses and their effects on others. <ref type="bibr">Avolio et al. (2009)</ref> maintain that authentic leaders create conditions that promote trust and build confidence in accomplishing work goals thereby increasing employee and organizational performance. Authentic leaders demonstrate a sense of genuine caring for employees and for open and honest dialogue about what is and is not working well in their work relationships based on ethical and moral standards.</p><p>To date studies of AL have primarily focused on positive outcomes most likely because the theory is situated within the POB paradigm. However, it is useful to examine the links between AL and negative work experiences and their detrimental outcomes to explore its' protective effects.</p><p>Research has linked AL to workplace incivility and burnout among nurses <ref type="bibr">(Read &amp; Laschinger, 2013)</ref> and Laschinger, <ref type="bibr">Wong &amp; Grau (2012a)</ref> found that nurses' perceptions of their managers' AL behaviors influenced burnout. These studies suggest that authentic leaders may create positive working conditions that reduce the likelihood of bullying and burnout. The suggestion that workplace bullying may be preventable through an AL approach is encouraging given the well documented negative health and organizational effects of these phenomena.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influence of Leadership on Workplace Bullying</head><p>Workplace bullying consists of 'repeated and prolonged exposure to predominantly psychological mistreatment, directed at a target who is typically teased, badgered and insulted, and who perceives himself or herself as not having the opportunity to retaliate in kind' <ref type="bibr">(Hauge et al., 2009, p.350)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Einarsen and Hoel (2001)</ref> described three components of workplace bullying: (1) work-related bullying, such as withholding information or imposing unreasonable deadlines; (2) personal bullying, such as gossiping or spreading rumors; and (3) physical bullying, such as being shouted at or threatened with physical abuse. Work-related bullying has been shown to be the most frequent and tolerated form of bullying and is strongly related to important retention outcomes, such as turnover intent, poor mental health, and absenteeism <ref type="bibr">(Berthelsen, Skögstad, Lau &amp; Einarsen, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Einarsen, Hoel, &amp; Notelaers, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Power et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>When bullying is allowed to continue this behavior becomes normalized in the workplace, leading others to engage in similar behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Pearson, Andersson, &amp; Porath, 2000)</ref>. Unfortunately bullying is often dismissed or ignored by leaders who are not equipped to handle the situation effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Salin, 2003)</ref>, and when left unchecked, bullying may escalate. As a result, morale suffers leading to further stress and lower productivity. Strong leadership is needed to address this state of affairs. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lutgen-Sandvik &amp; Davenport Sypher (2009)</ref>, bullying is 'an organizational, not individual problem' (p. 63), which requires the commitment of leadership at all levels of the organization to ensure that bullying is not tolerated.</p><p>Until recently, studies linking leadership practices to workplace bullying were rare. Recent research has shown that supportive leadership styles tend to be associated with lower levels of workplace bullying <ref type="bibr">(Hauge, Skögstad &amp; Einarsen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hauge at al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hoel, Glaso, Cooper, &amp; Einarsen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Stouten et al., 2010)</ref>. For example <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hauge et al. (2007) and</ref><ref type="bibr">Hoel et al. (2010)</ref> found that negative and what are often labelled 'non-leadership' behaviors (laissez-faire and non-contingent leadership) encourage workplace bullying, whereas positive, relationally-focused leadership styles, such as AL, may discourage bullying. Furthermore <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hauge et al. (2011)</ref> found that employees reported few incidences of workplace bullying when they felt their leaders were supportive and treated them fairly. The authors speculate that fair and supportive leadership practices communicate clear standards for acceptable behavior in the workplace and thus discourage bullying. Similarly <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Stouten et al. (2010)</ref> found that ethical leaders, an approach consistent with AL <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Treviño, Brown, &amp; Hartman, 2003)</ref>, influenced negatively workplace bullying through positive workplace design, characterized by employee perceptions of reasonable workloads and positive working conditions.</p><p>Ethical leaders emphasize ethical values by demonstrating honesty, trustworthiness, and fairness, and by being ethical in their decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Treviño et al., 2003)</ref>. Moreover <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Mayer, Kuenzi, Greenbaum, Bardes, &amp; Salvador (2009)</ref> found that employees' ratings of their managers' ethical leadership behavior were positively related to their own pro-social behaviors. This suggests that by modelling positive social behavior, leaders create work environments that are unlikely to tolerate workplace bullying because bullying is morally questionable work behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hauge et al.'s (2011)</ref> notion of leadership and <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Stouten et al's (2010)</ref> concept of ethical leadership are consistent with <ref type="bibr">Avolio, Gardner, Walumbwa, Luthan and May's (2004)</ref> conceptualization of AL, suggesting that AL may have a similar relationship with workplace bullying. Logically, authentic leaders create work environments that would not be expected to condone bullying. Bullying is common in stressful work environments that frustrate employees' efforts to accomplish their work goals for a variety of reasons, including role overload, unrealistic expectations, and role ambiguity <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hauge et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Skogstad, Einarsen, Torsheim, &amp; Aasland, 2007)</ref>. These conditions seem unlikely when nursing leaders consistently interact with followers in an open transparent manner and demonstrate integrity when making decisions that affect employees. Thus authentic leaders play an important role in preventing workplace bullying by establishing positive work environments and standards for acceptable interpersonal interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TURNOVER INTENT IN NEW NURSES</head><p>Based on this literature, we hypothesized that higher perception of immediate supervisor AL behaviors at T1 are related to lower levels of workplace bullying at T2 (Hypothesis 1). Authentic leaders create positive work environments that support employees' efforts to accomplish their work within a climate of respect and open communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Avolio et al., 2004)</ref>. By creating environments with adequate resources and expectations for respectful interpersonal interactions, authentic leaders remove common sources of bullying.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influence of Leadership on Burnout</head><p>Burnout is a psychological response to chronic job stressors consisting of three components-emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and personal efficacy <ref type="bibr">(Leiter &amp; Maslach, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Emotional exhaustion is considered the core element of burnout <ref type="bibr">(Leiter &amp; Maslach, 2004)</ref> which if sustained over time, results in cynicism and emotional withdrawal from work and feelings of inefficacy <ref type="bibr">(Leiter &amp; Maslach, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Maslach &amp; Leiter, 1997)</ref>. Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Leiter and Maslach (2004)</ref> describe burnout as a syndrome characterized by three factors, recent work has been focused on a two-factor conceptualization of burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Schaufeli &amp; Bakker, 2004)</ref>. They argue (and demonstrate empirically) that personal efficacy is better viewed as a component of work engagement, rather than burnout. They also point out that burnout studies have found consistent results for emotional exhaustion and cynicism but not for personal efficacy. <ref type="bibr">Maslach, Schaufeli, &amp; Leiter (2001)</ref> maintain that both emotional exhaustion and cynicism must be included in a valid measurement of burnout.</p><p>That is, exhaustion on its own, which is a physical and emotional response to demanding working conditions, does not fully convey employee's relationships with their work. In their view, cynicism is a cognitive response to workplace demands in an attempt to distance oneself emotionally and cognitively from one's work as a way of coping with both task and interpersonal demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Maslach &amp; Leiter, 2008)</ref>. Given the relevance of both of these burnout components to our research focus, we were interested in examining the effects of bullying on both to better understand nurses emotional and cognitive responses to this negative behavior.</p><p>In some countries, burnout is considered a treatable medical condition, attesting to the seriousness of this pervasive work related phenomenon worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Schaufeli, Leiter, &amp; Maslach, 2009)</ref>. The negative effects of employee burnout on a wide array of personal and organizational well-being outcomes have been documented in an extensive body of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Schaufeli &amp; Buunk, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Schaufeli et al., 2009)</ref>. In terms of personal well-being, burnout has been linked to health symptoms such as depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Peterson et al., 2008)</ref>. From an organizational perspective, numerous studies have linked burnout to job dissatisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Becker, Milad &amp; Klock, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Piko, 2006)</ref>, lower work performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Parker &amp; Kulik, 1995)</ref>, and job turnover <ref type="bibr">(Jourdain &amp; Chenevert, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Leiter &amp; Maslach, 2009)</ref> to name a few.</p><p>The prevalence of burnout in nursing is particularly high, similar to other helping professions because of the high emotional and physical demands of their roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aiken, Clarke, Sloane, Sochalski, &amp; Silber, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Greenglass, Burke, &amp; Fiksenbaum, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Leiter &amp; Maslach, 1988)</ref>. In the past two decades, nurse burnout rates have increased most likely because massive health system restructuring resulted in workforce downsizing and increased job demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Greenglass et al., 2001)</ref>. Disturbingly high levels of burnout among new nurses have been identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cho et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Laschinger, Finegan &amp; Wilk, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cho et al. (2006)</ref> found that 66% of new graduates experienced severe burnout, primarily related to negative work conditions. Similar rates were observed by Laschinger et al.</p><p>(2010), suggesting that this burnout continues to be a problem in nursing settings.</p><p>High burnout levels in nursing have been associated with high workload demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Duquette, Kérouac, Sandhu, &amp; Beaudet, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Greenglass et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Laschinger, Finegan &amp; Wilk, 2011)</ref>, job dissatisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aiken et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Vahey, Aiken, Sloane, Clarke, &amp; Vargas, 2004)</ref>, absenteeism <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Michie &amp; Williams, 2003)</ref>, and turnover <ref type="bibr">(Fochsen, Sjögren, Josephson, &amp; Lagerström, TURNOVER INTENT IN NEW NURSES 12 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kovner et al., 2007)</ref>. Similar outcomes have been linked to new graduate burnout <ref type="bibr">(Beecroft, Dorey, Wenten, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cho et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Rudman &amp; Gustavsson, 2011)</ref>. These findings are alarming and suggest that leadership should make every effort to prevent burnout among new graduate nurses.</p><p>Numerous studies have linked leadership either directly or indirectly to employee experiences of burnout <ref type="bibr">(Laschinger et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lee &amp; Cummings, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Zopiatis &amp; Constanti, 2010)</ref>. Research has shown that supportive management is related to lower levels of emotional exhaustion in health care work environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Balogun, Titiloye, Balogun, Oyeyemi, &amp; Katz, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Vahey et al., 2004)</ref> suggesting that supportive leadership may protect employees against burnout by building healthy work environments. In nursing, similar relationships have been observed between leadership and burnout among experienced nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Greco, Laschinger, &amp; Wong, 2006)</ref> and newly graduated nurses <ref type="bibr">(Laschinger et al., 2012a)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the review of the literature, we expect that higher perceptions of immediate supervisor AL behaviors at T1 will be related to lower levels of burnout (emotional exhaustion and cynicism) at T2 (Hypothesis 2a and 2b, respectively). Leaders play an important role in creating work environments that prevent burnout by ensuring that adequate resources are in place to accomplish work goals and that the social climate is conducive to effective working relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influence of Bullying on Burnout</head><p>Several studies have linked exposure to workplace bullying to burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bowling &amp; Beehr, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Nielsen &amp; Einarsen, 2012)</ref>. In a recent meta-analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Nielsen and Einarsen (2012)</ref> found an average bullying/burnout correlation of .27 across ten cross-sectional studies in the general management field. Other researchers have also found significant relationships between bullying and burnout in cross sectional studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Meliá &amp; Becerril, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sá &amp; Flemming, 2008)</ref>. Bullying has also been shown to have harmful health effects, such as depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr">(Hogh, Henriksson, &amp; Burr, 2005</ref>;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TURNOVER INTENT IN NEW NURSES 13</head><p>Mikkelsen <ref type="bibr">&amp; Einarsen, 2001)</ref>, poor physical health <ref type="bibr">(Hoel, Faragher, &amp; Cooper, 2004)</ref>, and burnout <ref type="bibr">(Laschinger et al., 2010)</ref>. However, we could find no studies linking bullying to burnout over time to strengthen empirical support for the causal nature of this relationship. In their theoretical model synthesizing empirical studies of the effects of workplace bullying, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Nielsen and Einarsen (2012)</ref> argue that bullying influences negative job-related health outcomes (such as burnout and job turnover) by activating cognitive mechanisms which may over time deplete available coping resources.</p><p>Based on this literature, we expect that workplace bullying at T1 affects both burnout dimensions at T2 (Hypothesis 3), that is, that employees' bullying experiences are positively related to both emotional exhaustion and cynicism dimensions of burnout one year later above and beyond their stability over time. Burnout results from prolonged exposure to negative demands in the workplace <ref type="bibr">(Leiter &amp; Maslach, 2004)</ref>. Workplace bullying is characterized as targeted negative acts that persist over time which are stressful for targets of bullying and may potentially deplete psychological resources needed to cope with these bullying behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Einarsen, Matthiesen, &amp; Skogstad, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover accordingly with burnout development theory <ref type="bibr">(Leiter &amp; Maslach, 2004)</ref> we expect that emotional exhaustion at T1 affects cynicism at T2 but not the reverse (Hypothesis 4).</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Maslach et al. (2001)</ref>, cynicism is an 'immediate reaction to exhaustion' (p. 403), which has been empirically supported in numerous studies. Thus, we model cynicism as an outcome emotional exhaustion in this study.</p></div>

According to a meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Griffeth, Hom and Gaertner (2000)</ref>, job turnover intention is the best predictor of actual turnover across studies, suggesting that it is a useful proxy for actual turnover. Job stress and dissatisfaction are prominent job-related reasons people leave their jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Firth, Mellor, Moor, &amp; Loquet, 2007)</ref>, often as a result of poor supervisory practices and negative working conditions, such as exposure to workplace bullying <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Berthelsen et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In nursing, job turnover is associated with job dissatisfaction, stress and burnout, negative leadership styles, and disempowering practice environments that limit professional autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hayes et al., 2006)</ref>. Turnover is higher for newly qualified nurse then experienced nurses <ref type="bibr">(Hayes et al., 2012)</ref>. O'Brien-Pallas et al. ( <ref type="formula">2006</ref>) estimated the turnover cost per nurse in Canada to be approximately $21,000, similar to estimates in other countries. Indirect costs of turnover relate to poor quality care and the negative effects of an unstable work environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Duffield et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">O'Brien-Pallas, Murphy, &amp; Shamian, 2008)</ref>. Thus, employee turnover is costly for both individuals and organizations and leaders play an important role in creating workplace conditions that reduce the loss of human and intellectual capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dess &amp; Shaw, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Exposure to workplace bullying may result in employee turnover because targets of persistent bullying often respond by withdrawing from the workplace, either by being absent from work or leaving their positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Berthelsen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hauge et al., 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Pearson and Porath (2005)</ref> found that mistreated employees often missed work to avoid the bully before finally leaving the organization altogether. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Berthelsen et al. (2011)</ref> found that exposure to bullying behavior over a 1year time frame was significantly related to a change in employment and increased sick time 1 year later. This study provides empirical evidence for the detrimental job and health effects of bullying over time, corroborating similar results in cross-sectional research.</p><p>Recent studies of bullying amongst new graduate nurses have revealed disturbing results. Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Simons (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Laschinger et al. (2010)</ref> found that new graduates who were bullied at work had higher intentions to leave their jobs. These results are concerning because workplace bullying threatens new graduates' transition to their new roles, resulting in job dissatisfaction and possibly leaving the profession. Nursing leadership can play an important role in putting strategies in place to prevent bullying of new graduate nurses, thereby promoting the retention of this valuable human resource.</p><p>Burnout has been linked to higher job turnover intentions in both the general management literature and in health care. Several studies have shown that burnout is the mediating mechanism between poor working conditions and turnover intent <ref type="bibr">(Kim &amp; Stoner, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Leiter &amp; Maslach, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zhang &amp; Feng, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">). Laschinger et al. (2011)</ref> found that the emotional exhaustion component of burnout mediated the relationship between job demands and nurses' job turnover intentions. <ref type="bibr">Maslach &amp; Leiter (2009)</ref> also showed that burnout was related to nurses' job turnover intentions.</p><p>They found that cynicism mediated the relationship between emotional exhaustion and turnover intention and concluded that exhaustion resulting from demanding working conditions decreased nurses' involvement with their work via psychological withdrawal, which in turn led to thoughts of leaving their jobs. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Schaufeli and Buunk (2003)</ref> note that the relationship between burnout and turnover is often weak, suggesting that many burned out employees remain in their jobs often with negative consequences for both themselves and their organizations.</p><p>Nurses' intentions to leave the profession have received less attention by researchers than job turnover intentions. However, the worldwide nursing workforce shortage, in combination with a large cohort of the nursing profession approaching retirement within the next decade, has drawn attention to this problem and stimulated research to inform evidence based efforts to recruit and retain qualified nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aiken et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">North &amp; Hughes, 2006)</ref>. By far the largest study investigating nurses' intent to leave the profession was the NEXT study of almost 40,000 nurses in <ref type="bibr">NEXT Study Coordination, 2005)</ref>. Personal factors (age and work/life balance) and burnout were strong predictors of intent to leave the profession, whereas organizational factors were stronger predictors of nurses' intent to leave their jobs <ref type="bibr">(Simon, Muller, &amp; Hasselhorn, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Both Flinkman, Leino-Kilpi &amp; Salanterä (2010)</ref> and Holte and <ref type="bibr">Mikkelsen (2003)</ref> showed that higher levels of emotional exhaustion were associated with more frequent thoughts of leaving nursing. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Jourdain and Chenevert (2010)</ref> found that emotional exhaustion mediated the relationship between demanding job conditions and Canadian nurses' intentions to leave the profession. These recent studies provide evidence about the role of burnout in nurses' intentions to leave the field and further highlight the need prevent burnout from developing in the first place, particularly among newly graduated members of the profession.</p><p>New graduate job turnover is often high in the first years of practice ranging from 35 -45 % within the first two years <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beecroft et al, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Scott, Engelke &amp; Swanson, 2008)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim of the Current Study</head><p>In summary the main aim of this study was to examine the process by which AL influences new graduate nurses' experiences of bullying and burnout (emotional exhaustion and cynicism) over a one year timeframe in Canadian healthcare settings. Moreover we also aimed to confirm longitudinally the influence of bullying on two dimensions of burnout dimensions as well as the longitudinal relations between these two dimensions, and to examine the process through which bullying and burnout affect job and occupational turnover intentions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedures</head><p>This two-wave study utilized questionnaire data gathered in 2010 (T1) and in 2011 (T2) from a sample of newly graduated nurses with less than two years of experience in acute care hospitals across Ontario. The original sample of all nurses who met this criteria was drawn from the registry list of practicing nurses in Ontario (N = 907). A survey was mailed to participants' home addresses using methods described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dillman (2007)</ref> to improve survey response rates. Questionnaires were coded in order to be able to match the respondents correctly in the follow-up. In the first study phase (T1), 342 participants returned the questionnaire, yielding a response rate of 37.7%. The follow-up questionnaire in the second study phase (T2) was sent only to those nurses who responded at T1. Of these, a total of 205 returned the completed questionnaire, yielding an acceptable response rate of 59.9%. Approval from the university ethics review board was received before the study was conducted.</p><p>The demographic profile for both samples is presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. At Time 1 the majority of nurses were female (92%), averaging 28 years of age and 1.04 years nursing experience. All responders were baccalaureate prepared. Most worked on either medical-surgical units (55%) or critical care units (23%) on a full time basis (62%) and part-time basis (28%). Most (64%) worked between 20 and 39 hours per week. There were no noteworthy differences between the Time 1 and Time 2 sample. This demographic profile is similar to provincial statistics for nurses within 5 years graduation <ref type="bibr">(CIHI, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>We used standardized questionnaires to measure the major study variables. All measures had acceptable reliability (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>The Authentic Leadership Questionnaire (ALQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Avolio, Gardner, &amp; Walumbwa, 2007)</ref> was used to measure the four components of nurses' perceptions of manager AL: (1) relational transparency, e.g., "my leader says exactly what he or she means"; (2) moral/ethical, e.g., "my leader makes decisions based on his or her core values"; (3) balanced processing, e.g., "my leader listens carefully to different points of view before coming to a decision" and; (4) self-awareness, e.g., "my leader shows he or she understands how specific actions impact others". The manager was defined as the formal leader of the clinical unit where they worked the majority of their time. Sixteen items (4 items per subscale) were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (frequently, if not always).</p><p>Bullying behaviors were measured using the work-related subscale of the Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised (NAQ-R, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Einarsen &amp; Hoel, 2001)</ref>. The work-related bullying subscale, consists of 7 items e.g., "having your opinions or views ignored", "being given unreasonable deadlines", "having your work excessively monitored", rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (daily).</p><p>The Emotional Exhaustion and Cynicism subscales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS) (e.g., "I feel emotionally drained from my work" and "I doubt the significance of my work", respectively) were used to measure new graduate burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Schaufeli, Leiter, Maslach, &amp; Jackson, 1996)</ref>. Each subscale contains five items rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 6 (daily). <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Leiter and Maslach (2004)</ref> argue that a high score on emotional exhaustion (&gt;3.0) is indicative of burnout.</p><p>Job turnover intention was measured using Kelloway, Gottlieb &amp; Barham's (1999) Job Turnover Intentions Scale, e.g., "I plan on leaving my job within the next year". This scale (3 items) was designed to measure one's intention to leave their current position All items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). <ref type="bibr">Kelloway et al.'s (1999)</ref> Job Turnover Intentions Scale (3 items) designed to measure one's intention to leave the nursing profession (i.e., "I want to remain in my job" was modified to "I often think about leaving the profession of nursing"). All items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Career turnover intention was measured using a modified version of</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Procedures</head><p>Data analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) (version 16.0) and MPlus (version 6.1, <ref type="bibr">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">-2010)</ref>. Descriptive statistics for all study variables were computed as well as reliability assessments of study instruments. Our hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques. We used this approach because it permits taking measurement errors into account by defining latent variables by their indicators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TURNOVER INTENT IN NEW NURSES 20</head><p>Specifically, due to the high correlations among the four AL factors, a second order leadership factor was defined by using the four subscales, whereas other variables were posited as a single-indicator latent variable, due to the large number of items included in the measurement instruments. In these cases, to account for measurement error and obtain more precise estimates of structural parameters, error variance for each single indicator was fixed at one minus the sample reliability estimate of the variable, multiplied by its sample variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bollen, 1989)</ref>. Furthermore since the one year time frame of our study did not allow simultaneous examination of all hypothesized longitudinal relations we defined two different models (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Specifically in Model 1 we tested Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2 considering AL at T1 as independent variable and both workplace bullying and the two components of burnout (emotional exhaustion and cynicism) at T2 as dependent variables.</p><p>Then in Model 2 we tested the remaining hypotheses by examining a cross-lagged model between workplace bullying and the two components of burnout and included both job and occupational turnover at T2 as dependent variables of both bullying and burnout, controlling for turnover prior levels at T1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>________________________________</head><p>Insert Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> about here ________________________________ Before proceeding with the analysis, the normality of the variables was ascertained. Due to the nonnormality of some measures (bullying both at T1 and T2), we computed the inverse to normalize these variables<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Tabachnick and Fidell (1996)</ref>. Since there was nonnormality of bullying variables even after their transformation in inverse, we used the Mplus robust ML method for parameters estimation, to correct standard errors and the chi-square test statistic for nonnormality.</p><p>There is little consensus in the SEM literature concerning the best index of overall fit for evaluating structural equation models <ref type="bibr">(Hoyle, 1995)</ref>. Based on Hoyle's (1995) recommendations and according to a multifaceted approach to the assessment of the model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Tanaka, 1993)</ref>, we considered: omnibus fit indices such as the Chi-square (χ 2 ) and incremental fit indices such as the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bentler &amp; Bonett, 1980)</ref>, the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Steiger, 1990)</ref> and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1984)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Statistics</head><p>Prior to analysing the hypothesized models, we conducted an analysis to examine differences between nurses who did or did not participate in the second wave of the study. No significant differences were found for both socio-demographic and study variables (α&lt;.01). Observed means, standard deviations and Cronbach alphas of study variables both at T1 and T2 are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Furthermore, results from paired t-tests showed that the only variable that significantly changed from T1 to T2 was cynicism, which was slightly higher at Time 2. Finally, none of the major study variables were significant while controlling for either age, type of work (speciality area), or number of work hours. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>________________________________ Insert</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Equation Models (SEM)</head><p>Both model 1 and model 2, displayed in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, yielded an excellent fit (Model 1: χ² = 13.98, df = 10, p = .17, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .044 [CI = .000 -.094], p = .52; SRMR = .024; Model 2: χ² = 19.80, df = 19, p = .41, CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = .014 [CI = .000 -.063], p = .85; SRMR = .033). All factor loadings of AL subscales were high, ranging from .83 to .91. With regard to the structural part, the model explained 35% of variance of job turnover and 30% of variance of career turnover.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>________________________________</head><p>Insert Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> about here ________________________________ As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, both Hypothesis 1 and 2 (hypothesis 2a and 2b) were supported by the empirical data. AL predicted later lower levels of work-related bullying and lower levels of both burnout dimensions. The more leaders at T1 were perceived to be authentic the less likely nurses' were to experience at T2 work-related bullying and burnout (emotional exhaustion and cynicism).</p><p>Moreover in accordance with Hypothesis 3 higher levels of work-related bullying predicted higher levels of both emotional exhaustion and cynicism one year later over and beyond their stability. The more workers are victims of negative acts, such as being ordered to do work below their level of competence or being a victim of persistent criticism, the more they will feel emotionally exhausted and cynical one year later. Furthermore, results suggested in accordance with Hypotheses 4 that emotional exhaustion predicted cynicism one year later but not the reverse, such that higher levels of emotional exhaustion resulted in subsequent higher levels of cynicism toward one's work. Finally, Hypotheses 5 and 6 were only partially confirmed. Specifically while burnout directly affected turnover intention (Hypothesis 6), workplace bullying did not directly influence it (Hypothesis 5).</p><p>Results of our models revealed that cynicism toward one's work was a stronger predictor of both job and career turnover intention than emotional exhaustion. The more new graduates become less enthusiastic and cynical about their work, the more they plan on leaving their job in the next year and the more they have been actively looking for jobs outside nursing. Emotional exhaustion significantly affected only career turnover intention. Interestingly time-lagged and cross-lagged job and career turnover intentions relations were not significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The results of the analysis provide support for the hypothesized model linking immediate supervisor's AL behavior to work-related bullying and burnout, and of these to job and career turnover intentions. Consistent with previous cross-sectional research <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hauge et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Laschinger et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Stouten et al., 2010)</ref>, positive leadership practices, in this case AL behaviors, were associated with lower levels of work-related bullying and burnout. This finding supports the notion that authentic leaders may influence the quality of workplace relationships by role modelling positive interpersonal behaviors and by setting standards for acceptable (and unacceptable) behaviors in the workplace. Furthermore, by being more sensitive to the requirements for effective work performance and ensuring resources are in place to empower employees to accomplish their work in meaningful ways, authentic leaders create conditions that are less amenable to the emergence of conflicts and frustration among employees. In this sense, by creating empowering conditions for employees, authentic leaders may play a protective role against bullying and also against burnout <ref type="bibr">(Laschinger et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Wong et al., 2012)</ref>. Supervisors are an important source of support for nurses in that they provide help and emotional support when needed thereby increasing nurses' ability to cope with demanding work conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Irvine &amp; Evans, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>The link between AL and lower bullying exposure of new graduate nurses is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hauge et al.'s (2011)</ref> findings that fair and supportive leadership practices were associated with lower bullying. These authors suggested that these leadership behaviors communicated higher standards of acceptable interpersonal behaviors in the workplace and discouraged bullying. Our results suggest that authentic leaders may influence work environments in a similar manner. This makes sense because leaders who are open and transparent with their followers and demonstrate integrity and consistency in their relationships with followers are likely to establish high standards of behavior in the work settings and not tolerate bullying behavior. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate this relationship.</p><p>Work-related bullying was also significantly predictive of new graduates' experiences of both emotional exhaustion and cynicism at Time 2 (controlling for their Time 1 levels). This finding is consistent with previous cross-sectional research that has demonstrated the influence of bullying on employee burnout <ref type="bibr">(Laschinger et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Sá &amp; Fleming, 2008)</ref>. However, this is one of the few studies that has demonstrated this effect when controlling for previous burnout levels. Given the negative personal and organizational effects of burnout, our findings highlight the importance of eliminating bullying as a source of employee burnout and point to the important influence of leadership in this process.</p><p>Finally, burnout was significantly related to both job and career turnover intentions, controlling for the Time 1 levels. Both job and career intentions were significantly related to the cynicism component of burnout, consistent with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Leiter and Maslach's (2009)</ref>  sectional study linking burnout to turnover intentions of staff nurses. Similar to their results, new graduate cynicism was more strongly related to job turnover intentions than was emotional exhaustion. This suggests that when nurses psychologically withdraw from their work through cynicism they are also more likely to withdraw socially by leaving their job. Interestingly, job turnover intent was not significantly related to emotional exhaustion when Time 1 levels were controlled in our study. However, cynicism is posited to be an outcome of emotional exhaustion resulting from prolonged exposure to stressful working conditions and our results suggest that emotional exhaustion influences turnover through its effect on cynicism. This result suggests that administrators must pay attention to conditions in the workplace that foster feelings of cynicism, such as work-related bullying and circumstances that lead to emotional exhaustion. Our results suggest that AL plays a key role in creating work environments that lessen the probability of these negative conditions.</p><p>Although cynicism was somewhat more strongly predictive of job turnover intentions, it was also an important predictor of intent to leave the profession. In our study, cynicism was significantly related to experiencing bullying in the workplace, which was associated with lower levels of AL.</p><p>These results are consistent with those of <ref type="bibr">van der Heijden et al.'s (2009)</ref> longitudinal study of European nurses that found that key predictors of new nurses' intention to leave the profession were an unsupportive work group and poor leadership. Also, similar to findings in the NEXT Study <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Flinkman et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Estryn-Béhar et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Simon et al., 2010)</ref>, our results revealed that emotional exhaustion was also a significant predictor of career turnover intentions. Since emotional exhaustion is considered to be a precursor of cynicism, it seems important for management to ensure that newly graduated nurses have reasonable workloads that do not predispose them to emotional exhaustion and raise premature thoughts about leaving the profession altogether. These findings are particularly compelling in light of the nursing workforce shortage. With a large proportion of the current nursing workforce approaching retirement, the profession can ill afford to lose newcomers to the workforce, particularly as a result of modifiable negative working conditions.</p><p>Our results add to the limited body of knowledge about why nurses leave the profession. As van der Heijden et al ( <ref type="formula">2009</ref>) point out, much of previous research has focussed on organizational turnover rather than occupational turnover. Given the current demographic profile of the nursing profession, it is critical to identify factors that influence occupational turnover and the associated loss of valuable human capital needed to address the health care demands of an aging population as the Baby Boomers move through the system. It is particularly important to examine factors that may contribute to premature turnover among newcomers to the profession because as a large proportion of the nursing population approach retirement, a new cohort of nurses is required to ensure that high quality nursing care is available to meet the increasing health care demands of an aging population.</p><p>The overall results of our study suggest that leadership may play a pivotal role in establishing working conditions that discourage bullying and burnout and thus promote retention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Salin (2003)</ref> noted that many leaders are either unaware of the detrimental effects of workplace bullying or are unsure of how to intervene. Our results suggest that training programs to enhance leaders' AL skills may be a step in the right direction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Avolio (2010)</ref> has described a variety of development strategies, although a full description of these strategies is beyond the scope of this paper. However, the essence of their approach is to encourage leaders to focus on developing self-awareness by reflecting on their values and behaviors and to consider how these qualities influence their interactions with followers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Avolio &amp; Gardner (2005)</ref> suggest that leaders who are in touch with how their values and behaviors affect others proactively influence their followers to do the same, thereby, creating positive supportive work groups throughout the organization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Walumbwa et al. (2010)</ref> argue that when leaders develop increased awareness of themselves and learn to be open and transparent in their decision making and interactions with employees, they will encourage the development of these characteristics in their followers and create positive, trusting working relationships. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Walumbwa et al. (2010)</ref> also recommend that supervisors take a caring approach with their employees and engage in dialogue with each employee about their expectations of their jobs and their role in the overall goals of the organization. They encourage leaders to pay attention to the values of individual employees and recognize the effect that their own leadership behaviors can have on employees' attitudes and work behaviors. As a result, authentic leaders create a positive, trusting work environment that fosters positive employee well-being and greater productivity. Thus, the primary role of authentic leaders is to foster the development of authentic followers by engaging with followers in a way characterized by honesty and transparency, behavioral integrity and consistency, and with selfawareness. It is reasonable to expect that work environments with these qualities are not conducive to workplace bullying and subsequent burnout, and therefore more likely to retain employees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodological Issues</head><p>The present study examined the impact of AL on employee experiences of work-related bullying and burnout, and ultimately turnover intentions over a one year timeframe. The cross-lagged design allowed us to examine these relationships while controlling for stability effects, strengthening our ability to address issues associated with more commonly used cross-sectional designs testing theoretical models. However this two-wave study did not permit examining all hypothesized relations in a single model. Future longitudinal studies with 3 waves are needed to confirm our results. Furthermore, as is often the case in longitudinal designs, many new nurses did not respond to the second survey. Although this dropout group did not differ substantially from the participating group in terms of demographic characteristics and on most substantive variables, this is a study limitation. It is possible that higher levels of exhaustion and turnover may have contributed to their lack of response to the following survey. Also, although separated by time we relied on self-report survey measures raising concerns about common method bias. Objective measures, such as supervisor ratings of some of the study variables would be advisable in future studies. Finally, although turnover intentions are known predictors of actual turnover, future research should include objective data on actual turnover.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and Implications</head><p>The results of this study support theory and research suggesting that the quality of working conditions created by leaders play an important role in the extent to which employees experience work related bullying and subsequent negative employee and organizational outcomes. This study adds to the relatively few studies linking positive leadership practices to work-related bullying and, to our knowledge, is the first study to demonstrate the influence of authentic leadership on workplace bullying and burnout over time. The results also add to our knowledge of how these interpersonal work context factors influence new graduates' thoughts about leaving their profession, a rarely studied topic. Our findings support the notion of authentic leadership as a promising core strategy for retaining newcomers to the nursing profession and for sustaining the future of the nursing workforce.</p></div>
