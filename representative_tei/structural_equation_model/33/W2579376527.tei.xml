<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose: This study investigates the impact of the loyalty program members' satisfaction towards the hotel loyalty program benefits and the customer management relationship initiatives of individual hotels on the brand relationship quality (BRQ), i.e. their relationship quality with the hotel brand, and its outcomes. The moderating impact of membership level on the hypothesized relationships was also investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology:</head><p>A usable sample of 920 active members of a hotel loyalty program was obtained. Structural equation modeling with partial least squares method was used to estimate the structural relationships and to investigate the moderating effect of membership level.</p><p>Findings: Employee's customer orientation, membership communication, and hotel-stay related benefits, are determinants of the loyalty program members' BRQ. BRQ is also confirmed as a higher order construct of three latent variables which include trust, satisfaction, and commitment. Moderating effects of the membership were partially supported in this study. The strongest effect of BRQ is on members' word-of-mouth followed by shares of purchase. BRQ is found to have negative relationship with members' willingness to serve as marketing resource but the impact was small.</p><p>Research limitations: This is a cross-sectional study with a population of active loyalty program members of only one luxury hotel group. The sample size of the top-tier members is also smaller in comparison to the other two groups.</p><p>Practical implications: This study contributes to the understanding of the antecedents and consequences of BRQ and the body of knowledge about loyalty program for hotel industry.</p><p>Originality/value: This is one of the few studies investigating the effectiveness of hotel loyalty programs from the active members' perspective and the moderating effect of membership level on the relationships among BRQ, its antecedents, and its outcomes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Loyalty programs are the most popular "value-added" defensive customer relationship management (CRM) strategies used by hotel chains to foster repeat business. They are developed to reward frequent customers, generate information about customers, manipulate customers' behavior, and to compete with other hotels. Loyalty program members have become business builders by buying more, paying premium prices, and bringing in new customers by referrals <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(O'Brien and Jones, 1995)</ref>. Some researchers assert that the loyalty programs can generally increase purchase frequency, customer advocacy, share of wallet, and operational profit by lowering expenses in recruiting new customers while they decrease customer price sensitivity and switching costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bowen and McCain, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Keh and Lee, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kim et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Leenheer et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lewis, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Reichheld, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Sharp and Sharp, 1997)</ref>. Others question the impact of rewards on customer loyalty and profits for firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Dowling and Uncles, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Mattila, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Ni et al., 2011)</ref>. While relatively high level of loyalty is detected on customers who join a loyalty program, most customers actually do not change their behavior after they become members <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gómez et al., 2006)</ref>. Nevertheless, loyalty program has been still frequently used by companies as an important tool of CRM strategies to enhance relationship quality.</p><p>While prior hospitality research emphasizes relationship quality between customers and employees (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Erkmen and Hancer, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hyun, 2010)</ref>, there is a dearth of empirical evidence to support the relationship between customers and the brand, that is, brand relationship quality <ref type="bibr">(BRQ, hereafter)</ref>. The importance of BRQ lies in the fact that it reflects customers' strong emotional and motivational tie with a brand in a similar way they relate to people <ref type="bibr">(Kim et al., 2014)</ref>. BRQ is similar to brand loyalty; however, BRQ offers conceptual richness over brand loyalty in terms of a prediction of relationship stability over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fournier, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>With this in mind, this study aims to empirically investigating the antecedents and consequences of BRQ of active hotel loyalty program members. BRQ is conceptualized as a higher order construct consisting of three dimensions of trust, satisfaction, and commitment. In order to understand the key drivers of loyalty programs that enhance the BRQ between the customers and the hotel, the perception of active users toward the loyalty program should be assessed. This is accomplished by evaluating the impact of the members' perceptions toward loyalty program activities and hotel CRM initiatives on the members' relationship quality with the hotel brand and its outcomes. In addition, the moderating role of membership level is examined to fill the research gap that lacks assessment of any impact of tier level on the loyaltyrelated outcomes. More specifically, the purposes of this study are to: 1) confirm BRQ is a higher-order construct which consists of three dimensions of trust, satisfaction, and commitment; 2) assess the impact of the hotel loyalty program at the corporate level and the various CRM initiatives at the property level on BRQ with the hotel brand; 3) assess the impact of BRQ on word-of-mouth, marketing resource, and shares of purchase; and 4) assess the moderating effect of membership level on the relationships between BRQ and its antecedents and outcomes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Brand relationship quality (BRQ)</head><p>With intense competition among global hotel companies, branding strategy has emerged as competitive advantage to increase market share and enhance customer loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Lin, 2013)</ref>. Branding is considered a powerful means of the strength of the customer-brand relationship, thus, it is argued that more effort should be placed to improve relationships between customers and the brand as it often leads to a higher intention to repurchase, financial gains, and customer retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Breivik and Thorbjørnsen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Huang et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Huber et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Smit et al., 2007)</ref>. Brand relationship quality (BRQ) is viewed as the emotional ties resulting from the interaction between the consumer and his/her brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fournier, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>The conceptualization of BRQ has been of particular interest to many marketing researchers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fournier (1998)</ref> has proposed six factors leading to a long-lasting brand relationship: love and passion, self-connection, interdependence, commitment, intimacy, and brand partner quality. Additional BRQ dimensions that are frequently used include satisfaction, brand knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Park and Kim, 2001)</ref>, and nostalgia and trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Park et al., 2002)</ref>. These constructs have been utilized in different settings of hospitality and tourism industry. The recent work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hudson et al. (2015)</ref> adapts six relationship facets of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fournier (1998)</ref> and trustworthiness of brand in association with festival brands. The study reveals a direct effect of BRQ on behavioral outcome (word-of-mouth) as well as its relevance for social media marketing. Similarly, the applicability of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fournier's (1998)</ref> BRQ framework in the hotel industry has been examined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Xie and Heung (2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kang et al. (2014)</ref> has conceptualized brand commitment and brand trust as important dimensions of BRQ in a restaurant setting.</p><p>Three dimensions are the most commonly adopted in describing consumer and employee/company relationship quality: trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Doney and Cannon, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hennig-Thurau and Klee, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Morgan and Hunt, 1994)</ref>, satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Crosby et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fullerton and Taylor, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Homburg and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Giering, 2001), and</ref><ref type="bibr">commitment (Harrison-Walker, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hennig-Thurau and Klee, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Moorman et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Prichard et al., 1999)</ref>. These are also frequently used relationship quality factors in hospitality researches <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bowen and Shoemaker, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cheng et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ha and Jang, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hyun, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Jin et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kim and Cha, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lee et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Wu and Li, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Trust is an individual's willingness to rely on an exchange partner in whom one has confidence and is the "enduring desire to maintain a valued relationship" <ref type="bibr">(Moorman et al., 1993, p.316)</ref>. It is the perception of an individual's confidence in the partner's reliability and integrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Lee and Kim, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Morgan and Hunt, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Palmatier et al., 2006)</ref>. The development of trust between customers and the brand is depicted as a process of setting expectations and evaluating whether the expectations have been met <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Garbarino and Johnson, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Overall satisfaction is an evaluation based on the total purchase and consumption experience with a good or service over time <ref type="bibr">(Anderson et al., 1994, p.54)</ref>. Evaluation of cumulative satisfaction is based on the company's past, current, and future performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Wu and Wang, 2012)</ref>. Customer satisfaction represents the customer's emotional feeling or reaction to the perceived difference between performance appraisal and expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Oliver, 1980)</ref>. It is a judgment that a product or service provides a pleasurable level of consumption-related fulfillment <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Oliver, 2015)</ref>. In addition to customer' satisfaction with the individual hotels, overall satisfaction with the hotel brand is of particular importance as this will in turn influence customers' desire to continue to patronize the hotels under the same brand. The measurement of satisfaction in this study adopts an overall assessment based on all their previous experience with the hotel brand.</p><p>Commitment is the desire to develop a stable relationship with another partner believing that a continuing relationship is vital to warrant maximum endeavors to maintaining it <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Morgan and Hunt, 1994)</ref>. It is the emotional link between the individual and the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akehurst et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ashley et al. 2011)</ref>. Customers' commitment is essential in the building and maintenance of positive relationship quality with the company. Relationship commitment is the implicit or explicit investment between customers and the company. To maintain a long-lasting relationship, both parties should be willing to make short-term sacrifice and should have the confidence in the stability of the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anderson and Weitz, 1991)</ref>. Following the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Valta (2013)</ref> on consumer brand relationship quality, this study conceptualizes BRQ as a highorder construct that consists of the dimensions including brand trust, relationship satisfaction, and relationship commitment, between the customer and the brand and not with employees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Antecedents of BRQ</head><p>There is a dearth of empirical research examining antecedents of relationship quality in the context of hotel loyalty program. In an effort to investigate what contributes to the customers' BRQ, two different antecedents are being tested: "loyalty program activities" and "hotel CRM activities." Loyalty program activities in this study refer to the benefit components that are designed at the corporate level and serve as strong motivators for customers' participation in loyalty programs. They include hotel stay-related loyalty program benefits, non-hotel stayrelated loyalty program benefits, and membership communication. Attractive membership benefits of hotel loyalty programs could increase repeated patronage, thus, possibly lead to hotel guests' loyal behaviors. In addition, customer perceptions of such benefits influence their perceived relationship investment and their relationship with the brand (Mimouni-Chaabane and Volle, 2010). Hotel CRM activities focus on the loyalty program members' experience with the different properties. While hotel loyalty programs are designed at the corporate level, individual hotels have their own CRM practices to enhance customer relationships. The customer-oriented CRM strategies adopted by individual hotels, which include customer orientation and delivery of loyalty program benefits are of great importance in creating a high quality relationship with the hotel brand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Loyalty program activities</head><p>Due to the fact that different chain hotels offer different benefits, this study has examined all benefit features of the loyalty program offered by the surveyed hotel chain, which are classified into three categories: hotel stay-related benefits, non-hotel stay-related benefits, and communication with members. Hotel stay-related benefits are the perks given to the loyalty program members which they can use and enjoy in conjunction with their hotel stay. Specific benefits include priority check-in, room-upgrade, spouse stays free, and complimentary amenities (e.g., fruits, beverages, and snacks). In this study, these rewards are defined as immediate rewards which guests can immediately redeem during their stay at the hotel. Non-hotel stay-related benefits include frequent flier mileages of partner airlines, discounts with other travel partners, membership upgrades, etc. These rewards are considered delayed rewards which members can redeem or enjoy later. It is posited that customers tend to prefer delayed reward to immediate reward or would not mind postponing the reward to a later date when the delayed reward is of higher value <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Banks et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Keh and Lee, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Perceived benefits play an important role in motivating brand loyalty and strengthening the relationship between the firm and customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bolton et al., 2000)</ref>. As customers nowadays perceive various loyalty programs as loyalty incentives in return for their repeated purchases with a firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Liu, 2007)</ref>, it is important to identify key elements of benefits that can increase customers' behavioral commitment to the firm. <ref type="bibr">Ashley et al.'s (2011)</ref> study suggests that the anticipated benefits offered by loyalty or membership cards of different type of service companies have positive impact on the respondents' receptiveness of the membership program. Therefore, this study proposes the following hypotheses: H1: Hotel-stay related membership benefits of loyalty program positively impacts BRQ. H2: Non-hotel stay-related membership benefits of loyalty program positively impacts BRQ.</p><p>The important role of communication has been emphasized in fostering a long-term relationship with customers in the hospitality industry. In a restaurant setting, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kim et al. (2006)</ref> posit that intangible antecedents such as communication are stronger predictors of relationship quality than those of the tangible antecedents (physical environment and food quality). Communication activities certainly help to reduce uncertainty and ambiguity in purchase situations. Through effective communication, companies can build trust and satisfaction and positive effect on repeat purchase from customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dichter, 1989)</ref>. Furthermore, integrated customer communication channels can facilitate community building among the loyalty program members and the delivery to customized customer experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Sigala, 2005)</ref>. The subject hotel of this study has a dedicated website for loyalty program to share information about the members' benefits. They also use emails to communicate with their members. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed: H3: Membership communication positively impacts BRQ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual hotel's CRM activities</head><p>Members' experience with the entire process of loyalty program delivery is as important as attractive loyalty program contents in establishing long term relationship with customers. Individual hotels can build relationships with their guests by trying to identify and understand their guests' requests and provide customized services during their stays <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Sigala, 2005)</ref>. Given that interactions between customers and employees are proven to influence the strength of the relationship on the level of trust and commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bove and Johnson, 2000)</ref>, this study defines individual hotel's CRM efforts that focus on the customer-oriented attitude of guest-contact employees as facilitators of loyalty program and their ability to honor and deliver the loyalty program benefits promptly and accurately. The specific items include customer orientation and the delivery of loyalty program benefits.</p><p>Customer orientation refers to the personal traits that reflect the service provider's willingness to meet the needs of customer <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brown et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Yoon et al., 2007)</ref>. Customeroriented employees tend to focus on putting customers' interests first amongst all, thus they have a significant impact on customer-employee relationships and an organization's financial and nonfinancial performance outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Teng and Barrows, 2009)</ref>. Several relationship quality literatures have found that employees' level of customer orientation is a key driver for customers' satisfaction, trust, commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cheng et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kim and Cha, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kim et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The delivery of loyalty program benefits involves brand promise fulfillment. The service marketing literature has asserted that employees are influential on customers' brand perceptions through their role in delivering both functional (what are delivered) and emotional (how they are delivered) values <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(De Chernatony, 2002)</ref>. The intangible nature of service brands further highlights the importance of brand promise fulfillment. When employees are successful in delivering a service that is consistent with the company's communicated brand values, it can strengthen customers' trust in the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(King and Grace, 2005)</ref>. Keeping promises is regarded as the core of building mutually beneficial relationship between the customer and the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kim et al., 2001)</ref>. Therefore, the ability of the employees to deliver the loyalty program benefits to the members is crucial in enhancing their relationship quality with the hotel brand. Thus, we propose the following hypotheses: H4: Employee's customer orientation positively impacts BRQ. H5: Employee's ability to deliver loyalty program benefits positively impacts BRQ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consequences of BRQ</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Word-of-mouth</head><p>Word-of-mouth is considered as one of the important consequences of commitment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Reichheld (2003)</ref> suggests that the willingness of customers to recommend a company, product or service to someone else has a positive impact on the company's business growth. The positive effect commitment on word-of-mouth can be also found in several hospitality researches. <ref type="bibr">Oh's study (1999)</ref> shows a positive relationship between customer satisfaction and word-of-mouth from luxury hotels customers. Restaurant customers with higher level of affective commitment have a higher tendency to be an advocate for the restaurant and are more likely to consider the restaurant as their top choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Mattila, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lacey (2009)</ref> also confirms that there is a significantly positive relationship between upscale retailers' relationship commitment and their intention to making personal referrals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Share of purchase</head><p>Share of purchase is found to have a positive relationship with relationship continuity <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kim and Cha, 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Mattila (2006)</ref> identifies that affective commitment is a key player to improve the overall attractiveness of the frequent-guest program, resulting in a bigger share of the customer's wallet. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Wirtz et al. (2007)</ref> provide empirical evidence of the effectiveness of credit card loyalty programs in influencing the share of wallet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Wu and Li (2011)</ref> observe that relationship quality has a significant influence on both word-of-mouth and shares of purchase. Since the population of the study is loyalty program members, there is a high likelihood that they will demonstrate closer relationship with the hotel brand than non-members, resulting in higher shares of purchases by staying more frequently and spending more at membership hotels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Willingness to serve as marketing resources</head><p>Willingness of committed customers to serve as marketing resources can be expressed by their willingness to engage in firm-sponsored marketing research activities and voluntarily share discretionary personal information with the firm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Lacey and Morgan (2007)</ref> provide an empirical evidence to support the relationship between commitment and the willingness of customers to serve as a marketing resource. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lacey (2009)</ref> confirms that relationship commitment has a direct association with customers' willingness to serve as marketing resources through the sharing of personal information and supporting marketing research activities. Therefore, cooperation from the customers in various marketing research initiatives (such as focus groups, quality circles, and surveys) can certainly help the hotel to better understand their needs and expectation. Based on the above, it is proposed that BRQ has a positive relationship with following three consequences: H6: BRQ positively impacts word-of-mouth. H7: BRQ positively impacts shares of purchase. H8: BRQ positively impacts customers' willingness to serve as marketing resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The moderating effect of membership level</head><p>Having a tiered loyalty program is effective in building a sense of identity among members within each tier and lead to commitment to the brand and more revenue for the hotels <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(McCall and Voorhees, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Tanford et al. (2011)</ref> suggest that hotel loyalty program members with different membership level exhibit differences in their emotional bonding to the brand. Their study concludes that membership tiers alone is not sufficient to produce loyal customer but must be accompanied by members' commitment to the brand. Perceived value of the benefits and privileges, emotional commitment, behavioral intentions and word-of-mouth increase as a function of the membership level <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Tanford, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Lina et al. (2014)</ref> confirms a positive relationship between members of different tiers and behavioral loyalty by exhibiting elite members' higher levels of loyalty behavior compared with basic members. Therefore, it is proposed that loyalty program membership level moderates the impact of loyalty program activities and hotel CRM activities on BRQ and the impact of BRQ on its relationship outcomes.</p><p>This study investigates the effects of loyalty program activities (benefits and communication) and hotel CRM activities (customer orientation and delivery of loyalty program benefits) on BRQ and the influence of BRQ on positive word-of-mouth, increase shares of purchase, and willingness to serve as marketing resources. The moderating role of membership level on the impact of the antecedents on BRQ and its outcomes is also examined. The proposed conceptual model and hypotheses are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODOLOGY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaire design and sample</head><p>An online questionnaire was developed based on the review of literature and in-depth interviews with the program executives of the subject hotel group and active members of the hotel's loyalty program. The questionnaire consisted of four sections: (1) BRQ (trust, satisfaction, and commitment), (2) loyalty program benefits including communication and hotel CRM activities (customer orientation and delivery of loyalty programs), (3) brand relationship quality outcomes (word-of-mouth, share of purchase, and marketing resources), and (4) respondents' demographic information and membership characteristics of the respondents. The questionnaire was translated into Chinese by a professional native Chinese translator by adopting the translationback-translation procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brislin, 1976)</ref>. The wordings of the questionnaire in both English and Chinese were reviewed by faculty members of two universities and the hotel group's loyalty program executives.</p><p>The target population for the study was active members of a hotel loyalty program offered by one of Asia-Pacific's leading luxury hotel groups with over 70 five-star luxury properties worldwide. A pilot test of the survey was conducted by distributing the paper-based questionnaire to 20 conveniently selected in-house loyalty program members of two properties of the hotel group. Clarity of the wordings of the questionnaire was also assessed by the respondents.</p><p>A total of 39,446 email invitations were sent by the hotel group directly to the active members of the loyalty program (members who are 18 years old or above and have stayed with the hotel group within the past 12 months) to invite them to participate in the online survey. If they agreed, they would be directed to either the English or Chinese online survey sites based on the language preference recorded in the member's profile.</p><p>Quota sampling was used to select members from the three different membership levels. Based on the hotel's frequent guest program's published membership qualification criteria. Basictier members are those who have stayed once at any hotels in the group and recorded at least one up to 19 qualifying room nights within one calendar year. Mid-tier members have recorded a minimum of 20 up to 59 qualifying room nights at two or more hotels in the hotel group within one calendar year. Top-tier members have recorded a minimum of 60 qualifying room nights at three or more hotels in the hotel group within one calendar year. The online survey was made available for four weeks. Reminder emails were sent to the non-respondents one week before the close of the survey. Each response (identified with a unique ID number) was sent back to the hotel group to extract demographic and membership information from their membership database. The survey responses and the demographic and membership information were combined for the analysis. A usable sample of 920 was finally included in the data analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Members' satisfaction towards the hotel stay-related loyalty program benefits, non-hotel stay-related benefits, and membership communications were measured by 18 statements using a 7-point Likert scale with 1=very dissatisfied and 7=very satisfied.

The list of statements consolidated was reviewed by faculty members of two universities. Only statements suitable for the context of this study were included. The three dimensions of BRQ were measured by eight statements: three statements measuring trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Doney and Cannon, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Morgan and Hunt, 1994)</ref>, three statements measuring satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Homburg and Giering, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fullerton and Taylor, 2002)</ref>, and two statements measuring commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Harrison-Walker, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Moorman et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Prichard et al., 1999)</ref>. Six statements were adapted from the relationship marketing literature to measure the three relationship quality outcomes, word-of-mouth <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Harrison-Walker, 2001)</ref>, share of purchase <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kim and Cha, 2002)</ref>, and willingness to serve as marketing resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Lacey and Morgan, 2007)</ref>. A 7-point Likert scale was used to measure these constructs with a scale of 1=totally disagree to 7=totally agree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Non-response bias was determined by comparing the demographic and membership characteristics of the respondents and a random sample of the non-respondents (provided by the hotel group). No major deviations were observed. This study tested the hypotheses and the relationship among the different constructs on the whole sample data in order to derive a statistically significant structural equation model. Then, we employed membership as a moderator to conduct a multi-group analysis of the final model on the three groups of respondents of different membership levels.</p><p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) with partial least squares (PLS) method was used to estimate the structural relationships. SEM was chosen because this study aimed to investigate a set of constructs that were interconnected with each other. SEM was superior to running a set of regressions in the sense that it can simultaneously estimate the measurement model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Byrne, 2010)</ref>. Therefore, it was possible for this study to examine the measurement errors of the indictors in addition to investigating the structural relationships, which made the analysis more rigorous than multiple regressions did <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ayeh et al., 2013)</ref>. The PLS method was chosen largely because it does not impose strict demand on distributional assumptions, measurement scales, and large sample sizes, which were actually difficult to meet in a cross-sectional survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hair et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Henseler et al., 2009)</ref>. The selection of the PLS method is appropriate in our study due to the complexity of the model that includes testing both the mediating effects of brand relationship quality and the moderating effects of membership level <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hair et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Valle and Assaker, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wetzels et al., 2009)</ref>. In addition, the PLS method featured by the variance-based estimation is more appropriate to test the effects of the membership as these effects are relatively exploratory in our study <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. The PLS method allows for the exploration of plausible causality among the constructs and the estimation of the model with dichotomous and formative measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ayeh et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lee et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Ryu et al., 2009)</ref>. This served the purpose of this study quite well, particularly, in relation to multi-group analysis of membership. SmartPLS (v. 3.2.1) was used to perform the analysis of the structural equation model as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>

Close to one-third of the respondents were from the Greater China region (Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan). A little more than a quarter were Europeans. Males made up more than 80% of the sample. Nearly three-quarters of respondents were married. Respondents between 36 and 45 and between 46 and 55 made up close to 60% of the sample. The 18-25 and over 65 year-old groups accounted for less than 6% of the respondents. The education level of the respondents was very high with close to 50% having attended college or above level. Only 6% of the respondents completed high school or below. Respondents with a monthly personal income of US$14,000 or above accounted for close to 30%, follow by those who earned US$3,000 or below which accounted for approximately 11% of the respondents.</p></div>

The diagnostic statistics included the factor loadings and their significance, communality, composite reliability, and Cronbach's α. All factor loadings were greater than .70 and statistically significant at .001, and the communality of all indicators were above .50 except one item (ho4) which was around .50, indicating the reliability of the indicators to measure their corresponding constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bagozzi and Yi, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hair et al., 2014)</ref>.

The values of composite reliability of all constructs were above the threshold value of .708 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>, and the values of Cronbach's α of the constructs were above the cutoff value of .70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994)</ref>, demonstrating that all the constructs had high levels of internal consistence reliability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[TABLE 3 HERE]</head><p>For testing the convergent validity of the measurement model, the AVEs of all the eleven first-order constructs were assessed.

The discriminant validity of the constructs was assessed based on the criterion that a construct should share more variance with its confirmed indicators than with any other constructs in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref>. This requires that the square root of a construct's AVE should be larger than the correlation coefficients between this construct and all other constructs in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. The square root of each construct's AVE in the model was greater than the inter-construct correlation coefficients, indicating that discriminant validity of the constructs was satisfied in the measurement model.</p></div>

We first converted each item to a single-indicator construct, ending up with a second-order construct model that was statistically equivalent to the original model; and then we included a common method factor that linked to all of the single-indicator constructs. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Liang et al.

(2014)</ref> to assess the structural model, which included assessing collinearity of the constructs, the significance and relevance of the structural relationships, coefficient of determination (R 2 ), the effect size f 2 and the predictive relevance Q 2 . The results of these assessments are presented in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6 to 8</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> shows that the tolerance (VIF) values of four predictor constructs were below the threshold value of 5 except for BRQ as a second-order construct, indicating that collinearity among the predictor constructs was not a concern in the structural model. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref> shows the values of R 2 of the seven endogenous constructs. Except for MR and PR with relatively weak R 2 values (below .25), all other endogenous constructs' variance was moderately or substantially explained by the predictor constructs. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref> shows the values of f 2 size and Q 2 , which were used to assess each of the exogenous constructs' contribution to an endogenous construct's R 2 value and its predictive relevance for the endogenous construct, respectively. While the f 2 values of DOL and NHRB indicated that these two constructs had relatively small effects on BRQ, the rest of the exogenous construct had medium and large effects on the target endogenous constructs. All the Q 2 values were greater than zero, indicating that the exogenous constructs had predictive relevance for the endogenous constructs under consideration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[TABLE 6 HERE] [TABLE 7 HERE] [TABLE 8 HERE]</head><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>, the results of the PLS analysis of the structural relationships indicate that all the structural relationships except DOL → BRQ and NHRB → BRQ were statistically significant. BRQ had substantially strong relationships with its three low-order components (LOCs), namely TR (β = .924, p &lt; .001), SA (β = .879, p &lt; .001), and CI (β = .831, p &lt; .001). Hence, the three LOCs were sufficiently highly correlated for BRQ to explain more than 50% of each LOC's variance. We therefore conclude that the second-order reflective construct of BRQ was confirmed in the structural model.</p><p>The results show that among BRQ's antecedent constructs, COR had the largest positive effect on BRQ (β = .522, p &lt; .001), followed by CMU (β = .157, p &lt; .001) and HRB (β = .148, p &lt; .001). We did not find evidence that DOL and NHRB affected BRQ as the associated structural relationships were statistically non-significant. For BRQ's consequence constructs, we found that BRQ had the largest positive effect on WM (β = .713, p &lt; .001), followed by PR (β = .400, p &lt; .001) and MR (β = -.100, p &lt; .05). It is worth noting that BRQ had a slightly negative effect on marketing resource (MR), which somewhat contradicted our hypothesis yet had important implications.</p><p>[FIGURE <ref type="figure">2</ref> HERE] Mediation analysis of brand relationship quality We followed <ref type="bibr">Hair et al.'s (2014)</ref> three-step procedure to test the mediation effects of BRQ (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">9</ref>). In the first step we assessed the direct effects of BRQ's five antecedent constructs on its three consequence constructs by excluding BRQ in the structural model. We rejected four structural relationships as they were statistically non-significant, indicating no mediating effects of BRQ on the four structural relationships. In the second step, we included BRQ as the mediator construct to assess the significance of a series of indirect effects. We further rejected five mediation effects as the indirect effects were statistically non-significant. Finally, we employed the variance accounted for (VAF), a ratio of the indirect effect to the total effect of the target construct, to assess the strength of the remaining six mediation effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[TABLE 9 HERE]</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Hair et al.'s (2014)</ref>, a value of VAF below .20 indicates no mediation effects, between 0.20 and 0.80 indicating partial mediation, and above 0.80 indicating full mediation. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">9</ref> shows that among the fifteen relationships mediated by BRQ, the effects of BRQ's three antecedent constructs (CMU, COR, and HRB) on all its three consequence constructs (PR, WM, and MR) were partially mediated by BRQ. Specially, BRQ explained the effects of CMU on PR and WM by 23.7% and 45.1% respectively; it explained the effects of COR on MR and WM by 25.8% and 43.4% respectively; and it explained the effect of HRB on WM by 33.4%.

The PLS-MGA was conducted with 431 observations from the basic-tier members, 343 observations from the mid-tier members, and 146 observations from the top-tier. We aimed to test whether membership can moderate the structural relationships of the theoretical model across the three subgroups.</p><p>Evidence was found for the moderating effect of membership at the path level. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">10</ref> shows that the significance of the four structural relationships were accounted for by the membership. Specifically, CMU → BRQ was statistically non-significant in the top-tier group, indicating that for the top-tier members CMU did not affect BRQ; HRB → BRQ was statistically non-significant in the basic-tier group, suggesting that for the basic-tier members HRB did not affect BRQ; and NHRB → BRQ was only statistically significant in the mid-tier group, indicating that for the mid-tier members NHRB did affect BRQ. Finally, BRQ → MR was statistically significant in the basic-tier group, suggesting that for the basic-tier members BRQ affected MR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[TABLE 10 HERE]</head><p>It is worth noting that among all the statistically significant structural relationships across the three groups, the structural relationship COR → BRQ was significantly different between the top-tier and the other two groups. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">10</ref> shows that the effect of COR on BRQ was significantly larger in both the basic-and mid-tier groups than that in the top-tier group while no significant difference of this relationship was found between the basic-and mid-tier groups. This indicates that for the top-tier members the effect of COR on BRQ was not as evident as it in the other two groups.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This study contributes to the understanding of the antecedents and consequences of BRQ and the body of knowledge about hotel loyalty program in several important ways. This study confirms that BRQ is a higher order construct of trust, satisfaction, and commitment. Employee's customer orientation, membership communication, and hotel-stay related benefits, are found to be determinants of the hotel loyalty program members' BRQ. The strongest effect of BRQ is on members' word-of-mouth followed by shares of purchase. BRQ is found to have negative effect on members' willingness to serve as marketing resource but the impact is small. Finally, the moderating effects of the membership level in the structural model are partially supported. Finally, the results provide insights into managerial guidance on hotel loyalty program design and execution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>Although a number of hotel's loyalty program studies have extensively investigated antecedents and consequences of relationship quality, these studies have mainly focused on the relationship between customers and employees not between customers and brands. It is argued that more attention should be paid to BRQ within a broader spectrum of consumer-brand relationship as an alternative to the concept of brand loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fournier, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Huber et al., 2010)</ref>. In adapting a BRQ framework to a hospitality setting, this study attempted to investigate the richness of a brand relationship perspective in a hotel loyalty program setting. This was done by conceptualizing BRQ as the second order construct (with the three dimensions of trust, satisfaction, and commitment) and the antecedents and behavioral outcomes from the perspective of active loyalty program members. In order to determine what truly drives the success of loyalty program, it is essential to assessing the experience and perception of loyalty program users, who are actively participating in the program.</p><p>Unlike several BRQ studies that have conceptualized relationship quality as a single latent construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(De Wulf et al., 2001 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">De Canniere et al., 2009)</ref>, BRQ is conceptualized as a higherorder construct in this study. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>, BRQ had substantially strong relationships with its three low-order components (LOCs), namely TR (β = .924, p &lt; .001), SA (β = .879, p &lt; .001), and CI (β = .831, p &lt; .001). Hence, the three LOCs were sufficiently highly correlated for BRQ to explain more than 50% of each LOC's variance. The results demonstrate the significant relationships of the three LOCs with BRQ and supports the conceptualization of BRQ as a higherorder construct in <ref type="bibr">Valta's study (2013)</ref>.</p><p>In examining the impact of the antecedents of BRQ, it was demonstrated that BRQ was influenced by two of the three types of loyalty program benefits (hotel-stay related benefits, and membership communication) and one of property-level CRM activities (customer orientation). Membership communication has comparatively higher impact on BRQ when compared to the other two loyalty program benefits (β = .1571, p &lt; .001). The finding supported previous studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chong, 2007 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kim et al., 2006)</ref>, which identified the importance of communication with customers in enhancing trust and other relationship quality dimensions. Hotel-stay related benefits (β = .148, p &lt; .001) were found to have a significant impact on BRQ. Given that the hotel-stay related benefits are considered immediate rewards whereas non-hotel-stay benefits are delayed rewards, the results showed that immediate rewards are more effective in building emotional bond between the members and the hotel. The effectiveness of immediate rewards was also illustrated in the study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hu et al. (2010)</ref>. Non-hotel-stay benefits have no significant impact of the BRQ, which demonstrates that delayed rewards do not contribute to enhancing the relationship between the hotel brand and the members.</p><p>In terms of the individual hotels' CRM activities, employee's customer orientation had the largest positive effect on BRQ (β = .522, p &lt; .001). This is consistent with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kim and Cha, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kim et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lo et al., 2010)</ref>, which emphasized the employees' willingness to tailor the customers' different needs and wants during face-to-face encounters with customers. In consideration of a critical role of hotel employees in gaining customers' trust, employees who are committed to prioritizing customers' interests and needs can fulfill the brand promise to customers. As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Herington et al. (2006)</ref>, firm-employee relationship is a prerequisite to the customer-firm relationship. In this sense, the results imply that hotels need to create a shared understanding of the brand promise to the customers and what they can do to deliver on its promise, thus enhance customers' relationship quality. The relationship between employee's customer orientation and BRQ was significantly different between the top-tier and the other two groups. The impact of employee's customer orientation on BRQ is about half the strength in the top-tier group as compared to the other two groups. This may be due to the fact that the expectations of the top-tier members on employee's customer orientation are much higher than the other members <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Tanford, 2013)</ref>. Delivery of loyalty program benefits was found to have an insignificant relationship with BRQ. The result is contrary to the literature that employees' ability to fulfill and deliver brand promise can strengthen customers' trust in the relationship with the brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(King and Grace, 2005)</ref>. This result demonstrates that employees' delivery of emotional value plays a more significant role than the delivery of the functional values to the customers. It supports the findings of prior research that highlights the critical role of customer-employee relationship in enhancing the quality of relationship between customers and the company (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Erkmen and Hancer, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In examining the relationship between BRQ and its outcomes, the study found the strongest effect of BRQ on members' word-of-mouth (β = .713, p &lt; .001), followed by shares of purchase (β = .400, p &lt; .001). This result is in line with past studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kim and Cha, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Magi, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Wu and Li, 2011)</ref>, supporting that commitment to the hotel brand can enhance loyalty program members' referral behavior and increase frequency of stay at membership hotels.</p><p>On the other hand, this study shows that BRQ has a negative significant relationship with members' willingness to serve as marketing resources. The result implies that members with higher BRQ tend to be less willing to serve as marketing resources for the hotel brand. Unlike prior research conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lacey (2009)</ref>, this study failed to verify positive impact of BRQ on customers' willingness to serve as marketing resources. Customers nowadays may tend to avoid being regarded as a marketing resource especially when this action may have to do with disclosing their personal information or privacy. In this regard, serving as marketing resource is different from word-of-mouth, which is completely spontaneous. Also, the size of the negative effect of BRQ on willingness to serve as marketing resource was quite small and the results for the relationship between the two constructs were somewhat mixed (significant for all and the basictier members, and insignificant for the mid-tier and top-tier members), therefore it is concluded that the negative relationship between BRQ and willingness to serve as marketing resource is weak. The moderating effect of membership level on the relationship between BRQ and the other two relationship outcomes: shares of purchase and word-of-mouth is significant. The results may imply that the effects of BRQ can be limited according to different relational outcomes being investigated, thus, loyalty program marketers have to be more cautious of not being overly dependent on loyalty program as a sole relationship marketing tool. This study has investigated the impact of membership level on the antecedents and outcomes of members' emotional commitment. The results demonstrated that moderating effect of membership was found at path level and support the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Tanford (2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>This study provides insights into managerial guidance about hotel relationship marketing. First, the results of the study indicate that employee's customer orientation, membership communication, hotel-stay-related benefits, are determinants of the loyalty program members' relationship quality with the brand. Poorly designed loyalty program may produce adverse effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Ou et al., 2011)</ref>. Given that loyalty programs will only be successful if the appropriate benefits are chosen <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Butscher, 2002)</ref>, it is important for loyalty program managers to identify the benefits that are more effective in enhancing the perceptions of members of different membership tiers on the value of the loyalty program. This can be done through importance-performance analysis (IPA) to determine the competitiveness of benefits structure of the loyalty program. The IPA can be very powerful tool in assessing the attractiveness of overall loyalty program by providing a snapshot of how well the loyalty program meets the members' important concerns on selected benefits. Loyalty program managers can then decide how to best allocate limited marketing resources to maximize the customers' brand relationship quality. In addition, the managers may need to consider generation differences between the Baby Boomers and Millennials into the design of loyalty program as the Millennials are emerging in hotel business <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bowen and McCain, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In evaluating their impact on customers' perceived relationship with the brand, two types of benefits, immediate and delayed benefits, were assessed. The results suggest that the active members are more likely to be attracted by the value of immediate rewards (e.g., priority checkin, room upgrade, and discounts), which they can immediately redeem their rewards during their stay, rather than save it for later use. This implies that loyalty program managers need to consider the role of reward timing with more emphasis on immediate rewards when developing the value of loyalty program. Loyalty program managers should thoroughly review their current program benefits to reconstruct more distinguishable benefits that are different from competitors and will be valued by active members.</p><p>The intangible nature of service also prompts a hotel to implement effective communication strategy to reduce the uncertainty experienced by customers in the service transaction. Therefore, the communication activities should help develop targeted and relevant communications exclusively for members with different membership tiers through various communication channels such as e-mails, websites, text messaging, and social networking. Integrated communications channels for more personalized network that includes loyalty program members, hotel entities (employees and managements), and external groups (media, hospitalityrelated industry, and external partners) should be devised to create more effective two-way communications. Hotel loyalty program managers need to facilitate collaborative experience and dialogue that customers value <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baird and Parasnis, 2011)</ref>. In this regard, more attention should be paid to the rise of social media as it is reshaping the ways people communicate, collaborate, and connect with others <ref type="bibr">(Henning-Thurau et al., 2010)</ref>. In an effort to reinforce customer-brand relationship, loyalty program managers need to better understand this increasing demand from customers and implement strategies to have their customers more engaged with brand on the social media platforms for direct interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Labrecque, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lee et al. (2015)</ref>, loyalty program benefits can be classified into economic and social rewards. Economic rewards are found to have a stronger impact on loyalty than social rewards. However, social rewards can influence relational behaviors of the customers and increase affective commitment. These kind of social rewards strongly rely on the hotel employees' ability to focus on the needs of the individual members and be able to recognize them as human individuals but not as membership numbers in a database. Being customer oriented may be of particular importance in many Asian countries where more emphasis is placed on the long-term development of relational bonding and trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Geddie et al., 2002)</ref>. This type of social practice is built on the foundation of implicit exchange of favors and a commitment to others through a silent code of reciprocity and equity <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Luo, 1997)</ref>. In this sense, it is not surprising that the surveyed Asian members of hotel loyalty program in the study prefer building relationship with employees who put customers first before the actual business transaction take place.</p><p>Customers' trust in hotel brand can be gained when employees are ensured to deliver the service as promised by the brand. Therefore, the hotel should develop effective internal branding programs to foster the employees' understanding of the brand promise to the customers, thus enhancing customer orientation. Human resources policies (such as hiring the people with the right attitude and training them with the right skills) and internal communications (formal and informal) need to be well orchestrated to disseminate consistent brand messages across employees located in different parts of the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Punjaisri et al., 2008)</ref>. Hotel companies can also encourage their customers to be advocates for their brands via social media. Brand advocates tend to recommend their favorite products because they have had a fantastic experience and want to help others <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Jacobs, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research</head><p>Several limitations of the research need to be acknowledged. The population of this study is limited to those who were active loyalty program members of an Asian luxury hotel chain. Therefore, the results may not be generalizable to members of other loyalty programs. Additional research is highly encouraged to collaborate with other hotel loyalty programs to compare the results. The conceptual model proposed in this study can also be replicated in subsequent studies, targeting loyalty program members with different nationalities to investigate how different cultures can impact customer-hotel brand relationship and behavioral outcomes. This study includes only active members who have stayed with the hotel group at least once over the past 12 months. It would be of interest to assess the perceptions of inactive members, those who have been promoted or demoted to different membership levels, and their years of membership, in order to generate more practical insights for the hotel chain to modify and enhance their program.</p><p>The current study may have excluded other additional benefit items of the loyalty program that might better explain the relationship between customers and hotel brand. Future research should investigate additional dimensions of loyalty program benefits that may influence relationship quality and customer's loyalty behavior. This study attempted to operationalize BRQ as a second order construct with trust, satisfaction, and commitment as the first order latent constructs and identify the antecedents and consequences of BRQ. Although these three constructs were seen as the key drivers of BRQ in a number of relationship quality studies, there may be other dimensions that can better conceptualize the hotel brand relationship quality. More research is encouraged to bridge this gap. Further efforts should be devoted to validate the effectiveness of this model in evaluating strengths of the BRQ for loyalty programs of the hospitality and tourism sector such as airlines and casinos.</p><p>Finally, the moderating effects of the membership were partially supported in this study. The reason might be that the sample size for the top-tier group was not sufficiently large so as to be comparable with other two groups. The PLS path modeling algorithm requires groups' sample sizes to be fairly similar when performing a multi-group analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Sarstedt et al., 2011)</ref>. In this regard, future research is suggested to investigate the moderating effects of the membership either by increasing the sample size of the top-tier group or by constructing a different model of relationship quality.   .900 *** .810 The X hotel group makes an effort to know its customers (tr2)</p><p>.891 *** .793 I trust the X hotel group and its staff (tr3)</p><p>.907 *** .823 Word-of-mouth <ref type="bibr">(WM)</ref> .900 .782 I will recommend X hotel group to my friends and families (wm1)</p><p>.933 *** .871 I will tell others about any good aspects of X hotel group (wm3)</p><p>.                 </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>CI = Commitment, CMU = Communication, COR = Employee's Customer Orientation, DOL = Delivery of Loyalty Programs, HRB = Hotel-stay Related Benefits, MR = Marketing Resources, NHRB = Non-Hotel-stay Related Benefits, PR = Shares of Purchase, BRQ = Brand Relationship Quality, SA = Satisfaction, TR = Trust, and WM = Word-of-Mouth. *** p &lt; .001.</figDesc></figure>
