<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose</head><p>Animal models implicate candida colonization facilitating invasive bacterial infections. The clinical relevance of this microbial interaction remains unde ned. Observations from studies of anti-septic, antibiotic, anti-fungal, and non-decontamination-based interventions to prevent ICU acquired infection collectively serve as a natural experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Three candidate generalized structural equation models (GSEM), with Candida and Pseudomonas colonization as latent variables, were confronted with blood culture and respiratory tract isolate data derived from 460 groups from 279 studies including studies of combined antibiotic and antifungal exposures within selective digestive decontamination (SDD) interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Introducing an interaction term between Candida colonization and Pseudomonas colonization substantially improved GSEM model t. Model derived coe cients for singular exposure to anti-septic agents (-1.23; -2.1 to -0.32), amphotericin (-1.78; -2.79 to -0.78) and topical antibiotic prophylaxis (TAP; +1.02; +0.11 to + 1.93) versus Candida colonization were similar in magnitude but contrary in direction. By contrast, the model-derived coe cients for singular exposure to TAP, as with anti-septic agents, versus Pseudomonas colonization were weaker or non-signi cant. Singular exposure to amphotericin would be predicted to more than halve candidemia and Pseudomonas bacteremia incidences versus literature benchmarks for absolute differences of approximately one percentage point or less.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>GSEM modelling of published data supports the postulated interaction between Candida and Pseudomonas colonization towards promoting bacteremia among ICU patients. The model implicates that anti-fungal agents have greater impact in preventing bacteremia versus TAP, which has no impact.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Animal models implicate candida colonization facilitating invasive bacterial infections <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. Which of over 600 catalogued immunological, biochemical, metabolic and mechanical processes might underlie this interaction between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans and, moreover, whether it has clinical relevance, remain challenging to investigate <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Conceptually, clinical investigation of this postulated interaction would manipulate candida colonization among patients and measure the resulting bacteremia incidence <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. Such a manipulation would be logistically complex. Additional challenges to such an approach are that the blood stream infection (BSI) endpoints are generally uncommon or rare, the key body site location of any postulated interaction, whether the oropharynx or elsewhere, remains unclear and measuring colonization, whether bacterial or candida, is problematic. Moreover, whether changes in the metabolic activity, hyphal growth or the mere viable count of Candida colonisation drives any interaction remains moot.</p><p>A novel approach uses the collective observations from numerous studies of assorted and variously formulated anti-septic, antibiotic, anti-fungal, and non-decontamination-based interventions in the prevention of ICU acquired infections such as ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. Candidemia and bacteremia incidences, being occasional secondary endpoints within these studies, in association with varying Candida colonisation occurring as a bystander process to the study intervention, serve as a natural experiment.</p><p>Selective digestive decontamination (SDD), a widely studied antibiotic-based regimen, combines antibiotic and antifungal exposures. Moreover, the SDD concept invokes population effects and several SDD studies in the ICU setting avoid these anticipated contextual effects by using either non-concurrent or no control group patients <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. These contextual effects need to be considered in any analysis.</p><p>The objectives here are threefold. Firstly, to recapitulate the study level evidence for various ICU infection prevention interventions versus each of VAP and BSI with Candida or Pseudomonas. Second, to develop models of colonization and infection based on the postulated interaction between Candida and Pseudomonas colonization as impacted by various infection prevention interventions and confront the models using group level infection data using GSEM modelling. Thirdly, to estimate the relative impacts of anti-septic, antibiotic, and speci c anti-fungal agents as singular or compound exposures on bacteremia and candidemia within the optimal GSEM model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials And Methods</head><p>Being an analysis of published work, ethics committee review of this study was not required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study selection and decant of groups</head><p>The literature search and study decant used here is as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> and is detailed in The various study level and group level data were extracted for tabulation and to serve as indicator variables in the GSEM models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visual benchmarking</head><p>Scatter plots of VAP and blood stream infections in association with Candida and Pseudomonas infection were generated to facilitate a visual survey of the entire data versus benchmarks as derived from the literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimation of summary effect sizes</head><p>As study events were rare, summary effect sizes were derived using the Peto's log odds ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. The Stata meta command was used for deriving summary effect sizes, the associated measures of betweenstudy heterogeneity and the caterpillar plots which display the results of individual studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GSEM models: Measurement components</head><p>The incidences of VAP and blood stream infections in association with Candida Pseudomonas were extracted. As Candida is generally not considered a cause of VAP, the count of Candida as a respiratory tract (RT Candida) isolate among patients with suspected VAP was recorded. These counts were each transformed to proportions using the number of patients with prolonged (&gt; 24 hours) ICU stay as the denominator. In the GSEM models, Candida and Pseudomonas colonization are each latent variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GSEM models: indicator variables</head><p>The following data constitute the indicator variables of the GSEM models; origin from trauma ICU's, being de ned here as an ICU with &gt; 50% of admissions being for trauma, whether more than 90% of patients of the group received more than 24 hours of MV, and a mean (or median) length of ICU stay (ICU-LOS) for the group greater than 7 days. In the extraction of MV percentages, if this was not stated for any group, the percentage receiving MV of less than 90% was assumed. In the extraction of ICU-LOS data from the studies, surrogate measures including mean (or median) length of mechanical ventilation were taken if the length of ICU-LOS was not available in order to generate a binary variable of ICU-LOS of greater or less than 7 days. Also, the presence of any of the following group wide risk factors for candidemia (CRF) and invasive Candida infection were noted; liver transplantation or liver failure, use of parenteral nutrition, surgery for intestinal perforation, pancreatitis, and being colonized with Candida, however that was de ned. Antiseptic exposure included use of agents such as chlorhexidine, povidone-iodine and iseganan regardless of whether the application was to the oropharynx, by tooth-brushing or by body-wash.</p><p>Antibiotic-based interventions were classi ed as follows. Topical antibiotic prophylaxis (TAP) is de ned without regard to the speci c antibiotic constituents and whether application was to the oropharynx and or gastrointestinal tract. Protocolized parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis (PPAP) is use of prophylactic parenteral antibiotic as dictated by the study protocol whether to intervention group alone or to both control and intervention groups (duplex studies). Exposure to anti-fungal prophylaxis was identi ed whether as a single agent or in combination with antibiotic-based interventions as within SDD or selective oropharyngeal decontamination (SOD) regimens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural equation modelling</head><p>In the GSEM models, the VAP and blood stream infection proportion data, serve as the measurement components, the group level exposure parameters serve as the indicator variables and colonization with each of Candida and Pseudomonas, being represented as latent variables, link the indicator and measurement components.</p><p>Three candidate GSEM models were developed. The rst two, with and without the inclusion of an interaction terms between the latent variables, being Candida colonization and Pseudomonas colonization and the third with the addition of concurrent control group membership within an antibioticbased study as an indicator variable.</p><p>Because the observations are clustered by study, study identi ers were used in the models to enable generation of robust variance covariance matrices of the coe cient estimate parameters. The GSEM model with the lowest Akaike's information criterion (AIC) score was selected as having parsimony and optimal t from among the candidate models using the 'GSEM' command in Stata (Stata 17, College Station Texas, USA) <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. The post model predictions were obtained using the command 'nlcom' to obtain nonlinear combinations of estimators</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characteristics of the studies</head><p>Of the 279 studies identi ed by the search, most were sourced from 23 systematic reviews (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1;</ref><ref type="table">Fig</ref>  <ref type="bibr">1)</ref>, most were published between 1990 and 2010 and most had a mean ICU-LOS exceeding seven days. Twelve studies had more than one type of intervention group and 15 studies had either more than one or no control group. The majority of groups from studies of infection prevention interventions had less than 150 patients per group versus more than 150 patients in the observational studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The incidence of BSI (Fig 2) and VAP (Fig S1 -S2</head><p>) with each of Candida and Pseudomonas ranged approximately 100-fold across the various control and intervention groups of the 279 studies. In each case, the incidence was approximately 50% higher among concurrent control groups within studies where intervention groups received TAP versus a benchmark derived from observational groups. The candidemia incidence was higher among groups from SAF studies as patient selection for most of these studies was commonly based on presence of CRF.</p><p>Bacteremia and candidemia incidences were generally lower among studies of anti-septic interventions as there was a lower proportion with respect to each of the following versus other study categories: mean length of stay less than 7 days, trauma ICU's, patient selection for CRF and use of MV for &gt; 48 hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary effect sizes</head><p>Among the summary prevention effects, the strongest was for antibiotic-based interventions versus Pseudomonas VAP (odds ratio 0.33; 95% CI; 0.26 to 0.42) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). In the prevention of candidemia, the indicative summary effect size for the SAF and antibiotic-based interventions were similar. All other summary effect estimates for all other interventions versus the VAP, bacteremia, or candidemia endpoints were either weaker or not signi cant (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>; Fig S3 <ref type="figure">-S6</ref>). Of note, surprisingly, no signi cant prevention effect for Pseudomonas bacteremia was apparent for any intervention (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>; Fig S3 <ref type="figure">-S6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GSEM modelling</head><p>Three GSEM models of the relationship between various group level exposures on Candida and Pseudomonas colonization as latent variables were evaluated for t and parsimony (Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>; In the optimal model, the coe cients for singular exposure to anti-septic agents (-1.23; -2.1 to -0.32), amphotericin (-1.78; -2.79 to -0.78) and topical antibiotic prophylaxis (TAP; +1.02; +0.11 to +1.93) versus Candida colonization were similar in magnitude but contrary in direction.</p><p>In all models, group wide exposure to CRF, anti-septics and singular exposures to each of TAP and antifungals, although less so for nystatin, displayed strong and signi cant associations with the Candida colonization latent variable, and these were generally consistent across the three models. By contrast, the same exposures versus Pseudomonas colonization were generally weaker, less consistent between models and variably signi cant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post GSEM modelling predictions</head><p>Post model predictions of Pseudomonas bacteremia and Candidemia incidences were estimated for a putative group of non-trauma ICU patients with group mean LOS greater than seven days and without patient selection for CRF. Predictions were made for various combination and singleton group wide exposures to anti-septic agents, TAP, PPAP, nystatin and amphotericin versus a benchmark derived for an equivalent putative non-concurrent control group (Fig <ref type="figure">4</ref>). In every case, singleton exposure to either amphotericin or to anti-septics outperformed singleton exposure to TAP towards lower predicted bacteremia incidences. Exposure to TAP combined with amphotericin, but not nystatin, was associated with signi cantly lower predicted bacteremia incidences versus benchmark.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>There were three objectives here. Firstly, the study level evidence for various ICU infection prevention interventions toward preventing VAP and BSI derived here broadly recapitulates prior summary estimates among systematic reviews in the literature (Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. The effect sizes are indicative as each category includes broadly selected studies, with some having compound interventions, such as TAP combined with an anti-fungal, together with without PPAP given to either or both of control and intervention groups in antibiotic-based studies. The selection of studies in the summaries here is congruous with that in the literature summaries. Of note, the concurrent control groups within antibioticbased intervention studies have unusually high incidences for several end-points that are unexplained in previous meta-regression models, taking into account several other group level variables not included here, such as year of publication, and likely represents a contextual effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</p><p>The second objective is the development of GSEM models. The optimal model includes both the postulated interaction between Candida and Pseudomonas colonization and the contextual in uences of TAP on concurrent control groups. In confronting the optimal GSEM model with published group level infection data, the anti-fungal agents, such as azoles and amphotericin, and anti-septic agents, each showed strong prevention effects versus Candida colonization. By contrast, TAP as a singular exposure versus Pseudomonas colonization and versus Candida colonization demonstrated effects that were weaker and variable in direction and signi cance.</p><p>Thirdly, in post GSEM model predictions, the estimated effects of singular exposure to topical amphotericin and anti-septic agents would each more than halve the incidence of candidemia and Pseudomonas bacteremia, although for absolute differences being approximately one percentage point or less. These differences would be challenging to detect. For example, a cluster-randomized trial demonstrating halving in Pseudomonas bacteremia incidence from 1% in the control group to 0.5% in the intervention group would need to enrol over 2,000 ICU's each providing 500 patients per arm to provide 80% power.</p><p>By contrast, singular TAP exposure, with or without PPAP in combination, was either neutral or promoted bacteremia and candidemia incidence. Of note, the most common PPAP among SDD studies is cefotaxime, which is not generally active against Pseudomonas. That antibiotic exposure in the ICU environment paradoxically promotes Pseudomonas acquisition is a nding with precedent <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>. Moreover, bacterial colonization rebounds following cessation of TAP with effects on the whole-of-ICU population <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. Whether rebound contributes to colonization pressure, and the contextual effects of TAP exposure, needs to be further examined <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>.</p><p>The observations here are paradoxical. On the one hand, antibiotic-based interventions show strong prevention effects against VAP that is most apparent for Pseudomonas VAP together with a halving in candidemia among studies of antibiotic-based interventions.</p><p>On the other hand, despite these two strong prevention effects of antibiotic-based interventions, there is insigni cant prevention of Pseudomonas bacteremia. Moreover, the incidences of candidemia and bacteremia are generally higher among the concurrent control groups of antibiotic-based studies.</p><p>These observations, while paradoxical, potentially explain how ICU-acquired gram-negative bacteremia might occur seemingly without preceding colonization <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr">36]</ref>. They also could account for the bacteremia prevention effects observed in large studies of antibiotic-based interventions of SDD regimens containing topical polymyxin and tobramycin combined with amphotericin as the anti-fungal <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>, whereas the largest SDD study, where the same TAP regimen was combined with nystatin <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, failed to demonstrate any prevention effects against any bacteremia, or candidemia, end-points.</p><p>The SEM technique is an emerging method among critical care and infection pathogenesis research that enables group level modelling of multiple simultaneously observed variables <ref type="bibr">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr">38]</ref>. This technique enables the testing of concepts that infer relationships between observed variables mediated through latent variables. GSEM allows generalized linear response functions in addition to the linear response functions allowed by non-generalized SEM. A strength of GSEM modelling is the ability to incorporate observations from clusters with missing observations under the assumption of missing at random. This enables the inclusion of groups from studies either lacking control groups or providing data for only some end-points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>There are multiple limitations and cautions in the interpretation of the modelling here. The GSEM is a group level modelling of two latent variables, Candida and Pseudomonas within a postulated model of interaction. These latent variables and the coe cients derived in the GSEM are indicative only. They have no counterpart at the level of any one patient or study and cannot be directly measured.</p><p>The second limitation is that there was no ability nor purpose to adjust for the underlying patient level risk. There was considerable heterogeneity in the interventions, populations, and study designs among the studies meeting intentional broad inclusion criteria. This stands in contrast to the technique of network meta-analysis (NMA) applied to data obtained from studies meeting tight inclusion criteria in order to satisfy transitivity assumptions. With transitivity, a NMA enables comparisons of multiple interventions as allocated to comparable patient groups within randomized controlled trials towards estimating patient level effects from study level data. By contrast, the GSEM technique enables modelling of group-level associations towards deriving group level inferences among patient groups experiencing compound exposures within studies assembled with less stringent inclusion criteria. This allows the inclusion of concurrent control groups from antibiotic-based studies where contextual effects invalidate the transitivity assumption.</p><p>The third limitation is that the GSEM model is deliberately simplistic. There are only limited numbers of key group level factors, the exposures are entered as binary variables, and with interaction between the latent variables being the only interactions tested. In reality, the relationships between expoures and outcomes will likely be graded and complex with potentially compound expoure interactions.</p><p>Finally, the various regimens of antibiotic-based, anti-septic and anti-fungal interventions used within the various studies have been considered as similar within each category. This is a deliberate simpli cation as some, for example some SAF interventions were administered parenterally rather than topically. Also, the intensity and duration of application, and the body site targeted by the various interventions, varied among the studies and have not been modelled. On the other hand, a strength of this analysis is that the various compound interventions, as for example within SDD regimens comprising TAP, PPAP, and antifungal components, are factorized towards estimating their separate singleton associations on the latent variables within the GSEM model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>GSEM modelling of Pseudomonas and candida colonization, each as latent variables versus group level exposures, demonstrates complex and paradoxical relationships that would not be apparent in any single study examined in isolation nor within a summary effect of the collective studies as derived by conventional meta-analytic modelling. The model provides support to the postulated interaction between candida and Pseudomonas colonization in facilitating invasive Pseudomonas infections. Anti-fungal interventions have potentially stronger prevention impact on Pseudomonas bacteremia, mediated via candida colonization, than does singleton TAP exposures, which has no impact or PPAP, which promotes Pseudomonas bacteremia.  </p></div>
