<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Different types of safety measures are very important for any organization so that the employees of the organization feel satisfied with their jobs. There are different behavioral and psychological aspects related to the safety culture. The basic objective of the study was to find out the impact of safety culture behavioral aspects, safety culture psychological aspects and use of mobile technology on employee well-being in the mediating role of safety at work. The data has been collected from 450 employees working in the herbal companies and Software program have been run on the collected data. The results of these tests show that the impact of the independent variables i.e. safety culture psychological aspects and use of mobile technology on employee well being is significant. But the imapct of safety culture behvaioral aspects has not been found as significant. In the similar way, the mediating impact of safety at work is significant in all cases i.e. between the relationship between all independent and dependent variables. The author has identified different theoratical, practical and policy making benefits of the study. Different limitations and future research indications in assiciation with this study have also been discussed.</p></div>

Through the promotion of safety knowledge among the employees, the organizations focus on the practical approach of this knowledge and enhance participation of the employees in safety measurements. Through the safety culture at enterprises, the employees learn about the hazards that they may come in contact with and the possible ways to reduce such hazards (C.

Therefore, this study will focus on the safety culture aspects that have been practiced in the industrial sector of Thailand. The best practices of safety culture helps in improving the safety Moreover, the present study also focused on the safety culture practices at the workplace in terms of the employees and participation from them. Previous literature studies focused on the safety practices that must be implemented by the administration and the governmental organizations but not on the practical practices of the employees. Therefore, the study will focus on the employee's perspective of the safety culture and the use of mobile technology that will affect the safety practices ta the workplace.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">REVIEW OF LITERATURE AND THEORETICAL BACKGROUND</head><p>The relationship between the safety culture aspects and practices at the workplace and the wellbeing of the employees can be best understood with the "ABC theory of safety". According to this theory, one of the most important determinants of the safety practice at the workplace is the behavior of the employee at the workplace regarding the safety practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cox &amp; Jones, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Guldenmund, 2000)</ref>. This theory also states that for the successful implementation of any of the management practices, the attitude and commitment of the employees is very important. Especially for the efficient environmental management systems and safety practices ta the workplace, the sole focus could not be on the compliance but rather it must be on the culture of the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jianhua &amp; Xiaoyan, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Xie &amp; Guo, 2018)</ref>. One of the focus aspects of this theory is that, the message regarding the safety practices must be simple as ABC so it would be easy for the employees to understand it, if it is too difficult and over-complicated, the employees would not get it and practice it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The impact of safety culture behavior aspects on the safety at work</head><p>The attitude and behavior of the employees is very important for the implementation and effective management of the safety culture. According to the research studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bernal, Colombo, Al Ai Baky, &amp; Casalegno, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lanzotti et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Williams &amp; Cendón, 2019)</ref>, the safety culture was introduced as a result of the increased number of workplace accidents that happened in past and thus, the new developed safety standards focused on the behavior of the employees towards the safety culture along with the regulations and practices that must be carried out and practiced by the organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abniki, Bastan, Kasiralvalad, &amp; Ahmadvand, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ciaccio, Del Cimmuto, &amp; La Torre, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lorenzini, Oelke, Marck, &amp; Dall'agnol, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rubin, Giacomini, Allen, Turner, &amp; Kelly, 2020)</ref>. The emotional reaction of the employees towards the things determines the outcomes and same is the case with the safety culture. If the employees perceive the safety culture as a positive thing for themselves, they will surely be more engaged in these practices and will take care of the safety at the workplace. Thus, the following hypothesis has been generated from the literature studies:</p><p>H1: There is a significant relationship between the safety culture behavior aspects and the safety at work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The impact of safety culture psychological aspects on the safety at work</head><p>Along with the behavior of the employees towards the safety culture, their psychological aspects must also be considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ciaccio et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Corrigan, Kay, Ryan, Ward, &amp; Brazil, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lorenzini et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rubin et al., 2020)</ref>. The psychological dimensions have a most significant impact on the safety practice at work and that is why it has always been the most frequently examined thing in the workplace safety studies. This shows the perception of people towards the safety practices and therefore <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abniki et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bernal et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lanzotti et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Williams &amp; Cendón, 2019)</ref>, the efficient management of the safety standards. Thus, the following hypothesis has been generated from the literature studies:</p><p>H2: There is a significant relationship between the safety culture psychological aspects and the safety at work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">The impact of use of mobile technology on the safety at work</head><p>The use of mobile technology has been in cased in the last few years and this is because of the wide applications available to ease the work. Literature studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bustillo &amp; Mateo, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dimond et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">El-Sherif &amp; Lahera, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Horton et al., 2018)</ref> shows that the wide implementation of the mobile technology at the workplace has resulted in improvements in the safety at work. As it make it accessible for the employees to learn about the safety practices and also makes it easy for the management team to reach out every employee <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hejduk &amp; Karwowski, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">C. Mather &amp; Cummings, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Otto et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rashid, 2017)</ref> and ensure that the employees work according to the standard safety practices by regularly providing them information regarding the safety practices. Thus, the following hypothesis has been generated from the literature studies:</p><p>H3: There is a significant relationship between the mobile technology and the safety at work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">The impact of the safety at work on the employee well-being</head><p>Employee well-being must be one of the top priorities of the organizations, as it effects the overall functioning of the organization and work performance of the employees. Literature studies(C. A. <ref type="bibr">Mather et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Reyes et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Trede et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Trede et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Vukicevic et al., 2019)</ref> have shown the positive and more constructive results from the use of safety practices at the work on the well-being of the employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bastan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Coetzee, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Sharman, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zhao et al., 2016)</ref>. It has also been observed that the organizations that increases the implementation of the safety culture causes the employees to feel safe at work and thus, increasing the employee well-being. Thus, the following hypothesis has been generated from the literature studies:</p><p>H1: There is a significant relationship between the safety at work and the employee well-being.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">METHODOLOGY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Study Approach and Data Collection</head><p>It has been observed that in the past studies, the method that has been widely used for the purpose of finding out different aspects of ergonomics and safety in different organizations, the structural equation modelling has been used. Therefore, based on these observations, the researcher has also applied the structural equation modelling technique in order to find out the impact of certain variables on each other in the study. For this purpose, a questionnaire has been developed by the researcher, which will be measured on the basis of five point Likert scale starting from 1(strongly disagree) to 5(strongly agree). The questionnaire was developed carefully in a well sequenced way. The language and the content used in the questionnaire were according to the knowledge and information of the sample selected by the author. The questionnaire was distributed among the employees of different herbal companies of Thailand. These employees are selected based on their work in different sectors of the work such as some manufacturing work related to physical and cognitive factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Measurement</head><p>The variables that are under study in this research include behavior aspects of safety culture, psychological aspects of safety culture, use of mobile technology, safety at work and employee well-being. All these variables and their constructs have been measured by related items that have been developed and taken from the studies conducted in the past. The first one is employee well-being, which is the dependent variable and has been measured by different items, taken from the past studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Holman, 2004</ref>). In the similar way, "behavior aspects of safety culture" is an independent variable and it has been measured by eight measurement items that have been taken from the past study <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Mohamed, 2003)</ref>. One of these measurement items is "Sometimes I use machines, devices, or tools whose technical condition may endanger my personal safety". In the similar way, "psychological aspects of safety culture" is another independent variable, measured by six measurement items taken from the past studies and one of these items is "Employees with extensive experience do not have to comply with health and safety rules" <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Mohamed, 2003)</ref>. Use of mobile technology is the last independent variable of this study and measured by six items, developed by the past studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brown, 2002)</ref>. One of these items is "In the event of a breakdown or accident, I look for information about their causes on the Internet using my smart phone". In the last we have one mediating variable in the study too, named as safety at work. This variable construct has been measured by six items, taken from the studies conducted in the past in the similar context <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Neal &amp; Griffin, 2004</ref>). One of these items is "I always follow the procedures for dealing with machine breakdowns or safety hazards". In this way all the variables and their constructs are measured by using their particularly related items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Statistical Analysis</head><p>The researcher has effectively analyzed the data previously collected, by using the SPSS and AMOS for obtaining demographic analysis, descriptive analysis, factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and structure equation modelling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DATA ANALYSIS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Demographics</head><p>According to the demographics of the study, it has been evident that the data was collected from 450 employees of herbal companies. 248 of them were males and 202 were females in these respondents. Moreover, the respondents having age less than 25 years are 142, those having age from 25 to 35 years are 193, those having 35 to 45 years are 99 while those having age more than 45 years are just 16. The experience of these respondents in the firms has also been observed and it has been found out that most of the respondents are having the experience from 2 to 8 years in the firms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Descriptive Statistics</head><p>The results of descriptive statistics presented in the table 1 show that the skewness of the variables is between -1 and +1 which is considered to be the threshold range and also indicates the normality of data. On the other hand, the minimum and maximum values ranging from 1 to 5 shows that there are no out liars in the collected data and data is ready to move in further research process. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">KMO and Bartlett's Test</head><p>As it can be seen in the table that the value of KMO test is very close to 1.00, this is an important indication that the factor analysis of the variables is beneficial for the results and in the similar way, as the value of the other test i.e. Bartlett's test is less than 0.05, which is an indication that points towards the usefulness of factor analysis in the study. .000</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Rotated Component Matrix</head><p>As per the results of rotated component matrix, it can be evidently seen that all the values of loading for various indicators used by the researcher are greater than 0.7. This can be deducted from the results that the data is eligible for use in the current study and no cross loading in the indicators has been observed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Convergent and Discriminant Validity</head><p>According to the results of convergent and discriminant validity, it can be observed that CR value is greater than 70% while AVE values for all the variables is more than 50%. Moreover, it can also be observed that the loadings of the variables are not related to each other thus indicating that the data is valid to be used in the study.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hassan, Hameed, Basheer, &amp; Ali, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Iqbal &amp; Hameed, 2020)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7">Structural Equation Modeling</head><p>The results of the most important and concluding test i.e. SEM have been presented in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>.</p><p>In the table it can be seen that the impact of the independent variables i.e. safety culture psychological aspects and use of mobile technology on employee well being is significant. But the imapct of safety culture behvaioral aspects has not been found as significant. In the similar way, the mediating impact of safety at work is significant in all cases i.e. between the relationship between all independent and dependent variables.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Discussion</head><p>The basic objective of the study was to find out the impact of safety culture behavioral aspects, safety culture psychological aspects and use of mobile technology on employee well-being in the mediating role of safety at work. The first hypothesis that the impact of safety culture behavioral aspects on employee well-being is significant has been rejected, in accordance with the similar studies in the past (van Nunen, Li, Reniers, &amp; Ponnet, 2018). The next hypothesis that the impact of safety culture psychological aspects on employee well-being is significant has been accepted and this is in line with the results presented in the past studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Stemn, Bofinger, Cliff, &amp; Hassall, 2019)</ref>. The next hypothesis that the impact of use of mobile technology on employee wellbeing is significant has been accepted and this is in concordance with the past studies (do Carmo Alonso, Gallier, &amp; Mercado, 2018). The next hypothesis was that the mediating impact of safety at work between safety culture behavioral aspects and employee well-being is significant has been accepted, in accordance with the similar studies in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Antonsen, Nilsen, &amp; Almklov, 2017)</ref>. The next hypothesis was that the mediating impact of safety at work between safety culture psychological aspects and employee well-being is significant has been accepted, and such results have also been found in studies in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2018)</ref>. The last hypothesis was that there is significant mediating impact of safety at work between use of mobile technology and employee well-being has been accepted, in accordance with the similar studies in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Guest, 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Conclusion</head><p>Safety measures are very important for any organization so that the employees of the organization feel secured and contented with their jobs. The basic objective of the study was to find out the impact of safety culture behavioral aspects, safety culture psychological aspects and use of mobile technology on employee well-being in the mediating role of safety at work. The results shown that impact of all independent variables, except safety culture behavioral aspects, on employee well-being is significant. In the similar way, it has been found out that the mediating impact of safety at work has been significant between all the independent and dependent variables of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Implications</head><p>The current study may assist the other researchers get enough information about the safety aspects and other factors related to employee well-being in their studies. In addition, it may provide guidance to the different companies to implement safety culture so that the employee well-being can be ensured. In addition, the policy makers may also get assistance from this study while making policies and regulations in the similar context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Limitations and Future Research Indications</head><p>The sample size of the study was small and must be increased in the future studies. Moreover, other countries may also be considered other than Thailand while conducting studies of the similar context. Other variables may also be considered along with the variables of the current study so that more knowledge and information can be generated on the relevant topics.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FigureFigure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Wellbeing services offered by the employer.
