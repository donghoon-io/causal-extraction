<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose -Given the widespread popularity of social media such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, understanding consumer-brand engagement behavior within social media is fundamental for retail firms. Yet, little is known about how consumers engage with retail brands through social media. This study addresses this gap and extends previous research by examining factors that influence consumers' attitudes and intentions to engage with retail brands through Facebook, and ultimately purchase products and services. Design/methodology/approach -This study draws on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to develop a model of consumer-brand social media engagement and purchase intentions. Specifically, the model tests the influence of five antecedents of attitude on consumer intentions to engage with retail brands through the brands' Facebook pages as well as intentions to make purchases through this social media. The hypotheses of the model are tested using structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings -The findings provide an understanding of the main drivers of consumer-brand engagement that can lead to purchase intentions. Results show that consumers' attitudes toward engaging with retail brands through Facebook are influenced by peer communication, compatibility and credibility and that attitude has a strong influence on intentions towards this behavior. Furthermore, there is a strong relationship between intentions to engage and the likelihood of purchasing through a retail brand's Facebook page. Research limitations/implications -This study is cross-sectional and was conducted at a particular point in time. Thus, results are not purported to make any inferences to causal relationships. Further, the measures of intentions to engage are attitudinal and not objective measures. Future longitudinal studies may help avoid this limitations by testing causal relationships. Practical implications -The study contributes to the important area of consumer engagement with retail brands through social media in ways that may lead to making purchases. Findings can provide retailers with reference points through which to engage their brands with consumers through their Facebook pages in ways that may lead to more direct returns on their investment in social media sites. Originality/value -Retailers are noticing the power of social media sites as a platform for engaging with consumers and extending this relationship to purchases. However, scant research has addressed this topic. The proposed model and findings of this study can extend prior research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube) are revolutionizing how consumers interact with brands and companies <ref type="bibr">(Kao, Yang, Wu, &amp; Cheng, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kaplan &amp; Haenlein, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Okazaki &amp; Taylor, 2013)</ref>. Retail brands are using digital technology extensively to engage with consumers, and almost every brand has some form of presence on social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Tirico, 2016)</ref>. Although, retail brands may draw millions of consumers to their social media sites (e.g., Facebook), this does not imply that consumers will purchase their products. Thus, a social media strategy for retail brands needs to lead consumers to an increased and continuous desire for products and services which results in sales.</p><p>Statistics for the second quarter of 2017 show that globally, more than 3 billion people are monthly active social media account holders <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Statista, 2017)</ref>. In addition, consumer research suggest that shoppers are looking to social media for online purchases in addition to simply communicating with organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Haslehurst, Randall, Weber, &amp; Sullivan, 2016)</ref>. As consumers increase their participation in social media and more retail companies use social media as a strategic channel to communicate with consumers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Assimakopoulos, Antoniadis, Kayas, &amp; Dvizac, 2017)</ref>, a better understanding of consumer-brand engagement through these social media sites is needed (Hall-Phillips, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Park, Chung, Anaza, &amp; Rathod, 2016)</ref>. We draw on <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Lin et al (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Van Doorn et al. (2010)</ref> and define consumer engagement with retail brands as a behavioral manifestation of consumers' continuance intention to use social media to communicate or purchase products and services. However, little is known regarding the factors that drive consumers to engage with brands and purchase products and services through social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bianchi &amp; Andrews, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>While much research has focused on consumers' social media behaviour and how consumers engage and make purchases through Internet channels such as company websites (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Demangeot &amp; Broderick, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Gunawan &amp; Huarng, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Islam, Rahman, &amp; Hollebeek, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Lu, Fan, &amp; Zhou, 2016)</ref>, limited research has assessed what factors influence consumers to engage in social media to communicate with retail brands and purchase products and services through their social media sites. These sites are interactive platforms that enable firms and brands to connect with their consumers on a daily basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Lipsman, Mudd, Rich, &amp; Bruich, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Tafesse, 2016)</ref>. Many retail companies, therefore, seek strategies to increase this engagement through developing their own social media sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Schamari &amp; Schaefers, 2015)</ref>. Social media provide opportunities to retailers for consumer engagement and purchasing opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Assimakopoulos et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Constantinides, Romero, &amp; Gomez Boria, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dessart, Veloutsou, &amp; Morgan-Thomas, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Gummerus, Liljander, Wemen, &amp; Pihlström, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Engaging consumers is important for retail brands because consumers may feel a stronger connection to the brand and the company <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Calder, Malthouse, &amp; Schaedel, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chang &amp; Fan, 2017)</ref>, and are more likely to participate in brand communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Algesheimer, Dholakia, &amp; Herrmann, 2005)</ref>. Social media also allows consumers to engage, share and exchange information with other consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Sashi, 2012)</ref>, and share their experiences about firms and brands through word-of-mouth or reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chang &amp; Fan, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chen, Fay, &amp; Wang, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Trusov, Bodapati, &amp; Bucklin, 2010)</ref>. Furthermore, a large number of consumers engage with brand's social media pages to co-create (Tzu-Yi <ref type="bibr">Kao, Yang, Wu, &amp; Cheng, 2016)</ref>, and purchase products and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hajli, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Yadav, de Valck, Hennig-Thurau, Hoffman, &amp; Spann, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Several scholars have attempted to develop specific consumer-brand engagement models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">France, Merrilees, &amp; Miller, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hollebeek, 2011)</ref>. Furthermore, the literature has identified factors contributing to consumers' engagement in social media with brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chi, 2011)</ref>. Nevertheless, these studies are primarily concerned with consumers' responses to advertising on social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chi, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Kelly, Kerr, &amp; Drennan, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Zeng, Huang, &amp; Dou, 2009)</ref>. In addition, studies have examined how consumers' social media behavior drives their online and offline purchases in retail context (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Gunawan &amp; Huarng, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hajli, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Liang, Ho, Li, &amp; Turban, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Lu et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Zhou, Zhang, &amp; Zimmermann, 2013)</ref>. However, limited research has assessed what factors influence consumers to engage with retail brands through social media sites and ultimately purchase products or services through these digital media environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hollebeek, Glynn, &amp; Brodie, 2014)</ref>. Among all of the social media sites, Facebook is the largest, with 2 billion active users worldwide, representing almost 40% of the global online population <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Statista, 2017)</ref>. Facebook has become a widespread global phenomenon for supporting interpersonal communication, entertainment, news reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Gottfried &amp; Shearer, 2016)</ref> as well as a medium for social bonding among users <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Economist, 2016)</ref>. Increasingly, firms are attempting to embrace Facebook as a marketing channel to drive engagement and brand awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Malhotra, Malhotra, &amp; See, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In spite of the explosive popularity of Facebook, there is limited research that examines the drivers of consumer-brand engagement in this site.</p><p>Specifically, there are two gaps identified in the literature. First, there is a lack of consistent research regarding consumers' engagement with retail brands through Facebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Tsai &amp; Men, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Yadav et al., 2013)</ref>, and their potential impact on purchasing behavior. This focus is important since Facebook is one of the largest social media platforms globally <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kemp, 2015)</ref>, and has significant potential for consumer-brand engagement. Second, much of the research on social media consumer studies is limited to investigating cognitive variables (e.g., perceived usefulness) as drivers of intentions to engage in social media. There is scant research that considers affective variables (e.g., enjoyment) or social variables (peer communication). Thus, this study seeks to investigate the cognitive, affective and relational factors that might influence consumers' attitudes and intentions to engage with retail brands through their Facebook pages.</p><p>The study also examines the role of credibility on Facebook that may affect these intentions, and whether consumers intend to use a retail brand's Facebook page for purchasing products or services.</p><p>The study draws on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975)</ref>, and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) <ref type="bibr">(Davis, 1989)</ref>. Both have been found useful for investigating consumer behavior in digital environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andrews &amp; Bianchi, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Wirtz &amp; Göttel, 2016)</ref>, and social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Reiter, McHaney, &amp; Hiller, 2016)</ref>. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Reiter et al. (2016)</ref> concluded that the TAM constructs of ease of use and perceived usefulness had psychometric stability when applied to social media technology use. For this study, the authors test a conceptual model that proposes specific antecedents that may influence consumers' intentions to engage with retail brands through Facebook. Particularly, this study extends previous research by incorporating new antecedent variables related to affective influences through enjoyment and credibility, and the social influence of peer communication as predictors of attitudes and intentions for consumers engaging with retail brands through social media as well as purchasing products and services.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. First, the current literature on social media and consumer engagement is examined. Next, the methodology and conceptual framework is explained. The findings are reported and the paper concludes with a discussion of their implications and suggestions for future research.</p></div>

In addition, several studies have also looked at the utility of online consumer reviews on consumer decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Sen &amp; Lerman, 2007)</ref>, purchase intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kim &amp; Ko, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Wang, Yu, &amp; Wei, 2012)</ref> and sales. However, less is known regarding the factors that lead consumers to engage with retail brands through their social media sites.</p><p>Consumer-brand engagement has become an important concept for research in the marketing and retailing literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brodie, Hollebeek, Juric, &amp; Ilic, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">France et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Graffigna &amp; Gambetti, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hollebeek, 2011)</ref>. Consumer engagement with a brand is defined as "behaviors [that] go beyond transactions, and may be specifically defined as a consumer's behavioral manifestations that have a brand or firm focus, beyond purchase, resulting from motivational drivers" <ref type="bibr">(Van Doorn et al., 2010, p.254)</ref>. Consumer-brand engagement has also been defined as 'the level of a customer's cognitive, emotional and behavioral investment in specific brand interactions' <ref type="bibr">(Hollebeek, 2011, p.555)</ref>. These conceptualization suggests that consumer engagement with retail brands entails a behavioral manifestation interactive personal connection with a brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brodie et al., 2011)</ref>. Drawing on <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Van Doorn et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Lin et al. (2014)</ref>, we define consumer engagement with retail brands social media as behavioral manifestations that lead consumers to continue communication with retail firms and resulting in purchase intentions.</p><p>By engaging with retail brands through social media, consumers can add value to these brands by generating content, becoming advocates, or by influencing other customers' purchase behavior through electronic word-of-mouth <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bruhn et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Kozinets, de Valck, Wojnicki, &amp; Wilner, 2010)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Theoretical Background and Hypotheses</head><p>This study draws on an adaptation of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) model, and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) <ref type="bibr">(Davis, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975)</ref>. TRA suggests that an individual's behavior is motivated by his/her attitude towards carrying out that behavior, a function of their beliefs about performing that behavior and an evaluation of the value of each of those outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975)</ref>. Additionally, behavior is determined by an intention to perform such behavior, because people, in general, behave as they intend to do, within the available context and time. TAM was adapted from the TRA model to theorize people's usage behavior of computer technology <ref type="bibr">(Davis, 1989)</ref> and breaks down the TRA's attitude construct into two variables: perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (EU) to explain computer usage behavior.</p><p>Both models have found utility for investigating consumer behavior and retailing in digital environments, such as Internet shopping (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andrews &amp; Bianchi, 2013)</ref>, social media (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chiang, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gironda &amp; Korgaonkar, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Reiter et al., 2016</ref>) and e-tailing <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Liao, Wang, &amp; Yeh, 2014)</ref>. The use of TRA and TAM frameworks in this current study provides a number of theoretical advantages since they have been extensively tested and validated across different digital contexts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andrews &amp; Bianchi, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Reiter et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Wirtz &amp; Göttel, 2016)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Reiter et al. (2016)</ref> confirmed that the TAM model maintains psychometric stability when applied to social media technology use.</p><p>While TRA and TAM models account for social and usage factors, they do not take into account emotional and other psychosocial factors that may fully explain consumers' attitudes and behavioral intentions toward engaging with retail brands through social media. Thus, this study incorporates other factors such as enjoyment and credibility in social media to improve the model´s predictive power. Extrinsic motivation refers to committing an action because of its perceived helpfulness in achieving value, while intrinsic motivation refers to committing an action because of interest in the action itself, rather than external reinforcement <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Davis, Bagozzi, &amp; Warshaw, 1992)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Sicilia and Palazón (2008)</ref>, key motivating factors for consumers' online participation are functional, social or for entertainment, suggesting both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations.</p><p>This study combines, adapts and extends the TRA and TAM models by incorporating three new variables related to an intrinsic entertainment motivation (enjoyment), socialization motivation (peer communication), and trust (credibility) in social media (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The model does not include the variable ´perceived ease of use´ from the Tam model, which explains the user's perception of the amount of effort required to utilize the technology. The authors made the decision to exclude this variable from the model, because it is found to have low significance as a predictor of attitude in current studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andrews &amp; Bianchi, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Insert Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Intentions to engage with a brand through social media</head><p>Intention is a central factor in the model, since it is the immediate antecedent to an actual behavior. Thus, the stronger the intention to perform a behavior the greater the likelihood that a consumer will actually perform that behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. Intentions are a signal of how much effort people are planning to exert in performing a particular behavior in question <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ajzen, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Kim, Ferrin, &amp; Rao, 2008)</ref>. Continuous usage intention refers to the degree to which an individual is willing to continuously use a particular social media site <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chiang, 2013)</ref>. For this study, intention is viewed as a consumers' indication that he or she will continue to engage with retail brands through their Facebook pages. Consumer engagement with a retail brand through social media may motivate positive reactions and behaviors that go beyond transactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Van Doorn et al., 2010)</ref>, as well as consumers' cognitive, emotional and behavioral investment in specific brand interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hollebeek, 2011)</ref>, such that consumers are more interested in and more likely to purchase a product from that brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kim &amp; Ko, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Wang et al., 2012)</ref>. Thus, the following hypothesis is stated:</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Consumers' intention to engage with retail brands through social media is positively related to consumers' intentions to purchase through social media.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Attitudes towards engaging with retail brands through social media</head><p>Drawing on TRA, attitude is the extent to which an individual makes a positive or negative evaluation about performing a behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975)</ref>. Attitude is considered a function of salient beliefs, which may be formed by observation, secondary information, or by an inferential process. Based on these beliefs, people form favorable or unfavorable attitudes toward the consequences of a behavior. For this study, Attitude is the extent to which an individual makes a positive or negative evaluation about engaging with retail brands through social media. Attitudes affect the intentions to perform a behavior, thus a positive relationship between attitude and intentions to engage with retail brands through social media is foreseeable. Extant studies also suggest that attitude is an important predictor of intentions to use social media (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Gironda &amp; Korgaonkar, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Liao et al., 2014)</ref>. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>Hypothesis 2: Attitude is positively related to consumers' intentions to engage with retail brands through social media.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Perceived Usefulness</head><p>According to the TAM model, perceived usefulness (PU) is an important factor that determines an individual's intention to use a technology <ref type="bibr">(Davis, 1989)</ref>. The model demonstrates that perceptions of the usefulness of a technology has a significant impact on its use <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, &amp; Davis, 2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Davis (1989, p. 320</ref>) defined perceived usefulness as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance". Perceived usefulness in this study relates to the extent to which consumers believe that using social media will help them perform better. Consumers use social media either to find user generated product information to support their purchase decisions, or to generate and share useful information based on their perceptions that it is useful <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Morrison, Cheong, &amp; McMillan, 2013)</ref>. Research findings support the notion that an individual's perception of the usefulness of the interactions with a brand through social media has a positive influence on their attitude and intentions regarding that behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Flavian, Guinaliu, &amp; Gurrea, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Hernández, Jimenez, &amp; Martin, 2010)</ref>. This study proposes that perceived usefulness has a positive effect on consumer attitudes towards engaging with retail brands through social media. Thus the following hypothesis is stated: Hypothesis 3: Perceived usefulness is positively related with consumers' attitude towards engaging with retail brands through social media.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Compatibility</head><p>Compatibility is the extent to which using social media to engage with retail brands is perceived by consumers as being consistent with existing values, past experiences and social media patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Rogers, 2003)</ref>. Compatibility has been shown to be an important precursor to attitude formation, in that if an individual perceives that there is a strong fit between an innovation and their needs, the individual will demonstrate a more positive attitude towards that innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Shih &amp; Fang, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Taylor &amp; Todd, 1995)</ref>. However, if an individual views social media as being incompatible with such needs, then he/she will most likely have a negative attitude towards using social media and not engage in the behavior. Compatibility is often the most important factors identified in the literature for online behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Andrews, Kiel, Drennan, Boyle, &amp; Werawardeena, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Forsythe, Liu, Shannon, &amp; Gardner, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rohm &amp; Swaminathan, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Wang, Gu, &amp; Aiken, 2010)</ref>.

A review of prior research shows that a lack of credibility is a major barrier for consumers wanting to use e-commerce sites (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Grabner-Krautera &amp; Kaluscha, 2003)</ref>. Credibility influences consumers' intentions to engage in online experiences and lack of credibility are primary reasons why consumers abstain from interacting with brands online <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Eastlick, Lotz, &amp; Warrington, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Gefen, Karahanna, &amp; Straub, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Pavlou &amp; Fygenson, 2006)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Peer Communication</head><p>The marketing literature indicates that peers are the primary socialization agents for individuals, beyond family members (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Moschis &amp; Churchill, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Zhang &amp; Daugherty, 2009)</ref>.

Thus, these studies suggest that individuals' intentions to use social media sites intensifies when the user perceives that many friends are using social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baker &amp; White, 2010)</ref>. Specifically, Facebook, by its very nature of being a social media site, is built on peer influence and communication through activities such as posting, commenting, sharing or liking.</p><p>Previous research has shown that peer communication has a strong impact on attitudes toward shopping orientations <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Lueg, Ponder, Beatty, &amp; Capella, 2006)</ref>, consumer decisionmaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Smith, Menon, &amp; Sivakumar, 2005)</ref>, and can influence marketing strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Vinerean, Cetina, Dumitrescu, &amp; Tichindelean, 2013)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Research Methodology</head><p>The hypotheses of the model are tested through an online survey administered to consumers between September and October 2014. The population of the study comprised Facebook users in Chile who have previously followed a retail brand's Facebook page at least once. It was decided that Facebook would be the most appropriate social media platform for the study for three reasons: statistics show that globally it is one of the most popular and has high take-up around the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kemp, 2015)</ref>; Chile has the highest e-Commerce uptake per capita in the Latin American region <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Euromonitor, 2015)</ref> and is the third largest market in the world for Facebook.com in terms of percentage reach of visitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Statista, 2017)</ref>. In addition, Facebook has is actively encouraging consumers to shop via Facebook brand pages through the recent introduction of a range of new ad features <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Vizard, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The questionnaire was developed initially in English, and one of the research team members, who is a native speaker, translated the survey into Spanish. The questionnaire was back translated to English by a native Chilean scholar <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brislin, 1970)</ref>. The survey was pre-tested with a convenience sample of 5 Chilean consumers, which resulted in minor changes in wording to some questions to improve meaning. After pre-testing the online survey, it was sent to a sample of 2,000 potential participants from a database of retail shoppers in Santiago, Chile.</p><p>Participants received an email presenting the research team, the objectives of the study and the survey link. At the end of 2 months, 186 completed surveys were received, and after eliminating 8 cases with extensive missing data, the researchers retained 178 cases to test the proposed model. The sample is composed of 45.5% women and 54.5% men, and 100% have engaged with social media. The average age of the sample was between 36-45 years old (range 18 to 70 years).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the demographic characteristics of respondents.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Measurement</head><p>The survey started with an initial section that asked questions regarding social media usage and the main activities they undertook in Facebook regarding brands. The following section provided the items measuring the variables shown in the model. The questionnaire used extant measures available from the literature. All of the measures used in this study were adopted or adapted from prior studies and measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> presents the sources and the number of items measuring the constructs in the proposed model. The dependent variable, intention to purchase through social media was measured with a 3-item scale adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Lin, Fan and Chau (2014)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Descriptive statistics</head><p>The descriptive statistics offer a general picture of the sample's social media behavior (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). While these characteristics do not allow for generalization of the data to the wider population, the purpose is to achieve a sample of participants that use social media and to examine their attitudes and intentions towards engaging with retail brands through social media.</p><p>In terms of social media usage, 100% had used Facebook at least once, 97% of the respondents had used Facebook for more than one year, and 76% had used Facebook for more than three years. Approximately 97.2% of the sample spent at least one hour per day on Facebook, and the average was approximately 9.8 hours per week spent on Facebook. All respondents had visited and liked a retail brand Facebook page at least once.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3 here&gt;&gt;</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Measurement analysis</head><p>SPSS was used for the measurement purification process for item-to-total correlations, standardized Cronbach Alpha, and the exploratory factor analysis (EFA). AMOS 16 was used for the single measurement models and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The scale reliability test of the measures revealed that one item of the perceived usefulness scale had very low inter-item correlation with other items in the scales. Therefore, this item was deleted from the measurement before conducting confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the Cronbach Alphas, means and standard deviations for the construct measures. To reduce the common method bias, the questionnaire also contained both positive and negatively worded items <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Podsakoff &amp; Organ, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to examine measurement properties.</p><p>The fit indices showed that model resulted in a good fit to the data as follows: χ2 = 396.26, df = 271, The Tucker-Lewis coefficient (TLI) = 0.95, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.96, Incremental fit index (IFI) = 0.96, root mean square residual (RMSR) = 0.051. All items loaded significantly on the expected constructs indicating convergent validity of the measures.</p><p>To reduce the common method bias variance, the questionnaire initially mixed positive and negatively worded items. Further, to satisfy the statistical contention of common method bias variance, negatively worded items were re-coded to make all the constructs symmetric.</p><p>Using <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Podsakoff and Organ's (1986)</ref> procedure, all constructs underwent factor analysis. This procedure illustrates that no single factor or any general factor accounted for most of the variance in the independent and dependent variables, suggesting there is no common method bias variance issues in the data.</p><p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) in AMOS 16 was used to test the proposed model and the hypothesized paths. The SEM analysis shows a good model fit (χ 2 /df=1.47, IFI=.959, TLI=.953, CFI=.959, and RMSEA=.052). Tests were conducted for the reliability and validity of the construct measures using alpha reliability, AVE, correlations, and CFA analyses. The AVE scores were compared with the shared variance of each construct and with all other constructs to assess discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Farrell, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gaski, 1984)</ref>. Discriminant validity was assessed using χ2 difference tests by setting the relationship between two constructs at 1.0. All test results indicate adequate discriminant validity. Further, this analysis shows that most AVEs of the constructs in the model are higher than the shared variance of the construct with all other constructs in the model, confirming discriminant validity for all of the variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Hypotheses Testing</head><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, results indicate that intentions to engage with retail brands through social media is positively related to purchase intentions (β=.63, p=.000).

Regarding H3, results indicate that perceived usefulness is not significantly related to attitudes <ref type="bibr">(β=.20, p=.21)</ref>. Thus, H3 is not supported.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion and Conclusions</head><p>As argued from the literature, limited consideration has been paid to drivers of consumer engagement with retail brands through social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chu &amp; Kim, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Hall-Phillips et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hollebeek, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Lipsman et al., 2012)</ref>. To address this limitation, the study investigated five antecedents that drive consumers' intentions to engage with retail brands through the brands' Facebook pages, including affective and relational variables, as well as credibility, that may influence these intentions. The model also tested consumers' potential intentions to purchase products and services through the Facebook pages of retail brands. The findings provide interesting insights into consumer behavior in relation to drivers of social media and retail brand engagement behavior, which is emerging as a very important topic in the marketing and retailing literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Gummerus et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Tafesse, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Van Doorn et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The findings confirm three significant antecedent variables of attitude which are indirectly linked with consumers' engagement intentions with retail brands: compatibility, credibility and peer communication. The results show that peer communication is the strongest positive antecedent of attitude. This suggests that consumers´ intention to engage with retail brands through social media intensifies when he/she perceives that many friends are using social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baker &amp; White, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Kwon &amp; Wen, 2010)</ref>. These results support previous research that finds that peer communication leads consumers to engage in communications activities with others through social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Park et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Zhang &amp; Daugherty, 2009)</ref>. The findings also support previous studies which show social media to have an impact on consumer attitudes towards products, services, and decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Lueg et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Vinerean et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that shows a positive relationship between social media and consumer attitudes and intentions to engage with retail brands through social media.</p><p>The findings also show that compatibility is an important positive predictor of attitude. This means that consumers´ attitude towards engaging with retail brands through social media is perceived as being consistent with his/her social media lifestyle patterns and needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Rogers, 2003)</ref>. Consistent with previous research, compatibility has been shown to be an important precursor to attitude formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Shih &amp; Fang, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Taylor &amp; Todd, 1995)</ref>, and one of the most important factors for online behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Andrews et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Forsythe et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rohm &amp; Swaminathan, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Wang et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Further, credibility in social media (Facebook) was found to be positively linked with attitude towards engaging with retail brands through their Facebook pages. This finding supports previous research that links social media credibility with consumer interactions with brands through social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Eastlick et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Gefen et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Pavlou &amp; Fygenson, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>However, this variable is the weakest antecedent of the three significant variables influencing attitude in the model. Consumers in Chile may find the Facebook pages of retail brands generally trustworthy, but not necessarily they want to engage with these brands through Facebook.</p><p>According to the study's findings, perceived usefulness and enjoyment are not related to attitude. The insignificant effect of perceived usefulness on attitude does not support this underlying proposition in TAM. Consistent with some previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>, the finding suggests that the perception of usefulness of a brand´s social media site does not have a significant impact on attitude towards engaging with retail brands through social media. This unanticipated finding implies that on the one hand, although retail brands´ Facebook pages might be perceived by Chilean consumers as helping them to accomplish tasks and transactions more quickly, this does not necessarily imply a positive attitude towards engaging with retail brands through social media. On the other hand, consumers might not perceive the usefulness of brands´ Facebook pages owing to their extensive use of social media on a daily basis.</p><p>Similarly, enjoyment was not supported as an antecedent of attitude, which contradicts some TAM-based studies that link enjoyment to attitude towards using technology and social media <ref type="bibr">(Kang, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lin &amp; Lu, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Sledgianowski &amp; Kulviwat, 2009)</ref>. This finding suggests that enjoyment may be important for attitudes towards using social media but may not be a sufficient condition for generating positive attitudes towards engaging with retail brands through social media. Thus, consumers may engage with retail brands through social media for social or transactional purposes rather than for enjoyment.</p><p>Overall, the study's findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge on consumer engagement in social media platforms and provide theoretical and managerial implications that may help future scholars and practitioners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Theoretical Contribution</head><p>The findings if the study make three contributions to the literature. First this study draws on the TRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975)</ref> and TAM <ref type="bibr">(Davis, 1989)</ref> frameworks to determine their applicability for understanding consumer behavior in the digital space <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andrews &amp; Bianchi, 2013)</ref>. Thus, this study further supports the attitude-intention relationship in the context of consumer-brand engagement and social media. Although consumer engagement with social media has been previously analyzed by several authors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Tafesse, 2016)</ref>, scant research has examined consumer engagement with retail brands through social media sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Gummerus et al., 2012)</ref>. The present study addresses this gap in the literature by shedding light on the impact of antecedents of consumer engagement with brands´ Facebook pages, and possible influence on purchase intentions.</p><p>Second, the current study tests a conceptual model that proposes specific antecedents that may influence consumers' intentions to engage with retail brands through social media and purchase products and services. Specifically, this study extends previous research on this topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Gummerus et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Tafesse, 2016)</ref> by incorporating new variables related to affective (enjoyment), trust (credibility) and social (peer communication) factors predicting attitudes and intentions for engaging with retail brands through social media. Findings reveal that those consumers that have a more positive attitude towards engaging with retail brands through social media, will tend to be more engaged with retail brands' Facebook pages, and will be more likely to purchase products or services through this channel.</p><p>Third, the study extends the literature by providing information related to consumerbrand engagement behavior through social media platforms. Previous research has focused mostly on the general social media engagement behavior of consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Tafesse, 2016)</ref>. By shifting the focus to the consumer-retail brand dyad, the present study was able to shed light on the role of social media in driving consumer-brand engagement for retailers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Managerial Contribution</head><p>Retailers around the world are very much aware of the social media revolution and the imperative of providing digital communication channels for consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dahlström &amp; Edelman, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Okazaki &amp; Taylor, 2013)</ref>. Social media networks have become a major part of human communication and interaction and influence how people behave and communicate with brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cheung &amp; Lee, 2010)</ref>. Our findings have several implications to help retail managers understand consumer engagement behavior with retail brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Van Doorn et al., 2010)</ref>. Retail managers are trying to find ways to encourage current and prospective consumers to join their social media pages in order to better communicate with them with a view to fostering ongoing consumer-brand relationships. Therefore, understanding which factors are more likely to enhance consumer engagement with retail brands through social media provides marketers with insights to improve the way they develop and operate their social media communication strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Gironda &amp; Korgaonkar, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Although it has been widely speculated that consumers are active participants in social media sites, the findings of this study show a moderate level of consumer-retail brand engagement through the brands' Facebook pages. This suggests that retail managers must not take for granted that consumers will actively follow a retail brand Facebook page, or purchase products or services through this channel. To deepen consumer-brand engagement levels through Facebook, (or other social media), retail firms must develop specific engagement strategies.</p><p>These strategies must highlight the credibility of the retailer's social media sites and focus on emphasizing compatibility with existing values as well as consumers' social media patterns.</p><p>These strategies should also encourage peer communication, since it is found to improve consumers' attitudes linked with consumer-brand engagement through social media. For retailing managers this means they need to pay attention to enhancing credibility of information on the social media site, while also providing opportunities for peer communication such as posting of consumer generated content (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Smith, Fischer, &amp; Chen, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Tsai &amp; Men, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Particularly, peer communication was found to be the main driver of positive attitudes towards engaging with retail brands' Facebook pages. This suggests that visiting a retail brand´s Facebook page to see whether the products or brand is well liked by others, or seeking opinions and advice from other users, leads consumers to have a more positive attitude and purchase intention through retail brands' Facebook pages. Thus, retail marketing managers should focus on offering social benefits to their users and consumer promotion campaigns should encourage consumers to share posts and information related to the retail brands´ products and services among peers and friends. By emphasizing social benefits, consumers can be attracted to visit a site more often, thereby also increasing their likelihood of reading up on new products and other company information, as well as engaging in other activities. Social benefits can be developed by providing more opportunities for member-to-member interactions.</p><p>Managers should also note that the lack of importance of perceived usefulness or enjoyment as predictors of positive attitudes. The former finding indicates that using Facebook to attract new consumers through emphasizing efficiency benefits may not be particularly productive overall for retail brands. The latter finding also indicates that retail marketers need to be more circumspect in what content or activities they provide to create enjoyment for their consumers as it may not be the best investment. Therefore, ensuring long term consumer engagement and purchase behavior requires strategies that emphasize and protect the security or credibility of the site, provide appropriate content and possibilities for socialization within the brand's Facebook page.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Limitations and Future Research</head><p>The study has several limitations that can be addressed in future research. First, the sample involved more highly educated consumers as the database considered only online shoppers. However, in emerging markets, such as Chile, more educated demographic segments are more likely to have access to digital technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bianchi and Andrews, 2015)</ref>. As a result they can provide more relevant information for the research, thus overcoming some of the challenges in collecting reliable data in these markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Fastoso &amp; Whitelock, 2011)</ref>. Researchers can conduct a similar study using samples drawn from more representative populations, where available, to further determine consumers' behavior with the retail brands' social media channels. Second, this study focused on only on one social media site: Facebook. Although Facebook is the leading social media site in the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Statista, 2017)</ref>, future studies should consider other social media sites where retail firms and brands also have presence, such as Google, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram, to gain a broader understanding of consumer-brand engagement through social media. Third, the fact that the conceptual model does not include the TAM variable `ease of use` might affect the generalization of the results to a different socioeconomic stratum other than the one used here in this study.</p><p>Finally, the study is a snapshot of consumers' attitudes and intentions at a particular point in time. Because the current study used a cross-sectional survey method, the findings pertaining to the relationship between consumer intentions to engage with retail brands through social media and its antecedents should be interpreted with caution. In other words, another limitation is that results are not purported to make any inferences to causal relationships.</p><p>Future studies may want to examine whether there is a relationship between personal characteristics of consumers and their attitude or intentions to engage with retail brands through social media and explore the extent to which demographic characteristics or other personal factors may act as moderators for explaining consumers-brand engagement behavior. Second, it would also be interesting to see whether the nature of the product/service has a differential effect on consumers' engagement behavior to determine optimal investment in social media. Third, the study can be replicated in a developed country with a large consumer take-up of Facebook for comparisons between developed and emerging markets. Fourth, future studies could consider and other possible outcomes, such as loyalty and positive word-of-mouth behaviors.     </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>(2003), and measured with a 4-item scale.
