<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The new economic reform in Vietnam has dramatically changed the retailing industry in the country, leading to the emergence of several supermarkets, local as well as international, in recent years. Supermarkets currently account for just 10 percent of the US$ 20 billion sales of the retail industry, however, they are growing rapidly, attracting shoppers away from traditional outdoor markets <ref type="bibr">(Vietnam Investment Review, 2004</ref>). This trend is in line with the support from the Vietnamese government who is keen to develop modern retailing networks throughout the country. Currently, there are about 160 supermarkets and 32 shopping centres, which are mostly located around heavily populated areas, such as Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, where the relatively affluent consumers with increasing purchasing power for goods <ref type="bibr">(Vietnam Investment Review, 2004)</ref>. A recent survey shows that up to 85 percent of urban dwellers in the South of Vietnam are fond of shopping at supermarkets because they believe that supermarkets offer them a convenient shopping environment as well as high quality products <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Thanh Nien, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>With a population of 80 million and an economic growth rate of about seven percent annually, Vietnam is considered as a promising retail market, resulting in the presence of several supermarkets, local as well as international, such as Coopmart, Maximark, Citimart, Metro, Big C, and Seiyu. This has made the market severely competitive, and many supermarkets have launched several marketing programs to attract new customers and to maintain existing customers. In addition, Vietnamese consumers are becoming more sophisticated in recent years, particularly in urban areas of the country. They are not only concerned with the quality and price of products but also the quality of supermarkets. They often visit several retail outlets before making purchase decisions. A recent survey conducted by Saigon Tiepthi reveals that shoppers, especially the young ones are not loyal to any specific supermarkets <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Saigon Tiepthi 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, a thorough understanding of the determinants of shopper loyalty would be beneficial to supermarket managers in the market.</p><p>Several researchers have focused their interest on the determinants of store loyalty such as store atmosphere, store images, store satisfaction, service quality, perceived value, and attitudes toward a store (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bloemer and Odekerken-Schroder, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Koo, 2003)</ref>. They discover that people go shopping for both hedonic and utilitarian outcomes. Hedonic shopping motivations are primarily based on the quality of shopping experience rather than information gathering or product purchasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Boedeker, 1995)</ref>. Consumers also view a store as a place not only for shopping but also for other activities such as socializing with friends or browsing without buying products <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bloch, Ridgway, and Dawson, 1994)</ref>. The multiple motives in a single shopping trip indicate the entertaining capabilities of shopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ibrahim and Ng, 2002)</ref>. Therefore, the entertainment aspect of retailing is viewed as a key competitive tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arnold and Reynolds, 2003)</ref>, and retailers have shifted their focus on improving the entertainment dimension of their outlets. Despite this trend, little attention has paid to the hedonic shopping motivations of consumers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arnold and Reynolds, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jin and Kim, 2003)</ref>. In addition, research on shopping motives and their relationships with retail outcome is mostly undertaken in the USA or European countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Jin and Kim, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Li et al., 2004)</ref>. Little attention has been paid to transitional markets like Vietnam, where supermarkets are still a new retailing system, appealing primarily to the upper class of people in urban areas of the country. Compared to traditional outdoor markets, supermarkets provide shoppers with a wide range of goods, from food to consumer durables. More importantly, shoppers can search for trends and fashions in the markets.</p><p>Supermarkets also offer shoppers several other entertainment services such as coffee shops, restaurants, and games for children <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Nguyen and Nguyen, 2003)</ref>. However, the shopping motivations of Vietnamese customers, particularly the hedonic shopping aspect, are largely unexplored <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(McDonald, Darbyshire, and Jevons, 2000)</ref>, although a shopping pattern of Vietnamese is "to shop often, to buy little" <ref type="bibr">(McDonald, Darbyshire, and Jervons, 2000)</ref>. This study attempts to bridge this gap by examining the impacts of hedonic shopping motivations and supermarket attributes on supermarket loyalty of Vietnamese shoppers. The paper is organised around four key points: literature review and hypotheses; method; results; and, discussion and conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature review and hypotheses</head><p>We suggest that hedonic shopping motivations and supermarket attributes play important roles in shopper loyalty. Also, supermarket attributes underlie hedonic shopping motivations. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> presents these relationships and hypotheses graphically. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shopper loyalty</head><p>It has been widely agreed that loyalty is an "essential asset" in service industries (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Keaveney, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bloemer and Ruyter, 1998)</ref>. Three different perspectives, i.e., attitudinal, behavioral, and reasoned action, have been found in the literature <ref type="bibr">(Gounaris and Stathakopoulous, 2004)</ref>. The attitudinal approach conceives loyalty based on psychological commitment, purchase intention, and word-of-mouth recommendations. It is expected that an increase in attitudinal loyalty should lead to an increase in behavioral loyalty <ref type="bibr">(Gounaris and Stathakopoulous, 2004)</ref>. The behavioral approach conceptualizes loyalty in terms of repeated purchases (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Huddleston, Whipple, and van Auken, 2004)</ref>. Finally, the reasoned action approach derived from the theory of reasoned action <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fishbein, 1980)</ref>. According to this view, one may have a favorable attitude towards a brand but does not purchase it because of not being able to afford it, i.e., loyalty is based merely on brand belief, not on brand experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Oliver, 1999)</ref>. Although such an individual never purchases the brand, s/he promotes it in the public and recommends it to others <ref type="bibr">(Gounaris and Stathakopoulous, 2004)</ref>. In this study, shopper loyalty refers to the willingness of shoppers to repeat their shopping trips in the same supermarket and to recommend it to others (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baker et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sirohi, McLaughlin, and Wittink, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zeithaml, Berry, and Parasuraman, 1996)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hedonic shopping motivations</head><p>Several studies have attempted to identify shoppers' underlying motives and the relationship between these motives with shoppers' behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jin and Kim, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tauber, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Westbrook and Black, 1985)</ref>. Shopping motivations can be defined as "the drivers of behavior that bring consumers to the marketplace to satisfy their internal needs" <ref type="bibr">(Jin and Kim, 2003, p. 399)</ref>. Based on the premise that people go shopping motivated by a variety of psychological needs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tauber (1972)</ref> develops a number of shopping motivations. These motivations can be categorized into personal (i.e., role playing, diversion, self-gratification, learning about new trends, physical activity, and sensory stimulation), and social (i.e., social experiences outside the home, communication with others having similar interest, peer group attractions, status and authority, and pleasure of bargaining). <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Westbrook and Black (1985)</ref> note that shopping behavior evolves from three reasons: to acquire a product; to acquire both a desired product and satisfaction with non-product related needs; and, to primarily attain goals not related to product acquisition. They propose seven dimensions of shopping motivations: anticipated utility; role enactment; negotiation; choice optimization; affiliation; power/authority; and, stimulation.</p><p>Generally, shopping motivations have been categorized into two key aspects: utilitarian and hedonic. The utilitarian shopping behavior is characterized by task-related, product-oriented, rational, and extrinsic motivations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Babin, Darden, and Griffin, 1994)</ref>. The hedonic shopping behavior refers to recreational, pleasurable, intrinsic, and stimulation-oriented motivations. This study focuses on the hedonic aspect of shopping motives by examining various hedonic reasons that people go shopping. Hedonic shopping motivations can be conceptualized to have six dimensions, i.e., adventure, social, gratification, idea, role, and value <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arnold and Reynolds, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Adventure shopping, grounded in stimulation and expressive theories of human motivation, refers to "shopping for stimulation, adventure, and the feeling of being in another world" <ref type="bibr">(Arnold and Reynolds, 2003, p. 80)</ref>. The adventure aspect of shopping can provide hedonic value for shoppers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Babin, Darden, and Griffin, 1994)</ref>. Social shopping, grounded in affiliation theories of human motivation, reflects socializing aims of shoppers while shopping <ref type="bibr">(Reynolds and Beaty, 1999)</ref>. Gratification shopping, grounded in tension-reduction theories of human motivation, involves shopping for relieving stress <ref type="bibr">(Lee, Moschis, and Marthur, 2001)</ref>. Idea shopping, grounded in categorization theories and objectification theories, refers to shopping with the purpose of learning about new trends and fashion, styling, or innovations <ref type="bibr">(Arnould and Reynolds, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tauber, 1972)</ref>. Role shopping, grounded from identification theories of human motivations, reflects the enjoyment that shoppers derive from shopping for others <ref type="bibr">(Arnould and Reynolds, 2003)</ref>. Finally, value shopping, grounded in assertion theories of human motivation, reflects the enjoyment of shoppers in bargaining, looking for sales, and finding discounts <ref type="bibr">(Arnould and Reynolds, 2003)</ref>. These components of hedonic shopping motivations are conceptually related but distinct concepts (Arnould and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Reynolds, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Westbrook and Black, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>Research has suggested that shopping motivations bring the shoppers to the marketplace and shopping motivations have direct links with outcomes such as shopper satisfaction and loyalty (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Babin, Darden, and Griffin, 1994)</ref>. Shoppers who are strongly motivated by hedonic aspects are more likely to be satisfied with a supermarket that is able to provide them the hedonic value of their shopping trips. Therefore, they are more likely to be loyal to the supermarket <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dawson, Bloch, and Ridgway, 1990)</ref>. Such customers in transitional markets like Vietnam, who have been experienced with traditional outdoor markets, will find supermarkets to be convenient, modern, and attractive places for shopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Thanh Nien, 2004)</ref>. Therefore, it is expected that shoppers with a greater level hedonic shopping motivations may be more loyal to supermarkets. H1: There is a positive relationship between hedonic shopping motivations and shopper loyalty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supermarket attributes</head><p>Store attributes has been viewed as a part of the overall image of a store <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bloemer and Ruyter, 1998)</ref>. Store attributes can be defined as the "summation of all attributes of a store as perceived by the shoppers through their experience of that store" <ref type="bibr">(Omar, 1999, p. 103)</ref>. There are a number of conceptualizations of store attributes. For example, <ref type="bibr">Lindquist (1974</ref><ref type="bibr">Lindquist ( -1975) )</ref> suggests nine key attributes: merchandise; services; clientele; physical facilities; convenience; promotion; store ambience; institutional factors; and, post transaction satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ghosh (1990)</ref> introduces eight elements: locations; merchandise; store atmosphere; customer services; price; advertising; personal selling; and, sales incentive programs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Koo (2003)</ref> proposes seven components: store atmosphere; location; convenient facilities; value; employee services; after sale services; and, merchandising. The results of a recent study of supermarkets in Vietnam indicate that supermarket atmosphere, locations, and convenient facilities were conceptually distinct but empirically unidimensional <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Nguyen and Nguyen, 2003)</ref>. Therefore, we propose four components of supermarket attributes: facilities; employee services; after sale services; and, merchandise. Facilities comprise the physical facilities available in a supermarket such as architecture, layout, and display <ref type="bibr">(Lindquist, 1974</ref><ref type="bibr">(Lindquist, -1975))</ref>. This category also includes convenience, such as locational convenience and parking. Employee services refer to the quality of services provided by a supermarket's employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Koo, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lindquist, 1974</ref><ref type="bibr">Lindquist, -1975))</ref>. After sale services involve good exchange and refund policies, and merchandise refers to product and brand variety and availability <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Koo, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>A number of studies have found a direct relationship between store attributes and store loyalty (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Koo, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Sirgy, Grewal, and Mangleburg, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wakefield and Baker, 1998)</ref>. In addition, shoppers driven by hedonic shopping motivations tend to pay more attention to store attributes <ref type="bibr">(Dawson, Bloch, and Ridway, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arnold and Reynolds, 2003)</ref>. Therefore, supermarkets with higher quality of attributes will more likely stimulate the hedonic aspect of shoppers. Therefore, it is expected that supermarket attributes underlie the hedonic motivations of supermarket shoppers. This leads to: H2: There is a positive relationship between supermarket attributes and shopper loyalty.</p><p>H3: There is a positive relationship between supermarket attributes and hedonic shopping motivations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderating effects of customer demographics</head><p>Several researchers have posited that demographic characteristics of customers will affect their purchasing behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Raju, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wood, 1998)</ref>, although the relationship is not so clear, i.e., research findings are still in controversy (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Jin and Kim, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mai and Zhao, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mitchell and Walsh, 2004)</ref>. With an aim of verifying the moderating role of customer demographics in a transitional market, we examine the difference between some key demographic variables: gender; age; and, income levels of consumers. Thus, we propose: H4: The impacts of supermarket attributes on hedonic shopping motivations and supermarket loyalty will be affected by customers' gender, age, and income levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H5: The impacts of hedonic shopping motivations on supermarket loyalty will be affected by customers' gender, age, and income levels.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>A sample of 608 in-service training students of three universities -University of Economics, HCM City, Vietnam National University -HCM City, and HCM City Open University -in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, was surveyed to test the measurement and theoretical models. Inservice training students were used as study subjects because research has shown that they can be used as a surrogate for consumers <ref type="bibr">(James and Sonners, 2001)</ref>. In addition, they represent a wide range of socioeconomic and age groups. There were four supermarkets under investigation: Coopmart; Maximark; Big C; and, Citimart. All of them were located in Ho Chi Minh City, the major business centre of Vietnam. The sample included 385 (63.3%) female and 223 (36.7%) male shoppers. In terms of age, there were 478 (78.6%) shoppers aged from 20 to 30 years, and 130 (21.4%) shoppers with more than 30 years of age. Finally, there were 444 (73%) shoppers who had a monthly income of $US 300 or less, and 164 (27%) shoppers had a monthly income more than US$ 300.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement</head><p>Supermarket attributes (SMA) comprised four components: facilities (FAC); employee services (EMS); after sale services (AFS); and, merchandise (MER). The items used to measure the SMA components were based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Koo (2003)</ref>. Hedonic shopping motivations (HSM) consisted of six components: adventure shopping (ADV); gratification shopping (GRA); role shopping (ROL); value shopping (VAL); social shopping (SOC); and, idea shopping (IDE). The items measuring the HSM components were based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arnold and Reynolds (2003)</ref>. Finally, the scale used to measure shopper loyalty (SLO) was based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sirohi, McLaughlin, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wittink (1998) and</ref><ref type="bibr">Zeithaml, Berry, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Parasuraman (1996)</ref>. All items were measured by a seven-point Likert scale, anchored by 1: strongly disagree and 7: strongly agree (see Appendix 1 for the sale items).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural results: hypothesis testing</head><p>The SEM results show that the theoretical model received an acceptable fit to the data: χ 2 (547) = 1285.33 (p = .000); IFI = .911; CFI = .911; GFI = .883; and, RMSEA = .047. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> presents the unstandardized structural coefficients, and Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the standardized ones. Consistent with H1, hedonic shopping motivations were found to be positively associated with shopper loyalty (β = .21, p &lt; .01). H2 posits a positive relationship between supermarket attributes and shopper loyalty. This hypothesis was supported (γ = .56, p &lt; .001). Finally, H3, which proposes a positive relationship between supermarket attributes and hedonic shopping motivations, was also </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multi-group analysis: testing the moderating effects of demographic variables</head><p>To test the moderating effects of consumer demographic characteristics (age, gender, and income), the multi-group analysis in SEM was employed. There were two groups for each moderating variable, i.e., gender (female and male), age (young and older), and income levels (low and higher). The invariance was applied for both factor loadings and regression weights between constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bollen, 1989)</ref>. For this test, with the purpose of reducing parameters estimated, summated items were used as indicators. These summated items were formed by summing all items measuring each component of the two second-order constructs: SMA and HSM. This procedure was employed because the measures of each component of HSM and SMA were unidimensional <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bagozzi and Edwards, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>The results show that no difference was found in terms of gender of shoppers: ∆χ 2 = 13.20; ∆df = 15; p &gt; .58. However, difference between the young and older groups was found to be significant: ∆χ 2 = 36.47; ∆df = 15; p &lt; .005. The difference between the low and higher income groups was also significant: ∆χ 2 = 33.01; ∆df = 15; p &lt; .005. Consequently, hypotheses H4 and H5 were partly supported. A closer inspection of the structural paths reveals that the key difference was the impact of hedonic shopping motivations on shopper loyalty. In terms of age groups, this relationship found in the young group was much lower (β young = .07, p &lt; .05) compared to the older group (β older = .20, p &lt; .001). In terms of income levels, the impact of hedonic shopping motivations on shopper loyalty was statistically significant in the higher income group (β higher income = .24, p &lt; .01). However, it was not significant in the low income group (β low income = .06, p &gt; .06). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref> presents the unstandardized estimates of the model based on the multi-group analysis. It is also noted that no improper solution was found in any analysis: Heywood cases were absent; all error term variances were significant; and, all standardized residuals were less than |2.58|. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and implications</head><p>The aim of this study is to examine the roles of hedonic shopping motivations and supermarket attributes in the loyalty of supermarket shoppers in Vietnam. In so doing, the study contributes to our understanding of hedonic shopping motivations of shopper loyalty in a transitional market.</p><p>The support of the hypotheses indicates that both hedonic shopping motivations and supermarket attributes play their roles in explaining shopper loyalty (explains 50 percent of the variance of loyalty). However, supermarket attributes are still a key factor that underlies the loyalty of shoppers (β = .56), compared to that of hedonic shopping motivations (γ = .21). In addition, supermarket attributes have not only a direct impact but an indirect one, through hedonic shopping motivations, on shopper loyalty. The results of this study provide evidence of the role of the hedonic aspect of shopping in shopper loyalty in the context of a transitional market, although this role is moderate compared to that of supermarket attributes. Shoppers driven by hedonic motivations pay more attention to the quality of supermarket attributes, and thereby, are more loyal customers. The results further verify the findings found in advanced economies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arnold and Reynolds, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Babin, Darden, and Griffin, 1994)</ref>. Not only do utilitarian motivations but also hedonic motivations <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Voss, Spangenberg, and Grohmann, 2003)</ref> enhance the loyalty of Vietnamese shoppers. It is also noted that the role of hedonic shopping motivations in supermarket loyalty is different between young and older shoppers as well as between low and higher income groups of shoppers.</p><p>These findings suggest a number of implications for supermarket managers in Vietnam.</p><p>Firstly, supermarket managers should improve supermarket attributes such as facilities, employee services, and merchandise to attract shoppers, i.e., to create a good shopping environment in order to increase the frequency of customer visits. The hedonic aspect makes Vietnamese consumers to be impulse buyers who are susceptible to the influence of marketing communications at the point of purchase <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Li et al., 2004)</ref>. Therefore, supermarket managers should stimulate hedonic shopping motivations in stores to keep shoppers stay longer and buy more in supermarkets. This requires positioning strategies to centre not only on the utilitarian aspects but also on hedonic motivations of shoppers such as excitement, entertainment, fantasy, and fun. Effectively delivering such benefits to customers will produce important outcomes such as customer loyalty, word-of-mouth communication, and profit (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Carpenter and Fairhurst, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sirohi, Mclaughlin, and Wittink, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, the role of hedonic shopping motivations in supermarket loyalty is of importance primarily for higher income groups and older shoppers. These findings suggest that supermarket managers should focus on factors that are important to their target markets. For example, concentrating on the hedonic aspect of higher income and older customers will stimulate them to be more loyal to their supermarkets, which, in turn, may lead to a dramatic increase in profits. Therefore, supermarket managers should investigate the entertaining shopping experiences for their target audiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and directions for further research</head><p>This study has a number of limitations. Firstly, the empirical investigation was undertaken in one transitional market using a student sample. Although research has shown that part-time students can be used as a surrogate for consumers <ref type="bibr">(James and Sonners, 2001)</ref>, a more representative sample is required for future research. Future research should also explore other transitional markets to compare and contrast the findings, which will give a broader picture of hedonic shopping motivations to supermarket managers in such markets. Furthermore, this study investigated supermarket shoppers in general. However, the role of hedonic shopping motivations and supermarket attributes in shopper loyalty may vary with regards to the degree of product involvement. This requires further exploration in future research. In addition, this study focused on the hedonic aspect of shopping motivations. A comparison between the role of hedonic shopping motivations and utilitarian shopping motivations will be needed in future research in order to fully understand shoppers in the market.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>*</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement validation</head><p>The CFA results indicate that these scales were satisfactory with the requirement for scale reliability and validity. Firstly, the saturated model (the model in which SLO and the components of HSM and SMA were freely correlated with each other) received a good fit to the data: χ 2 (505) = 1074.07 (p = .000); IFI = .932; CFI = .931; GFI = .906; and, RMSEA = .043. It is also noted that two items in the SMA scale were deleted due to their low factor loadings (&lt; .50). Appendix 1 presents the standardized factor loadings, composite reliability, and average variance extracted of the scale items <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref>. A closer inspection of item loadings and correlations among components of each construct revealed that all factor loadings were substantial (≥ .51) and significant (p &lt; .001), and all factor correlations were significantly below unity (p &lt; .001). These results indicate that the convergent validity and within-construct discriminant validity were achieved (Appendix 2). Further, the final measurement model also received an acceptable fit to the data: χ 2 (547) = 1285.33 (p = .000); IFI = .911; CFI = .911; GFI = .883; and, RMSEA = .047.</p><p>The correlations (r) between the constructs, together with their standard errors (se) (r SMA-HSM =</p><p>.62, se = .089; r SMA-SLO = .69, se = .074; r HSM-SLO = .56, se = .080) were also significantly different from unity (p &lt; .001), supporting the across-construct discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Steenkamp and van Trijp, 1991)</ref>. </p></div>			</div>
