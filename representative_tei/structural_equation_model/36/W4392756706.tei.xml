<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>International student mobility has doubled over the past decade and its implications for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have become increasingly significant as over 5 million students' study outside their own country <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(de Wit, 2020)</ref>. The numbers are expected to grow to 7.2 million by 2025 <ref type="bibr">(GLOBAL STUDENT MOBILITY 2025</ref><ref type="bibr">MEDIA BRIEFING, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">International Higher Education Student Flows Final Report, 2019)</ref>, and while China is the largest global source country -sending 20% of all students studying overseas, India has grown at a healthy rate <ref type="bibr">(International Higher Education Student Flows Final Report, 2019)</ref>. A recent report by the industry body Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry in India (ASSOCHAM) found that about 450,000 Indian students migrate overseas and spend US$13 billion each year on acquiring a higher education abroad. Another study by <ref type="bibr">Choudhury (NBER, 2023)</ref> states that over 30% of the top thousand scorers of the most reputed Indian engineering entrance examination (IIT JEE) migrate abroad.</p><p>While the trend by itself, is not new, its mode, formats and drivers have been seeing paradigm shifts <ref type="bibr">(Malcolm, 2019)</ref> leading to exciting possibilities for increased contribution of higher education towards service exports and to ever broadening competitive frameworks, as well as mutually beneficial partnerships. The dynamics in the field of higher education in India are shifting rapidly with changing regulations, a revolutionary National Education Policy (NEP 2020), spurt in the quality &amp; features of virtual education and cross-border or transnational education (TNE). Efficient international student mobility programs can raise the profile of Indian higher education institutions, improve curricula, faculty, research capabilities, and increase the rankings of Indian institutions, as witnessed in the QS World University Rankings (2023). There are no findings that build structural associations or present any well-researched frameworks to enable Indian HEIs to develop innovative &amp; flexible academic models for better international business strategies. Previous studies show that HEIs are faced with a challenge of being able to design an appropriate study abroad program that will attract good student cohorts to enrol and gain through meaningful learning &amp; experiential outcomes <ref type="bibr">(King et.al, 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Chang et. al (2022)</ref> explored statistical relationships of contextual and motivational factors to attract &amp; retain international students in STEM in Taiwan. The current study extends their design to short term study abroad students from India, to probe their motivations, inhibitions, and perceptions about international programs and establish &amp; confirm the significance of institutional strategies for internationalization.</p><p>The practical significance of this paper is accentuated by the timing of the changing landscape of the higher education sector in India with active thrust on internationalization. It provides a direction for HEIs that are keen to gain a competitive edge with better models &amp; programs that offer benefits of international exposure to students. At the same time, the paper highlights underlying theories &amp; models of mobility that trigger scholarly insights towards further research. The study achieves this by examining the following research questions:</p><p>1. How can Indian Institutions leverage the National Education Policy to increase international student mobility? 2. What are the institutional interventions that lead to positive outcomes in short term international student mobility programs? 3. How can international student mobility be understood and implemented better through structural models?</p><p>We present the study in this paper by starting with its significance, followed by the review of the existing literature, with emphasis on the theories &amp; models that led us to our framework for the structured equation model. Next, we explain the empirical base for the chosen data and discuss the results along with their implications for further study &amp; adoption by Indian HEIs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical underpinnings</head><p>This study is based on a framework that emerged after a scientifically acceptable and impactful literature review <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Paul &amp; Criado, 2020)</ref>, to meet the necessary purpose of a critical analysis in this area with the objective of identifying relevant theories, key constructs and contexts that can set a future research agenda for promoting and driving responsible student mobility programs under international education in India as per the vision of NEP (UGC, 2022). The UGC agenda is clear but the path to achieve it is ambiguous. Extant studies and research actively study ISM trends (Chouadha R. and Chang. L. 2012) as well as explore student choices and decision making <ref type="bibr">(Wilkins et.al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Albien et. al. 2021)</ref> to understand the kaleidoscope of factors, drivers, and barriers of global mobility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wells (2014)</ref> highlights how the study of ISM has been concentrated on migration theories, such as the push and pull factors. These are good to understand the concept at a macro level but fail to examine the intricate influences at micro levels. Thus, in this section, we focus on the literature that helps us to specifically understand measures of international business strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hill C., 2021)</ref> for Indian HEIs that can be built into a conceptual model for further validation &amp; testing.</p><p>We argue that Indian institutions need to shift from being good teaching institutions to functioning like professional organizations amidst rising waves of Globalization and Internationalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Malcolm T., 2019)</ref>. Strategic interventions, innovative leadership, competitive spirit and applying customer choice &amp; satisfaction models to student life cycles (Taskah K., 2020) is the key towards effective internationalization of higher education in India.</p><p>Let's face the music. Rankings are here to stay and the position of Indian HEIs is way below their potential. There are several ways in which the institutional leadership can rise to the occasion, and apply suitable interventions <ref type="bibr">(Chang, D.F. et. al., 2021)</ref> to leverage the already existing urge of studying abroad in an interesting and beneficial manner. The need for having researched frameworks is hence well established and the next section of our paper focuses on developing one such structural model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Framework development</head><p>NEP highlights three key reforms in its plan for internationalization of education. It advocates for foreign universities to set up campuses in India, Indian universities to set up campuses abroad, and twining, dual degree &amp; joint degree collaborative programs at Indian universities. Study abroad programs, semester abroad programs, immersion programs &amp; credit transfer pathways are few of the new models for gaining international education that have encouraged students to stay home while being able to achieve the distinction &amp; benefits of international education.</p><p>Based on the theoretical reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Albien et. al, 2021)</ref>, this study suggests a basic conceptual model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) for conducting a pilot test to develop a deeper model that can help Indian HEIs to focus their strategic advancement &amp; interventions towards effective internationalization from the perspective of the student mindset amidst the combined effects of the factors that "push" them to go outside and others that "pull" them from abroad. The positive attraction of better living conditions (e1), higher value &amp; stability (e2) and success (e3) constitute the pull factors while the push factors include poor learning environment (e4), low choices (e5) and lack of employability (e6).</p><p>The model then shifts to assessing the importance of an active, encouraging (e7), clear and vibrant (e8) ecosystem of internationalization strategies, policies &amp; procedures (e9) for market competitiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fakunle O., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hill C., 2021)</ref>, through the ultimate objective of student fulfilment in form of satisfaction with the design (e10), learning experience (e11) and outcomes (e12). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data Collection, Analysis and Results</head><p>This study was conducted by collecting primary data from 30 undergraduate students through a selfdesigned questionnaire, based on the SEM model to test the push, pull, institutional interventions and fulfilment factors. All the questions were tested using a 5-point Likert scale, from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).</p><p>The descriptive statistics of the observations for the factors (push, pull, institutional intervention and fulfilment) are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. These are the mean &amp; standard deviation of each of the factors with their number of observed items. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the Pearson correlation that examined the relationship between the Push, Pull, Institutional Support and the Fulfilment factors considered in the study. Scale scores were computed by adding the responses of the question in each scale. The mean for the Push factor was 2.38 (SD = 0.920), mean for Pull factor was 3.18 (SD = 0.866), mean for the Institutional support was 2.01 (SD = 0.450) and Fulfilment factor was 2.29 (SD = 1.164). It was observed that the relationship between the Push, Pull and Fulfilment factors were positively correlated, and it ranged between 0.309 to 0.429 while the relationship between the Push, Institutional support and Pull was found to be negatively correlated and it ranged between -0.319 to -0.370.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3a</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3b</ref> depict the results for when the Dependent variable (Fulfilment) was regressed on predicted variable of Push, Pull and Institutional support factors. The independent variables significantly predict the Fulfilment, which indicates that the three factors under the study have a significant impact on the Fulfilment factor. Moreover, the R2 was found to be .377 depicts that the model explains 37.7% of variation in fulfilment. The result revealed that push factor has significant positive impact on fulfilment (β = 0.065, t= 2.186, p= 0.033). Also pull factor has significant positive impact on fulfilment (β = 0.037, t= 2.193, p= 0.049). Moreover, institutional support has a significant negative impact on fulfilment (β = -0.354, t= 2.051, p= 0.026).   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion and Implications</head><p>It is unanimously expected that there must be free flow of students and faculty who can find solutions for a growing interdependent world challenged equally by global issues <ref type="bibr">(Baranova, et.al, 2011)</ref>. The present one-way exodus of Indian students needs more indigenous institutions to write new chapters in the education ecosystem that encourages stay in India and invites many more to study in India. Internationalization at home is an imperative opportunity and strategic need that needs to be adopted by the Indian HEIs <ref type="bibr">(Knight J, 2018)</ref>. Every best practice has its limitations and it is important to understand that potential benefits of internationalisation can never be taken for granted <ref type="bibr">(Bijsmans et.al. 2022)</ref>. Studies have shown that the outcomes may not be achieved due to problems at the macro as well as stakeholder levels (de Wit, 2019). Results of this paper accentuates these arguments and encourages more strategic interventions at the Indian institution levels.</p><p>In addition, this research highlights how national policies (like NEP), and regulatory frameworks are upfront and any change in them has always been an important factor while considering market plans. While these may be beyond the circle of influence, actual design of international mobility programs and pedagogy is under the direct management of institutions. Balance is important if the exposure is not to be "lost to translation" due to the overbearing nature of a particular culture <ref type="bibr">(Bijsmans et.al. 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Indian HEIs have started looking at short term international student mobility, the design of which needs more studies like this to provide evidence-based best practices. It is no longer sufficient to rely on theories that a push, pull or institutional intervention will be sufficient to drive student fulfilment. The results provide implications for the successful deployment of a clear agenda for internationalization, as set out through the NEP. Institutions can leverage the understanding of the structural relationships discussed in this paper to involve students in value co-creation, build trust, satisfaction and excellence amongst students and create better designed, marketed &amp; executed study abroad programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>This study was undertaken as a pilot for a deeper empirical model that can identify mechanisms that can be put in place to ensure that Indian HEIs do not fall prey to the systemic &amp; procedural gaps, while leveraging the benefits of international student mobility programs. The SEM model shows that the variables need to go beyond the typical factors of push, pull &amp; institutional interventions, if there is to be a better design for fulfilment of student goals &amp; aspirations.</p><p>This suggests the need to include &amp; test additional factors through other studies <ref type="bibr">(Peterson et.al, 2017)</ref> that have assessed students who attend study abroad programs. Indicative examples include credit transfer policies, timing of the study abroad program, psychological factors, cross-cultural sensitivities, behavioural &amp; emotional challenges such as the proliferation of confusion, home sickness, loneliness, cultural sensitivity, and depression, amongst others (de Wit, 2020).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Limitations and potential scope of research</head><p>There are some limitations of this study. Sampling was restricted to one university and based on pilot testing of a rather rigid model on a small sample, that may not be representative of the larger student population. The model can be applied across different universities &amp; institutions for competitive analysis or as a longitudinal study within one HEI.</p><p>Further, the domain of internationalization of higher education is a dynamically evolving area and has many dimensions, besides student mobility, which was the focus of this study. This, along with inclusion of other demographic &amp; psychographic variables, presents further scope for research, particularly for understanding of way forward for adoption in the Indian context.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
