<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Grid-based inventories of 1,924 deciduous forests plots in Germany and 4,775 in Romania were used to investigate tree species composition as affected by browsing and grazing under different forest management (rotation forestry, selectively cut forest, protected forest). At regional scale, the loss of tree species in the dominant layer was between 52 to 67% in Germany and of 10 to 30% in Romania, with largest effects in protected nature reserves in Germany. At plot level, only 50% (Germany) to 54% (Romania) of canopy species were found in the regeneration layer with a height of 1.5 m. Browsing was influenced by the proportion of Fagus in the regenerating trees in Germany, and by stand density, basal area, and management in both regions. Structural equation modeling explained 11 to 26% of the variance in species loss based on the fresh loss of the terminal bud in the winter prior to the inventory work (one season browsing). Browsing (and grazing in Romania) is shown to be a significant cause of species loss across both countries and all management types. Potential cascading effects on other organisms of deciduous forest ecosystems are discussed. We conclude that the present hunting practices that support overabundant ungulate populations constitute a major threat to the biodiversity of deciduous forests in Germany and Romania and to other places with similar ungulate management, and that changes my only be possible by modernizing the legal framework of hunting.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Among disturbances, browsing by ungulates has direct effects on the establishment and maintenance of plant species and indirect effects on other organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lessard et al. 2012)</ref>. The consequences of this disturbance regime are closely related to forest ecosystem resilience and thus of particular importance for forest management. An "overpopulation" of deer would exist if certain management goals cannot anymore be reached. However there is no fi xed deer-density ascribing "overpopulations", as the effects of browsing is depending on the grazing species and its preference for certain plant species, and on forest management goals (monoculture versus mixed forests). In contrast to agriculture, managing ungulate browsing is diffi cult because the effects of browsing are not immediately reversible in forests due to the long life-time of trees, even if ungulate populations were to decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Tanentzap et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Quantifying a balanced ungulate density satisfying multiple objectives (e.g. stand characteristics and resilience, productivity, biodiversity, and economic output) is a major issue in managing forests. Browsing can strongly infl uence the structure, composition, growth and succession of forest stands as a result of the intensity and the selectivity of browsing damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Klötzli 1965</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">, Skarpe &amp; Hester 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">, Gerhadt et al. 2013)</ref>. Even <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carlowitz (1713)</ref>, who coined the concept of sustainable forestry, recommended already in the 18th century that "browsed trees should be cut, because such damaged individuals subsequently exhibit reduced growth" (quote translated from German). Preferred (i.e. more palatable) species lose their competitiveness mainly from browsing of the terminal bud. Tree height in the regeneration layer of browsed species decreases as deer density increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Horsley et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Tremblay et al., 2007)</ref>, and reduction of height has a major effect on competitive ability. Thus, deer may alter inter-specifi c competition such that avoided (i.e., less palatable) species benefi t from browsing at the expense of preferred ones <ref type="bibr">("apparent competition", Holt 1977)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Harper (1977)</ref> described such situations where plant species that would dominate a plant community in the absence of herbivory, are disadvantaged by herbivory to an extent where less preferred or grazing-tolerant plant species attain dominance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Crawley (1988)</ref> generalized these observations such that a frequency-dependent herbivore feeding can be a force to increasing plant-species richness, allowing the recruitment of grazing-tolerant species. If this type of interaction would operate for forest tree species, we would expect higher tree diversity in the regeneration of stands, which are grazed by ungulates than in the canopy if management is excluded (protected sites).</p><p>In managed stands one tendency would be to reduce the action of deer, while supporting subdominant tree species of commercial value by tending and thinning. Thus management would tend to maintaining diversity in deciduous forests. However, forest managers are not independent in their decisions, as deer management depends on hunters, who lease properties across boarders to reach the legally required minimum hunting area. Present strategies (mainly hunting for trophies; Crişan 1994, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gautschi 2010</ref>), and the improved food supply with high yielding crops in agriculture and with feeding of deer in forests in winter caused an increasing deer population globally <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Milner et al. 2007</ref>), which would impact not only tree diversity, but result also in cascading impacts on other animal taxa <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lessard et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Côté et al. 2004)</ref>.</p><p>In this study the effects of ungulates on tree species diversity were investigated by quantifying changes in tree species composition between the canopy and different regeneration layers of different forest types in Romania and Germany. The focus is on browsing of deciduous trees by roe deer, because of its known effect on tree regeneration (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Klötzli 1965</ref>). We neglect bark peeling and fraying by red deer, which requires a separate analysis. Forest management options range in the investigated areas from age-class rotation forest to totally protected forest reserves. The overall hypothesis is that the effects of ungulate browsing lead to a species loss in temperate deciduous forest rather than to an enrichment of tree diversity, and that the level of loss depends on the type of forest management. Different management systems (age class forests with and without thinning, selective logging, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Schulze et al. 2014</ref>) may tolerate different levels of browsing/grazing and still reach the management goals. Based on our observations we discuss the legal implications of hunting and the cascading effects of tree species loss for ecosystem diversity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study regions and grid-based inventories</head><p>The investigation was conducted between 2008 and 2012 in Southeastern Europe (Romania) and in Central Europe (Germany), exhibiting different levels of browsing intensities. Gridbased inventories were used to sample a large range of forest habitats, ages, structures, management types, and browsing conditions.</p><p>In Romania, the investigation is based on the Romanian National Forest inventory (NFI), which includes forests, woodlands, and trees outside forests. The NFI covers the entire country of Romania (approx. 500 x 500 km area) on a 4 x 4 km grid in hills and mountains and a 2 x 2 km grid in lowlands <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Marin et al. 2009)</ref>. The measurements were taken on clusters of four plots located in the corners of a 250 x 250 m square. For the present study, plots at low altitude (250 to 650 m above sea level) with deciduous forest cover were selected, which are in total 4,775 plots of 2,194 clusters from the 4 x 4 km grid and 55 from the 2 x 2 km grid. The mean annual daily temperature ranges from 6 to 8°C and precipitation ranges from 600 to 800 mm.</p><p>In Germany, the investigation was focused on the Hainich-Dün region, in the Northwestern part of Thuringia. The region of approx. 200 x 50 km contains different land use types (agriculture, forest, infrastructure). A 100 x 100 m grid was placed in the core of the forest areas, excluding forest margins <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hessenmöller et al. 2011)</ref>, which resulted in a total of 1,924 plots. Elevation ranges from 300 to 600 m above sea level. The mean annual daily temperature ranges from 6 to 8°C and precipitation ranges from 600 to 750 mm.</p><p>We are aware that comparisons between regions that are more than 1,000 km apart contain inherent weaknesses with respect to geological substrates and management histories. Nevertheless, the climate conditions are very similar in both regions and the species composition is very close <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Schulze et al. 2014)</ref>. Both regions were covered by forest after the Pleistocene from the same tree refugia <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lang 1994)</ref>. Thus, a comparison of both regions with respect to browsing and management of the regeneration appears legitimate, and it would strengthen the conclusions if similar patterns emerge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inventory measurements</head><p>Forest management was recorded for each inventory plot as (i) age-class (rotation) forest consisting of even-aged stands established after harvest, (ii) selectively cut forest consisting of uneven-aged stands with single tree harvest at target diameter, and (iii) protected unmanaged forest reserves.</p><p>Canopy measurements followed the identical protocols in the both regions. Circular plots covered 500 m 2 (radius 12.62 m) in young stands and 1000 m 2 area (radius 17.8 m) in old-growth stands. All living and dead trees &gt;5.6 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were recorded depending on tree size in concentric sub-circles: trees with 5.6 ≤ DBH ≤ 28.5 cm were measured within a 200 m 2 inner circle and trees with DBH ≥ 28.5 cm within a concentric 500 m 2 circle <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hessenmöller et al. 2011)</ref>. Plots with exotic, introduced species (e.g., Pseudotsuga menziesii) were discarded.</p><p>For some tree genera (Quercus: two species, Tilia: two species, Sorbus: three species, Ulmus: three species) determination to species level was not possible in winter. Therefore, the analysis of diversity in Germany is based on genera for these groups. Using genera for some species in Germany and actual species in Romania affects about 10% of the plots, and it is unlikely to change the results. Tree species diversity increased with the number of investigated plots, saturating at about 21 species in Romania and at 16 taxonomic units in Germany with 500 and 1,000 plots, respectively (species accumulation curves: Supplement-Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>). Stand parameters are summarized for both regions in the supplement (Supplement-Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</p><p>Regeneration was sampled on rectangular plots of 8 m 2 in Germany. In Romania, regeneration was sampled on two satellite plots located at 10 m from one another. Each satellite plot is constituted of two concentric circular plots of 1 m radius for saplings between 10 cm and 50 cm height, and 1.78 m radius for saplings beyond 50 cm height. Observations in fenced areas show that these plot sizes are large enough to support the maximum diversity of tree saplings for the investigated height classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Schulze 2014)</ref>. The regeneration layer (see also Supplement-Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>) was divided into low, intermediate and tall regeneration as: 0.2 to 0.5 m being Height Class 1 (HC1); 0.5 to1.3 m in Romania and 0.5 to 1.5 m in Germany being Height Class 2 (HC2); and 1.3 m in Romania and 1.5 m in Germany to 3 m being Height Class 3 (HC3). For each height class, the number and species identity of all individuals were recorded. The transition from HC1 to HC3 takes about 10 to 20 years under unfenced conditions in Germany.</p><p>Ungulate browsing was recorded as loss of the terminal bud during the current growing season. When interpreting browsing damage, one must consider that this damage happens each year. We did not record browsing on lateral branches, because height growth is the main factor for success in dense regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burschel &amp; Huss 2002)</ref>. Old and repeated browsing damage of terminal shoots were also not accounted for. Thus, total impact was underestimated. Repeatedly browsed individuals become distorted and die from competition with un-browsed neighbors.</p><p>Browsing was at different levels in Romania and Germany (p &lt; 0.001), despite a great similarity in canopy tree species composition and total canopy species number. Thus, the comparison of these two countries may detect the specifi c effects of browsing. However, there are differences. Despite of lower deer populations in Romania, another type of disturbance emerged during the evaluation of the data. In addition to deer and predators, we must consider domesticated animals in Romania, where the total number of sheep (12.5 million) plus goats (1.6 million) is equivalent to about 2.1 head per ha forest as a national average. The population of goats has increased signifi cantly since 2002: from 0.7 million in 2003 (National Institute of Statistics 2003) to 1.7 million in 2012 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(MADR 2012)</ref>. This increase occurred mainly on small and medium sized farms (with 20 to 500 goats per farm) grazing both agricultural land and forest, mostly in the lowlands of southern and eastern Romania. We do not have a precise estimate of the amount of grazing in forests and on our inventory plots because forest grazing is illegal. But there is suffi cient evidence and fi eld observations by the authors to confi rm its large-scale existence and impact. Grazing pressure is also acknowledged in the Romsilva reports (Ministerul Mediului şi Pădurilor 2011) and the media report grazing even in nature reserves (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Gardianul, 27.7.2007)</ref>. Sheep and goats affect mainly the lower-most height class (HC1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimates of the mean age of trees in a plot</head><p>Stand age is an important variable in forest succession and it is strongly related to species richness <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ellenberg 1978)</ref>. To estimate stand age in uneven-aged stands is diffi cult. Here we used a general relationship between DBH and the measured tree ages at DBH in Romania and at stump height in Thuringia (Supplement-Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>). For Romania, a total of 546 trees and for Germany a total of 114 trees of Fagus, Quercus and Acer originating from all types of forest management were used for the reduced major axis regression model <ref type="bibr">(RMA, Sokal and Rohlf 1995)</ref>. The slope of the regression line was signifi cantly higher in Romania than in Germany (p &lt; 0.05), partly because cores were taken at DBH in Romania and at tree base in Germany. Stand age was estimated by averaging the DBH-related age of all trees per plot. Thus, stand and plot age are represented by the mean age of trees in a plot. There was no signifi cant effect of species identity on this relation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimate of near-ground light conditions</head><p>The large number of inventory points represented a broad range of light conditions. Even though the light conditions at the regeneration height were estimated by eye, as canopy closure, in the statistical analysis (see chapter 2.6), the basal area was taken as a continuous variable surrogating for light conditions on the ground. Basal area and light-level estimates were closely correlated (ANOVA with the categorical independent variable "light level" and the continuous variable "basal area", p &lt;0.01 for Romania and Germany).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regional estimates of deer populations</head><p>In Romania, the density of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.) and red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) was estimated for 347 hunting districts each covering 2,500 to 23,000 ha, matching the forest inventory (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). These governmental data have never been aggregated and published before, and the survey has not been repeated. Animal numbers are based on independent counts of tracks in fresh snow in March 2002, on a national basis. These counts are compared with the reports of the rangers. The large predators (wolf: Canis lupus L., bear: Ursus arctos L., lynx: Lynx lynx L.) were summed. Ungulate numbers may be underestimated (about 10% by expert knowledge) because some animals may not have moved during the survey, and the predators could be overestimated because animals move between districts.</p><p>In Germany, populations of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.), fallow deer (Dama dama L.), red deer (Cervus elaphus L.), and moufl on (Ovis orientalis musimon) were assessed (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) by spotlight counting and by expert estimates of the forest service <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Tottewitz et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Heinze et al. 2011)</ref>. Two spotlight counts were carried out in the early evening and after dawn in spring and autumn of 2008. 100 watt spotlights were used along a total of 40 km of forest road for each management type. A comparison of the spotlight counts with other methods of deer density assessments (counts of feces, counts of footprints in fresh snow) showed good agreement for red deer, but an underestimate of about 30% for roe and fallow deer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Heinze et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>For both countries, the different ungulate species were aggregated into a weight-corrected "ungulate equivalent unit", based on average food consumption of red deer. Four roe deer or two fallow deer are assumed to graze the equivalent of one red deer -about 840 kg of dry matter on 100 ha over one winter <ref type="bibr">(Hofmann et al. 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Effects of stand development. Tree species richness changes with stand development, and it is crucial to separate effects of succession and browsing. In this study the large number of inventory plots probably covers most of the range of interactions between browsing, stand age, and environmental conditions.</p><p>As an approximation of the net effect of this species turnover in European temperate deciduous forest, we investigate the age distribution of various tree species richness levels. Due to the frequency of biotic and abiotic disturbances, there is a right-sided frequency distribution of the number of inventory plots representing a certain canopy tree species number, with many observations of plots at low average tree age on a plot, and a decreasing number of observations with increasing age. To avoid any bias of sampling, in our analysis we determined the maximum age that was observed for a given species richness level. We observed that a high mean age of trees in a plot was reached only at low tree species richness (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), confi rming the observations in primary stands of deciduous forest (Korpel 1995). High species richness was found only in young stands <ref type="bibr">(Buschel &amp; Huss 2003)</ref>. The implications of species losses during succession are emphasized in the discussion.</p><p>In the following, we describe the change in tree species richness of the canopy by a regression through the maximum age that was reached by each species richness level. Since there are numerous causes for the variation of tree species richness at plot level, we made sure that the regression of species richness at maximum age would not be affected by the number of observations in that diversity class. Thus, our regression describes community dynamics of deciduous forest under most undisturbed and favorable conditions as base line. We are aware that this is a dynamic boundary line of the net effect of species losses and gains. If a gap were formed by the loss of an old tree individual, an additional species may enter into the canopy, but the mean age of trees will decrease by a younger individual entering the canopy. If a species were lost during self thinning, species richness will decline and may reach a higher mean age of trees at continually increasing height. Thus, we observed a negative relationship between species richness in the canopy and the maximum mean age of trees per plot (represented by the three observations of maximum age of a given diversity level: red points in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), forming a boundary-line of a scatter diagram of all study plots. There are numerous situations of lower diversity and age due to anthropogenic and natural disturbances, environmental conditions and deer browsing.</p><p>Interactions between biotic and abiotic factors determining canopy species richness. In this study we used generalized linear models and structural equation modeling to study the interactions between parameters and to separate effects of correlated variables.</p><p>In order to describe the overall browsing effect, we defi ned the variable "species loss" as the difference between the number of species in the canopy, or in HC1, minus the number of species present in HC2, because this are the stages, at which the main differentiation between plant individuals occur. For this analysis we neglected plots without any regeneration. The lack of any regeneration could be due to light conditions below dense canopies or due to browsing by deer or due to domestic animal grazing of seedlings. We cannot distinguish between these factors especially since plots without any regeneration occurred at the same basal area where other plots showed a maximum of regeneration (see Supplement Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref>). We excluded these "zero" sites lacking any regeneration because the complete absence of regeneration on a plot does not allow to inspecting changes.</p><p>Generalized linear models (R Development Core Team 2010) were used to explore the relationship of management, canopy cover, and browsing on tree species richness in the regeneration layer, without accounting for the multiplicity of possible interactions between factors (see Supplement-Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref>). Since species numbers in HC 1 and HC2 also represent a shift in time, situations occur where tree diversity was higher in HC2 than HC1. We excluded these few instances of negative numbers.</p><p>Structural equation modeling was used to explain species losses in the regeneration layer by the complex direct and indirect interactions between browsing and other parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Grace 2006</ref>). We performed separate analyses for the forest management types 'protected forest', 'selectively cut forest', and 'age-class forest' in Germany, and for 'selectively cut forest' and 'age-class forest' in Romania. Due to a low number of replicates, we were not able to perform structural equation modeling analyses with data from protected forests in Romania. The initial model was based on previous knowledge (literature, expert knowledge; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A</ref>), testing effects of the tree species number in the canopy, the percentage of Fagus in the canopy and light availability (exogenous variables) on browsing in age class 1, tree density in age class 1, and on species loss (endogenous variables). The initial model was improved by using "modifi cation indices" (which are program functions indicating if adding new paths will improve the model fi t) and stepwise removal of "unimportant relationships" (paths which were not signifi cant and removal would improve the fi t of the model); however, only "scientifi cally sound paths" (paths for which an established theory exists) were considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Grace 2006)</ref>. The adequacy of the models was determined through χ 2 tests, AIC and RMSEA (Supplement-Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S3</ref>). Adequate model fi ts are indicated by a non-signifi cant χ 2 test (P &gt; 0.05), low AIC and low RMSEA (&lt; 0.05) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Grace 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Arbuckle 2010)</ref>. Structured equation modeling was performed with IBM SPSS Amos 21.0.0 (Amos Development Corporation; Meadville, PA, USA). Tree density in age class 1 was log10-transformed to allow for linear analyses. Scatter diagrams of the individual relations are summarized in the supplement (Supplement-Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4</ref>). The results from simple regressions and structural equation models may differ, because structural equation models account for the co-variance structure of the tested variables and thus provide a more balanced picture of relationships in a multivariate context.</p></div>

Despite this potentially high diversity on single plots, most plots had less than 3 species, irrespective of the type of management as indicated by the numbers inserted on the margins of Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>Old forest stands may contain multiple layers of trees. This causes an apparent low maximum age in Romania compared to regularly thinned age-class forests in Germany. For Romania, the loss of species with successional age as indicated by the slope of the boundary line was 0.6 to 0.7 species lost for every 10 years of increasing age.</p><p>In Germany (Fig. <ref type="figure">1D</ref> to F), the maximum number of species per inventory plot was 7, which was lower than in Romania, mainly due to the count of genera in Quercus, Tilia, Ulmus and Sorbus under-representing tree species richness. At plot-scale, the total number of species was surprisingly similar between Romania and Germany.</p><p>The loss of species by succession in protected forest in Germany was similar to Romania (0.7 species lost every 10 years). The loss was lower in managed German forests (0.3 to 0.4 species per 10 years) at lower maximum diversity. In both countries, Fagus sylvatica is the only species remaining after 150 years in Romania and 200 years in Germany at plot scale (Section 3.5 gives the regional loss of tree species). Thus, species are lost during succession, and in the following we will explain the additional effects of browsing and grazing, which reduces species diversity at the stage of regeneration.</p></div>

Despite this potential for regeneration, the maximum species number in the regeneration layer was always lower than in the canopy.</p><p>In Romania (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), the average species number in the lower regeneration layer (including plots without regeneration) was about 1 species, with a maximum of 5 in protected forest to 8 and 9 species in managed forests. A signifi cant decrease in species number between HC1 and HC2 was observed (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.00234), but species numbers in the regeneration layer increased again in HC3 compared to HC2 (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.00234).</p><p>In Germany, the average number of species in HC1 was 2, while the maximum number reached only 5, as compared to 7 in the canopy, in part due to the count of genera (not species) in Quercus, Tilia, Ulmus and Sorbus. In contrast to Romania, there was a signifi cant trend (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05) of decreasing species number when comparing HC1 with HC2 and HC3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Browsing effects on regeneration</head><p>The fresh (last winter) loss of terminal bud was considered as a parameter to quantify the effects of browsing and grazing (Supplement-Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S4</ref>). In Romania, browsing affected only about 3 to 6 % of the total number of trees in HC1 and HC2 of rotation and selectively cut forests, but reached 10% in HC2 of protected forests. In contrast, in Germany, browsing affected 16 to 39% of the terminal buds in HC1 and HC2 of rotation and selectively cut forests, but reached levels &gt;40% in protected forest. Browsing rate was lower in HC3 as these trees are too tall to be browsed by roe deer.</p><p>The loss of the terminal bud by browsing or grazing was not shared equally among species and not related to the density of the respective species (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Fagus sylvatica exhibited the highest plant density in HC1 both in Romania and Germany. The density of Fraxinus excelsior and Acer pseudoplatanus was higher in Germany than in Romania, while Carpinus betulus, Ulmus spp. and Acer campestre reached higher density in Romania than in Germany.</p><p>In Romania, only 2% of Fagus sylvatica individuals lost the terminal bud, as compared to 12% of the individuals of more palatable species such as Sorbus aucuparia and 6 to 7% of individuals of Fraxinus excelsior and Acer pseudoplatanus. In Germany, the fraction of individuals that lost the terminal bud was up to ten times higher than in Romania. Despite its dominance, only 12% of the Fagus sylvatica individuals lost their terminal bud. This con-trasts to 60 to 77% of the individuals of Fraxinus excelsior and Acer pseudoplatanus, and to about 20 to 40% of all other associated species individuals that lost their terminal bud in a single year.</p><p>For both countries, the relationship between species numbers and associated browsing intensity in HC1 and HC2 indicates that the highest number of species was observed only at low browsing intensity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). The boundaries of the scatter plots (green dots in Fig. 3) show a signifi cant decrease of the species number in the regeneration layer with increasing browsing intensity. The species loss was largest when Fagus sylvatica was dominant, irrespective of the type of management. The recorded regional differences in success of regeneration in HC1 could be related to the age-class distribution of the canopy. In Romania, about two-thirds of all stands were less than 50 years old (average age of all canopy trees per plot), while only 5% of the stands were aged less than 50 years in Germany. However, browsing in different height classes was not related to the average canopy age of the inventory plot (Supplement-Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>). Browsing was highly patchy: irrespective of stand age, there were a large number of plots without browsing or with 100% browsing.</p><p>In this study it was not possible to investigate the causes for lack of any regeneration on inventoried plots -e.g., the complete consumption and failure of seedlings. In a separate analysis of the density of regeneration in relation to basal area (Supplement-Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref>) we show that plots without any regeneration are not observed at highest basal area, but at inter-mediate stages of succession where on other plots a maximum of regeneration was reached. Also, plots without any regeneration were only observed in Germany (see also Supplement-Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). Thus, the complete absence of regeneration appears to be related to deer browsing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factors contributing to species loss in the regeneration layers</head><p>General linear models already indicate that the loss of species number in the regeneration layer of HC2 was related to ungulate browsing with higher levels of signifi cance in Germany as in Romania (Supplement-Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref>).</p><p>The complicated interactions between stand parameters and browsing become apparent in structural equation models (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A</ref> for the initial model) which fi t the data well in all fi ve cases where analyses were possible (all χ 2 tests P &gt; 0.06). We were able to explain 11 to 13% of the variance in species loss in Romania (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>) and 8 to 26% in Germany (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4D, E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>). Overall, the structural equation models reveal that sapling density Density of individual tree species measured in Height Class 1 (the numbers are small because plots where a given species does not occur or without regeneration are included and contribute with 0) and the fraction of individuals that lost the terminal bud in 2008. Only species with more than 1 ‰ density are shown. The numbers average across 3 management types + standard deviations in HC1 and browsing in HC1 were the most consistent and signifi cant predictors for species loss both in Romania and Germany. While tree species number in the canopy was only signifi cantly and positively associated with species loss in Romania and in age-class forest in Germany, light had only inconsistent effects on species loss (two signifi cant relationships in selectively cut forests and age-class forests in Germany). The percentage of Fagus in the canopy increased species loss in Germany through mechanisms not related to light availability and tree density in HC1, but this was only signifi cant in protected forests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regional effects of browsing and management on tree species composition</head><p>The effects of browsing at plot scale do not include the effects on regional tree fl ora, and the large-scale effects of browsing and management on tree species composition can only be demonstrated in a regional comparison (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). In Romania, about 20 species are found in the canopy, with a lower number of species in protected forests, due to the lower number of sampling points (see Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>). For this region, the loss of species in the regeneration layer was 10 to 30%, with a maximum loss in HC2 of protected forests. In Germany, the regional loss of species was larger than in Romania. Considering that Tilia, Quercus, Sorbus and Ulmus contained more Scatter diagram of number of tree species per plot in HC1 and HC2 as related to the relative number of browsed individuals (% of total number of individuals) for stands with different dominance of Fagus. The numbers at the margin of the plot indicate the total number of dots in each row and column grouped according to the presence of Fagus  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref> for more information). than one species, the regional tree diversity of Thuringia is 22 tree species. The canopy of the selectively cut, age-class and protected forest contained a total of 20, 21 and 18 tree species respectively. The total number of species in HC3 decreased to 7, 10 and only 6 (52 to 67 % loss) in the selectively cut, age-class and protected forest, respectively.</p></div>

Based on a meta-analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Horn (1974)</ref> claimed that the diversity of the "climax" should be lower than the diversity of preceding stages. However, the trend seems to depend on the species reservoir of late successional species. Species numbers increased with succession in tropical forests (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Wittmann et al. 2006</ref>), but decreased in boreal forest (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Schoonmaker &amp; McKee 1988)</ref>, and this may depend on the geological history. Contrasting to deciduous forests in North America and East Asia, European forests were impoverished during the Pleistocene <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Schulze et al. 1996)</ref>.</p><p>In our study, the boundary line in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> represents the upper level of attainable tree diversity for a given developmental stage under a broad range of conditions. We observed a decline to the level of one remaining species due to the species-specifi c ability to grow in height. In Europe, Fagus sylvatica becomes a "monopolist" (in the sense of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Horn 1974)</ref>, because it is the tallest species, reaching more than 40 m in height, overtopping all other associated canopy species on average by 5 to 10 m <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Schulze et al. 2010</ref>). In addition, Fagus sylvatica is more capable than any other associated tree species for rapid lateral growth, closing any canopy gap in a short period of time. Height and lateral growth of Fagus sylvatica explain the observation of monotypic old growth stands <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Petriţan et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">, Korpel 1995)</ref>. In the present large dataset, we never observed a species-rich old stand. The species "reservoir" of European deciduous forest does not contain an old-growth competitor for Fagus, except, maybe, for Abies alba at higher altitudes.</p><p>All tree species had the possibility of regenerating in the lowest layer (HC1), independent of canopy age and the species richness in the canopy. Despite this potential for regeneration, our study shows that the maximum species number in the regeneration layer was always lower than in the canopy (comparing Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> with Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), and this was partly explained by browsing. Our data provide evidence contradicting the initial hypothesis that in European deciduous forests ungulate browsing may increase diversity (in the sense of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Harper 1977</ref>). Browsing appears to enhance the established pattern of species diversity reduction from species-rich young communities towards late successional mono-specifi c stands <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Mayer 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Begon et al. 1990</ref>). This apparent enhancement of succession distorts the community dynamics and tree diversity in earlier stages of succession. A forest management effect on the rate of tree species decline is not apparent, contradicting our second general hypothesis. Even though the affected species can recover, they lose the competitive advantage of early height growth, i.e. they are overgrown and shaded out by the non-grazed species, mainly Fagus sylvatica.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other factors explaining species loss in regeneration</head><p>Our observation contrasts studies which regard shade tolerance as the main factor regulating density and diversity of regeneration, with Fagus being "apparently" the most shade tolerant species (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Petriţan et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">, von Lüpke 2005)</ref>. Many of these observations were made in stands without any protection against browsing. In our study, the structural equation analysis detected a more consistent effect of browsing than of light, confi rming <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abs et al. (2008)</ref> who showed that the light requirements of Fagus are very similar to those of Tilia and Ulmus, and that shade tolerance of Acer pseudoplatanus and Acer platanoides even exceeds the shade tolerance of Fagus. If protected from browsing, non-Fagus species would become dominant even under conditions of shade <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Striepen 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Caquet et al. 2009</ref>). In our study, Fagus had already become dominant by the third height class, having totally suppressed Acer platanoides. Overall, 77% of A. plata-noides individuals were browsed in Germany in a single season. In a fencing experiment of our study region, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Schulze (2014)</ref> showed that even Fagus suffers from browsing: tree height was 4 to 6 meters taller in fenced versus unfenced areas four years after fencing, and non-Fagus species were dominant over Fagus in the sun and in the shade. <ref type="bibr">Modry et al. (2004)</ref> already concluded that browsing is the main factor confounding shade tolerance studies. Obviously, the "apparent" superior shade tolerance of Fagus results from its lower speciesspecifi c palatability to roe deer <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Holt 1977</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Pépin et al. 2006)</ref>.</p><p>We did not investigate the effects of deer on seedlings <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gill &amp; Beardall 2001)</ref>. Thus, the effects of deer are likely to be underestimated. The variable number of plots without any regeneration, as well as the reduction in species number between the canopy and HC1, is probably associated with deer browsing on seedlings as fencing experiments indicate <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Striepen 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">, Schulze 2014</ref>). Thus, based on an extensive monitoring of more than &gt;6,500 plots we conclude that the species diversity in the tall regeneration layer is up to 67% lower than in the canopy, with a large number of species being effectively lost at regional scale, with ungulate browsing playing a signifi cant role across different forest management types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regional differences and deer management</head><p>Our initial hypothesis was that the level of browsing pressure in Romania is "more natural", because of the existence of large predators which, together with illegal hunting, reduces the number of ungulates. In contrast to our expectations and despite a low deer population, however, major species losses in regeneration were also found in Romania, the decline being most prominent in HC1 and HC2. The increase in species numbers in HC3 may indicate that the process is a recent occurrence, affecting HC1 more than HC3, and may not have even existed when HC3 was at the age of HC1. The decline in tree species in HC1 as compared to HC3 and the canopy cannot be explained by deer only. It appears be related to a change in land management following the political changes in Romania in 1990. A decline in forest-policing enhanced illegal forest grazing, which is now a common practice. Obviously, separating the effects of grazing and browsing needs further investigation.</p><p>The other important fi nding of this study concerns Germany: the largest effect of browsing was observed in protected areas (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mitchell &amp; Kirby 1990)</ref>. This observation is supported by the repeated grid-based inventories in <ref type="bibr">Hainich National Park (Nationalpark Hainich 2013)</ref> showing the decline of density in non-Fagus species. The core area of the National Park is not being hunted. Our observations question the concept of "letting nature take its course". The high deer population in Germany in general, and in protected areas specifi cally, are anthropogenic: natural predators have been eliminated, while adjacent agricultural land provides an additional source of food. The region is too small for "natural" development.</p><p>The high browsing intensity in Germany is confi rmed by government assessments. In Thuringia, 57% of non-Fagus species are browsed annually (Thüringen Forst 2010). The roe deer population increased by at least 30% between 1980 and 2000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Milner et al. 2006</ref>). The German revolution in the 19 th century and subsequent wars repeatedly created periods of low deer density, favoring tree regeneration and the development of the present species-rich canopies <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Schulze et al. 2010)</ref>. All the investigated forest management systems in Germany, including nature protection, suffer the same effects of deer browsing and tree species losses (see also <ref type="bibr">Reimoser &amp; Gossow1996, Gordon et al. 2004</ref>). Based on our results, the only possble way of mitigation is a change in "the legal framework of" deer management.</p><p>The structural equation modeling explains 11 to 13% of the species loss in Romania and 8 to 26% in Germany, based on freshly browsed terminal buds of the winter season prior to the inventory work. Species loss is based on a single season of freshly affected terminal buds. Considering, that about 10% of the non-Fagus species are lost by browsing of a single season, all non-Fagus species could be lost within 10 years. This is in fact the time to move from HC1 to HC2. Compared to the estimates by the German State Forest administrations, our estimates are still conservative. We did not investigate multiple browsing, but only fresh bites. All Acer individuals show single or multiple browsing marks in Germany, and most of them cannot recover to an extent that they could compete with un-browsed neighbors. Thus, the browsed individuals are eventually lost from the regeneration. Unexpectedly, the number of affected terminal buds was high in Romania, despite relatively low deer populations. Obviously, the effects of grazing by domesticated animals leads to the same effects in Romania, as high deer populations in Germany.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ecosystem consequences of tree diversity losses to other organisms</head><p>Losses of tree species may cause signifi cant cascading effects on other species in deciduous forest ecosystems. These indirect effects are wide-ranging, including songbirds <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allombert et al. 2005)</ref>, wildcat populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lozano et al. 2007</ref>), insect populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brousseau et al. 2013)</ref>, and even belowground communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lessard et al. 2012)</ref>. It is inherently diffi cult to include other organisms in grid-based inventories and therefore ecosystem perspectives have not been suffi ciently recognized in the past. It emerges that the damage caused by excess deer populations goes far beyond the loss of tree species. Here we draw attention to macrolepidoptera <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Walentowski et al. 2010)</ref> assuming that the associated species that are indicated as a loss in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> would in fact be lost at stand scale in the future.</p><p>Macrolepidoptera rely on a special resource or tree species for their development in the caterpillar stage (stenoecic), or they can use a broad spectrum of plants as hosts (euryoecic). The number of these species that can feed on Fagus indicate the importance of non-Fagus species (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). The potential loss of macrolepidoptera due to the loss of a tree species may be calculated as the number feeding on this tree species minus the number of species that can also feed on Fagus. Thus, the following numbers estimate the maximal species loss under the condition that only Fagus survives, which is the case in heavily browsed natureprotected areas of Germany. The number of potentially endangered stenoecic macrolepidoptera species ranges between 8% (Carpinus) and 80.5% (Salix). The total number of species potentially lost in a pure Fagus forest compared to a mixed forest is 537 out of 800 stenoecic species (67% loss). As there are overlaps of host tree species for macrolepidoptera, the effect will be lower for the remaining mixture of species shown in HC3 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. However, the maximum number would represent as much as 55% of the macrolepidoptera of Central Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hacker 1998)</ref>. The present estimate of potentially endangered macrolepidoptera is still incomplete, because Sorbus (other than S. aucuparia), Pyrus and Malus, and which are endangered genera, have not yet been investigated with respect to their butterfl y fauna. Most likely the loss of associated tree species will result in major losses of many additional taxa that are yet to be studied in detail. Similar effects were observed with xylobiontic beetles (45% of the taxa depend on non-Fagus species, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Müller et al. 2005</ref>) and molluscs (44% require non-Fagus species, Thoms 2010). This wide range of organismic groups indicates that the expected effects are indeed disturbing, since plant species diversity emerged as the "back-bone" of the associated diversity of heterotrophic organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Scherber et al. 2010</ref>). Thus, this browsing-induced tree species loss is likely to contribute to a major biodiversity loss across Europe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Legal implications of hunting and management</head><p>Even though we have not studied the legal framework of hunting and forest management, we feel that the current situation has historic roots in feudalistic property rights and it can therefore only be altered by changes in that legal framework. Hunting and grazing versus forest production represents a classic confl ict of forestland rights and interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hellström &amp; Reunala 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">, Niemelä et al. 2005)</ref>. Hunting legislation in most nations of Europe is part of a long-established legal framework of property rights, in which for different reasons the hunting rights have been separated from the attributes of land ownership. That per se is a source of confl ict between landowners and hunting associations. It is frequently assumed that this confl ict also extends to the hunting and biodiversity-conservation interests. However, this assumption should be questioned, and the many nature conservation policies based on non-intervention, as is the case for old-growth forests <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Linder et al. 1997)</ref>, should be re-considered.The main question is whether existing forest and hunting laws are suffi cient to avoid the observed decline in forest species, or, if new policies and legislation are needed.</p><p>A confl ict-centered approach, identifying the drivers and how to manage them <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Nie 2003</ref>), e.g., analysis of the distribution of rights, and enhanced stakeholder and local community involvement, should be preferred to an impactbased approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Niemelä et al. 2005</ref>) through mere legislation changes. However, putting aside the aspects of the property rights that have emerged from feudalistic regimes of the past, it now seems clear that hunters should not be the sole group of people legally allowed to regulate the population of deer. A change to a more pluralistic operation is required, with more rights given to landowners. A recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights opens a path for further changes: the judgment states that the exercise of hunting violates the landowner's right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions (European Court of Human Rights 2012). However, this judgment only encourages landowners to oppose the exercise of hunting; it does not challenge the position of hunters and the State regarding the intensity of hunting. The situation may become worse, if only hunting restrictions and not the regulation of deer populations is a property right.</p><p>Obviously, the situation of browsing affecting ecosystem properties of deciduous forest will only change with a modernization of the legal frameworks for hunting.</p><p>Butterfl y species numbers feeding as caterpillar on various tree species. The data in brackets of the columns with "Total" represent the number of stenoecic species that can only feed on that species.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We observed an increasing dominance of Fagus with stand age in both Romania and Germany. Independently from natural succession, there is an enhancing effect of browsing in both regions, but largest in protected areas in Germany. The apparent enhancement of succession by browsing has its cost, namely to distort community dynamics at early stages of stand development. Browsing eliminates a major portion of species at regional scale. Browsing intensity was six times higher in Germany than in Romania, irrespective of palatability, presumably due to the different levels of ungulate populations. The loss of species in Romania was possibly also associated with illegal grazing. Browsing had a more consistent effects on tree species losses than light. Management had minor effects.</p><p>The use of a grid-based inventory is proposed as an alternative method to fencing experiments for the detection of browsing. The boundary line method used here quantifi es the maximum possible and achievable tree diversity under all combinations of stand age, canopy opening, and management.</p><p>In Germany, all the investigated forest management systems, even the protected nature reserves, suffer from deer browsing. The only possible way of mitigation is a change in deer management. This appears possible only by a change of the legal framework on hunting. The result of our extensive analysis of &gt;6,500 plots provides evidence that the loss of tree species in tree regeneration and across succession is likely to have major consequences for other organisms (e.g. macrolepidoptera).</p><p>The present hunting practices that support overabundant ungulate populations constitute a major threat to the biodiversity of deciduous forests in Germany and Romania and to other places with similar ungulate management.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 2</figDesc><graphic coords="10,130.85,99.49,337.63,401.65" type="bitmap" /></figure>
