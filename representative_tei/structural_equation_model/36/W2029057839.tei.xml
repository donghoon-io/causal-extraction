<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Charity sport events provide charitable organizations with a mechanism to communicate the mission of the charity to a large participant base, while fostering a meaningful event experience for event participants. This research examines the relationship among motives for charity sport event participation, participant belief in making a difference and attachment to the event. In making this examination, an online questionnaire was administered to participants in the 2007 Lance Armstrong Foundation (LAF) LIVESTRONG Challenge (N=568). Through structural equation modeling, the results demonstrate that belief in making a difference mediates the relationship between social and charity motives and attachment. Suggestions are made for marketing communication highlighting belief in making a difference via rituals, symbols, and social media to assist in attracting and retaining participants.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In 2009, charitable giving in the United States equaled $303.75US billion; 75% ($227US billion) of which came from private donations (Giving USA Foundation, 2010).</p><p>Further, over 50% of the population of Western Europe donated money to charity, while over one third of the Australian population donated time to charitable organizations <ref type="bibr">(Charities Aid Foundation, 2010)</ref>. Despite these positive statistics, nonprofit charitable organizations are confronted by challenges in raising funds to sustain their operations.</p><p>These challenges include: the global economic recession, increased competition among charities <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sargeant, 1999)</ref>, increased donor attrition <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Sargeant &amp; Woodliffe, 2007)</ref>, and waning government support <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hibbert &amp; Horne, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Nonprofit organizations increasingly rely on building relationships with donors <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Merchant, Ford &amp; Sargeant, 2010)</ref> and utilizing innovative marketing strategies to attract charitable participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kirchner, Markowski, &amp; Ford, 2007)</ref>. Hosting a charity sport event, an event where a participant raises funds and then engages in physical activity on behalf of the charity, is one strategy gaining popularity among charities <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ruperto &amp; Kerr, 2009)</ref>. Charity sport events allow participants to satisfy a variety of motives related to both the sport and recreation aspects of the event such as social, physical, and escape, in combination with motives for charitable giving <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Filo, Funk, &amp; O'Brien, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Taylor &amp; Shanka, 2008)</ref>. Recent research has found that individuals can derive considerable meaning from an event which can result in a felt attachment to the event <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Filo, Funk, &amp; O'Brien, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Sport Events and Making a Difference 4 Charity sport events have emerged as viable fundraising mechanisms for charitable organizations. Beyond fundraising, additional objectives of these events include: raising awareness for a cause, encouraging community engagement, building sponsor relationships, and generating publicity for the charity <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ruperto &amp; Kerr, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Within the research on these alternative fundraising mechanisms, a variety of terms have been used to identify the events. These terms include charity sport events, charityaffiliated sporting events, physical activity events, cause-related events, community events, participant sport events, and special events (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bennett, Mousley, Kitchin, &amp; Ali-Choudhury, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Filo et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Higgins &amp; Hodgins, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Higgins &amp; Lauzon, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Scott &amp; Solomon, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Taylor &amp; Shanka, 2008)</ref>. For the purposes of this research, the term charity sport event will be used to refer to an event requiring a registered participant to raise funds and complete physical activity with at least a portion of proceeds benefiting a designated charity.</p><p>With an increase in the number of charity sport events, organizers must now differentiate their event from competing events to attract participants and reach fundraising goals. Beyond communicating the motives that can be satisfied through participation, charity sport event managers must showcase other factors that distinguish the event and contribute to the creation of a meaningful event experience. One way charitable organizations may be able to accomplish this is through the communication and reinforcement of the belief that individuals can make a difference beyond raising funds through participation.</p><p>Research has noted that individuals can be motivated by the belief that they are 'making a difference' <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Francois, 2007)</ref>. Specifically, Francois posits that workers are motivated by the belief that they are making a difference and that such a belief may lead the individuals to donate their labor to that organization. While the focus of the current research is not concerned with labor per se, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Duncan (1999)</ref> notes that donations of efforts are conceptually similar to monetary donations. Individuals may make monetary donations, or donations of time and effort if they believe their efforts are making a difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Francois, 2007)</ref>. Similarly, the role of the organization's commitment to the output produced is viewed as a central concern in eliciting donations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bilodeau &amp; Slivinski, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Glazer, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Various nonprofit and charitable organizations include statements about making a difference in their marketing communications, and often try to communicate to participants post-campaign that the goals and objectives were met. Further, these communications often highlight profiles of individuals that have been helped by the fundraising of such campaigns with the goal of convincing donors and participants that their efforts have, in fact, made a difference.</p><p>Concurrently, consumers are placing greater importance on the need for belonging and self-realization while material wealth is becoming less important <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Pringle &amp; Thompson, 1999)</ref>. This pronounced shift in consumer attitude has placed greater emphasis on alignment with products and services that provide meaning and fulfillment <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ebenkamp &amp; Stark, 1999)</ref>. Further, the act of giving and helping others has been linked with feelings of happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(McGowan, 2006)</ref>. Charity sport events in particular, provide participants with a meaningful experience, and the act of giving and helping others represents an important component of that meaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Filo et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sport Events and Making a Difference 6</head><p>Reinforcing belief in making a difference through participation represents an objective that can be achieved through charity sport events. Enhancing the belief in making a difference may further contribute to the meaning participants derive from the event and thus result in increased attachment to the event and associated charity. An increased sense of attachment may, in turn, strengthen participants' positive attitudes and supportive behaviors toward the event including increased likelihood of repeat participation, more positive attitudes towards event sponsors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Filo, Funk, &amp; O'Brien, 2010)</ref>, as well as positive word of mouth <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Funk &amp; James, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The purpose of this research is to examine the relationships among motives for charity sport event participation, belief in making a difference, and attachment to a charity sport event. Specifically, this paper investigates how social, physical, escape, and charity motives, along with belief in making a difference, contribute to attachment to a charity sport event. In making this examination, the current research extends the findings of existing research in the charity sport event context by building on what we know about motives that drive participation in charity sport events <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Taylor &amp; Shanka, 2008)</ref> as well as the factors that contribute to attachment to the event <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Filo et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Filo et al., , 2009))</ref>. The current research introduces the concept of belief in making a difference, as a factor that may influence the relationship between motives and attachment. Accordingly, the contribution of this research is a quantitative investigation of how belief in making a difference impacts attachment to a charity sport event.</p><p>The 2007 Lance Armstrong Foundation (LAF) LIVESTRONG Challenge serves as the research context. This event represents an established charity sport event with an emphasis on the mission of the charitable organization throughout event marketing Sport Events and Making a Difference 7 communication. The manuscript encompasses the following sections: First, the theoretical framework employed to examine motivation, belief in making a difference, and attachment to charity sport events is introduced. Next, the method is described and the results are relayed. The paper utilizes structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze survey data gathered from participants in this event. Finally, an overall discussion of findings highlights marketing and theoretical implications, along with directions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Framework</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Psychological Continuum Model</head><p>The current research employs the Psychological Continuum Model (PCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Funk &amp; James, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">2006)</ref> to guide the investigation of the relationship between motives, belief in making a difference, and attachment to a charity sport event. The PCM advances processes that operate within and among four stages: awareness, attraction, attachment, and allegiance. The awareness process involves various socializing agents such as the media, peers and family serving as environmental inputs introducing a charity sport event to an individual, thus leading to the realization that the event is taking place.</p><p>From there, awareness outcomes combine with external inputs including environmental forces such as event marketing communication, as well as internal inputs such as individual perceptions of motives satisfied through participation. The interaction among these perceived needs and motives, along with the knowledge of the charity sport event's existence, evolves into attraction outcomes. Attraction outcomes include a preference for the event fostered through participation in the event.</p><p>Next, the satisfaction of motives achieved through behavioral engagement in the charity sport event interacts with the individual's self-concept and values. Collectively, the interaction among motives, values, and self-concept represents the attachment process and results in specific outcomes. These outcomes are embodied in stronger attitudes and a more meaningful connection towards the charity sport event revealed through emotional, symbolic, and functional meaning held for the charity sport event. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Funk and James (2006)</ref> suggest that attitudes and connection may form, grow stronger, and feed back into the attachment process, facilitating allegiance, or commitment to the charity sport event. Considering these favorable outcomes and an increasingly competitive environment, charity sport event managers are well served to work to enhance participants' attachment to the event. Thus, the current research focuses specifically on attachment within the PCM framework. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Funk and James (2006)</ref> suggest that attachment to a sport object is revealed through the object taking on emotional, symbolic, and/or functional meaning for the individual. Sport objects can provide individuals with a sense of attachment <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Trail, Anderson, &amp; Fink, 2000)</ref> and this can be based upon a variety of different aspects of the object <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Robinson &amp; Trail, 2005)</ref>. Meanwhile, the attitude strength inherent to attachment can influence behavioral intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alexandris, Funk, &amp; Pritchard, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Funk, Haugtvedt, &amp; Howard, 2000)</ref>. For the purposes of this research, attachment to a charity sport event is conceptualized as emotional, symbolic and functional meaning derived from a charity sport event among participants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Funk and James' (2006)</ref> discussion of attachment highlights the importance of motives for sport and recreation participation as factors contributing to attachment. They suggest that motives reflect hedonic motives and dispositional needs that an individual satisfies through charity sport event participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Funk &amp; James, 2001)</ref>. Motivation in the context of charity sport events is reviewed next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Charity Sport Events Motives</head><p>Charity sport events appeal to a variety of market segments based upon an individual participant's identification with both the charity and sport <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Peloza &amp; Hassay, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Scott &amp; Solomon, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wood, Snelgrove, &amp; Danylchuk, 2010)</ref>. A number of specific motives have been uncovered which explain charity sport event participation.</p><p>While each of these motives serves to satisfy needs, they can be broadly categorized as being either recreation-based or charity-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bennett et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Webber, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Recreation-based motives include (1) the desire to socialize with others to expand one's knowledge base (2) the pursuit of a physical challenge, and (3) the desire to escape one's everyday routine <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Taylor &amp; Shanka, 2008)</ref>. Individuals driven to participate by charitybased motivation seek to satisfy the desire to help others <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bennett et al., 2007)</ref>. For the purposes of this research, motives for charity sport event participation can be defined as recreation-based and charity-based needs fulfilled through charity sport event participation.</p><p>In a qualitative examination of charity sport event participation, <ref type="bibr">Filo and colleagues (2008)</ref> uncovered both recreation-based and charity-based motives, and determined that an interaction occurs among the charitable component and select recreation motives leading to attachment to a charity sport event. Specifically, the authors revealed that motives such as physical and social took on enhanced meaning in the charity sport event context. The social component of the event was depicted as an opportunity to talk to others about their experience with, and connection to, the fight against cancer. Meanwhile, the physical challenge inherent to the event was described in terms of the challenges faced by cancer survivors. The enhanced meaning held for these motives contributed to attachment to the event.</p><p>Recreation and charity-based motives were then assessed quantitatively and found to contribute to attachment to a charity sport event <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Filo et al., 2010)</ref>. The current research seeks to further test these findings through an examination of the antecedents of attachment to a charity sport event. Specifically, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Social, physical, escape, and charity motives will contribute positively to attachment to a charity sport event.</p><p>The contribution of motives may only represent part of the picture of understanding attachment to a charity sport event. As noted above, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Funk and James (2006)</ref> suggest that motives interact with an individual's self-concept and values, leading to attachment to a sport object. Furthermore, personal and psychological forces can increase attachment and these forces may reflect an evaluative outcome encompassing an individual's beliefs and feelings towards the object <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Funk, 2008)</ref>. In the charity sport event context, an individual's belief in making a difference through charity sport event participation may reflect this evaluative outcome.</p><p>Research has demonstrated that an individual is motivated to take action on behalf of a charitable cause and make a difference based upon three beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref>. First, the belief that making a difference will personally impact the individual is necessary. Second, the belief that a difference can actually be made must exist. Third, the individual must believe that involvement within a particular social context will result Sport Events and Making a Difference 11 in making a difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000)</ref>. Charity sport events provide a context in which individuals develop and reaffirm the belief that a difference can be made. Accordingly, belief in making a difference is conceptualized here as an evaluative process reflecting a charity sport event participant's beliefs and feelings towards the charitable initiatives of the event.</p><p>As an individual's psychological connection with an object strengthens, their evaluation may become more salient and accessible. This salience and accessibility can be formed by gaining knowledge about the event, psychological rewards derived from the event, and direct experience with the event (i.e., participation). Consequently, the motives satisfied through charity sport event participation may contribute to belief in making a difference. This introduces the second hypothesis advanced within this research:</p><p>Hypothesis 2: Social, physical, escape, and charity motives will contribute positively to belief in making a difference through charity sport event participation.</p><p>Finally, in the charity sport context, belief in making a difference may strengthen the outcomes associated with each stage within the PCM framework. For example, if an individual believes their participation in a charity sport event will truly make a difference then that individual will likely be more attracted to participate in the event and potentially become attached to the event. Hence, it is predicted that this evaluative outcome will mediate an individual's attachment with the charity sport event. Mediation advances that independent variables contribute to the mediating variable, which in turn contributes to Sport Events and Making a Difference 12 the dependent variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986)</ref>. This introduces the third and final hypothesis:</p><p>Hypothesis 3: Belief in making a difference through charity sport event participation will mediate the relationship between social, physical, escape, and charity motives and attachment.</p><p>Quantitative data were collected to address the three hypotheses advanced within this research. The current research utilizes structural equation modeling to test the relationships among social, physical, escape, and charity motives, belief in making a difference, and attachment to the charity sport event. The sample of participants ranged in age from 18 to 70 with 46.3% between the ages of 40-64. Thirty-five percent had obtained at least a Bachelor's Degree, and 74.6% selected White as their ethnicity. Event organizers indicated the event's participant base reflected a 60/40 male/female ratio, and participants were mostly white, affluent, and computer-savvy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>The online questionnaire included scales to assess various motives for participating in the event, belief in making a difference, as well as participant attachment to the event. Participants were given a multi-attribute questionnaire comprised of (a) four items to measure social motivation, (b) two items to measure physical motivation, (c) two items to measure escape motivation, (d) three items to measure charity motivation and (e) six items to measure attachment to the event <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Beard &amp; Ragheb, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dawson, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gladden, Mahony, &amp; Apostolopoulou, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Funk &amp; James, 2006)</ref>. Three items from the research of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Deci and Ryan (1985)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Ryan and Deci (2000)</ref> were adapted in consultation with the LAF research team, and employed to measure Belief in Making a Difference. All items were measured on seven-point Likert-scales (anchored by 1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). Each item is listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. A brief battery of demographic questions was also included in the questionnaire. This did not include gender.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>To test the hypotheses advanced within this research, the following steps were employed. First, to assess the measurement of the different constructs, mean scores were calculated and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was run to confirm the validity of the Sport Events and Making a Difference 14 measures. Convergent validity was examined by calculating average variance extracted (AVE) for each latent construct and discriminant validity was assessed by examining the correlations between the latent constructs. Further, reliability was examined through assessing the coefficient alpha and composite reliability of each construct.</p><p>Next, structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to test the effect of social, physical, escape, and charity motives on attachment and belief in making a difference (Hypothesis 1 and 2), as well as the mediating effect of belief in making a difference on the relationship between the motives and attachment (Hypothesis 3) (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Iacobucci, Saldanha, &amp; Deng, 2007)</ref>. The measured constructs were modeled based upon the relationships advanced in the theoretical framework. Within the model, direct and indirect paths were fit simultaneously to estimate effects across the constructs.</p><p>Finally, a z-test was computed to assess mediation through testing the relative size of the direct and indirect paths. Significant paths found within the structural equation model were used to test hypotheses 1 and 2, while the mediation advanced within hypothesis 3 was assessed via the z-test. According to Iabuccci and colleagues, if the ztest is significant, and the direct path between the latent and outcome variables is not significant, then full mediation exists. If the both the z-test and the direct path between the latent and outcome variables are significant, then the mediation is deemed partial. In assessing the structural equation model, fit was tested through select fit indices: CFI, IFI, NFI, GFI, and RMSEA. The results derived from these data analyses are presented next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The means and standard deviations of the latent constructs were calculated first, and are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The mean scores for each construct ranged from M = 4.49 Sport Events and Making a Difference 15 (Belief in Making a Difference) to M = 6.00 (Physical). Next, the 21 items representing six latent variables were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using LISREL 8.8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gerbing &amp; Anderson, 1988)</ref>. As predicted, all items loaded correctly on their a priori hypothesized factors; factor loadings were all above 0.6 (all but three were above 0.7).</p><p>According to the model fit statistics the measurement model fit the data satisfactorily (CFI =.97, IFI = .97, NFI =.96, GFI = .89, RMSEA = .079) as all fit indices exceed the commonly suggested thresholds <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, &amp; Tatham, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>From there, internal consistency was examined. Cronbach's alphas were above the .70 level recommended by <ref type="bibr">Nunnally (1978)</ref> for each construct except charity (α =.66). Reliability was also assessed by calculating composite reliabilitiesall were well above the .70 recommended level <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bagozzi, 1993)</ref> ranging from .86 to .98 (charity =.86).</p><p>Collectively, these two approaches for assessing internal consistency suggest that the measures are, in fact, reliable. Convergent validity was then assessed by calculating the average variance extracted (AVE) of each latent construct. All AVEs exceeded the recommended threshold of .50 (ranging from .54 to .90) providing evidence of convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>. The standardized factor loadings of each item, as well as the Cronbach alphas, composite reliabilities, and average variance extracted for each latent variable can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Finally, evidence of discriminant validity is provided by the fact that all inter-correlations are less than the .85 threshold suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kline (1998)</ref>. The correlations among the latent variables can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>- <ref type="figure">----------------------------------------------</ref>Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2 about here</ref> To test the hypotheses a structural model was estimated using LISREL 8.8 with maximum likelihood estimation. The results of this estimation can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, and the structural equation model is displayed in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Significant paths are present from social motives to attachment (standardized coefficient = .31, t = 4.58) and from charity motives to attachment (standardized coefficient = .34, t = 7.23). Hypothesis 1 advanced that social, physical, escape and charity motives would contribute to attachment to a charity sport event. Results revealed a significant path between the social and charity motives and attachment. However, the path between physical motivation and attachment was not significant, nor was the path between escape and attachment. This finding provides partial support for hypothesis 1.</p><p>Significant paths were found between social motives and belief in making a difference (standardized coefficient = .35, t = 5.24) and from charity motives to belief in making a difference (standardized coefficient = .35, t = 8.04). Hypothesis 2 suggested that social, physical, escape and charity motives contribute to an individual's belief in making a difference through their charity sport event participation. The results demonstrated a significant relationship exists among the social and charity motive and belief in making a difference. The path between physical motives and belief in making a difference was insignificant, as was the path between escape and belief in making a difference. These results provide partial support for hypothesis 2.</p><p>Finally, the model estimation yielded a significant path from belief in making a difference to attachment (standardized coefficient = .29, t = 6.11). In accordance with <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Iacobucci et al. (2007)</ref> a z-test assessing the indirect effect of social motives on Sport Events and Making a Difference 17 attachment was calculated. The significant z-test (z=3.98, p &lt; .01) indicates that belief in making a difference partially mediates the relationship between social motives and attachment. A z-test assessing the indirect effect of charity motivation on attachment was also calculated. Again, the significant z-test (z = 4.86, p &lt; .01) indicates that belief in making a difference partially mediates the relationship between charity motives and attachment. Hypothesis 3 advanced belief in making a difference as a mediator between social, physical, escape, and charity motives and attachment. The analysis revealed that belief in making a difference mediates the relationship between social and charity motives and attachment, but not between physical and escape and attachment, providing partial support for hypothesis 3. The fit indices for the overall path model provide evidence of sufficient model fit (CFI =.97, IFI = .97, NFI =.96, GFI = .90, RMSEA = .076).</p><p>- <ref type="figure">----------------------------------</ref>Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> about here <ref type="figure">----------------------------------------------------------------------</ref>Insert Figure <ref type="figure">1 about here   ----------------------------------</ref>-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The results introduce a number of findings consistent with existing literature in the charity sport event context. The impact of social and charity motives on attachment to the event underscores the importance of a connection to both sport and charity among charity sport event participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Peloza &amp; Hassay, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Scott &amp; Solomon, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wood et al., 2010)</ref>. In addition, the relationship between social motives and charity motives and attachment supports the notion that charity sport events can represent a meaningful experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cornwell &amp; Smith, 2001)</ref>. The results show that neither physical motives nor escape motives lead to belief in making a difference, or attachment. It is conceivable that an individual motivated to participate in a charity sport event by the physical aspect, or the opportunity to escape his or her everyday routine, may not be particularly attached to the event. Previous research in the charity sport event context has questioned the contribution of the escape motive to attachment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Filo et al., 2008)</ref>. In light of this, it is not surprising that the physical and escape motives do not lead to belief in making a difference or attachment.</p><p>The contribution of the social motives and charity motives to belief in making a difference suggests that belief in making a difference is highlighted and reinforced through charity sport event participation. This aligns with the notion that charity sport events can achieve objectives beyond fundraising <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ruperto &amp; Kerr, 2009)</ref>. The significant relationship between the social and charity motives and attachment, as well as belief in making a difference and attachment supports the idea that an individual becomes attached to an object based upon different aspects of the object <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Robinson &amp; Trail, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, the contribution of both the social and charity motives, along with the belief in making a difference, confirms Funk and James' (2006) assertion that attachment is an outcome driven by factors beyond motives. Moreover, the mediating role of belief in making a difference in predicting attachment to a charity sport event provides empirical support for <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Funk's (2008)</ref> contention that an evaluative outcome representing an individual's beliefs and feelings towards an object strengthens the outcomes. In the case of the current research, belief in making a difference reflects an evaluative outcome that predicts a stronger attachment to a charity sport event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Marketing Implications</head><p>The findings of this research introduce a number of implications for those who manage and market events. To strengthen individuals' attachment to the event, marketers must work to reinforce the belief that these individuals are making a difference through their participation in the event. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Reddin and Sonn (2003)</ref> suggest symbols and rituals can reinforce an individual's emotional connection to an object. Event marketers can utilize symbols through the development of event merchandise emphasizing the social change outcomes of the event. T-shirts, hats, and posters that include messaging highlighting the difference made through participation can be sold to participants before, during, and after the event. In addition, rituals can be integrated into the event showcasing the impact that the event has on the related cause. Gatherings such as early bird registration parties, ceremonies prior to the start of the event, and post-event parties can be used to communicate goals in advance of the event; achievement of those goals; and objectives for future events. Symbols and rituals can contribute to the development of moral responsibility within communities, and, in turn, commitment to a charity's calls to action <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hassay &amp; Peloza 2009)</ref>. Through developing and reinforcing belief in making a difference among event participants, event organizers can further facilitate attachment.</p><p>Second, social media can be utilized to reinforce the social aspect of charity sport events, while also enhancing participants' belief in making a difference before and after the event. Organizations can attract consumer response to social media activity by engaging and leading users via the provision of compelling content <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bennett, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Sport Events and Making a Difference 20 Social media technologies can communicate needs in advance of the event, while also providing a mechanism to thank participants following the event and communicate the outcomes achieved. Online viral videos featuring constituents of the charitable organization describing the importance of the charity and the event could be an effective means to create a narrative within event marketing communication.</p><p>Third, the link between social motives and belief in making a difference suggests that the strength of the collective among participants may reinforce participant belief in impacting change through the event. Event managers can leverage the relationship between socializing and belief in making a difference by facilitating the development of networks among participants. Social networks can facilitate the flow of information and communicate opportunities to individuals, while enhancing social capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lin, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Event marketers can develop promotions for social networks at the event, as well as activities for networks in the aftermath of the event. These promotions can include registration and sign up opportunities for small groups to volunteer or join committees within the charitable organization, as well as join lobbying efforts on behalf of the charity. In addition, small group training programs and teams can be facilitated by event managers to allow participants to sustain their physical activity following the event alongside individuals who share the connection to the charity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Directions</head><p>The current study examined a set of motives based on prior research that were thought to influence belief in making a difference and attachment. A number of further studies are warranted based upon the findings of this research. Further qualitative and quantitative work can refine the scales employed to assess belief in making a difference.</p><p>Qualitative research can further define what qualifies as making a difference. Subjectivity may exist among participants as to how they are successfully making a difference (e.g., awareness, fundraising, advocacy, participation) Focus groups may provide an effective means to solicit these opinions.</p><p>In addition, longitudinal data can be collected to track sustained participant engagement with the charity following the event. It may also be useful to examine similarities and differences among sub-groups who participate in these events based on level of physical activity. For example, the current study included those participating in the LAF event as a whole, thus combining those who were participating in a 10-mile cycling ride with those who were participating in a 100-mile cycling ride. Similarly, individuals who participate in a variety of charity sport events can be compared with individuals who participate in a select few events to account for differences that may exist in the factors contributing to attachment based upon experience and history with these events. Possible differences between the motives for participation, the level of attachment to the event, as well as the collective belief in making a difference among each segment should be assessed.</p><p>The current study focused on an event and charity that are quite well-known and successful, while many smaller charity sport events exist. It may be useful to examine attachment to the event and charity, and how individuals believe they can make a difference through smaller, lesser-known events. Further, this research focused exclusively on event participants. However, charity sport events rely upon a dedicated volunteer force, while encouraging friends and family of participants to attend as spectators. An investigation of belief in making a difference among volunteers and spectators could assist event marketers in tailoring communication to different event stakeholders. Effective marketing communication to volunteers and spectators could not only assist in the achievement of social change objectives, but could also enhance event sustainability. Event sponsors represent an additional event stakeholder worthy of examination. Qualitative data could be collected to investigate the relationship between the charity and corporate partners to evaluate belief in making a difference among these event stakeholders.</p><p>Finally, further research can explore whether charity sport event participation promotes increased charitable activity in general among participants. Belief in making a difference among participants may transcend the designated benefitting charity for a specific event. Participants may be inspired to engage with a variety of other charitable endeavors as a result of a charity sport event. Research can examine whether this occurs, as well as how participants get involved with other charities (i.e., fundraising, advocacy, volunteering). Finally, future research should investigate whether the same relationship holds true for non-sport charity events such as Shave for a Cure and the MS Read-A-Thon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This research reveals belief in making a difference as an evaluative outcome among participants mediating the relationship between motives and attachment to a charity sport event. Specifically, social motives and charity motives contribute to a participant's belief in making a difference which, in turn, contributes to a participant's attachment to the event. Event marketers can utilize a number of resources to reinforce belief in making a difference to attract and retain participants. It is hoped that this research serves as a starting point for further investigation of the social change-based initiatives of charity sport events.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>An online questionnaire was administered to participants in the 2007 LAF LIVESTRONG Challenge in Austin, Texas. The LIVESTRONG Challenge is the LAF's signature fundraising event, with all proceeds benefiting the LAF's mission to support individuals living with cancer. Participants in the LIVESTRONG Challenge were required to pay a $50 registration fee along with meeting a $200 fundraising minimum. The LIVESTRONG Challenge provides participants with the choice of a 5K walk or run, a 10K run, a 10-, 40-, 70-, or a 100-mile cycling ride. An e-mail including a link to an online questionnaire was distributed to 4,000 registered participants by a representative from the LAF. The e-mail was sent one day following the event in October 2007, and the questionnaire was made available for 12 days after the event. The</figDesc></figure>
