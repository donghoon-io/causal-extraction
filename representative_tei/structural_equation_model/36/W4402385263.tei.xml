<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The attitude-behavior nexus has long intrigued social scientists <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975)</ref>. It played a key role in the development of the contingent valuation method in economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mitchell and Carson, 1989)</ref> and the possible divergence between attitude and behavior is implicit in critiques of stated preference methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kahneman and Knetsch, 1992)</ref>. Examples emerged in various disciplines of divergences between attitudes and behavior that were intuitive and easy to grasp, such as the difference between ex ante desired gym visits and ex post gym visits <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(DellaVigna and Malmendier, 2006)</ref>. Stylized experiments pointed to much deeper implications of the attitude-behavior divergence, like social norms of fairness as a constraint on setting prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kahneman et al., 1986)</ref> or the role of assigned property rights on willingness to trade <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kahneman et al., 1990)</ref>. However, until the advent of behavioral economics, most economists did not pay much attention to understanding situations where stated preferences and revealed behavior conflict. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>In this paper, we examine an example of the divergence between attitudes and behavior that has received an enormous amount of attentionthe difference between the American public's support for facemask mandates and their actual facemask use behavior. Facemask mandates in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic sought to get people to wear facemasks to reduce COVID-19 transmission rates in a desperate effort to "flatten" the pandemic's projected U.S. trajectory. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> The fear was that without widespread facemask use, COVID cases would overwhelm the existing US hospital capacity, leading to an unnecessarily high number of COVID-related deaths.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> summarizes this policy context. It shows that without individuals taking protective measures to reduce transmission like curtailing travel, social distancing, and wearing facemasks the number of positive cases would rise until the fraction of the population previously infected started to slow COVID-19's spread. Initial estimates of COVID-19's R0 (around 2.5) suggested that herd immunity (under a uniform population mixing assumption) would be realized with about 60% of the U.S. population infected. The strong implication here was that measures to reduce the rate of COVID-19 transmission did not need to be perfect to help flatten the curve. Specifically, the entire US population did not need to wear facemasks for a facemask policy to be effective. The more effective efforts to reduce transmission were: (1) the greater the likelihood of preventing "excess" deaths due to overrunning health care capacity, (2) the greater the ability to expand relevant health care bottlenecks and develop effective treatments over the medium term, and (3) the greater the time available to design, manufacture, and deploy a vaccine.</p><p>In 2020 we designed a survey to explore, among other things, the divergence between respondents' attitudes about facemask mandates and their individual behavior with respect to facemask use. YouGov implemented the online survey between August 28 and September 29, 2020. In September 2020 political views of the US population on COVID-19 and measures to reduce transmission had just started to diverge. In particular, many supporters of the Republican Party started to see the federal government and public reaction to COVID-19 as overblown. They believed the disease was less serious, that closures of businesses and schools were highly damaging to the economy, and transmission reduction measures were either ineffective or unneeded. Facemask mandates started to be seen as an infringement on personal freedom, although less so at the time of our survey than by the November 2020 Biden-Trump 2020 presidential election.</p><p>We use a generalized structural equation modeling (GSEM) approach to explore the factors influencing respondents' attitudes toward facemask mandates and their actual use of facemask. We show the factors that explain which of four attitude-behavior groups a respondent falls into: (1) wear a facemask and support facemask mandates (Group A), (2) wear a facemask and oppose facemask mandates (Group B); do not wear a facemask but support facemask mandates (Group C); and do not wear a facemask and do not support facemask mandates (Group D). Our categorization of the public into these four groups has close ties to several core economic concepts starting with how status quo property rights are defined and the potential of the pandemic to alter property rights perceptions. Aspects of altruism, free riding and information come into play.</p><p>Our use of the GSEM approach allows us to produce a much richer picture of how these four attitude-behavior combinations are characterized by a broad set of predictors. The model, which is well-fit by our data, posits three broad sets of covariates influencing the multinomial categorization variable. This multinomial categorization variable is cast as the observed outcome of the attitude-behavior typology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fishbein and Ajzen (1975)</ref>.</p><p>The GSEM results, implemented using an initial confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach, examine the roles of each of the three latent variables in influencing the possibility of not supporting the mask mandate and not wearing face masks. The GSEM analysis provides a detailed description of how three latent factors interact with the four distinct groups and in turn how a set of observable covariates explain systematic variation in the latent factors. The analysis highlights the importance of developing more advanced methods to better understand the forces influencing compliance with a policy objective like facemask adherence. The findings offer valuable insights into the complex dynamics at play in policy implementation and emphasize the necessity for more nuanced implementation strategies for policies such as facemask mandates.</p><p>In Section 2, we present a summary of the literature on the factors that predict facemask use. Section 3 describes our survey data. Section 4 presents our conceptual approach, and Section 5 describes the empirical modeling strategy. Section 6 presents the results and the Section 7 offers a concluding discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>This paper draws upon several distinct literatures. The first is a large set of papers that try to explain/predict who is wearing a facemask. This is also our objective, but from a deeper level where the predictors identified in our analysis become candidates for driving differences in a set of latent factors to which we have assigned labels like "COVID-19 knowledge". Our purpose is to gain an understanding of how these latent factors come together to drive respondents into the four groups defined above. Here we point to some of the key literature on structural equation modeling, noting some of its advantages from the perspective of our objectives.</p><p>The "generalized" nature of the GSEM approach is important because our application utilizes a multinomial response variable rather than the usual continuous response. We briefly review this literature with an eye toward some subtle distinctions. In particular, our attitude measure takes the form of a policy preference question on mask mandates, which does not have a straightforward behavioral intentions interpretation that characterizes much of this literature.</p><p>Numerous scholars have conducted studies to look at people who were or were not wearing facemasks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Haischer et al. (2020)</ref> found demographic features of those who wear face masks. By observing shoppers entering retail stores, they concluded that the aged, female, and urban shoppers were more likely to wear face masks and that wearing face masks increased after a facemask mandate was adopted. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Galasso et al. (2020)</ref> also point out the importance of gender. Women perceive the risks of the pandemic as more serious than men. Hence, they are more likely to comply with facemask mandates. In addition to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Haischer et al. (2020)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Knotek et al. (2020)</ref> also emphasized the impact of age. In their survey older respondents were more likely to report that they wear face masks. This is consistent with the higher rate of mortality among older people than for younger people.</p><p>Political partisanship, measured either by reported ideological beliefs or support for Donald Trump, suggests that being politically liberal or not supporting Trump, was also a strong predictor <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kahane, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kerr et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Milosh et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Young et al., 2022)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kahane (2021)</ref> compares facemask use in counties supporting Trump and counties not supporting him during the 2016 presidential election. People were less likely to wear facemasks in counties that more strongly supported Trump. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kerr et al. (2021)</ref> also find that progressives were more likely to wear face masks than conservatives. Progressives had more trust in medical experts and organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), but had less trust in Trump administration officials during the COVID pandemic. Progressives tended to perceive the pandemic as a very serious public health problem, while conservatives are much less likely to. Using multiple machine learning approaches, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Milosh et al. (2021)</ref> found that political partisanship was the strongest predictor of wearing face masks.</p><p>Another influence on the attitude-behavior divergence for facemasks was religion. Evangelicals, in particular, were more likely not to get vaccinated, to be politically conservative, and to not wear facemasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Guidry et al., 2022)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">DeMora et al. (2021)</ref> found that evangelicals were less likely to use and support facemasks. Based on their interpretation of biblical scripture, evangelicals often support men playing a dominant role in household decision-making. The strong male-dominant gender role leads them to identify with the Republican Party <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brint and Abrutyn, 2010)</ref>. Another influence on the attitudebehavior divergence is that President Donald Trump repeatedly emphasized China as a source of the virus, and tended to blame China, its main geopolitical rivalry, for the pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Shurafa et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>A number of researchers such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gray et al. (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ning et al. (2020)</ref> have focused on the role of knowledge about COVID-19 in predicting who wears a facemask. Belief in the effectiveness of wearing face masks significantly influenced the behavior of individuals regarding wearing face masks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gray et al. (2020)</ref> conducted an online survey in New Zealand. People who self-reported that wearing masking measures were "somewhat" or "very" effective were more likely to say that they wear face masks than those who believed that wearing masks was "not at all" effective in preventing the COVID infection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Knotek et al. (2020)</ref> also found that respondents who believe that wearing face masks was effective in reducing the spread of COVID were much more likely to wear face masks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ning et al. (2020)</ref> studied the relationship in China between knowledge, risk perception, emotional response, official communication, and protective behaviors such as wearing face masks, refreshing indoor air, and avoiding crowds. Knowledge was hypothesized to positively affect people's belief in the effectiveness of protective behaviors. Hence, having knowledge about COVID-19 enables people to prevent COVID infection. Perceived risk was hypothesized to stimulate people to change their behaviors in order to avoid the potential risk. During the uncertain pandemic situation, people felt anxiety and stress. These negative emotions would exacerbate perceived risk and strengthen the protective behaviors. Information was hypothesized to play a vital role in forming knowledge and affecting people's attitudes. Thus, whether people receive information about COVID-19 will influence their knowledge and their attitudes and behavior. Their conclusions show that greater knowledge of COVID-19 was associated with high perceived risk, high negative emotions, and more attention to the governmental media, as well as being more likely to adopt protective behaviors.</p><p>The literature referenced above focuses on the binary indicator variable of wearing or not wearing a facemask. The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kim et al. (2022)</ref> reveals the divergence in the US population between facemask attitudes and behavior using the device of a 2 Â 2 crosstabulation of a respondent wearing a facemask with their support of a requirement that masks be worn. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> displays Kim et al.'s results for this crosstab based on the nationally representative sample of 4000 US respondents that we will use in this paper. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">3</ref>The main diagonal cells are (A) consistent supporters (supporting/wearing) and (D) consistent opponents (not supporting/not wearing), where the consistency is with respect to the expressed attitude and reported behavior.</p><p>However, there was a divergence between attitudes and behavior among respondents in the off-diagonal cells (B) and (C). A sizeable fraction of respondents (B) were opposed to the health officials requiring facemasks but nonetheless the respondents were wearing them. These individuals can be thought of as "compliant opponents". Group (C) respondents were not currently wearing facemasks but supported a requirement that facemask use be mandatory. These individuals can be thought of as non-compliant" supporters. The chi-square test for the independent distribution of our attitude and behavior variables strongly rejects (p &lt; 0:001).</p><p>Effective policy interventions require a much deeper understanding of this attitudebehavior typology than analyses that simply look at variables that predict whether an agent is using a facemask. If a substantial fraction of the population falls into Groups (B) and (C), policymakers face two quite distinct challenges: avoiding pushing some of the people in Group (B) into Group (D), and trying to move some of the people in Group (C) to Group (A). This facemask attitude-behavior divergence in the United States presents novel property rights issues and an issue of altruism by individuals toward other local residents. Like oil spills <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bishop et al., 2017)</ref>, COVID-19 imposed a loss-loss welfare change situation on individuals with respect to wearing a facemask relative to the pre-COVID frame of reference since both the risk of getting COVID and the risk of transmitting it to another person have both increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Knetsch et al., 2012)</ref>. Pre-COVID, there was a clear property right to move freely in public without a facemask. The imposition of a mask mandate changes that property right in a detrimental way. In particular, it is viewed by some as a fundamental loss of freedom. The facemasks available in the US at the beginning of the pandemic reduced transmission risk to others but provided only marginal protection to the individual wearing a facemask. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">4</ref> The shift in the reference state presents interesting challenges when dealing with risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Zong and Knetsch, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>One way to look at these four cells of this 2 Â 2 crosstabulation is through the classic lens of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fishbein and Ajzen (1975)</ref>. They posit that attitudes and behaviors may not always be consistent, with the main diagonal (Groups A and D) representing consistent pairings. Off-diagonal cells are inconsistent, but in opposite ways. Fishbein and Ajzen's framework is often termed the theory of reasoned action which melds attitudes and subjective norms to form behavioral intentions, that in turn get translated, with error, into behavior. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> displays this framework in flowchart form.</p><p>Attitudes are formed based on beliefs about how the world works and personal preferences. Expression of these attitudes into observed behavior is tempered by subjective norms. These are often cast in terms of social norms at both the societal level as well as close peers and referent groups. Affinity and peer group pressures can play a key role in either accentuating or tempering the translation of attitudes into behavioral intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chung et al., 2016)</ref>. Another important aspect of Fishbein and Ajzen's framework is to identify the behavioral action of interest in terms of actions, targets, context and timing <ref type="bibr">(Presseau et al., 2019)</ref>. A further issue with inferring how people are going to behave based on their attitudes within the Ajzen and Fishbein framework occurs due to conceptual divergences between attitude measures and behaviors of interest. There can also be competing motives reflected in attitude measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Rabideau, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>For empirical work, the attitude stage is often represented by observable variables ranging from clearly exogenous demographic variables to adjacent attitudinal variables. Because attitudes can be driven by beliefs, variables reflective of particular types of knowledge are often included. Subjective norms are often modeled by including variables related to the individual's reference groups. In the translation of behavior, contextual variables such as cost or purchase channels can be important.</p><p>Economists have also theorized about the attitude-behavior dichotomy. In The Logic of Collective Action, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Olsen (1965)</ref> describes the prisoner's dilemma of free riding on the provision of public goods. The role of herd immunity in bringing a pandemic under control provides novel opportunities for free riding. Herd immunity is generally achieved at levels well below everyone in the population becoming infected. The fraction of the population that needs to become infected to achieve herd immunity can be influenced both by measures that reduce transmission rates and by vaccination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hardin (1982)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Mueller (2003)</ref> review the free-riding literature and explore ways of overcoming it. Particularly relevant here is the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Margolis (1982)</ref> who posited that within each person lies two selves, one selfish in a narrow economic sense whose first instinct is to free ride or actively obstruct if they are required to contribute, and another which is group-oriented, with a Darwinian survival rule switching an individual between these two selves. Margolis was able to show a tight connection between this rule and notions of fairness. Margolis' work had a strong influence on economists, political scientists, psychologists, and sociologists at a conceptual level, but much less so in empirical work. It would fall to later work such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andreoni's (1990)</ref> formulation of altruism in a neoclassical economic framework and the behavioral revolution in economics that emphasized the role of gains and losses with a richer property rights perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kahneman et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Knetsch et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The wearing of facemasks to help stem a pandemic is a dramatic example of the potential conflict between attitudes and observed behavior. There are others that occur in important public policy contexts. We briefly examine two more here: one from the field of public health and the other from the field of environmental management. The public health issue involves smoking indoors in restaurants, which can subject others to second-hand smoke. Individuals tend to either favor or oppose banning smoking, with smokers tending to oppose and non-smokers tending to favor it. Demographic characteristics, political orientation, and knowledge also drive differences. As the fraction in opposition grew, bans on smoking became more common. Such bans were almost always enforced via social norms and employee requests rather than formal government fines, even when those were available through the enabling regulation. Some smoking customers quit going to restaurants that banned smoking. Overall patronage tended to increase after the smoking ban because most smokers complied with the ban <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Weaver, 2009)</ref>. Other customers increased their visits after smoking was banned, and some people who avoided restaurants due to second-hand smoke now came. Smokers found substitutes such as smoking outside in the parking lot or frequenting close substitutes that allowed smoking (such as cigar bars).</p><p>The environmental management example is recycling <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Guagnano et al., 1995)</ref>. People tend to either believe that recycling is a good thing to do (e.g., beneficial for the environment) or they do not. Recycling policies take many forms and achieve substantially different results, so the specific details and context obviously matter. Using economic incentives, the government can tax non-recycled waste <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fullerton and Kinnaman, 1996)</ref> or directly pay for recycled waste. Due to the cost and effort involved in the economic incentive approach, most recycling programs, other than deposit-refund schemes, rely on reducing cost to those inclined to recycle by providing color-coded bins emptied on a regular pick-up schedule, information campaigns, and invocation of the greater societal good <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Nigbur et al., 2010)</ref>. Some areas have achieved high rates of compliance, but there is always a non-trivial fraction of households that do not recycle.</p><p>The magnitude of the economic impact is known to shift sharply with the property rights perspective involving an environmental amenity (e.g., an authorized release of air pollution by an electric utility versus a large oil spill) under both a standard neoclassical and behavior framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Carson and Hanemann, 2005)</ref>. There is, however, no clear prediction as to how revealed behavior will change in the time of COVID (Graff Zivin and Sanders, 2020). In the most simplistic setting revealed behavior should depend on the individual's tradeoff between the discomfort of wearing a facemask and the degree of altruism toward other people in locations frequented by the agent. A richer model could include a much broader set of potential influences, such as the information set available to the individual, the magnitude of the local COVID-19 threat level and the role of social norms and political identity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data</head><p>Our survey instrument included an extensive set of questions relevant to COVID-19. These questions assessed knowledge about specific aspects of COVID-19, asked about what media sources respondents paid attention to for COVID news, personal experience with those directly impacted by COVID, actions being taken that might influence COVID transmission rates, and preferences toward specific government policies toward COVID-19. The survey instrument also included questions on respondents' sociodemographic characteristics and political opinions. Four thousand respondents were interviewed in August and September 2020.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> Respondents were selected from YouGov's internet panel for the United States. YouGov maintains an online panel of several million respondents who answer their clients' surveys. For our survey, YouGov drew a random sample of their respondents that matched the demographic characteristics of the US population. Respondents were paid a small incentive to participate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conceptual Model</head><p>A novel feature of our modeling approach is the direct operationalization of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>'s fourcell categorization as our dependent variable in terms of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fishbein and Ajzen (1975)</ref> attitude-behavior typology. A major feature of that typology is that beliefs influence attitudes which in turn influence behavioral intention through social norms and economic incentives. Behavioral intentions translate into observed behavior with error. Beliefs are treated as exogenous rather than something to change.</p><p>In the model we propose, three latent variables can affect a person's attitudes. The first is their political and demographic characteristics. Political orientation is a core component of many individuals' identities. A person with a particular political orientation may interpret "facts" differently from a person who holds very different fundamental beliefs. A person's political orientation is often facilitated and solidified by following partisan media sources. In addition to the political variables, we further include a set of demographic variables from the survey long known to be closely tied to political behavior. Together these demographic and political variables provide multiple indicators determining differences in the magnitude of the first of our three latent factors. The second latent factor uses as its multiple indicators a set of knowledge variables directly related to COVID-19 transmissibility. The third latent variable characterizes a respondent's COVID-19 risk in terms of their personal knowledge of individuals who had experienced positive cases, hospitalization or death.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Dependent variable</head><p>The dependent variable we seek to predict is which of the four groups displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> a respondent falls into, i.e., the dependent variable puts respondents into the four groups created by the cross-classification of an indicator variable for believing the government should require masks and an indicator variable for currently wearing a facemask. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">6</ref> The percent of our sample in each of the four cells is important from the perspective of using facemasks to mimic herd immunity (60% infected/blocking) by driving down transmission rates. If one assumed facemask use resulted in 50% efficacy in reducing COVID transmission (Howard et al. 2021), then facemask use by Compliant Supporters (Group A) alone would not be sufficient to reduce the effective reproduction rate of the virus below one. If the Non-Compliant Opponents (Group D) are assumed to stay in that state, then policies are needed that simultaneously retain the behavioral status of the second largest group of Compliant Opponents (Group B) while gaining compliance of the Non-Compliant Supporters (Group C).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Observable predictors influencing latent variables</head><p>Political &amp; Demographic: Eight indicator variables were selected to measure this first latent variable. Based on reviewing the literature, we identified several important political and socioeconomic factors shown to be associated with a person's decision to wear a face mask: partisanship, age, education, gender, race, and religiosity.</p><p>To directly represent partisanship, we used four indicator variables. The first is whether the respondent preferred Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. We use the standard voting intention question here to form the "Trump" indicator variable. We created the second indicator variable from a standard political ideology scale (very liberal, liberal, moderate, conservative, very conservative, and not sure) by grouping the conservative and very conservative categories together as the "1" with the other codes coded as "0". We created a third indicator variable that described whether the respondent followed media sources with a right-wing orientation. We set this "Media-Right" indicator variable to one if respondents received information on COVID through conservative media based on a survey question that asked, "How much attention are you paying to each of these different media sources for information on the COVID-19 crisis?". Respondents who indicated that they were paying a lot of attention to Fox, Talk Radio, and/or Breitbart are coded as the "1" category. Lastly, we included a "China Origin" indicator variable. An early political debate in the United States concerned the origins of COVID-19. The indicator variable takes on the value of one for those who agree with the statement "The first people infected with COVID-19 were in China". With a large majority of our sample (correctly) agreeing with this statement, the zero side of this indicator variable represents those respondents who are paying little attention.</p><p>Turning now to demographic variables, our intent here is to support a latent factor defined along a Trump_Republican political dimension by tapping into a set of variables known to underlie a wide range of related political preferences. We first define an indicator variable for being Black, one of the most reliable predictors of supporting Democratic Party positions. As such, this variable should have the opposite sign of the Trump indicator variable. We could have included a larger set of ethnicity/race variables but did not due to computational cost and some initial work suggesting small gains in predictive power. For age, we defined an indicator variable "Senior" that takes on the value of "1" if the respondent is over 60 years of age and "0" otherwise. Older Americans are known to be one of the larger and most reliable Republican constituencies. Again, the use of additional age categories is possible, but the gains from doing so appear to be small.</p><p>There is obviously a gender split across our four groups, but it is not always that striking so we turn to interactions with gender, which in many voting studies exhibit more distinct behavior. The two most common gender (and highly correlated) interactions are college female and non-college male. We use the first, defining "Female-College" as the "1" side of an indicator variable where the respondent is female and has at least two years of college education. On the male side, we deploy another commonly used gender interaction, this time with male, interacted with one of the Pew Research Center's religion variables, "bornagain". We define "Male-Born Again" as taking on a value of "1" for a male who also provides a "yes" response to the question asking about self-identification as "born-again" in a religious sense which characterizes many evangelicals.</p><p>Knowledge About COVID-19 Transmission: For the second latent variable, "COVID Knowledge," we used four indicator variables: Symptom Knowledge, Crowds Knowledge,</p><p>The Attitude-Behavior Dichotomy in the Time of COVID-19 1581 Distancing Knowledge, and Mask Knowledge. Symptom Knowledge used the data on whether the respondent agreed, disagreed, or was not sure in answering the following statement: "You can have COVID-19 and infect others without showing any symptoms." Correct responses are coded as a "1" and otherwise defined as the "0" side of the indicator variable. This convention is followed for the other three knowledge variables. Responses to the statement "Avoiding crowds reduces your chances of infection with COVID-19" were used to define the Crowds Knowledge indicator variable. Distancing Knowledge used responses to the statement: "Standing six feet apart helps reduce COVID-19's spread." Lastly, for Mask Knowledge, we used data from responses to the statement: "Face masks help reduce COVID-19's spread."</p><p>COVID Risk: For the third latent variable, "Covid Risk," we used personal knowledge of someone having been affected by COVID-19 to measure how "close" the respondent perceived the threat of COVID-19. At the time of the online survey, the fall 2020 surge in COVID-19 infection had not yet happened <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carson et al., 2021)</ref>. While the number of people affected by COVID-19 was large at the time of the survey, COVID-19 had not reached many places in force. This was particularly true with some demographic groups who were more isolated from essential workers, particularly in large cities where their infection rates were highest. We used three binary indicators. The first comes from responses to the question "Do you know anyone personally who has tested positive for COVID-19?". The other two come from related questions asking about "knowing anyone personally who has gotten sick with COVID-19 and was hospitalized" and "knowing anyone personally who has died from COVID-19. These three indicators are labeled as "Positive", "Hospitalized" and "Dead". By construction they are correlated. A priori it is unclear how these experiences will influence an individual. The most likely effect, particularly for Hospitalization and Dead, is to increase the likelihood that a respondent falls into the compliant supporter group. There are other plausible interpretations. For instance, knowing someone who tested positive for COVID-19 but suffered little or none in terms of health effects might influence the respondent to perceive COVID-19 as not a serious health threat. Likewise, knowing someone very old who died (but no one else) may contribute to a young person seeing themselves as not at risk. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> lists the variables used in the GSEM Model to characterize the three latent variables.</p><p>We assume that each respondent is located in one of the four groups defined by the cells of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> based on their choice among the four alternatives that provide them the highest level of utility. That, of course, is an almost tautological statement in this case. Even though there are enormous societal consequences of the choices made, it is not clear why income should play any substantive role and the incentives are not the standard ones that involve prices and taxes. On the other hand, social norms are likely to play an outsized role in the form of perceived property rights in the presence of a pandemic and specifically what the appropriate definition of status quo property rights now is <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hardin, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Knetsch et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In the highly partisan U.S. political environment, both social norms and information dissemination are likely to be interpreted through the lens of political identification. As such, we expect the first two latent variables to be substantively correlated. For the experienced [COVID] risk latent variable the drivers are indicator variables for knowing one or more individuals who have experienced a positive case, a hospitalization, or death. Correlations between this factor and the Political &amp; Democratic and Knowledge factors would be expected to be smaller, but not zero since early in the pandemic COVID-19 activity was more prevalent in more urban areas and less common in areas where the ability to shift to remote work was high.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Statistical Approach</head><p>The statistical approach we used is generalized structural equation modelling (GSEM). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">7</ref>Structural equation modeling (SEM) is one of the most commonly used approaches in the social sciences when the phenomenon of interest is thought to be influenced by a set of not fully observable (latent) factors rather than directly by a set of observable variables. The latent factors are specified in terms of observable variables coupled with assumed functional forms and statistical distribution assumptions concerning error components. Originally SEMs required continuous response variables and the use of (log) normal error components. SEMs were generalized to a much broader set of models and error component distributions by adapting the generalized linear model framework of McCullagh and Nelder (1989).<ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">foot_8</ref> Maximum-likelihood-type procedures are usually used for parameter estimation.</p><p>The origins of SEM lie with geneticist Seawell Wright's path analysis (1933) which has influenced many disciplines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jöreskog (1969)</ref> formulated a maximum likelihood version of the problem embedding latent factors in a system of path analysis-type equations. A key step was the recognition that simultaneous equations econometric models were an important special case of SEMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Goldberger, 1972)</ref>. This allowed a deeper understanding of the identification and causality issues within the framework that had long intrigued <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Wold (1956)</ref>, a prominent Swedish econometrician and statistician, who had been Jöreskog's advisor as a graduate student. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">9</ref>Jöreskog developed a computer program known as LISEL for fitting SEM. LISEL helped define the SEM approach for decades. The class of models was often referred to as multiple indictor-multiple cause models to recognize the influence of observable factors on the latent variables and the dependence of the observed outcome on multiple causal forces including the latent variables. The standard operational formulation of these models is often referred to as confirmatory factor analysis because the estimated parameters on the observable variables that predict a latent variable take the form of factor analysis parameters. The "confirmatory" modifier reflects a distinction from the traditional exploratory factor analysis and the ability to evaluate hypotheses concerning parameters and model structure in a manner similar to that of standard simultaneous equation statistical models. Models in other social science fields often embody elaborate "path" structures. In econometric work, the typical use of these models has emphasized the latent variable components and simpler structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aigner et al., 1984)</ref>. This approach characterizes our usage here. [G]SEMs have been used in a Fishbein and Ajzen framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Mayeri and Best, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kadoya and Khan, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The generic issues associated with [G]SEMs are well-known and tend to fall into four categories. The first is that there is a vast range of possible specifications for these models. This makes it difficult to identify the "best" model, particularly when different specifications result in similar overall fit. This problem exists in most complex statistical models. The second issue is that the distributional assumptions chosen for error components often have a strong influence on the results. Because G[SEM]s typically involve multiple linked equations, the impact of these choices can propagate well beyond the original equation to which they were attached. In many ways, this is a consequence of simultaneously wanting to examine the influence of multiple factors as opposed to isolating the influence of a single one, in instances where it is possible to experimentally or statistically control for the influence of other factors.</p><p>The third issue is that the G[SEM] approach is quite demanding in terms of data needs. This is particularly a problem with noisy individual-level data that characterizes many of the questions researchers seek to answer with this approach. A large sample size is needed to adequately pin down the key parameters of interest. With 4000 observations, our sample size is four to eight times larger than the typical high-quality survey of a national population. The fourth issue is that SEMs, and particularly GSEMs, are computationally difficult to estimate. Models of any appreciable size face an array of convergence problems. They often require days and sometimes weeks of computer time to obtain parameter estimates for a single model run. Our model presented below is no exception.</p><p>We use a Generalized Structural Equation Model (GSEM) approach to predict which of the four groups (A, wear/want mandate; B, wear/oppose mandate; C, don't wear/favor mandate; and D, don't wear/oppose mandate) respondents fall. The simplest variant is just a multinomial logit model with constant terms (alternative specific constants [ASC] for groups B, C and D, to predict group membership with Group A used as the baseline. The estimates for the ASC simply reproduce the unconditional probabilities for all four groups since all respondents are treated as equivalent. The standard approach would be to add observed covariates to directly help predict group members.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_10">foot_10</ref> It is at this point that we use the GSEM approach to diverge from this conceptualization. Instead, we posit that group membership is driven by three latent variables (or factors as they are often called).</p><p>The first of these is the respondent's political orientation. This cannot can be observed directly, although many proxies have been proposed over the years ranging from identification as a supporter of a particular party's presidential candidate to demographic characteristics that have a long history of having greater affinity for one party's candidates. As noted above, we used several here. We label this latent variable Political &amp; Demographic. To make it operational and statistically identified we need to do three things that effectively define a model of how this latent variable varies across respondents. The first is to specify the set of covariates [proxy predictors] that plausibly move the value of the Political and Demographic factor around.</p><p>The second is to specify a functional form for how they do so. We assume the typical linearity specification. The third is to specify an error component. We make the usual Gaussian assumption. While this latent variable cannot be directly observed, its expected value is readily calculated from the covariates that define it and their estimated parameters. Further, the error component that also helps to define the properties of the latent variable features an estimable standard deviation, whose value is chosen to best maximize the goodness of fit. In this formulation there are multiple ways to move the same latent variable around and the translation from a change in its expected value to predictions of group membership adds an additional stochastic component that has some similarities with a mixed-logit random utility model <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Train, 2003)</ref>. Here we lack a panel structure of multiple choice occasions per respondent that makes that approach effective, so we have to rely on cross-sectional variation among our survey respondents.</p><p>A [G]SEM with one latent variable is fairly uninteresting as it simply confounds two error components, while it produces a standard set of model parameters as if the covariates had been used directly. The introduction of a second latent variable changes this situation as it introduces two additional considerations that do not come into play when there is only one latent variable. First, all or some of the covariate variables are used to define the second latent variable distinct from those used to define the first latent variable. In turn, the covariates are used to define the third latent variable, distinct from those used to define the first two latent factors. The issue is similar to the role of exclusion restrictions in the standard simultaneous equations model in econometrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Goldberger, 1972)</ref>. Second, the error components used to define the latent variables can be correlated with each other in a manner similar to that of simultaneous equation models.</p><p>The Political_Demographic factor measures political orientation along a stylized Trump_Republican dimension anchored by its normalizing (at 1.000) for the coefficient on the supporting TRUMP variable. The Knowledge factor increases as the number of correctly answered COVID-19 knowledge questions increases. Larger coefficient estimates indicate a better ability of a particular variable to help distinguish which group in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> the respondent is a member of. The normalization here (also to 1.000) is on the SYMP-TOM variable indicating correct information about the possibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, which can be important knowledge in an individual taking steps to reduce their risk of becoming infected. The estimated coefficients on the other knowledge covariates are defined relative to this normalization. For the risk factor variable, the normalization (to 1.000) is on the indicator variable POSITIVE, for the respondent for knowing someone who has tested positive. Like any standard multinomial choice model, it provides separated estimated coefficients for three of our groups relative to a baseline group, which we take to be Group A, those who are both wearing a facemask and support a mandate for their use. For the three non-baseline groups, alternative specific constants are also included. 11  While it is possible to write down the system of equations that define our GSEM in the notation of simultaneous equation systems, such a model is typically defined in terms of a directed graph where paths represent parameters, often referred to as path coefficients, to be estimated. This structure is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, which also displays the estimated path coefficients for the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Empirical Findings</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> reports the percentage of respondents in each of the four groups ( <ref type="figure">A, B, C,</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>) for the set of predictor variables in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The first row provides the unconditional distribution for each of the groups. Ignoring minor rounding considerations, the percentages sum to 100% going across a row. Larger divergences between the unconditional percentages in the first row and those in the row for a specific covariate in one of the other rows suggest better predictors of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> group membership. For instance, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows that respondents who support Trump or self-identify as politically conservative are much more likely to be in Group B and Group D than the unconditional probabilities would suggest. 12 In contrast, the Senior variable group splits show must less divergence relative to their unconditional counterparts.</p><p>The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using our three latent variables defined in terms of the 15 observable covariates is displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. 13 It provides useful confirmation that the structure concerning the relationship between the latent variables and their defining covariates is actually present in the data. With respect to the first Political-Demographic factor, Trump and Conservative are, as expected, the strongest (positive) components in the factor analysis for this dimension. The coefficient on Media-Right is also of interest. It is moderately large and roughly twice the size of the other remaining demographic covariates, which all have the expected signs. This suggests one source of linkage with the Knowledge factor.</p><p>With respect to the knowledge factor, the covariate directly measuring knowledge that the use of facemasks reduces transmission has the largest factor loading, with the social distancing knowledge covariate being the next largest. For the risk factor, knowing someone who has been hospitalized has the largest factor loading. All these have implications for developing effective media strategies, but perhaps more subtly than one might Note: Due to rounding, percentages may not sum to 100% across rows.</p><p>12 Note that the Trump percentage is substantial lower than he received in the 2020 election because this point many respondents indicated they were uncertain over who they planned to vote for or did not intend to vote. 13 An examination of the eigenvalues from factor analysis (unrotated) for each of our three sets of variables suggests all are well characterized by one factor. For the knowledge variables, the eigenvalue of the first factor is 1.93 while the second is À0.01. For eigenvalue for Political-Demographic variables used, the first eigenvalue is 1.50 while the second is 0.25. For the risk variables, the first eigenvalue is 1.36, while the second is À0.07.</p><p>The Attitude-Behavior Dichotomy in the Time of COVID-19 1587 expect. It is likely that there is substantial partisan-encouraged pushback on acceptance of facemasks as safe and effective. In this case, for the same effort moving someone's knowledge from the incorrect level to the correct level on whether social distancing reduces COVID-19 transmission may be the most effective course if it has (as is the case here) only a moderately smaller path coefficient in terms of increasing actual facemask use. The Political &amp; Demographic factor has a moderately large (À0.43) correlation with the knowledge factor, where the correlation's sign suggests a Trump_Republican orientation is negatively related to the degree of correct COVID-19 information. The other two correlations between the factors are smaller in magnitude, but the implications of the sign of these correlations is of potential interest. The stronger a respondent's Trump_Republican orientation the less likely the respondent is to know someone who has experienced COVID-19. The more likely the respondent is to know someone experiencing more severe COVID-19 events, the more likely they possess correct COVID-19 information.</p><p>Examination of standard CFA goodness of fit measures suggests the proposed latent variable structure is reasonably consistent with the observed data. The signs and magnitudes of estimated factor loadings are all consistent with our prior expectations. The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) is 0.057, with values of this statistic below 0.06 often taken as an indicator of an acceptable fit. The comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) are 0.913 and 0.895, respectively. Like R-square measures, values closer to 1 than 0 indicate a better fit.  <ref type="table">4</ref> displays parameter estimates in the usual regression table format including standard deviations and p-values using robust standard errors. As the magnitude of the Political &amp; Demographic latent variable shifts in the Trump_Republican direction, the prediction of a respondent's group membership moves away from Group A and specifically toward either Group B or D. Shifts in this factor have little predictive power in distinguishing Group A members from Group C members.</p><p>As the latent variable representing COVID Knowledge increases, the likelihood that a respondent falls into Groups B, C, or D decreases. This effect is quite large in magnitude, relative to the path coefficients from the other two latent variables. The effect size is almost 80% larger for Group D than it is Group B, whose members share a political affinity toward the Trump_Republican direction. The greater responsiveness of Group D here is masked by Group D's possession of substantially lower amounts of correct information (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) and likely greater resistance to believing correct information than Group B members, who are reasonably close to the sample average except on the facemask knowledge covariate where there is a considerable dip (12% correct in Group B versus unconditional 18% expected based on group size).</p><p>This divergence on facemask knowledge, however, is even more striking for Group D, where the unconditional percent would be 13% compared to the observed 3%. With respect that the person tested positive, it is the hospitalization variable that has the largest coefficient, 20% larger in magnitude than a positive test, by far the most common event and almost 50% larger than that for a death, which at the time the survey was conducted was still a relatively rare event and concentrated among the elderly.</p><p>The multiway interactions between these three factors can be expressed in terms of the indirect effects. Here adding the Knowledge factor to the Political &amp; Demographic factor, indirect effects whose magnitude is more than large enough to be important for some purposes. Because the direct and indirect effects are of the same sign for all three Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> groups (relative to Group A), the total effect is larger and in the case of Group D almost twice as large as the direct effect alone. Interpretation of this result is straightforward. Someone with a strong Trump_Republican orientation as reflected by having large values on the first latent variable is even more likely to be in Group D if they also have a low value on the Knowledge factor. For Group C, this indirect effect dominates the direct effect. At a deeper level, the sizeable indirect effects are likely to be picking up the role now being played by political orientation in interpreting key factual knowledge that becomes tied to partisan policy disputes. The indirect effects associated with the two-way interactions involving risk, while, potentially important at the margin, are small. This may be due to the specific definition of risk used here, which is tied to experiences within the household. That makes it well defined but a noisy measure of direct experiences, which should include experiences involving relatives (including elderly parents), close colleagues, and neighbors. Those associated with the three-way interaction are small enough to be ignorable, as is often the case. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Discussion</head><p>Prior to the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, the implicit property right in the United States was that Americans did not need to wear facemasks to protect others. The relatively small number of people wearing facemasks in public were those who perceived themselves at elevated risk of being infected by respiratory diseases. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_14">15</ref> The pandemic brought this implicit property right into sharp relief. Before the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, public health officials knew that the only real tools they had available to slow COVID-19's transmission levels were the same non-pharmaceutical options last deployed on a mass scale during the Spanish Flu that had killed millions after World War I <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bootsma and Ferguson, 2007)</ref>. Like most countries, the U.S. failed in its early effort to contain the COVID-19 virus due to a lack of adequate testing capacity and a very imperfectly implemented initial lockdown. The effort in the U.S. and most other countries then shifted to trying to slow the rate of transmission to prevent hospital capacity from being overrun by too many desperately ill from the disease. This effort was also intended to buy time in hopes that an unprecedented effort to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19 that could be quickly produced, which would either prevent infection or dramatically reduce the chance of death and other adverse events if infected, would be successful. The stakes were high. Bringing the pandemic under control using natural herd immunity, with roughly 60% of the population becoming infected, was projected to kill two million Americans in the process, given what was known about the disease in the summer of 2020, and many more if hospital capacity to handle serious cases was overwhelmed. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_15">16</ref>The two most commonly adopted measures in the U.S. were facemasks and social distancing. While they did not prevent transmission of the disease, they did reduce transmission rates and worked well together amplifying the reduction in transmission. Widespread adoption was seen as critical to the economy to "reopen" safely. Lines with X's for people to stand six feet apart and signs noting that a facemask was required to enter the building became commonplace. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_16">17</ref>However, the U.S. Federal Government had little real legal authority to impose a national mandate compelling its citizens to use such measures. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_17">18</ref> Through its Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Federal Government and the Public Health Service, it can issue guidance documents. Recommendations from such guidance documents are routinely implemented by individual U.S. states and local political jurisdictions that do possess such legal authority. Even then, however, there is no active enforcement mechanism. No police or other civil authorities stood ready to issue fines on a large scale for non-compliance. 18  Compliance with wearing a facemask was thus effectively voluntary. However, compliance was also heavily influenced by the actions of businesses and local agencies broadly characterized to include the local government and non-profit organizations working through peer pressure and helping to define current social norms. Many of these had put forward requirements for customers and employees earlier in the pandemic but, by the time of our survey, formal mandates were starting to lapse due to political opposition or the failure of local public health authorities in the summer of 2020 to recognize the need for driving case counts down when the virus' temperature amplification factor worked with their effort rather than against them. Cooling weather, coupled with the virus now being well seeded, resulted in a large and predictable wave of COVID-19 cases in the late fall of 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carson et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>This sets up the need for public health authorities to take actions to substantially increase the fraction of the public wearing facemasks in order to reduce the transmission rate. In some instances this was done by renewing formal mandates, but, in most cases, accomplished by encouraging businesses and organizations to require their use. This sets up the four-cell Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> typology of actual compliance versus support for mandated compliance as one avenue toward understanding the key drivers of behaviors like the wearing of facemasks that the health authority would like to increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kim et al., 2022)</ref>. Two of our contributions here are likely to be of use in formulating policy responses to future pandemics and other large-scale disasters. The first moves away from simply focusing on the revealed behavior of interest, here wearing or not wearing a facemask, to augmenting it with stated preference data. And not as simply predictors of that behavior, but rather to define a richer set of "types" of members of the population. 19  The second recognizes that the specific sizes of four Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> groups comprised critical information for the effort to save lives and buy time for the vaccine development effort to bear fruit. Group A, already compliant and wanting compliance by others mandated, was by far the largest group. By itself, though, Group A was not large enough to accomplish the reduction in the COVID-19 transmission that was desired. At the same time, it was widely recognized that a reasonable amount of non-compliance could be tolerated, which meant a country-wide mandate might not be the only way to achieve success. This opened up a different, albeit riskier way but one that was more politically palatable, to achieve the 18 Many state and local public health agencies issued some type of mandate requiring the use of facemask. This was not done at the onset of the pandemic due to fear that the supply of medical grade masks was rapidly being exhausted, but somewhat later as initial lockdown orders were relaxed and evidence was amassed that home-cloth masks were effective at reducing transmission to others. The number of fines for non-compliance issued across the U.S. was quite small. 19 An even simpler COVID-19 related analogue proved extremely useful during the pandemic: the typology of vaccinated/no vaccinated with intend to be vaccinated/don't intend. The Group A cell (vaccinated/intend to be) was target will a reminder type message to get boosted. The Group B cell was target with messages about why getting boosted was important. The Group C cell with messages about how and where to get vaccinated. There was also some effort to move those in Group D to Group C by emphasizing the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. objective, by moving some Group C or D members toward compliance while keeping Group B members compliant.</p><p>A deeper understanding of the factors influencing into which of the four Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> groups an individual falls would have been helpful in formulating a better policy response to this pandemic and to the inevitable next one.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_19">foot_19</ref> Support for mandated facemask compliance can be seen as wanting to formally change the social norm during the time of an epidemic. Examining it in the context of our estimated GSEM results in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows that divisions between our four groups closely map to two of our three latent variables. Those aligned with higher values on the Political_Demographic factor (closer to Trump_Republican) are disproportionately found in Groups B and D. One of the other two latent variables, Knowledge is closely associated with the second split in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> on the compliance dimension, Groups A and B versus Groups C and D.</p><p>It is useful to think of the Political_Demographic dimension as essentially fixed in the sense that the underlying covariate values are both hard and slow to change and that government policies do not try to change them. The weights in this linear index function of the covariates are tuned to best predict membership of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> groups. Respondents high on the Trump_Republicans scale are concentrated at one end point of what looks like a political polarization index with Biden_Democrats concentrated at the other end.</p><p>Social norms are conventions that define societal structure. They can be formally incorporated into law but often are not now allowing societies to function without excess regulation. They are self-enforcing to a greater or lesser degree, with compliance levels increasing in both the fraction of the public currently complying and the fraction of the public supporting compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Ostrom, 2000)</ref>. They are typically stable. Our GSEM results illustrate the problem with trying to "formally" change them during the time of a pandemic with one of the two major political parties opposed. However, those close to the Trump_Republicans pole are split into two factions: those currently compliant with wearing a facemask (Group B) and those who are not (Group D). This split in turn is influenced by both the amount of correct knowledge pertaining to COVID-19 transmission and familiarity with people experiencing COVID-19 events. This suggests information paths to move those in Group D to Group B, even though compliance with the new social norm the majority wanted to establish might only be temporary and driven by a perceived seriousness of the current pandemic. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_20">21</ref> It also suggested that the disinformation campaign, which by design had infected Group D members, threatened compliance by those in Group B.</p><p>Group C members, who are non-compliant but favor a facemask mandate, look like less well-informed (and less politically active) versions of Group A members. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_21">22</ref> As such, this finding also suggests the use of a targeted information campaign to increase compliance. Such a campaign would need to be different than one targeting Group D members because Group C's information sets tend to run toward "don't know" rather than actively believing false facts. The open question with respect to Group C members is whether widespread voluntary actions by businesses and local agencies can create the appearance of a shift in social norms toward facemask wearing to which Group C members would then adhere. If so, then this represents a specific way to enhance the self-enforcing nature of social norms during a pandemic. An alternative hypothesis is that Group C members are free riders on the use of facemasks by others to reduce transmission rates, but their low information state argues against this interpretation.</p><p>Our GSEM model provides a deeper understanding of how our posited latent variable structure works by examining how our 15 observable covariates drive the larger set of path coefficients. The parameter estimates are optimized to predict class membership using the core multinomial logit specification for the four groups. The latent factor for [COVID] Knowledge is the strongest with respect to predicting Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> group membership. This is followed by the Political_Demographic factor, which in turn is a better predictor than the COVID[Risk] factor.</p><p>Within the Knowledge latent factor, increasing the amount of "correct COVID-19 specific information" always increases the likelihood that the respondent is complying with the facemask mandate. The specific question concerning whether facemasks reduce transmission is the strong driver of variation in this latent variable's expected value. This was followed, as expected, by knowledge that social distancing reduces transmission.</p><p>There is a substantive relationship between the Political_Demographic factor and the Knowledge factor, which statistically takes the form of a negative moderately large correlation coefficient. Those stronger in the Trump_Republican direction tend to be less knowledgeable along the [COVID] Knowledge direction. One explanation for the pattern of estimated path coefficients is that it is hard to convince (the negative correlation) someone with a high expected value on the Trump_Republican factor of the correctness of a particular COVID fact. But if one could reduce such misinformation, then the relevant path coefficient suggests a substantive increase in facemask compliance. It is suggestive of why the attention to right-leaning media path coefficient was substantially larger than the demographic ones long used to characterize key parts of the two parties' constituencies. Devoting additional attention to understanding how and why so much COVID-19 disinformation was transmitted and absorbed is likely to be a useful line of inquiry.</p><p>The [COVID]risk latent factor was operationalized in terms of knowing someone who had tested positive, been hospitalized, or died. A priori, which of these to emphasize to increase facemask adherence was unknown. Our GSEM model yields the insight that knowing someone hospitalized has a path coefficient about 50% larger than the indicator for knowing someone who died. With hospitalizations more common than deaths, and further concentrated among the elderly, a randomly chosen respondent may be more likely to envision being hospitalized due to COVID-19. Knowing someone with a positive case conceivably could increase or decrease perceived risks associated with COVID-19 depending on its outcome. The path coefficient here is normalized to 1.000, but judging the magnitude of the other two path coefficients, relative to the normalization, suggests dissemination of information on positive test counts would be better than doing so on death counts. Both of these hint that "prevalence" information for higher probability COVIDevents may be helpful for encouraging facemask usage.</p><p>At the center of all the work presented here is a core message from the classic <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kahneman et al. (1990)</ref> coffee mug experiment. It is hard to get people to change the expected property right they operate under even for something as simple as selling a coffee mug that was readily available for purchase in the university bookstore. This insight extends far beyond that paper's discussion of the divergence between maximum willingness to pay and minimum willingness to accept compensation. As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, learning how to better shift such a pre-existing property right toward the new social norm, that people have an affirmative obligation to try to protect each other in time of an emergency, can have profound consequences. In a more general context, our framework should be of use in trying to understand the interplay between beliefs and actions in other large-scale crisis management situations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Facemask requirements were often coupled with requirements for social distancing. The extent to which members of the public saw facemasks and social distancing as intrinsically linked versus clear separably policies with distinct properties is potentially an interesting issue we cannot explore here because we did not ask respondents a specific question concerning whether they thought social distancing should be required.</p></note>

Suppose your local city or county government was considering a regulation that would require everyone to wear a face mask whenever they left their own home. Someone not wearing a face mask in public buildings and parks as well as retail stores would be issued a ticket and fined, just like a traffic violation.
