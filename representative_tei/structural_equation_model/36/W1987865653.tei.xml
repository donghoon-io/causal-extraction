<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The objective of this paper is to assess the attitude of Malaysian stakeholders to genetically modified (GM) salmon and to identify the factors that influence their acceptance of GM salmon using a structural equation model. A survey was carried out on 434 representatives from various stakeholder groups in the Klang Valley region of Malaysia. Public attitude towards GM salmon was measured using self-developed questionnaires with seven-point Likert scales. The findings of this study have confirmed that public attitudes towards GM salmon is a complex issue and should be seen as a multi-faceted process. The most important direct predictors for the encouragement of GM salmon are the specific application-linked perceptions about religious acceptability of GM salmon followed by perceived risks and benefits, familiarity, and general promise of modern biotechnology. Encouragement of GM salmon also involves the interplay among other factors such as general concerns of biotechnology, threatening the natural order of things, the need for labeling, the need for patenting, confidence in regulation, and societal values. The research findings can serve as a database that will be useful for understanding the social construct of public attitude towards GM foods in a developing country.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Biotechnology has become an important field in the global market. Genetically modified (GM) food involves the deliberate modification of plants and animals' genetic material using innovative recombinant DNA technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Genetic engineering techniques have been envisaged as an opportunity to improve food production to fulfill consumer preferences for improved quality and diversity. The modification of food genetically has the potential to increase yields and could lower the price of food, which would boost productivity in farming and increase the supply of food for the world's rapidly growing population <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Although genetic modification technology holds the promise to increase food security in developing countries, negative public acceptance can affect its adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The public's main concerns relate to the uncertainties and possible negative effects of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on human health and the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Despite the associated benefits of genetic engineering of food, its successful adoption can only become a reality if consumers accept the end-products. The future advancement of gene technology very much depends on public acceptance.</p><p>Aquaculture has been reported as the fastest growing food industry worldwide, and salmon farming has been identified as the fastest growing sector in aquaculture <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. GM salmon may become an important source of protein to meet the growing demand of the growing global population. According to Cowx et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, around 50 species/traits of animals have been modified genetically. The modifications mostly involved fish species such as Atlantic salmon, common carp and tilapia. The popular traits engineered include growth rate improvements, resistance to diseases, efficiency of feed conversion, low oxygen level tolerance, resistance to cold and freezing, and the ability to utilize low cost and non-animal protein based diets <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. These traits could be developed by genetic modification of fish, which would in turn make a great contribution to the modern fish sector. GM salmon was the first genetically modified animal approved for human consumption in the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The GM Atlantic salmon were engineered with either antifreeze protein genes or salmon growth hormone gene constructs. The GM Atlantic salmon inserted with the type III antifreeze protein were able to survive in water at temperatures of below 0uC <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The growth rate of GM Atlantic salmon, which was inserted with the growth hormone gene from Chinook salmon, is higher than conventional fish and can reach their commercial size in one third of the time required for nontransgenic salmon <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. GM salmon has great potential to provide a sustainable food alternative, and could help solve economic and environmental constraints in aquaculture farming <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Public understanding, perception, and acceptance of genetic modification (GM) technologies and their products would either promote or hamper their adoption and commercialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Wynne <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> stressed the existing of unacknowledged problem of our contemporary scientific culture that are not being recognized and address. The experts have always argued that public concerns are based on ignorance and misunderstanding of science. In reality, most people are less aware of the scientific nature of a risk, and are much more concerned with broader, qualitative attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Acceptance involves an individual's attitude to certain political issues such as those involving technological innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. People's attitude towards a new technology, such as GM technology, is determined by several interrelated factors including perceived risks and perceived benefits, social values, and trust in key actors or institutions representing and governing these technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> as well as general attitudes and personal values <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Public attitudes towards GM technology have been found to differ across various cultures and geographical regions worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> as well as across different types of applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. Bauer <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> stressed that GM foods were found to be more controversial and were put into the negative light compared to medical biotechnology. Consumers in developed countries worldwide were not very supportive of the development of GM salmon for food. According to Chern et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, consumers in the United States and Norway were willing to pay more for non-GM salmon than for GM salmon but consumers in the United States were more favorable towards GM salmon compared with their counterparts in Norway. Haro <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> reported that the majority of life-science students at university in Norway were not keen on buying GM transgenic salmon even though it has benefits such as increased nutrition and disease resistance. In Scotland, the salmon industry has been reported to have voted against GM salmon <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. A more recent survey in 2010 by the Lake Research Partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> in the United States revealed that 78% of respondents did not support the approval of GM salmon for human consumption by the United States Federal Food and Drug Administration. Menozzi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> revealed through qualitative scenario analysis that the majority of experts in Europe, Canada and Chile did not believe that the GM of salmon will be an important technical innovation.</p><p>Several studies have tried to identify the factors determining consumers' acceptance of GM salmon in Europe and the United States. The majority of the studies on willingness to pay for GM salmon concluded that price was the major factor affecting consumer choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Additional determinants identified were tangible benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, health risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, nature of transfer and environmental concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, and knowledge and education <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Nep and O'Doherty <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> analyzed public deliberation on GM salmon in Canada and found that labeling was inadequately addressed in Canada's regulatory framework. Although some of the factors determining consumers support of GM salmon have been identified in the earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, the various factors were not derived from a similar study or similar respondents. Moreover, focus-group studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> have the limitation of small samples. There are other factors that have been cited as important in influencing consumers' acceptance of GM foods that have not been included in the above studies related to GM salmon. The factor of religious acceptance has been shown to be important for Malaysians <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Other general attitudinal factors such as confidence in regulation, attitude to patenting, moral aspects (threatening natural order), societal value (nature versus materialism), attitude to labeling and general concerns and the promise of modern biotechnology are also included in this study to assess their influence on the acceptance of GM salmon. Their importance will be highlighted in the theoretical framework section of this paper.</p><p>There has been no attempt to use structural equation modeling (SEM) to assess factors influencing the acceptance of GM salmon in past studies. The use of SEM has several advantages over other techniques. It is an advanced multivariate technique that assesses multiple dependence relationships between variables simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, allows the modelling and prediction of relation-ships between construct variables in a hypothesized manner and has the ability to suggest novel hypotheses originally not considered. It helps to specify hypotheses and operationalize constructs more precisely and ensures the reliability of measures in the testing of hypotheses in ways beyond the averaging of multimeasures of constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. SEM has the ability to model latent variables, specify errors, correct measurement error, analyze covariance structures and construct complete theories simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>There have been only limited studies on Asian attitudes towards GM foods and GM salmon and none on the identification of factors determining the public acceptance of GM salmon. Our earlier publications identified the dimensions of public attitude towards modern biotechnology in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and several applications of gene technology in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. This paper further analyzes the Malaysian attitude towards GM animals as past studies have shown that people were less supportive of genetic modification of animals compared with that of plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The relationships between the various factors (dimensions) and their influence on the acceptance of GM application, which has not been determined in earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>, will also be assessed in this paper. The objective of this paper is to assess the Malaysian stakeholders' attitude towards GM salmon and to identify the factors that influence their acceptance of GM salmon using SEM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Framework</head><p>The theoretical framework of this study has been developed based on the attitude model towards biotechnology applications proposed by Pardo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> and Bredahl's Attitude Model towards GM foods <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, which was based on Fishbein's Multiattribute Attitude Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. The model begins with potential causes that are known to affect attitudes. The variables are arranged according to their assumed influence on the subsequent variables. The model shows that specific attitude towards modern biotechnology applications is influenced by the more general attitudinal and values variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> and the relationships between the variables were hypothesized based on earlier studies. The magnitude of any influence or association between two variables will be determined by the regression weights from structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis.</p><p>Specific attitude. In the model, the overall attitude (encouragement) towards a specific application or product of modern biotechnology such as GM salmon is determined by the specific perceptions of risks and benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>, familiarity, and religious acceptance of GM salmon. According to Campbell et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, evaluation of any complex object is affected by extraneous concerns, which are also known as general attitude or schemas <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Since GM foods are considered new to the food arena, people may have difficulties in configuring them in their minds, so it is expected that attitudes towards them would be influenced by more general attitudes and values that have been embedded in their minds <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. So the specific attitudinal variables: familiarity, perceived risks and benefits, and religious acceptability of GM salmon are given causal interpretations by several general attitudinal and values variables such as general promise and concerns of modern biotechnology <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, societal value <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, moral concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, confidence on regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref> and the need for labelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and patenting of GM products <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>Perceived benefit and perceived risk have been identified by many researchers as important variables for the measurement of public attitudes towards GM technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>. Perception of benefits and risks are complex and difficult to conceptualize separately. Several studies have suggested that perceived risk and benefit are not independent <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>, but that people instead tend to judge an inverse relationship between perceived risks and perceived benefit. Fischhoff et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> also reported a consistent association between perceived benefit and acceptable level of risk. Perception of benefits revolves around producers, consumers, health, and societal issues, while risks are extended to include long-term effects on human health, the environment, and societal and moral issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>. The encouragement variable in this study reflects support towards the GM product or the overall attitude or acceptability of a GM application. This dimension has been introduced and repeatedly used by the Eurobarometer time series surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref> and other researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>.</p><p>According to Verdurme and Viaene <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> and Costa-Font et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, a consumer's knowledge about GM technology can play a role in determining their risk and benefit perception towards GM foods. On the other hand, other studies have proved that acceptance of modern biotechnology by the public may not be related to awareness at all. Frewer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref> stressed that people were able to judge whether GM technology is useful or risky regardless of whether they were aware of the technology. Chen and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> further showed that factual knowledge about gene technology was not related to the perceived benefits of GM foods and was only weakly related to their perceived risks. Bauer <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> concluded that in controversial issues, knowledge is not related at all to positive attitudes but attitude that are based on knowledge will be held more strongly. Bucchi and Neresini <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> also reported that the better informed public will be more likely to be more critical in evaluating modern biotechnology applications. Costa-Font et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> suggested the differentiation between 'objective knowledge', which refers to people's real knowledge about GM food, and 'subjective knowledge' which ascribe people's perception of what they know about GM foods. Subjective knowledge has been reported to be more related to general attitudes, values and acceptance of GM foods compared to objective knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>. The variable, familiarity has been recognized and demonstrated to be an important dimension in risk perception studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>. Because familiarity with GM food was found to have a positive effect on its acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> as well as it represent subjective knowledge, the dimension of familiarity is included in this model. Kirk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> suggested that familiarity comprised several items related to the ease of identifying a product that contains risky substances, whether the risk is known to science and whether people have control over eating a particular product.</p><p>Furedi <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> stressed that risk perception at the individual and societal level are affected by moral values. If a product was perceived as worthy and not having moral concerns, people would be willing to accept its associated risks to a certain extent. Gaskell et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> proposed moral acceptability as the veto predictor for the encouragement of several biotechnology applications. People from the United States were also found to use moral reasoning in their perception of six biotechnology applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. A study by Einseidel <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> showed that moral acceptance was the strongest predictor for encouragement of animal cloning. Chen and Li <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> have suggested that an additional attitudinal indicator related to acceptance of GM food from religious beliefs or customs should be included in future studies. Amin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> reported that the stakeholders in Malaysia have claimed to have high attachment to their religion. The Canadian Trade Commissioner Service <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> also highlighted that Malaysians of all faiths are usually deeply attached to their religion. So in this study, the variable of religious acceptance has been added to represent the specific moral acceptance of GM food in Malaysia. The more general moral concerns have been conceptualized as threatening the natural order of things, because past studies have associated the moral aspects of GM products with interfering with nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> and being seen as playing God <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>.</p><p>General attitude and values. GM foods are new to the food scene and people are expected to have difficulties in conceiving them as concrete product entities. Instead people tended to apply their more general attitudes to evaluate new and unfamiliar foods <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. The general attitudinal variables included in the theoretical model of this study were general promise and concern of modern biotechnology, biotechnology regarded as threatening natural order of things, attitude towards labeling (the need for labeling), confidence in regulation, attitude to patenting, and societal value.</p><p>Pardo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> have identified general promise and reservations (concerns) as two important schemas for the European people's attitude towards biotechnology. They reported that the general promise schema as the strongest predictor of perceived benefits of biotechnology application and inversely related to perceived risk. On the other hand, the reservation schema was found to be positively related to perceived risk of biotechnology application. Past studies have shown that moral concerns as an important determinant for the support of GM foods <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. In this study, the specific moral concerns have been conceptualized as religious acceptability. Some researchers have highlighted that modern biotechnology in general has been seen as threatening the natural order of living things <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>. Taking the lead from the structure proposed by Pardo and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, a general schema for moral concerns is included in this framework and termed as biotechnology regarded as threatening the natural order of things.</p><p>Societal value (nature versus materials) has been shown to predict encouragement of six biotechnology applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and has exerted considerable influence on both perceived risk magnitude and risk acceptance of technological risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. People who are more inclined towards materials were found to be more supportive of biotechnology applications compared to those with nature inclined attitude.</p><p>Most of the time people cannot directly assess the benefit and risks of GM food and they have to depend on information provided by experts or others resources. Therefore consumers have to depend on experts and institutions in managing risks associated with technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Past studies confirmed that consumers' trust in science and institutions involved in gene technology regulation is related to their perception of risks and benefits of gene technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79]</ref>. Bucchi and Neresini <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> highlighted that inadequate governance of innovation led to public rejection of some biotechnology applications. Past studies have proved the association of trust on related institutions with perceived benefits of GM foods but there has been no study to test the effect of confidence on GMOs regulation. In this framework, confidence on regulation is incorporated to assess its influence on the specific attitude variables.</p><p>Potrykus <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> reported that the patenting right of scientists has become a serious issue for GM technology. Uzogara <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref> has highlighted the possibilities that patenting might allows big corporations to monopolize GM plants and animals besides patenting is said to violate the sanctity of life. Many critics also oppose the fact that seeds are now regarded as propriety products, moreover with the 'terminator gene' technology which renders the seeds sterile <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. The farmers are force to buy new seeds each year from multinational companies instead of sowing seeds from previous years' harvest. Labeling is an important source of information so that consumers know the ingredients in the food they consume <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref>. Although the main function of labels is to provide information but labelling may also function as a cue for product safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85]</ref>. Although some consumers may use labelling to avoid biotechnology products, others may perceive the explicit labelling as a sign of the manufacturers' confidence in the product's safety. Wansink &amp; Kim <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref> highlighted the important of providing consumers a sense of control over their choices. When their confusion about what and how to choose diminishes, the consumers will be more comfortable and confident in accepting biotechnology. There has been no attempt to study the influence of these two variables in earlier models on attitude towards GM foods. Due to their importance, attitude towards patenting and labeling were included in the model to assess their influence on the specific attitude towards GM salmon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>The research data were obtained through face-to-face surveys of 434 adults (aged 18 years and above) residing in the Klang Valley region from August 2009 to February 2010. The Klang Valley was chosen to be the study area because it is the center of Malaysia's economic and social development, and because the people who reside there meet the study's requirement of diversity among respondents. The respondents were selected based on stratification according to stakeholders' groups. The groups selected included producers (5.8%), policy makers (9.0%), scientists (7.4%), nongovernmental organizations (6.0%), media (6.7%), university students (10.1%), religious scholars (Muslim 9.9%, Christian 7.8%, Buddhist 7.4%, Hindu 7.8%) and consumers (22.1%). Since the respective populations for the stakeholders involved were unknown, the respondents were chosen using stratified purposive sampling as recommended by Monroe &amp; Monroe <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. This technique allows comparisons among respondents from different stakeholder groups that might otherwise be underrepresented if random sampling was used. Sixty-two per cent of the respondents were female and 38% male, ages ranged from 18-64 years, the majority (62.9%) of respondents had tertiary level education, and 23.5% had pre-university education or diploma holders while the remaining 13.6% had at least secondary level education. The survey approach used was based on the conventional multiple indicator proposed by Kelly <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> to make it easier for the respondents to answer and to reduce measurement errors. The questionnaires were conducted face-to-face by trained graduate enumerators. Before answering, the respondents were first briefed with an introduction to basic concepts of genetic engineering and development of GM salmon. Participation of the respondents in this study was voluntary and anonymous. Ethic approval was not needed for this study as under the Guidelines for Ethical Review of Clinical Research or Research involving human subjects, Ministry of Health Malaysia <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>, research involving questionnaires with no collection of identifiable private information would be exempted from the Medical Review and Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health Malaysia. Although informed consent was also exempted for research in this category, verbal informed consent was asked before the respondents answered the questionnaires and was recorded by the enumerators. The research data could not be deposited in a public resource as this project is funded by the Malaysian government but the data is available upon request from the corresponding author.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) is known to be powerful multivariate analysis techniques to detect causal relationships among variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[105,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">107]</ref>. The structural equation model in this study was developed on the basis of previous research findings as well as correlations among variables. The model was designed according to the assumed influenced variables as proposed by Pardo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. A single step SEM analysis as recommended by Hair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[108]</ref> was carried out to estimate the measurement and structural model using AMOS version 5.0 software with maximum likelihood function.</p><p>Testing of the measurement model. Before testing the proposed model with SEM, Gursory and Rutherford <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[109]</ref> recommended the assessment of the unidimensionality of each construct to ensure that each set of indicators has only one underlying trait or construct in common. In this study, unidimensionality of the overall measuring instrument was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Cronbach's alpha. Only items or indicators with factor loadings minimally 0.30 <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[110]</ref> or item-total correlation at least 0.3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[111]</ref> were considered acceptable.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the results of CFA for the measurement scale of attitude towards GM salmon using maximum likehood estimation. The analysis yielded 12 meaningful item groupings or constructs with strong unambiguous loadings. The three types of reliabilities measured in this paper are internal consistency (Cronbach alpha), item reliability and construct reliability. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the majority of the constructs were considered good (above 0.70; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The corrected item-total correlations for all items in each dimension were very good (correlation coefficients greater than 0.5; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The construct reliability is represented by the composite reliabilities and the variance extracted. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, it can be seen that the composite reliabilities for all constructs were above 0.7 and the variance extracted were all above 0.50, indicating good construct reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[108]</ref>. The convergent validity was assessed by the factor loadings and composite reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[108]</ref>. The standardized loadings of all factors were greater than 0.7, and the composite reliabilities for all factors were also above 0.7, indicating good convergent validity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Testing of the structural model. After confirming the unidimensionality of the measurement scale, SEM was carried out for the proposed model. A single step SEM analysis as proposed by Hair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[112]</ref> was carried out to estimate simultaneously the structural and measurement models using AMOS version 5.0 software with maximum likehood function. The model generation strategy as recommended by Joreskog and Sorbom <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[113]</ref> was used to specify the model in this study but the modifications of the nested models were only carried out when they were substantively meaningful. A series of five nested models were tested to identify the best model for attitude towards GM salmon (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The first model was developed and specified according to the theoretical framework described earlier. Forty-two hypotheses were formulated from significant bivariate correlations at p,0.05 among the 12 factors as can be seen in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. In the second model, nineteen of the forty-two proposed paths (parameters) that were nonsignificant were eliminated. In SEM, it has been suggested to remove non-significant parameters of the original model and to add additional paths suggested by the modification index to improve the model fit as long it does not contradict with theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[109,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">114]</ref>. Additionally, Hair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[108,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">110]</ref> recommended the removal of items with large standardized residual covariances to increase model fit. Eight items with large standardized residual covariances were deleted in the third model. In the fourth model, an additional path suggested by the modification index was included and three additional items with large residuals were further removed in the fifth model. Only 24 hypothesized paths that were statistically significant at the 0.05 probability level or lower were retained in the final model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). According to Hair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[110]</ref> and Arbuckle and Wothke <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[115]</ref>, a well fitting model should have goodness-of-fit index (GFI), comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) values greater than 0.90, and a root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) value of less than 0.05 supported with a narrow confidence interval. The final model was found to have a good fit with x 2 / df = 1.565, CFI of 0.954, GFI of 0.902, TLI of 0.948 and RMSEA of 0.037 with a 90% confidence level in the range of 0.032-0.041.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attitude</head><p>Overall, the Malaysian stakeholders in the Klang Valley were more inclined towards nature (mean score of 3.35). They perceived modern biotechnology as moderately threatening to the natural order of things (mean score of 3.75), recognized the high promise that modern biotechnology could provide to society (mean score of 5.38) and highly acknowledged the patenting rights of the scientists and producers (mean score of 5.28) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>). However, they also professed their moderate concerns about modern biotechnology (mean score of 4.49) and expressed a strong need for the proper labeling of modern biotechnology products (mean score of 5.74). They exhibited a moderate level of confidence in government regulations on modern biotechnology (mean score of 4.12). The respondents claimed that they were not particularly familiar with GM salmon (mean score below the mid-point value of 4.0) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>). This finding is not surprising as modern biotechnology has been labeled as being 'novel' and 'complex'  with only a moderate level of awareness and knowledge among the public <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[116]</ref>, no mandatory labeling of modern biotechnology products in Malaysia and limited periodic coverage on modern biotechnology issues in the Malaysian general mass media <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. This situation is not unique to Malaysians. The public in the United Kingdom was also found to have low familiarity with GM foods <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. The Taiwanese were reported to eat many GM foods but they did not know it <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and the population in the United States also did not realize that modern biotechnology has been part of their foods <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[117]</ref>. Demirci <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[118]</ref> found that only 49% of their respondents thought they had seen GM foods at supermarkets while shopping and only 41% expressed that they had consumed GM foods. GM salmon was perceived as being moderately beneficial (mean score of 3.90), moderately risky (mean score of 4.07), and moderately acceptable from the respondents' religious perspectives (mean score of 4.65), and was moderately encouraged (mean score of 4.70) by the Malaysian respondents (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>). The level of support for GM salmon among the Malaysian stakeholders was slightly more positive than that of other stakeholders worldwide. Grimsrud et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> reported that consumers in Norway needed a 56% discount to willingly accept GM salmon over non-GM salmon. A more worldwide study carried out by Menozzi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> indicated that the experts and producers in their study believed that the acceptance of GM salmon by consumers worldwide was below the mid-point score of 5.0 (mean score of 2.43) while the mean score for the acceptance by producers worldwide was only 2.29.</p><p>Comparing GM salmon that involves same-species gene transfer in fish (Chinook salmon's growth gene into Atlantic salmon) with gene transfers in plants, it was found that GM salmon was less encouraged than plant-to-plant gene transfer in Malaysia <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> but was more acceptable than the transfer of a higher animal's gene into a plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>). This pattern of acceptance can be explained by the balancing relationship of the factors determining the encouragement of a GM product (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). If the application is perceived as more acceptable from the respondents religious perspective, the risk is rated as lower and the benefits as higher, and the GM product is considered more familiar, which in the end translates to the product being more encouraged by the stakeholders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determining factors</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the final structural model of public attitude towards GM salmon. The model have a good fit with x 2 / df = 1.565, a CFI of 0.954, a GFI of 0.902, a TLI of 0.948 and an RMSEA of 0.037 with a 90% confidence level in the range of 0.032-0.041. However, because a model generation strategy was used in this study, it must be acknowledged that the resulting model is in part data driven, but efforts have been taken to include only substantively meaningful modifications that do not contradict existing theory as recommended by Hair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[108,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">110]</ref>. Various fit indexes have been chosen to adhere to standard practices in SEM and to account for sensitivity of SEM to the sample size and model misspecification. The chi-square test was carried out as it is considered essential in SEM studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[120]</ref> but, as expected, there was no significance owing to the large sample size. Bentler and Bonnet <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[121]</ref> and Joreskog <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[122]</ref> highlighted this issue where the chi-square statistic always rejects the model when large samples are used. The GFI was also reported to measure the extent to which the specified model is able to reproduce the sample covariance matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[123]</ref>. Although the GFI has been widely used in the SEM literature, it has been reported to be insufficiently and inconsistently sensitive to model misspecification and strongly Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. The correlation matrix among the factors in the research model. affected by sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[124]</ref>. To address the impact of sample size on the model, normed chi-square (x 2 /df) and incremental fit indexes such as the CFI <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[125]</ref> and TLI <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[126]</ref> were included. As proposed by Hu and Bentler <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[127]</ref> and MacCallum and Austin <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[128]</ref>, the RMSEA is also embraced in this study to address any model misspecification problem; additionally, it has been proved to be able to generate an appropriate conclusion on the model quality and the availability of confidence interval that can provide important information about the precision of the estimate of fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[127]</ref>. Despite the effort taken to address SEM sensitivity, it is only appropriate to acknowledge the limitation of this model with respect to sampling effects, measures and occasions. The model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is valid in reflecting the Malaysian stakeholder attitude towards GM salmon, and the generalization of this model beyond this population is uncertain as the respective populations for the stakeholders involved were mostly unknown. The model was generated using a combined sample of various stakeholder representatives owing to the limitation of getting more respondents to represent categories of stakeholders such as producers, policy makers, NGOs and religious experts and because the respective populations of the stakeholders involved were mostly unknown. Nonetheless, the model is able to provide an initial picture of the important factors influencing the Malaysian stakeholder attitude towards GM salmon. In future work, this model should be crossvalidated with more specific stakeholder groups. With respect to measures, the model is valid using the measured variables chosen in this study. Several steps have been taken into consideration with regard to the choice of indicators to represent latent variables. The indicators were developed according to the results of past studies and, when available, existing indicators were used. Standard testing for the validity and reliability of the measures were carried out and only good indicators were retained. The effect of occasions of measurement should be noted. The effects of the identified variables may vary over time and further research should be carried out for different time lags to better understand the influence of time.</p><p>The model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows that perceived risk and religious acceptance are found to be the two most important direct predictors for the encouragement of GM salmon. Perceived risk is negatively associated with religious acceptance (b = 20.37) and encouragement (b = 20.28), while religious acceptance is positively associated with encouragement (b = 0.27). This result indicates that the Malaysians public's support towards GM salmon is mainly determined by their risk perception and religious acceptability. Only when GM salmon is considered as having low risks, it will be more acceptable from their religious point of view and translates to it being more encouraged. This finding is in contrast with the Malaysians attitude towards GM crop <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and the Taiwanese attitude towards GM foods <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. For GM crop, perceived benefit is the strongest predictor of its encouragement. It seems that the Malaysians are more concerns about the genetic modification of animal compared to plant. The experts in Menozzi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> study believed that GM salmon has more risks than benefits. Salmon farming have been identified by as the cause for diseases, pollution from waste effluents and pressure on wild fish stocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[129,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">130]</ref>. For issue that they are more worried, they use perceived risk and moral consideration (religious acceptance) as determinants of their support. When they perceived GM salmon as risky, they are also not accepting of GM salmon from their religious perspectives. Malaysians identify themselves as being highly religious, where religion plays an important role in their day-to-day decision making processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Amin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> have also highlighted the importance of religiosity in their assessment of the general promises and concerns of modern biotechnology. Majority of the Malaysian respondents are Muslims whose views are governed by the Islamic law (syariah) <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[131]</ref>. For a GM food to  be accepted by the Muslims, the food must be proven safe to the five purposes of syariah: preservation of religion, health, progeny, intelligence and wealth. The religious acceptance variable introduced in the model is a new factor that has not been included in other attitude towards GM food models. Therefore in countries like Malaysia and those with a similar culture, it is important to consider religious perspectives on GM food.</p><p>Although risk perception emerged as the dominant predictor of support for GM salmon in Malaysia, benefit still play a significant role in the Malaysians' attitude. As can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, perceived benefit is significantly associated with the encouragement of GM salmon (b = 0.14). The presence of clear benefits of GM salmon to the Malaysian public will enhance their support. This is in line with Brehdahl's research <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[132]</ref> which concluded that consumers attitude to GM foods is determined by the weighing up of their perceived risks and benefits. Both are determinants of attitude towards GM foods but their weightage differ according to different GM products. Surprisingly in this study, there was no significant relationship between perceived risk and perceived benefit of GM salmon. Although many studies reported an inverse relationship between the two variables and suggested that risk and benefit perceptions might represent the same feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">133]</ref> but Traill et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[134]</ref> found that risk and benefit perceptions are not perfectly correlated and suggested separate measurement. The finding of this study suggests that in a culture where the role of religion plays an important part in decision making, the stakeholders assessed perceived risks and benefits independently. This confirms the suggestion by Bredahl <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and Connor and Siegrist <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> that there are cross-cultural differences in consumers' perception of the risks and benefits of GM foods.</p><p>Familiarity is positively associated with religious acceptance (b = 0.52) and encouragement of GM salmon (b = 0.16). When GM salmon is perceived as more familiar by the Malaysian respondents, it would be more acceptable from their religious perspective and is more encouraged by them. This finding is also supported by previous research on the public perception of GM technology. Italian consumers who claimed to be more familiar with GM food were also found to have positive attitudes towards the food <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. Bredahl <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[135]</ref> also reported that perceived knowledge of genetic modification played a significant role in the acceptance of GM foods. Knowledge has been found to be an important factor in positive attitudes towards food among US, UK and French consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. However, it should be noted that the variable familiarity in this study consisted of two items reflecting personal control: whether it is easy to identify GM goods and whether it is easy to judge whether it is good or bad to consume GM food. In most studies related to attitude towards GM foods, objective knowledge have been tested <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>. This study affirmed the recommendation by House et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> and Costa-font et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> that subjective knowledge is the more important determinant for public acceptance of GM foods. However in addition to being subjective, this study has proved that it is not their perception of the ''content knowledge'' that is important but rather their perception of being able to differentiate whether the food is good or bad and whether they have control whether to eat them or not. The variable familiarity or 'control' has been frequently included in risk perception of different kind of hazards related to technology, life styles, environmental issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref> but not very frequently associated with GM foods. Genetic engineering is relatively a new technology that many people are not familiar with. Therefore there is a need to enhance the Malaysian people's familiarity with GM foods that can be achieved through knowledge enhancement in order for them to make informed judgement about GM foods. However in the case of GM food, the process of acquiring knowledge is not straightforward <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Costa-Font et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> recommended three interrelated elements that must be considered: substantial reliable and accurate content, trust in information sources and the communication of the information. Scientists, being perceived as trustworthy by the public can play a prominent role in supplying accurate and reliable information to the media in Malaysia. The provision of labeling can provide accurate information and increase individual perception of personal control over the consumption of GM food <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[136]</ref>. From the model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, it can be seen that the need for labeling is positively related to familiarity (b = 20.15). The respondents who stressed the high need for labeling of modern biotechnology products were those who were less familiar with GM salmon. Currently labeling of GM foods in Malaysia is not mandatory. Nevertheless it is encouraged that the GM foods industries to label their products to be marketed in Malaysia in order to increase public confidence in the product safety. When food industries provide consumers with the feeling of control over their food choices, confusion about what and how to choose will diminish and consumers will be more comfortable and confident in accepting GM food.</p><p>The Malaysian public general attitude and values were found to have influences on their attitude towards GM salmon. Among the general attitudinal variables, general promise of biotechnology was the only variable that had direct positive association with encouragement of GM salmon (b = 0.28). It was also positively associated with religious acceptance (b = 0.26) but negatively associated with perceived risk (b = 20.21; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). When the Malaysian respondents perceived the general promises of modern biotechnology as high, they also tended to regard GM salmon as less risky and were more accepting of GM salmon from their religious perspective which translated to them being were more encouraging of the product. In order for products of GM technology to be accepted, people must have a positive image of the technology in general. This association between process and products of GM technology has been explained by Bredahl <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. On the other hand, general concern was positively associated with perceived risk (b = 0.29). Those who perceived modern biotechnology as having more concerns tended to perceive products of biotechnology such as GM salmon as highly risky too. The results of this study suggest that the Malaysians' broad general perception about biotechnology have direct effect on how they perceived GM salmon. It is expected that not all citizens of Malaysia would have a good understanding of specific applications of modern biotechnology but the informed public would have some general perceptions of biotechnology due to the cumulative effect of media coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p><p>Individual values have been reported to affect their attitude towards a product <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>. In this study, the factor of threatening the natural order of things was positively associated with general concern (b = 0.52) and perceived risk (b = 0.25; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This result reveals that when the Malaysian respondents viewed modern biotechnology as highly threatening the natural order of things, they tended to regard it as having high concerns and its products, such as GM salmon, were also perceived as highly risky. GM technology has often been associated with interference with nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> and being seen as playing God <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Malaysians claimed that they are highly religious <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. It is expected that people who are highly religious would be more concerns on the moral aspects of GM technology. Sjoberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> noticed a strong positive correlation between interfering with nature and perceived risk of genetic engineering. This study proves that moral aspects of modern biotechnology had significant influence on how people perceive specific application and product of GM technology such as GM salmon. The influence of values on attitude formation is supported by the 'means-end' theory which links product perceptions to consumers' values <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Confidence on regulation was positively associated with familiarity (b = 0.32) and perceived benefit (b = 0.28). The Malaysian respondents who were more confident in the regulation of GMOs tended to be more familiar with GM salmon and perceived it as having high benefits. This result is supported by earlier researchers. Gutteling et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[137]</ref> reported that the Dutch public who have higher trust in the governance of GM food tended to be more positive towards GM foods. Trust in key players, such as scientists and the government have also been shown to be related to acceptance of GM technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">138,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">139]</ref> and its benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">140]</ref>. Confidence in regulation was also positively correlated with patenting (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The Malaysian respondents who had high confidence in the regulation of modern biotechnology also supported the patenting of modern biotechnology products by the industries. Because of the positive influence of confidence on regulation on benefit perception, it is important that the Malaysian government be transparent and highly responsible in regulating the development and safe use of GM foods in Malaysia. Improper use of GM technology can be avoided with the presence of adequate regulations and effective monitoring systems. Once proper safety assurance mechanism is in place, it will build up public trust on the government and its governance and will increase their confidence to accept GM foods.</p><p>Societal value was positively associated with religious acceptance (b = 0.11) but negatively associated with perceived risk (b = 20.12). The Malaysian public who were more inclined towards materials tended to perceive GM salmon as less risky. The association between materialistic value and perceived risk is not unique to the Malaysian society as earlier researchers in western countries have proven that societal value exerted considerable influence on both perceived risk magnitude and acceptance of technological risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[141]</ref>. Gaskell et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> reported that supporters of GM foods in Europe were those who believed in free market economic values, while those who were more concerned about the nature and environment were the rejecters. However it is interesting to note the association between materialistic value and religious acceptance, confidence on regulation and the need for labeling which has not been studied before. From Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> it can be deducted that the Malaysians who were more materialistic will be more accepting of GM salmon from their religious point of view. This category of people will have higher confidence on gene technology regulation and stress less need for labeling of GM products.</p><p>Attitude to patenting was positively associated with general promise (b = 0.36). The Malaysian respondents who were highly supportive of the patenting of modern biotechnology products also perceived modern biotechnology as having high general promise. This factor has not been included in earlier studies. Even though there has been issues of patenting of gene technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, this study shows that the Malaysian people are more open minded in nature. They acknowledged the rights of the scientists and industries to patent their innovation and to cover the developmental costs of GM products. On the other hand, patenting was also positively correlated with the need for labeling. Although the Malaysian people recognized the patenting rights of the GM food developers, they insisted on their rights to information on the food that they eat.</p><p>The need for labeling was negatively associated with familiarity (b = 20.15). The Malaysian respondents who stressed a great need for labeling of modern biotechnology products were those who were less familiar with GM salmon. The influence of this factor on attitude to GM foods has not been tested in past studies. The need for labeling was also found to be positively associated with general promise (b = 0.22) and general concern of modern biotechnology (b = 0.31). This finding seems to reflect the main function of labeling in providing information either related to the benefits of the ingredients labeled or vice versa. Wansink and Kim <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref> stressed the role of labeling as a signal of product safety. Some consumers might use labeling to avoid GM foods, but others may interpret labeling as the manufacturer's evidence for a product's safety. Once people felt confidence on the safety of GM foods, they will perceive the technology as promising, have less concerns and will be more accepting of them. Past study has shown two different effect of labeling. Some studies showed no change in consumers' attitude by increased product information <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[136,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">142,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">143]</ref>. On the other hand, other studies quoted a positive effect of giving additional information that involve clear consumer benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">144]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In Malaysia, GM salmon was found to be moderately encouraged by stakeholders. The acceptance of GM salmon is determined by the balancing of the factors identified from the structural equation model developed in this study. The most significant finding in this study is the identification of specific application-linked perceptions about the religious acceptability as an important determinant of the encouragement of GM salmon besides perceived risks. It is important to highlight that for a country like Malaysia where religion plays an important part in their daily life and decision making, the factor religious acceptance should be seriously considered and assessed. The failure to do this will results in incomplete consideration of their major concerns related to GM foods. It is suggested that more in-depth studies on religious perspective of GM foods should be carried out to understand the reasoning behind the acceptance or rejection of GM foods.</p><p>There is a need to consider the balancing role of risk and benefits. In a country where religion plays a major role in decision making and when a GM application raises more concerns, perceived risk is a more prominent factor that needs to be look into in contrast with a GM application that have less concerns such as GM plant, perceived benefits will be the more dominant factor. The results of the study also suggest subjective knowledge (familiarity) that relates to personal control is more important than objective knowledge in relation to the acceptance for a complex issue such as GM foods. The factor of familiarity, which has rarely been included in attitudinal studies on GM foods, should be considered for inclusion in future studies.</p><p>Encouragement of GM salmon involves interplay between general attitudinal and value factors such as the general promise of and concerns about biotechnology, confidence in regulation, and societal values, which confirms the findings of earlier research on GM foods. Additional general schemas such as attitude to labeling and patenting and threatening the natural order of things, which have rarely been included in past studies, have been shown to shape attitudes towards GM salmon. These factors should also be considered in future research to understand their role in shaping public acceptance of GM foods.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
