<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Employees' behavior and corporate social responsibility (CSR) can affect firms' profitability and increase the corporate economic burden. This current research endeavors to explore how business firms navigate employees' technology-driven behavior and CSR sustainable practices for tax avoidance to affect firms' performance. This study examines how CSR sustainable practices moderate the relationship between employees' behavior and tax avoidance to achieve sustainable business performance. The study incorporated the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) for the purpose of data analysis using the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique that is suitable for this sample size. The study's target population is employees of small and medium enterprises located in Pakistan. The study has drawn a sample of employees and applied a convenience sampling technique. The findings show that tax avoidance, employee behavior, and corporate social responsibility positively affect business firms' performance. The results further indicate that sustainable CSR practices significantly moderate tax avoidance's effect on business firms' performance. However, there is no condition to identify the relationship between employee behavior and firm performance. In theory, this research contributes to the corporate strategy literature by answering how corporate social responsibility sustainable practices mediate the relationship between tax avoidance, employees' behavior, and sustainable business performance. It shows that socially responsible organizations will engage less in tax avoidance behaviors. The results exhibit that the study provides a systematic, holistic framework to attain sustainable firms' performance. The findings' generalizability offers future direction with helpful insights for business managers and policymakers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Corporate tax is a significant contributor to the economic growth in technology-enabled circular economy practices. It is considered a vital feature of corporate social responsibility; however, some business firms keep their tax payments to retain extra profit margins <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Khuong et al., 2020)</ref>. Business firms indulge in tax avoidance to enhance shareholders' wealth, a substantially workable corporate strategy for the sustainable production of goods <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Armstrong, Blouin, Jagolinzer &amp; Larcker, 2015)</ref>. Tax avoidance has a significant impact on corporate firm performance and society as a whole. Thus, it is essential to explore the effects in-depth and see how a technology-enabled circular economy documents sustainable practices of CSR to attain healthier business performance. Conventionally, tax avoidance is an organizational tactic that transfers government wealth to organizations, contributing to the overall firm performance through financial stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Khuong et al., 2020)</ref>. Henceforth, subjective evidence indicates that tax avoidance has an unavoidable effect on sustainable firm performance, particularly from the perspective of wealth. In contrast, tax avoidance has certain costs associated. These costs include damage to reputation, cost of implementation, and legal action if authorities identify these practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Hardeck and Hertl, 2014)</ref>. Organizations should therefore decide whether to indulge in tax avoidance based on the associated costs and benefits.</p><p>Scholars see business firms' performance as a broader perspective, covering the overall achievement of organizations that is often reflected in organizational, environmental, and social activities. At a narrower level, corporate performance results from the functions and operations performed by an organization through adequate human resources, relationships with stakeholders, and sustainable practices of corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. Organizational performance is primarily studied from a financial perspective. However, other determinants can affect non-financial performance, such as e-marketing strategy, word of mouth (WoM), goal achievement, customer retention, reduced employee turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Spillan and Parnell, 2006)</ref>. Consequently, it is essential to stretch the boundaries of sustainable business performance through sustainable practices of organizations' social performance, tax strategy, and social responsibility.</p><p>Employees are a crucial strength in an organization, and their behavior is critical in shaping the work environment across the organization. Organizations that experience employees' positive emotions at work, such firms show sustainable and enhanced business performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Goswami et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Burić and Macuka, 2018)</ref>. Organizations need to ensure that employees have a good relationship with leadership at the operational level. It helps the organization achieve positive and beneficial staff behavior for attaining sustainable financial performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Xi, Zhao, and Xu (2017)</ref> argue that a well-structured organization makes the work environment more comfortable and helps gain enhanced business performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Xi et al., 2016)</ref>. High-performing organizations have shown that employee behavior is an essential determinant of their success, and sustainable and balanced HR policies maintain a positive attitude of the employees.</p><p>Organizations are under increasing pressure to manage and assess their social responsibilities properly. Consequently, organizations are more inclined to devote resources and time to the sustainable practice of CSR to ensure mutual expectations and the interests of stakeholders. The main stakeholders of sustainable practices of CSR are government agencies, civil society, and customers who facilitate business relationship management. An intense display of sustainable practices of CSR activities has a significant impact on overall organizational performance and corporate image. However, disagreements remain about taking up such socially responsible actions. It is due to the high cost of implementing CSR sustainable practices, which contradicts the organization's primary goal of maximizing profits <ref type="bibr">(Ikram Sroufe, Mohsin, Solangi, Shah and Shahzad, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Past literature has not shown greater level of research exploring the relationship between tax avoidance and firm performance in developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Khuong et al., 2020)</ref>. Various research fields of the studies have chosen their tax avoidance methods, such as finance, economics, and accounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Hanlon and Heitzman, 2010)</ref>. There is a lack of discrete and multidisciplinary frameworks addressing tax avoidance's impact on sustainable business performance from an HR perspective. Past research studies have examined the relationship between sustainable corporate social responsibility practices, organizational growth, and tax avoidance on financial performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Mao and Wu, 2019)</ref>. Some studies have emphasized exploring the influence of tax avoidance and sustainable practices of CSR on firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Hasseldine and Morris, 2013)</ref>. Past literature has not shown any comprehensive studies examining the impact of tax avoidance and employee behavior on sustainable firm performance. In addition, there is room for assessing CSR sustainable practices to enrich quantitative research by examining the moderating role of CSR. Accordingly, this research study expands on the sparse literature on organizational behavior by examining the inclusive impact of corporate social responsibility on sustainable corporate performance, taking into account tax avoidance and employee behavior in organizations. This novel research framework contributes to the growing literature on sustainable firm performance in the Pakistani context. An organization's employee behavior and sustainable corporate social responsibility practices are vital for controlling environmental challenges to safeguard firms' social responsibility for a green environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LITERATURE REVIEW Tax Avoidance and Firm Performance</head><p>Scholars have debated the core issue of tax avoidance, which determines the legal use of the public tax system for a firm's or one's benefit to reduce the payable tax amount through means within the law <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Maydew et al., 2008)</ref>. A tax shelter is one tax avoidance form, while a tax haven is a jurisdiction that promotes tax cuts. Therefore, tax avoidance refers to a condition of tax noncompliance or violation, as it describes a range of practices that are detrimental to the national tax system <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Tang et al., 2022)</ref>. A past study describes that tax avoidance is the practice of reducing business firms' tax liabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Chen, Hu, Wang and TAng, 2014)</ref>. Constant growth in a firm's capital, the scale of corporate tax avoidance, and its impact on firm-level and overall economic developments produce a robust case for studying the relationship between corporate social responsibility, employee behavior, corporate tax avoidance, and firm performance. A recent study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Dyreng et al. (2017)</ref> shows that corporate tax avoidance has risen significantly over the 3 decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Dyreng et al., 2017)</ref>. The annual cost of tax avoidance in the U.S. is around $200 billion. Nearly 73% of Fortune 500 companies have different types of subsidiaries in the countries that are tax havens states <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Chen et al., 2022)</ref>. Academic researchers have examined many firm-level features to understand cross-sectional discrepancies in corporate tax avoidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Hasan et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>It is a continuum of corporate tax strategies. It shows legal practices that differs from tax avoidance practice. However, managers also believe in having exploited complex and ambiguous tax avoidance strategies that negatively influence cash flow in some organizations. Similarly, agency theory presents this situation as the cash flow generated by tax avoidance may indicate the occurrence of consumption on behalf of the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Donaldson &amp; Davis, 2016)</ref>. It will lead to reduced cash inflows.in the future, thereby reducing company performance. In addition to reputational damage, tax avoidance can lead to decreased cash flow and increased cost of organizational capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Mao &amp; Wu, 2019)</ref>. Nonetheless, whether tax avoidance positively or negatively affects firm performance remains an empirical question, as there are mixed findings in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Khuong et al., 2020)</ref>. Free cash flow results from tax avoidance, both in the short and long term, and as a result, it affects business performance. These emerging dominant effects are related to certain factors, including the operating sustainable business environment, institutional settings, and the social status of the organization. Therefore, it will be interesting to understand the effect of tax avoidance on firm performance from a human resources perspective. Based on the literature review, the study puts forward the following hypothesized assumptions: H1: There is a significant relationship between tax avoidance and firm performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Employee Behavior and Firm Performance</head><p>Artificial Intelligence systems and technology-enabled employees are productive for organizations. Trained employees perceive and respond to complicated and dynamic industry turbulent environments <ref type="bibr">(Kaplan and Haenlein, 2019)</ref>. Over the past 2 decades, technological innovations have rapidly transformed business firms to expand the scope of their inventions. It was historically a human task. Business Organizational recruit hightech employees for technological innovations that help achieve business success, organizational competitive advantage, and longterm survival. Hence, it requires the implementation of new ideas generated by high-tech employees <ref type="bibr">(Lin et al., 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Afsar, Badir, and Khan (2015)</ref> suggest that motivating firms' employees keep them innovative, and high-tech employees' are creative, and their productive behavior is helpful. Employees' innovative work behavior is one of the perfect ways to encourage business innovation. When introducing technological innovations into the workplace, it is critical to study the factors that influence employee innovative work behavior that brings mental peace, affectiveness, and analytical energy to their role <ref type="bibr">(Belanche et al., 2019)</ref>. However, some studies have indicated that employee perceptions about technological innovations and AI systems vary. Ultimately, companies strive to adapt their strategic decision-making processes to reflect changes in AI systems and technological advancement successfully <ref type="bibr">(Dwivedi et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>An organization's employees are a key component that plays an vital role in organizational business performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Schneider, Yost, Kropp, Kind and Lam, 2018)</ref>. Employee behavior determines how staff performing responsibilities in an organization respond to specific relevant and distinct situations <ref type="bibr">(Bhattacharya, Gibson and Harold, 2005)</ref>. Nevertheless, leadership functions and a firm's employee behavior are crucial for sustainable financial performance. Employee behavior is essential for helping and motivating each other and promoting a positive attitude. The growing literature on firm performance discusses the role of top management behavior in an indirect but positive relationship to financial performance in well-structured business organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Xi, et al., 2017)</ref>. In addition, past research identifies that high-performance work system that value employees even at the operational level tend to impact business performance by shaping employee behavior. Technology-enabled trained employees are helpful for better firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Schmidt, Pohler and Willness, 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Lin, Zhao, and Li (2014)</ref> argue that there is a need for further investigations to explore the mechanisms and conditions that identify the relationship between employees' technology-driven behavior and sustainable firm performance. Consequently, it is worth and valuable steps to examine the behavior of employees at the operational level. Study examines how behaviors influences the organizational system to attain sustainable financial performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Lin et al., 2014)</ref>. With the support of the literature on technology-enabled trained employees, this study formulated the hypotheses on the relationship between employee behavior and sustainable firm performance, as given below.</p><p>H2: There is a significant relationship between technologyenabled trained employee behavior and sustainable firm performance.</p></div>

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) emphasizes firms safeguard the environment while pursuing financial profits <ref type="bibr">(Abbas et al., 2019c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hao and He 2022)</ref>. The sustainable practices of CSR implementation require enterprises to consider stakeholders' interests, including consumers, society, and the environment, while performing their production operations (Golinska-Dawson and Spychała 2018; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Awan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Yang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Ikram et al., 2021)</ref>. In recent times, business firms have faced increasing internal and external coercion to enhance non-financial performance and different dimensions, such as environmental protection challenges, social welfare, employee interest, and acceptable employment practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Awan et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Bhutto et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Cheng et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Rashid Khan et al., 2021)</ref>.

At the same time, the actual sustainable practices of CSR activities on social welfare, employee behavior, and long-term business performance remain unexplored.</p><p>The growing literature lacks systematic evidence estimating the sustainable practices of CSR organizations to produce innovations for solving environmental problems. Business firms engaged in sustainable practices of CSR activities effectively manage relationships with their stakeholders, responsible for creating, developing, and maintaining relationships with productive resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Baumgartner, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Shen and Benson, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Trivellas et al., 2019)</ref>. From a stakeholder's perspective, CSR practices tend to enhance their connection to the company's operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Babiak and Kihl, 2018)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Yang, Paulo and Ahsan (2019)</ref>, companies gain financial stability through profitability when customers and other stakeholders admire their social responsibility activities. It shows that adequate investment in sustainable CSR practices is critical for clients <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Yang et al., 2019)</ref>. CSR practices help improve employee morale which leads to influencing overall business performance.

Therefore, organizations that effectively conduct CSR activities and link strategic resource allocation and stakeholder preferences tend to achieve higher business performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Jang, Ko, Chung and Woo, 2019)</ref>. Accordingly, based on the above debate, the study formulates assumptions about CSR and corporate business performance, as follows.</p><p>H3: There is a significant association between sustainable practices of CSR activities and firm performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderating Role of CSR on Sustainable Firm Performance</head><p>Over the past decades, various studies have extensively examined the concept of sustainable practices related to CSR activities, covering various aspects. These investigations include as CSR components, firms' CSR performance, CSR regulations and their impact on consumers, corporate governance, and even tax avoidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Aras and Crowther, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Baumgartner, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Blanco-Gonzalez et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">del-Castillo-Feito et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Hardeck and Hertl, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Martínez et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Tsourvakas and Yfantidou, 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Mao and Wu (2019)</ref> debate that organizations can maintain their competitive advantage by investing in sustainable practices of CSR activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Mao &amp; Wu, 2019)</ref>. Different organizational factors, primarily strategic risk management and corporate culture, significantly impact how corporate social responsibility practices affect corporate tax avoidance and firm performance. Empirical surveys on sustainable practices of CSR from different perspectives show that responsible CSR activities indicated a negative impact on corporate tax avoidance. However, such evidence comes from developed countries <ref type="bibr">(Ikram et al., 2020)</ref>. Past studies explored sustainable practices of CSR on firms' performance and further examined the relationship by adhering to different scenarios <ref type="bibr">(Zulfiqar, Rabeea, József, Jolita and Domicián 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ahmed, Zehou, Raza, Qureshi, Yousufi, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, this research is necessary to seek empirical evidence from developing countries, such as Pakistan, taking tax avoidance and corporate business performance into account. Past studies investigated CSR's moderating role in tax avoidance and business performance. However, this study measured the opposite relationship. In contrast to previous studies, which only examined the direct effect of CSR on other variables, this study examined whether moderating effects also occurred. This research proposes that tax avoidance directly affects firms' financial performance, and corporate social responsibility moderates the relation between tax avoidance, employee behavior, and sustainable business performance. This research study addresses this newly identified literature gap. The recent literature indicates a potential gap in measuring the relationship between tax avoidance, employee behavior, and firm performance through the moderating role of sustainable practices of CSR to attain sustainable firm performance. Thus, keeping in view the above discussion, this study proposes the following hypotheses: H4: Sustainable practices of CSR moderate the relationship between tax avoidance and sustainable business firm performance.</p><p>H5: Sustainable practice of CSR moderates the relationship between employee behavior and firm's sustainable performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Framework</head><p>The current research study has extensively reviewed the fresh literature and examined the relationship between tax avoidance, employee behavior, and sustainable firm performance. This research survey examines how sustainable practices of corporate social responsibility moderates the relationship between tax avoidance, employee behavior, and sustainable firm performance. This research model contains four chosen variables to describe the proposed framework. This study determined tax avoidance and employee behavior as independent variables (IVs) and sustainable firm performance as a dependent variable (DV). Concurrently, sustainable practices of CSR are the moderating variable. This research framework aims to address the potential literature gaps. This study model appraises the influence of employee behavior, tax avoidance, and sustainable firm performance through the moderating role of CSR practices. The below framework shows a pictorial description indicating the theoretical grounds built in this study. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> below exemplifies a proposed framework.</p></div>

The self-administered scales also recorded participants' (SMEs employees) general profile data, including employees' gender, education, age, profession, and inhabited locations. The investigators invited participants from various regions. The study used designed questionnaires using a five-point Likert scale, with responses ranging from "strongly agree = 5" to "strongly disagree = 1". The investigators approached targeted participants and recruited them to participate in the survey with their consent with their agreed appointments. The study distributed 422 forms to potential respondents and collected data using selfadministered selected questionnaires. The researchers introduced themselves to the participants and explained study protocols to fill out the forms appropriately. Investigators explained to participants that the questions on the scales are equally important.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>This research paper aims to address the identified gaps in the context of tax avoidance and corporate employee behavior through the moderating role of sustainable practices of CSR activities. The present research study performs a systematic analysis of sustainable practices of CSR implications, employee behavior, and tax avoidance to evaluate business firms' reliable, sustainable performance. This research study combines insights from new literature related to corporate governance, finance, and CSR practices to discuss and advance the possible impact of employee behavior and sustainable practices of CSR activities at the firm level on sustainable financial performance. This study primarily emphasizes exploring how CSR practices moderate the relationship between tax avoidance and employee behavior to achieve sustainable business performance.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> displays the study results regarding the measurement model. Results for the first hypothesis of the study indicate that tax avoidance has a significant positive impact on the firm performance. The findings approve H 1 . Past studies that measured the effect of tax avoidance on business firm performance have reported mixed results. Some studies have indicated that tax avoidance causes a boost in the firm performance by saving money and retaining profits <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Armstrong et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Jiang et al., 2022)</ref>. However, some studies have described that tax avoidance leads to financial and nonfinancial losses to business firms sustainable performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Chen et al., 2014)</ref>. The results show that tax avoidance positively affects sustainable firm performance, which is inconsistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Khuong et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Hasan et al., 2021)</ref>. This finding supports agency theory, which states that shareholders do not always want management to avoid taxes because of the associated costs. Still, companies must declare to reduce information asymmetry with stakeholders, especially shareholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Fuadah et al., 2022)</ref>. As companies are forced to disclose their tax amounts in their financial statements, shareholders will know the amount of tax avoidance the company has promised. These complex transactions allow management to reallocate resources to its own goals and conceal resources from tax authorities. This finding is consistent with the first hypothesis, which stated that tax avoidance positively and substantially affects business firms' performance. It shows that the more tax avoidance, the better the company's performance. Existing research shows that managers who engage in tax avoidance activities generate a positive tax avoidance corporate value relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Shams et al., 2022)</ref>. In contrast, another study shows that corporate tax avoidance implies that tax avoidance is a value-adding activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Armstrong et al., 2012)</ref>. The findings are consistent with many previous studies reporting that tax avoidance reduces the cost of equity, implying that the additional advantage of considerable tax savings from tax avoidance improves firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Shams et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Results for the second hypothesis proposed in the study indicate that employee behavior has a significant positive impact on sustainable firm performance. Therefore, the findings have validated H 2 . These findings are synchronous with the past studies that also advocate the view that organically structured organizations that show healthy employee behaviors are found ahead in the firm performance and outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Lin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Xi et al., 2017)</ref>. This finding shows that employee behavior has a substantial impact on explaining sustainable business performance. The study finding is consistent with the earlier research studies that identified significant effects on employees' overall perceptions of their company's sustainable performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Kim et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Wong et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The results of the third hypothesis of this study show that corporate social responsibility has a significant positive impact on sustainable corporate business performance.

The study findings, considering the impact of sustainable practices of CSR on sustainable firm performance are in line and consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Jang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Abdelfattah &amp; Aboud, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Saha et al., 2020)</ref>. Past studies have reported that sustainable practices of CSR implementation have a strong and direct impact on firm performance. However, these findings contradict the findings of a previous study that identified that CSR disclosure of business organizations led to lower overall firm performance and profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Mao and Wu, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The findings show that sustainable practices of corporate social responsibility moderates the relationship between tax avoidance and sustainable firm performance. The results indicated a negative moderating impact of sustainable practices of CSR to achieve sustainable firm performance, which reveals that tax avoidance has a weak effect on sustainable firm performance. Thus, the results validate H 4 . This insightful outcome shows that business firms become more involved in socially responsible activities and are less likely to engage in tax avoidance. The results are consistent with research that found that organizations with higher CSR-focused activities tended to reduce their tax avoidance behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Lanis and Richardson, 2015)</ref>. However, these findings contradict past research that found CSR to have no moderating role in the relationship between tax avoidance and firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Mao &amp; Wu, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Another study supports the findings of this study, arguing that CSR increases business value by treating all stakeholders fairly and defending their interests. Companies can reduce risks and costs by building appropriate relationships with stakeholders. There may be a competitive advantage. Therefore, a good relationship with all stakeholders always positively influences firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Harjoto and Jo 2011)</ref>. Overall, the results of this study confirm Hypothesis 2: CSR is positively related to corporate performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Rehman et al., 2015)</ref>. A company that increases stakeholder trust through CSR activities ultimately improves business performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Adams 2002)</ref>. The reason for supporting CSR regulations is that businesses demonstrate their obligations to the public by demonstrating their commitment to society and using CSR as a beneficial tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Adams 2002)</ref>. Second, shareholders generally view companies engaged in CSR business as optimistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Freeman and Hasnaoui 2011)</ref>.

Organizational CSR initiatives increase revenue by resolving conflicts between the various interests of the CEO and shareholders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Wang and Chen 2017)</ref>. Managers strive to increase long-term benefits by improving stakeholder relationships, corporate social responsibility practices, and building social trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Godos-Díez et al., 2010)</ref>. Furthermore, stakeholder representatives claim that CSR generates reasonable income for shareholders, and CSR initiatives attract more investment and increase corporate profits <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Jensen 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Sen et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, the study proposed the last hypothesis that indicated a moderating role of CSR practices on the relationship between employee behavior and sustainable firm performance. The results have approved H 5 . Employee behavior is a subjective, personal behavior that may affect a sustainable firm, but many are not affected by external factors such as corporate social responsibility. These findings are consistent with the past studies conducted in a similar context <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Zulfiqar et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ahmed et al., 2020)</ref>. When business firms involve in specific CSR activities, the enterprises create a higher degree of recognition among their employees' behavior, which upsurges sales because customers' purchase increases. Similarly, when business enterprises fail to treat their employees reasonably, the consumers' trust decreases to buy the products from these companies. Past literature documents that CSR practices undermine business firms' corporate reputation as well as brands image <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Oikonomou et al., 2012)</ref>. It also affects business organizations relationships with various stakeholders, which ultimately affects sustainable firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Wei et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Corporate taxation determines an essential milestone for the organization to stand with other socially responsible organizations. However, hoarding tax bucks is also used to preserve additional cash inflows and profit margins. Business organizations implement tax avoidance to increase the wealth of their stakeholders, and literature has reported such practices by the organizations. Business firms incorporate such tax-saving strategies directly or indirectly to improve their financial performance. In such scenarios, employees are involved gaining their personal interests in this phenomenon. Employees are the backbone of organizational structures, and taming and caring for their behavior is critical to having a positive and growing impact on firms' sustainable business performance. Likewise, another crucial organizational factor affecting sustainable business performance is participating in corporate social responsibility activities.</p><p>As the post-pandemic situation worsens, organizations have encountered stress and pressure to assess and demonstrate sustainable, socially responsible behavior. Therefore, organizations are more inclined to invest in human capital and time to achieve sustainable financial performance and profitability. Sustainable corporate social responsibility implication guarantees the common interests and expectations of the organizations and their stakeholders. Accordingly, this research study aimed to investigate further the role of tax avoidance, employee behavior, and sustainable corporate social responsibility practices in achieving sustainable corporate financial performance. The results show that tax avoidance, employee behavior, and corporate social responsibility significantly influence sustainable business performance. It preserves cash inflows, increasing profits, corporate reputation, and image. The study further shows that corporate social responsibility has a negative but significant moderating effect on the relationship between tax avoidance and corporate business performance.</p><p>This research contributes to the fresh literature on organizational behavior and corporate strategy to measure employee behavior theoretically and tax avoidance's influence on corporate financial performance. This study further questions how CSR moderates the relationship between tax avoidance, employee behavior, and corporate performance, suggesting that socially responsible organizations will be less involved in tax avoidance behaviors. In addition, the tax department of an organization is of great importance and benefit in developing a tax strategy that best suits the interests of the organization and the country.
