<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The primary aim of this study was to test the stress process model (SPM; Pearlin, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mullan, Semple, &amp; Skaff, 1990</ref> ) in a racially diverse sample of Alzheimer ' s caregivers (CGs) using structural equation modeling (SEM) and regression techniques. A secondary aim was to examine race or ethnicity as a moderator of the relation between latent constructs (e.g., subjective stressors and role strain) in the SPM. Sample : Participants included White or Caucasian ( n = 212), Black or African American ( n = 201), and Hispanic or Latino ( n = 196) Alzheimer ' s CGs from the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer ' s Caregiver Health (REACH) II clinical trial. Results: SEM revealed that the Pearlin model obtains a satisfactory fi t across race or ethnicity in the REACH II data, despite signifi cant racial differences in each of the latent constructs. Race or ethnicity moderated the impact of resources on intrapsychic strain, such that CGs reported similar intrapsychic strain across race at lower levels of resources, but White or Caucasian CGs reported more intrapsychic strain than Black or African American or Hispanic or Latino CGs when resources are higher. Implications: Strengths and weaknesses for each race or ethnicity vary considerably, suggesting that interventions must target different aspects of the stress process to provide optimal benefi t for individuals of different cultural or ethnic backgrounds.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer ' s disease or a related disorder (ADRD) can have a devastating effect on the emotional and physical well-being of the primary caregiver (CG), as illustrated by the variety of stress process models (SPMs; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pearlin, Mullan, Semple, &amp; Skaff, 1990 )</ref> developed to guide examination of the caregiving process. Many studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dilworth-Anderson, Goodwin, &amp; Williams, 2004 )</ref> have isolated portions of the Pearlin SPM (i.e., context variables, stressors) to predict important CG outcomes such as health, emotional wellbeing, and desire to institutionalize the care recipient (CR). Following the 2006 National Consensus Development Conference, the Family Caregiver Alliance (FCA) published a report suggesting that the Pearlin SPM was a particularly useful tool for both research and practice. The FCA consensus report makes Pearlin ' s original SPM accessible to professionals who work with family CGs by suggesting measures to be used for each construct <ref type="bibr">( FCA, 2006 )</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> , the SPM proposes that caregiving context variables affect each part of the stress process and can have implications for the types of stressors facing CGs, the perception or appraisal of those stressors, and outcomes such as CG depression and perceptions of physical health. Specifi cally, age, gender, employment status, and relationship to the CR affect CG outcomes within the SPM <ref type="bibr">( FCA, 2006 )</ref>. One potentially important variable that is missing from the Pearlin SPM is the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Testing a Theoretical Model of the Stress Process in Alzheimer ' s Caregivers With Race as a Moderator</head><p>race or ethnicity of the CG. Racial or ethnic groups may vary in the perceived intensity of stressors, availability of resources, and use of coping strategies, as well as the relation of stressors, resources, and strategies to CG outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">( Pinquart &amp; Sörensen, 2005 )</ref>.</p><p>In a meta-analysis of caregiving research for a period of 20 years, Dilworth-Anderson, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Williams, and Gibson (2002)</ref> found signifi cant racial or ethnic differences in the caregiving context. For example, Whites or Caucasians were more likely than Blacks or African Americans to utilize only immediate family in caregiving and received more social services. Furthermore, Black or African Americans had more members in their caregiving networks, were more likely to include friends and neighbors as resources, and were more likely to share caregiving responsibilities than were White or Caucasians. Black or African American CGs are also less likely to invoke formal supports than their White or Caucasian counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">( Miller &amp; Guo, 2000 )</ref>. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lawton, Rajagopal, Brody, and Kleban (1992)</ref> found Black or African Americans to have higher levels of mastery, lower subjective burden, and greater satisfaction within the caregiving role. <ref type="bibr">Haley and colleagues (1996)</ref> noted that Black or African American families are more likely than White or Caucasians to view caregiving as a natural part of the life course. Black or African Ameri-cans report lower anxiety, greater religious coping, and less use of psychotropic medications than White or Caucasians <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">( Roff, Burgio, Gitlin, Nichols, &amp; Chaplin, 2004 )</ref>. Many other risk factors for depression, including low self-effi cacy, severity of patient impairment, dissatisfaction with social support, and higher appraisals of stress present differently in Black or African American and White or Caucasian CGs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">( Haley, Lamond, Han, Burton, &amp; Schonwetter, 2003 )</ref>.</p><p>Hispanic or Latino CGs are distinctly different from White or Caucasians and Black or African Americans in ways that may be critical for a better understanding of the stress process. Hispanic or Latino CGs, particularly Mexican American CGs, are more likely to have to quit their jobs to provide care and more often share the caregiving role than other racial or ethnic groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">( Aranda &amp; Knight, 1997 )</ref>. Hispanic or Latino individuals are also at increased risk for diabetes and other illnesses that may produce more debilitating forms of dementia that affect individuals at a younger age than their White or Caucasian or Black or African American counterparts. Moreover, Aranda and Knight reported that Hispanic or Latino individuals access long-term care services at lower rates. Language barriers may increase risk of isolation and lead to reduced access to educational materials regarding protective factors, services, and treatment of illnesses such as diabetes and other risk factors. Despite being exposed to more stressors than White or Caucasian CGs and reporting more hours of care, Hispanic or Latino CGs utilize more religious coping and appear to be more resilient in the face of stress through positive appraisal <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">( Pinquart &amp; Sörensen, 2005 )</ref>.</p><p>Although differences between Black or African Americans and Hispanic or Latinos are numerous, some shared challenges of these ethnic or racial groups merit further exploration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pinquart and Sörensen (2005)</ref> concluded that the literature on informal support and race or ethnicity is mixed. They suggest this might be a result of a cohort effect, with younger generations having less social support than their predecessors. Furthermore, Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino CGs are more likely to be employed in jobs with reduced scheduling fl exibility. They are also more likely to be raising children concurrently with their elder caregiving duties. Notably, these CGs are less likely to be spousal CGs than White or Caucasians and are therefore typically younger in age <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">( Pinquart &amp; Sörensen, 2005 )</ref>. At each level of the stress process, divergent patterns emerge in the existing caregiving literature across races in appraisal, moderating factors, and psychological distress. Yet, these differences have not been jointly examined in a single study utilizing a racially or ethnically diverse group of CGs. Integrating existing knowledge of racial differences into the widely used Pearlin SPM will become increasingly important as racial diversity in the United States continues to increase.</p><p>This study addresses two aims. First, it tests the SPM in its entirety through secondary analysis of the baseline assessment data from the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer ' s Caregiver Health (REACH) II project. Although numerous studies have isolated components of the Pearlin model or tested modifi ed versions, the current study is the fi rst, to our knowledge, to test the entire model without altering its original structure. To test this aim, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the fi t of the SPM measurement model and generate values of the latent constructs. Following this, we used regression techniques to examine the relations among the constructs because it is better suited to examine moderating effects, which are central to the stress process (e.g., the impact of resources at several points in the model). The REACH interventions and assessments were designed within a stress -health framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">( Schulz, Gallagher-Thompson, Haley, &amp; Czaja, 2000 )</ref>, making them well suited to test the SPM. Second, we tested the model with race or ethnicity as a moderator to determine whether the proposed relations among latent constructs varied by race or ethnicity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedure</head><p>We examined secondary data drawn from the baseline assessment for the REACH <ref type="bibr">II (2004</ref><ref type="bibr">II ( -2006;;</ref><ref type="bibr">ClinicalTrials.gov</ref>  Of the 642 CGs included in the study, 33 were excluded due to missing baseline data. The remaining 609 participants were White or Caucasian, n = 212 (34.8%); Black or African American, n = 201 (33%); and Hispanic or Latino, n = 196 (32.2%). Although there are signifi cant differences in age, F (2, 606) = 55.011, p &lt; .001; education, F (2, 606) = 12.137, p &lt; .001; and years providing care, F (2, 606) = 3.826, p = .022, among racial or ethnic groups, individuals who were excluded from the analyses due to missing data did not differ signifi cantly from those included in the analyses.</p><p>Participants were recruited from multiple community organizations, with special attention paid to the recruitment of minority CGs. Caregivers were included if they were at least 21 years old, living with or sharing cooking facilities with the CR, providing an average of 4 or more hours of care per day to a CR with at least two functional impairments of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) or one activity of daily living (ADL) impairment <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">( Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, &amp; Jaffe, 1963 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lawton &amp; Brody, 1969 )</ref>, providing care for at least the last 6 months, and reporting at least two symptoms of distress associated with caregiving <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">( Belle et al., 2006 )</ref>. The CR had to have a diagnosis of ADRD or a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975</ref> ) score of 23 or lower; however, bed-bound CRs with a score of zero on the MMSE were excluded.</p><p>After obtaining informed consent from eligible participants, baseline data were collected during a face-to-face interview. Detailed information about the overall REACH II study, psychometric properties of all measures, recruitment procedures, and intervention outcomes are described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">( Belle et al., 2006 )</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Indicators used to defi ne the latent constructs of the SPM are described subsequently. Our conceptualization and testing of the SPM were guided by Pearlin and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">( Aneshensel, Pearlin, Mullan, Zarit, &amp; Whitlatch, 1995 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pearlin et al., 1990 )</ref> and the FCA ' s consensus report <ref type="bibr">( FCA, 2006 )</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Caregiving Context Variables</head><p>Observed values for the caregiving context were taken from the REACH II baseline interview, including relationship to the CR, age, years providing care, CG gender, education, employment status, and whether the CG was employed outside the home ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> ). Caregivers were coded as either " spouse " or " nonspouse " for the fi nal analyses based on the importance of this distinction in the caregiving literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Miller &amp; Guo, 2000 )</ref>. Unlike other constructs in the model, context variables were not considered to be a unitary construct and were not collapsed into a single latent variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective Stressors</head><p>Objective stressors represent the stimuli or behaviors related to the CR that trigger the emotional response or reaction in the CG (i.e., subjective stressors). We used the following indicators to defi ne the latent variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mini-Mental State</head><p>Examination. -The MMSE measured the cognitive status of the CR by providing a brief assessment of a person ' s orientation to time and place, recall ability, short-term memory, and arithmetic ability. Scores range from 0 to 30, with scores equal to or less than 24 indicating cognitive impairment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">( Folstein et al., 1975 )</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Revised Memory and Behavior Problem</head><p>Checklist -Frequency. -The Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist (RMBPC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Teri et al., 1992 )</ref> assessed the presence of 24 problem behaviors that the CR may have exhibited in the past week (e.g., trouble remembering recent events, asking the same question over and over). Caregivers rated the frequency of problem behaviors on a 4-point scale from 0 = not in the past week to 3 = daily or more often . A sum " frequency of problem behaviors " score is totaled and used as an objective measure of the presence of behavioral problems related to the dementia diagnosis. Cronbach ' s alpha for this sample was .81.</p><p>ADL and IADL Scale -Frequency. -The sevenitem ADL scale (Cronbach ' s alpha in the current sample = .84; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Katz et al., 1963 )</ref> assessed the CR ' s ability to perform basic tasks of daily functioning independently (e.g., bathing, dressing, toileting, eating, grooming, transfer). Similarly, the eight-item IADL scale (Cronbach ' s alpha = .76; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lawton &amp; Brody, 1969 )</ref> assessed the assistance needed to perform higher-level tasks such as shopping, operating the telephone, preparing meals, doing housework or laundry, and managing fi nances or medications. Total level of assistance needed for ADLs and IADLs were summed separately, with higher scores indicating more functional impairment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective Stressors</head><p>Subjective stress included caregiving burden, emotional bother related to providing for the CR ' s daily care needs, behavioral bother, and vigilance.</p><p>RMBPC Conditional Bother Score. -In the presence of a problem behavior (see RMBPC previously), CGs reported how bothered or upset they were by each behavior using a 5-point scale from 0 = not at all to 4 = extremely <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">( Teri et al., 1992 )</ref>. The conditional bother score was calculated by dividing the sum " bother " scores by the total frequency of behavior problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">( Gitlin et al., 2005 )</ref>. The fi nal score had a range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater bother. Cronbach ' s alpha for this sample was .86.</p><p>Zarit Caregiver Burden Inventory. -The 12-item abbreviated version of the <ref type="bibr">Zarit Caregiver Burden Inventory (Cronbach ' s alpha = .85;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Zarit, Orr, &amp; Zarit, 1985 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bedard et al., 2001 )</ref> was used to assess burden associated with caregiving (e.g., not enough time for oneself, not as much privacy). Caregivers rated each item on a 5-point scale from 0 = never to 4 = nearly always . Scores range from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating higher reported burden.</p><p>Vigilance (REACH investigators). -Vigilance was conceptualized as role captivity, referring to the amount of time the CGs believe they are required to supervise, provide care, and be " on duty " for the CRs. A single item (i.e., " About how many hours a day do you feel the need to ' be there ' or ' on duty ' to care for (CR)? " ) indicated greater vigilance with more " on-duty " hours.</p><p>Daily Care Bother. -Bother associated with the tasks of providing daily care or assistance with ADLs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">( Katz et al., 1963 )</ref> was also computed <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">( Gitlin et al., 2005 )</ref>. For each of the seven items of CG assistance, CGs reported their level of upset on a 5-point scale from 0 = no upset to 4 = extremely upset . A total CG upset score was found for daily care burden by averaging the amount of burden experienced across daily care tasks. Scores of average daily care burden can range from 0 to 4; higher scores indicate more burden. Cronbach ' s alpha for this sample was .86.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Role Strain</head><p>The role strain latent variable encompasses the stressors related to maintaining multiple social, community, and work-related roles and includes the following indicators.</p><p>Income Adequacy (REACH investigators). -Financial strain was measured by a single item assessing perceived diffi culty in paying for basic needs such as food, housing, medical care, and heating along a 4-point Likert-type scale (0 = not diffi cult at all to 3 = very diffi cult ).</p><p>Social Support: Negative Interactions. -Negative social support (e.g., others being critical, prying into affairs) was calculated from four items taken from the modifi ed social support measure and rated on a 4-point scale (0 = never to 3 = very often ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Krause, 1995 )</ref>. Scores range from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more negative social interactions. Cronbach ' s alpha for this sample was .75.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intrapsychic Strain</head><p>The infringement of the caregiving role into the CGs ' ability to maintain a sense of personal identity was measured by confi dence in caregiving, caregiving skills, and rewards associated with caregiving. The latent construct is coded such that higher values indicate less intrapsychic strain; a description of variables used to defi ne the latent construct follows.</p><p>RMBPC: Confi dence. -The RMBPC Confi dence <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">( Teri et al., 1992 )</ref> subscale assessed CG confi dence in dealing with 24 problem behaviors that the CR may have exhibited in the past week. After rating the frequency of problem behaviors, CGs then assessed how confi dent they were in handling the target behavior on a 5-point scale from 0 = not at all to 4 = extremely . A mean " confi dence " score was calculated, with higher scores indicating more confi dence. Cronbach ' s alpha for this sample was .83.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk Appraisal: Caregiving Skills (REACH II investigators</head><p>). -Caregiver skills or mastery was assessed for eight items. Caregivers responded on a 3-point scale (0 = never to 2 = often ) to questions regarding how hard or stressful it was to perform duties associated with caregiving (e.g., preparing meals, doing basic household chores). Higher scores indicate more mastery on a scale from 0 to 6. Cronbach ' s alpha for this sample was .66.</p><p>Positive Aspects of Caregiving. -The nine-item Positive Aspects of Caregiving scale (Cronbach ' s alpha = .92; <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Tarlow et al., 2004 )</ref> presented statements about the CG ' s mental or affective state in the context of the caregiving experience. Responses were provided on a 5-point scale (0 = disagree a lot and 4 = agree a lot ) and were designed to assess the perception of benefi ts within the caregiving context such as feeling more useful and feeling appreciated. Scores range from 0 to 36, with higher scores representing more positive appraisals of the caregiving situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resources</head><p>Indicator variables for the resources latent construct include perceived social support, religious coping strategies, and caregiving knowledge.</p><p>Social Support Satisfaction and Network. -Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer ' s Caregiver Health study investigators modifi ed a social support measure assessing satisfaction, network, and negative interactions from several previous measures of social support and interactions <ref type="bibr">( Barrera, Sandler, &amp; Ramsey, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Krause, 1995 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Krause &amp; Markides, 1990 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lubben, 1988 )</ref>. Satisfaction was assessed across three items tapping satisfaction with the amount of help received from social support networks (i.e., help with transportation, providing comfort, and making suggestions). Scores range from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating more satisfaction. Cronbach ' s alpha for this sample was .76. Similarly, social network was assessed across two items, on a 6-point scale, with categories for the number of network members (none, one, two, three or four, fi ve to eight, nine or more). Scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating larger social networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Religious and Spiritual Coping (modifi ed by the REACH investigators</head><p>). -Caregivers rated religious and spiritual coping for six items assessing the extent that religious or spiritual beliefs affect their caregiving (i.e., working with God as partners or wondering whether God has abandoned them; <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pargament et al., 1998 )</ref>. Caregivers rated items on a 4-point scale from 0 = a great deal to 3 = not at all . Higher scores indicated greater religious and spiritual coping.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Negative Outcomes</head><p>Risk Appraisal: Emotional and Physical Wellbeing (REACH II investigators). -Emotional and physical well-being of the CG was assessed across eight items assessing occurrence of physical and emotional markers of health and well-being. Example items include the following: " In the past month, has caregiving made you feel overwhelmed or extremely tired? " and " Is it hard for you to have quiet time for yourself or time to do things you enjoy? " Scores range from 0 to 16, with higher scores indicating higher well-being. Cronbach ' s alpha for this sample was .77.</p><p>Caregiver Health and Health Behaviors. -Two items from the Caregiver Health and Health Behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">( Schulz et al., 1997 )</ref> measure were used in this analysis to assess subjective health. On the fi rst item, CGs rated their health in general on a 5-point scale from excellent to poor. Scores range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating better perceived health. On the second item, CGs were asked to rate their health compared with that 6 months ago using the same scale, which represents a perceived change in health over previous months.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression</head><p>Scale. -Caregiver depression was assessed using the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Radloff, 1977 )</ref> (Cronbach ' s alpha = .82), which asks about the frequency with which respondents have experienced depressive symptoms within the past week (e.g., " I was bothered by things that usually don ' t bother me, " " I felt that everything I did was an effort " ). Total scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating elevated levels of depressive symptoms. A score of 16 or greater indicates that the individual may have clinically signifi cant depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">( Radloff, 1977 )</ref>.</p><p>Desire to Institutionalize. -The CG ' s desire to institutionalize the CR in the past 6 months was assessed across six yes/no items (e.g., taken steps toward placement, consider nursing home; <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Morycz, 1985 )</ref>. Scores range from 0 to 6, with greater scores indicating an increased desire to institutionalize the CR. Cronbach ' s alpha for this sample was .73.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Missing values were handled according to REACH II guidelines. For cases missing less than 25% of items on a given scale, mean imputation was used to replace the missing value. If an individual missed more than 25% of items on any one of the measures, the data were excluded. A total of 33 of 642 participants were excluded from the analyses.</p><p>The fi rst goal of this study was to examine the ability of the Pearlin model ( Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> ) to explain the global pattern of fi ndings in the REACH II data. Structural equation modeling was used because a large-sample study was available and included multiple measures of each of the constructs in the model. However, one important feature of the Pearlin model is that resources are seen to moderate the relation between constructs ( Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> ). Any attempt to implement this model statistically must include these proposed interaction effects to provide a valid examination of Pearlin ' s theory. Although interaction effects have not commonly been examined in SEM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jöreskog (2000)</ref> describes a technique termed the " latent variable approach. " In this approach, SEM is fi rst used to estimate values of the latent variables in the model from observed measurements. These latent values are then saved to a data set, and the relations among them are then examined using regression analysis. The latent variable approach therefore separates the estimation of the measurement model from the estimation of the structural model, which are usually performed at the same time in traditional SEM.</p><p>In our implementation of this technique, we fi rst estimated the relations between the observed variables and the latent constructs using LISREL 8.54 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">( Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1996</ref> ; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> ). We used these estimates to generate scores on the latent constructs for each participant, which were then imported into SPSS 13.0. Before testing the model using a series of regressions, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to describe racial differences in the estimates of the latent constructs. The latent constructs were then used to estimate a series of regression models representing the paths in the modifi ed Pearlin model ( Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> ). Values for the latent constructs were centered and standardized prior to testing interaction effects in accordance with recommendations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aiken and West (1991)</ref> . Caregiving context variables were not combined into a single latent construct because it would be logically inappropriate to use one value to represent the entire collection of context variables. Instead, these variables were entered into each model individually.</p><p>The primary aim of the study, testing the predictive ability of the Pearlin model as a whole, was addressed by examining both the fi t of the SEM and the explanatory abilities of the regression models. The secondary aim of the study, determining whether the predictive ability of the Pearlin model varies by race, was addressed by determining whether the relations between the latent constructs in the regression models were signifi cantly moderated by race. For the sake of space, post hoc analyses for each regression are described in the Discussion section, but specifi c statistics are not reported.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimating the Measurement Model</head><p>The confi rmatory factor analysis suggested the measurement model was fi t, using LISREL 8.54 with a maximum likelihood estimation method ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> ). The values of R 2 indicated the reliability of each observed measure with respect to its underlying latent construct. All factor loadings were found to be statistically signifi cant, except for MMSE and vigilance. The overall measurement model fi t was acceptable, as indicated by the standardized root mean square residual (07) and the root mean square error of approximation (RM-SEA; .07; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kenny, 2008 )</ref>. Our analysis makes the assumption that the latent variables are defi ned consistently across racial groups. To examine whether this is appropriate, we tested the measurement invariance between an unconstrained model for all groups and a constrained model in which factor loadings are held equal across groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">( Schumacker &amp; Lomax, 2004 )</ref>. Although the test revealed that there is a signifi cant chi-square difference, c 2 (34) = 274.51, p &lt; .05, the actual difference in global fi t indexes was minimal (i.e., the unconstrained model: RMSEA = .07; and the constrained model: RMSEA = .08). Because the focus of this article was to test how race or ethnicity affects the relations among the latent variables, using different measurement models would complicate any differences we see at the structural level, making any interactions with race diffi cult to interpret.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Analyses</head><p>Descriptive analyses by race for the estimates of the latent constructs were performed using ANO-VA and revealed signifi cant racial differences by group for all the latent constructs (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> ). Each of the constructs signifi cantly differed across the racial groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Testing the Pearlin Model</head><p>To address the primary aim, four separate regression models were used to test the relations among latent constructs in the SPM for the overall sample. The fi rst regression ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> ), predicting objective stressors from caregiving context variables, revealed that the model was not signifi cant, F (7, 601) = 1.22, p = .29; thus, caregiving context variables were not collectively a signifi cant predictor of objective stressors. Although the overall model was not signifi cant, CG age was signifi cantly related to objective stressors, such that younger CGs reported more objective stress.</p><p>The second regression model ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> ) predicts role strain from objective stressors, subjective stressors, resources, caregiving context variables, and the interaction between resources and subjective stressors. Results revealed that the overall model was able to predict variability in role strain, F (11, 597) = 27.55, p &lt; .001. There were significant main effects of age, relationship, subjective stressors, and resources. Younger CGs, nonspouses, those experiencing more subjective stressors, and those with fewer resources experienced more role strain. There was also a signifi cant interaction between resources and subjective stressors, such that the effect of stressors on role strain was magnifi ed for those with fewer resources ( Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> ).</p><p>The third regression model ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> ) predicts intrapsychic strain from role strain, resources, caregiving context variables, and the interaction between resources and role strain. Results revealed a signifi cant overall model predicting intrapsychic strain, F (10, 598) = 25.88, p &lt; .001. There were signifi cant main effects of gender, relationship, education, role strain, and resources. Specifi cally, more role strain, fewer resources, being female, being a spouse, and more education were related to higher levels of intrapsychic strain.</p><p>The fourth regression model ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> ) predicting negative outcomes from caregiving context variables, resources, intrapsychic strain, and interaction between resources and intrapsychic strain was also signifi cant, F (10, 598) = 266.01, p &lt; .001. Resources, intrapsychic strain, gender, and education were all signifi cant predictors of negative outcomes. Specifi cally, CGs who were female and had lower education, fewer resources, and higher intrapsychic strain had more negative outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of Race Within the Pearlin Model</head><p>Four separate regression models were used to test whether each relation in the SPM differed across race. Each of these models contained all the effects that were originally proposed in the Pearlin model and included new terms representing the main effect of race as well as the interaction of each of the original effects with race. Post hoc analyses based on the adjusted means were used to explore signifi cant race effects and interactions, but specifi c statistics are not reported for the sake of space. We did not add terms interacting race with the individual caregiving context variables.</p><p>Results from the fi rst regression ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> ) predicting objective stressors again revealed that the model was not signifi cant, F (9, 599) = 1.739, p = .077, indicating that caregiving context variables were not related to objective stressors.</p><p>The second regression model ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> ) predicting role strain was signifi cant, F (19, 589) = 17.168, p &lt; .001. There were signifi cant main effects for race, CG age, employment status, subjective stressors, and resources. Younger CGs, CGs who were employed, those experiencing more subjective stressors, and those with fewer resources experienced more role strain. Post hoc analyses revealed that Black or African American CGs had significantly more role strain than White or Caucasian and Hispanic or Latino CGs. White or Caucasian CGs and Hispanic or Latino CGs were not significantly different in role strain. There was a significant interaction between resources and subjective stressors, such that the effect of stressors on role strain was again magnifi ed for those with few resources.</p><p>The third regression model ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> ) predicting intrapsychic strain was signifi cant, F (16, 592) = 19.497, p &lt; .001. There were signifi cant main effects for race, gender, relationship, education, role strain, and resources. Specifi cally, more role strain, fewer resources, being female, being a spouse, and more education were related to higher levels of intrapsychic strain. Post hoc analyses revealed that White or Caucasians had signifi cantly greater intrapsychic strain than Black or African Americans and Hispanic or Latinos. Black or African Americans and Hispanic or Latinos were not signifi cantly different in intrapsychic strain. The effect of race  interacted with resources, such that CGs reported similar levels of intrapsychic strain across race at lower levels of resources, but White or Caucasians reported more intrapsychic strain than Black or African Americans or Hispanic or Latinos at higher levels of resources ( Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> ). The fourth regression model ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> ) predicting negative outcomes was also signifi cant, F (16, 592) = 167.994, p &lt; .001. Resources, intrapsychic strain, gender, and education were all signifi cant predictors of negative outcomes. Specifi cally, CGs who were female and had lower education, fewer resources, and higher intrapsychic strain had more negative outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study addressed two primary aims. To address the fi rst aim, we used a combination of SEM and regression techniques to evaluate the SPM as proposed by <ref type="bibr">Pearlin and colleagues (1990)</ref> . Structural equation modeling revealed that the SPM obtains a satisfactory fi t (i.e., a goodness of fi t index of .90) across race or ethnicity in the REACH II data. To address the second aim, we incorporated race or ethnicity into Pearlin ' s SPM by examining race as a moderator of the relation between each of the latent constructs ( Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> ). We found that each pathway is signifi cant except for the one predicting objective stress from caregiving context ( Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> ) and the one predicting role strain from objective stress.</p><p>Findings support interventions, such as REACH II, that simultaneously target multiple aspects of the SPM across racial or ethnic groups. These analyses bolster theoretical and practice-based arguments for conceptualizing the caregiving context in an SPM framework such as the one proposed by a R 2 change = .003.</p><p>-2.5  Pearlin and colleagues (e.g., <ref type="bibr">FCA, 2006 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pearlin et al., 1990 )</ref>. Although the current analyses did not directly test the relation between primary stressors and mental health variables, our analyses suggest that assessing subjective stressors is essential when predicting role strain ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> ). It is noteworthy that, similar to Gallagher-Thompson and Powers (1997) , objective stressors did not signifi cantly predict secondary role strain or negative mental health outcomes. This may suggest that a decreased emphasis on CR characteristics would be appropriate when the CG ' s mental health is the focus of intervention. In other words, when time and resources are limited, reducing assessment related to the CR may facilitate a more time-effi cient evaluation and intervention.</p><p>Although the SPM as a whole appears to fi t the caregiving experience across racial or ethnic groups, supplemental analyses found signifi cant differences in all the individual components: objective stress, subjective stress, role strain, intrapsychic strain, resources, and negative outcomes by race ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). (Racial differences in the estimates of the latent constructs are described using ANO-VA and are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> . These analyses are not directly related to the aims of this study and therefore are not a primary focus.) Strengths and vulnerabilities for each race or ethnicity vary considerably, suggesting that interventions must target different nuanced aspects of the stress process to provide optimal benefi t for individuals of different cultural or ethnic backgrounds. Specifically, White or Caucasians experienced signifi cantly greater intrapsychic strain than Black or African Americans and Hispanic or Latinos, suggesting that they might benefi t most from interventions that target intrapsychic concerns (e.g., learning to manage negative emotions).</p><p>In contrast, among the Hispanic or Latinos, high levels of resources seem more protective in reducing levels of intrapsychic strain than among White or Caucasians. This suggests a different intervention target, such as increasing knowledge about dementia and access to services. <ref type="bibr">Gray, Jimenez, Tong, and Gallagher-Thompson (in press)</ref> found that Hispanic or Latinos had signifi cantly less accurate information about dementia causes and treatments and were more likely to use nonmedical interventions for themselves and their CRs compared with White or Caucasians. Thus, programs that include education about dementia, as well as culturally and linguistically appropriate resources, would likely yield benefi ts for this group.</p><p>For African Americans, interventions that target role strain (e.g., negative social support) may prove to be most helpful. This is a complex issue for this group because these CGs tend to be younger, employed, and taking care of their own families. Programs that focus on improving communication skills among family members might be further developed for this group. For example, family interventions such as the creation of legacies to represent the life accomplishments of older adults are effective in improving family communication, reducing stress, and increasing CRs ' sense of meaning in life <ref type="bibr">( Allen, Hilgeman, Ege, Shuster, &amp; Burgio, in press</ref> ). Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gitlin et al. (2003)</ref> found that education, problem-solving training, and adaptive equipment provided by occupational therapists to make the home environment safer and more " user friendly " for the demented person resulted in signifi cant improvements in CG stress and depression among African American CGs.</p><p>One limitation of the current study is that we have combined Hispanic or Latino CGs from different cultural subgroups -primarily, Cuban American and Mexican American individuals were recruited at the Miami and Palo Alto sites, respectively. These two groups have distinct cultures, despite speaking the same language, and may appraise the caregiving situation differently <ref type="bibr">( Yeo &amp; Gallagher-Thompson, 2006 )</ref>. Furthermore, acculturation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kao &amp; Travis, 2005 )</ref> and cultural justifi cations for caregiving (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dilworth-Anderson, et al., 2005 )</ref> should also be considered as potential moderators in the stress process. We suggest that future research should limit samples to one group and include measures of acculturation and cultural infl uences when possible. More research is also needed on intragroup subtleties in the link between stressors and emotional and physical outcomes.</p><p>Another limitation is the acceptable rather than good fi t of the measurement model used in the analyses, which suggests that the model as measured in the current study has room for improvement. Additionally, several indicators (e.g., MMSE, vigilance hours on duty) had nonsignifi cant loadings on their latent constructs. Given that we tested an established conceptual model that has designated indicators for each latent construct, it is possible that some indicators might not adequately capture the construct for reasons such as poor measures and nonlinear relations. For example, there is evidence that cognitive impairment (i.e., MMSE) functions nonlinearly as a stressor <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">( Gwyther, 2007 )</ref> over the course of the disease, which would affect its statistical relation to other indicators of the latent construct. Similarly, hours on duty (i.e., vigilance) is based on CGs ' self-report. Measures like this one that rely solely on an individual ' s memory of a given event make it easily susceptible to the infl uences of social desirability factors. Future studies may want to test a modifi ed model by removing nonstatistically signifi cant indicators or those with low R 2 values.</p><p>Clearly, " tailoring " interventions to fi t the expressed needs and problems of ethnically and culturally diverse CGs has been recommended by many researchers (e.g., Gallagher-Thompson, <ref type="bibr">Haley, et al., 2003 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hilgeman, Allen, DeCoster, &amp; Burgio, 2007 )</ref>. The fi ndings of this study suggest empirically derived and ethnically specifi c domains for intervention that should be informative for future research in this fi eld. Ideally, tailored interventions based on needs assessments, such as the REACH II trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Belle et al., 2006 )</ref>, may be the most appropriate. However, researchers and clinicians can use a conceptual framework like the one presented here to initiate intervention when family-specifi c information is not available or would be too expensive to collect.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 .
