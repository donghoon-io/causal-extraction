<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The growing use of mobile technologies is spawning firms' adoption of mobile relationshipbuilding techniques, including via mobile apps. However, despite the rapid rise of these technologies, little remains known regarding consumers' mobile app-(vs desktop browser) related behaviors, as, therefore, investigated in this paper. Specifically, we explore the effect of customer engagement (CE) and customer experience (CX) on customers' relationship quality/loyalty intention across mobile app (vs. desktop browser)-based interactions. Using structural equation modeling, we analyze data collected from 420 customers. The results reveal a stronger positive association between CE/CX and relationship quality/loyalty intention for mobile app-(vs. desktop browser)-based interactions, revealing the former's strategic importance. We conclude by discussing key implications that arise from our analyses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Mobile app-based marketing is rapidly gaining prominence <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Stocchi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Viswanathan et al., 2017)</ref>. As most consumers tend to carry their smartphone wherever they go. Mobile apps offer up-to-the minute information, (real-time) customer/firm interactions (e.g., purchasing), and a range of entertainment or educational activities (e.g., gamification; <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Picoto et al., 2019)</ref>. Mobile apps offer convenient, portable touchpoints that can capitalize on user location through smartphone-based GPS systems (e.g., by offering deals to customers approaching the store).</p><p>However, these features are less typical in desktop browser-based interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Shankar et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Mclean et al., 2018)</ref>. Desktop browser (vs. mobile app) display, navigation, and usage principles also differ (e.g., QR codes are more common in mobile apps; <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Newman et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, mobile app (vs. desktop browser) based interactions tend to affect (e.g., accelerate) consumer decision-making in a different way (e.g., through showrooming; <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kaatz, 2020)</ref>. The said differences between mobile app and desktop browser-system propelled comparative research towards the impact of mobile app marketing with respect to desktop browserbased platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Ström et al., 2014)</ref>. In response to this call, few attempts were made to grasp the difference across the mobile and desktop browser-based marketing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Goldstein &amp; Hajaj, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>For instances, 1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Sreejesh et al. (2021)</ref> examined the impact of critical contextual factors such as accessed platform (mobile devices and desktop-browser) on brand attitude; 2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kaatz et al. (2019)</ref> studied differences between the desktop and smartphone devices concerning the success of distinct marketing channel strategies; 3) mobile and desktop users participation in electronic word-ofmouth was also assessed <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Okazaki, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">and 4</ref>) recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Goldstein and Hajaj (2022)</ref> compared mobile and desktop users' online search behavior by studying the users' stages (states) in the conversion funnel (i.e., research, decision, or purchase).</p><p>Despite such comparative examinations, gaps surround the dynamics characterizing the differences in the mobile app-(vs. desktop browser-based) relating to customer engagement <ref type="bibr">(CE)</ref> and customer experience (CX) still exists. While researchers including <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Tuguinay et al. (2022)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Khan et al. (2019)</ref> have explored the association of CE and CX (i.e., a customer's sensations, feelings, cognitions, and behavioral responses; <ref type="bibr">Brakus et al., 2009, p. 52)</ref> in internet settings, but lacks a comparative analysis. This reveals important research gaps and raises unresolved questions around these touchpoints' respective marketing effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Alalwan et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Wang, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, the present study addresses the following research questions: 1) Do the consumer interface platforms (mobile app vs. desktop browser-based) determine different CE and CX? 2) How do CE and CX are effective in determining consumer behavior outcomes (relationship quality and loyalty) across the two platforms (mobile app vs. desktop browser)?</p><p>Addressing the above-mentioned research questions, this study empirically examines and compare CE and CX for mobile app (vs. desktop browser) -based platforms to yield further insight into their respective dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ho &amp; Chung, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Khan et al., 2016)</ref>. The study also investigates the effect of CE/CX on customers' perceived relationship quality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chan, 2018)</ref> and their loyalty intent to the brand (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Zhang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">McLean et al., 2020)</ref>. This assessment offers novel insight into the relative effectiveness of these touchpoints, as called for by scholars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Choudrie et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fagerstrøm et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Mohd-Ramly &amp; Omar, 2017)</ref>. The development of further understanding on this (comparison) issue is important. As a stronger (vs. weaker) association in this regard would signal mobile app's (or desktop browser's) extensive (vs. lesser) effect on the customer's experience-based journey <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Lemon &amp; Verhoef, 2016)</ref>, which islikewise gaining traction in the literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bleier et al., 2019)</ref>. This paper has important contributions to the CE/CX-and mobile marketing literature. For instances, the study extends scholarly understanding of the effect of CE/CX on customers' perceived relationship quality across mobile app-(vs. desktop browser-based) platforms. Our empirical findings reveal a stronger positive association between CE/CX on the one hand, and relationship quality/loyalty intention on the other, for mobile apps. This reveals the former's particular strategic importance for businesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(McLean et al., 2020)</ref>. That is, our analyses identify mobile app (vs. desktop browser) -based marketing's particular relational capability. Thus, making an enhanced contribution to the firm's relationship marketing objectives, which however remains nebulous to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(San-Martín et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Choudrie et al., 2018)</ref>. Broadly, our analyses also respond to the Marketing Science Institute's (2020, p. 5) call for further research on the Customer-Technology Interface, with a focus on better understanding users' cross-platform-based CE/CX. The paper's remainder is structured as follows. We review key literature in the areas of mobile app-and desktop browser-based interactions, online CE, CX, relationship quality and loyalty intention in section 2. We then develop a conceptual model and an associated set of research hypotheses in section 3. In section 4, we discussed research methodology, followed by an outline of the findings in section 5. We conclude by discussing the study's key implications, limitations, and further research avenues in section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Conceptual background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The social exchange theory, CE, and CX interface</head><p>Contemporary consumers are increasingly interacting with brands via digital channels, including mobile apps, virtual/augmented reality presentations, artificially intelligent applications, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ho &amp; Chung, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hollebeek et al., 2021)</ref>. The mobile apps may be used to help answer consumer queries, offer product/service recommendations, play brand-related (e.g., educational) games, or record customer feedback, among others <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fritz et al., 2017)</ref>. Given the interactive aspect inherent in consumers' mobile app usage, fostering interactively generated CE with the brand has been heralded as a key performance metric for these apps (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Viswanathan et al., 2017)</ref>. In turn, these apps also generate a particular CX, which marketers will also wish to optimize <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(McLean et al., 2018)</ref>. Thus, while CE and CX are conceptually related, they each cover a distinct theoretical domain. CE represents the customers' resource investment in their mobile app-based interactions, and CX reflects the customer's (e.g., behavioral) response to these investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hollebeek et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Lemon &amp; Verhoef, 2016</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Blau's (1964)</ref> social exchange theory posits that an individual (e.g., customer) will continue investing (i.e., engaging) in interactions with a particular engagement object (e.g., a brand's mobile app; <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Viswanathan et al., 2017)</ref>, if and as long as they feel they are attaining value from doing so. It also proposes that, in such cases, customers are predicted to reciprocate their perceived value back to the brand (e.g., by making repurchases from it, by recommending the brand to others; <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Steinhoff et al., 2019)</ref>. Accordingly, the study put forth that by engaging with a brand's mobile app and by attaining a favorable user experience, customers are predicted to reciprocate to the brand (e.g., by displaying an elevated repurchase/loyalty intent to it; <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Pervan et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Customers' mobile app-(vs. desktop browser)-based interactions</head><p>Mobile apps are defined as, "software that is downloadable to a mobile device, which prominently displays a brand identity, often via the name of the app and the appearance of a brand logo or icon, throughout the customer experience" <ref type="bibr">(Bellman et al., 2011, p.191)</ref>. While mobile apps were originally developed for more utilitarian purposes (e.g., to access one's email/calendar, the weather forecast; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hsiao et al., 2016)</ref>, they have evolved to fulfil more hedonic or social purposes (e.g., gaming, social networking; <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Salehan &amp; Negahban, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>By drawing on a mobile device's hardware/software features, mobile apps (vs. desktop browsers) can offer a more personalized CX <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mclean et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ebrahim et al., 2016)</ref>. In addition, as mobile apps (unlike desktop browser) can be accessed from anywhere, at any time, they are conducive to engaging consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Stocchi et al., 2018)</ref>. The way consumers make (e.g., purchase) decisions also varies across desktop browser-and mobile app-based interfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kumar et al., 2018)</ref>. For example, mobile app-based touchscreens can offer a greater sense of ownership (vs. mouse-clicking on an item in the case of a desktop-based browser). Moreover, touch-based interfaces can see users' differing perceived importance of product attributes and may increase the number of alternatives searched <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brasel &amp; Gips, 2014)</ref>. Thus, while customers' more traditional desktop browser-based interactions remain important, a growing role of mobile app-based interactions is observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Newman et al., 2018)</ref>. This warrants further study in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Sung, 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Online customer engagement</head><p>Though CE has developed into a prominent metric in the last decade (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kumar et al., 2019)</ref>, debate surrounds its conceptualization <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kumar &amp; Pansari, 2016)</ref>. For example, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Brodie et al. (2011)</ref> define CE as "a psychological state that occurs by virtue of interactive, cocreative customer experiences with a focal agent/object (e.g., a brand) in …service relationships" (p. 260), <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hollebeek et al. (2019)</ref> propose CE as a customer's motivationally driven operant (e.g., cognitive, emotional, and behavioral) and operand (e.g., equipment-based) resource investment in their brand interactions.</p><p>We discuss key areas of definitional overlap across CE conceptualizations below. First, most authors consider CE as an interactive concept that centers on customer dynamics during their brand interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brodie et al., 2011)</ref>. Here, interaction implies the existence of two-way or bilateral actions featuring actively contributing actors <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Vargo &amp; Lusch, 2016)</ref>. Users may have utilitarian, hedonic, or social motives for participating in an interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hsu &amp; Lin, 2016)</ref>. While utilitarian motives center on getting a job done (e.g., learning), hedonic motives reflect the user's desire for diversion, entertainment, or fun. Social motives, by contrast, center on a desire to connect with relevant others <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Second, CE is typically viewed as a multidimensional concept that comprises cognitive, emotional, and behavioral tenets <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Harrigan et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Vivek et al., 2012)</ref>. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hollebeek et al. (2014)</ref>, cognitive CE reflects "a consumer's level of brand-related thought processing/elaboration in a… consumer/brand interaction" (p. 154). Emotional CE denotes a consumer's positive brand-related affect in an interaction, while behavioral CE is a consumer's level of "energy, effort and time spent on a brand interaction" (p. 154). Though some authors add social CE, which reflects the consumer's brand-related interactive investment vis-à-vis others (e.g., in conspicuous consumption), others limit CE to a purely behavioral perspective (i.e., engagement behaviors; <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Van Doorn et al. 2010)</ref>. These latter authors assume that consumers' latent cognitive/emotional dynamics manifest through their brand-related behavioral engagement. We, however, adopt a multidimensional view of CE as a reflective second-order construct comprising cognitive CE (cognitive processing), emotional CE (affection), and behavioral CE (activation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Harrigan et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Though CE may manifest online and/or offline, online CE represents a prolific CE research sub-stream. Owing to its interactive nature, CE fits well in online settings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Brodie et al., 2013)</ref>. In line with these developments, we center on online CE, with a particular focus on users' mobile app (vs. desktop browser)-based interactions. As a theoretical sub-set of online CE research, mobile CE transpires when customers interact with brands' mobile platforms (e.g., mobile apps) to meet their needs and/or create value <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kim et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Viswanathan et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to their portable, ubiquitous nature, mobile apps can be personalized to meet the consumer's unique needs. Thus, potentially stretching their engaged timespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bellman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kim et al., 2013)</ref>. Correspondingly, we adopt Hollebeek et al.'s (2014) CE conceptualization, which was designed for application in the online context. The authors define CE as "a consumer's positively-valenced brand-related cognitive, emotional and behavioral activity during or related to focal consumer/brand interactions" (p. 154), which we posit to have high applicability in the mobile app context (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Wang, 2020)</ref>. Mobile app-based CE is driven by personal (e.g., need-for-cognition), app-based (e.g., ease-of-use), interaction-related (e.g., hedonic/utilitarian), and situational factors (e.g., mood; <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Stocchi et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Online customer experience</head><p>CX has been defined as "the internal and subjective response that customers have to any direct or indirect contact with a company" <ref type="bibr">(Meyer &amp; Schwager 2007, p. 18)</ref>. As per <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Homburg et al. (2015)</ref>, CX is a person's affective, sensorial, cognitive, behavioral, and relational responses to a brand by being through a series of touchpoints along pre-purchase, purchase and post-purchase.</p><p>Moreover, <ref type="bibr">Lemon and Verhoef (2016, p. 71)</ref> define CX as "a multidimensional construct focusing on a customer's cognitive, emotional, behavioral, sensorial, and social responses to a firm's offerings during [his/her] entire purchase journey."</p><p>From these definitions, we make the following observations. First, CX covers the customer's complete purchase journey (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Schmitt, 1999)</ref>, thus extending beyond CE's intra-interaction scope <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Prentice et al., 2019)</ref>. Second, CX has been modeled as a multidimensional concept comprising cognitive, emotional, behavioral, sensorial, and social tenets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Brakus et al., 2009)</ref>. However, some authors highlight certain CX facets. For example, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Novak et al. (2000)</ref> focused on cognitive experience, <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Rose et al. (2012)</ref> highlighted the customer's emotional experience.</p><p>Third, the online CX is typified by dynamic, fast-moving, information-rich journey stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ciuchita et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Novak et al., 2000)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr">Rose et al. (2012, p. 309</ref>) define online CX as a "psychological state manifested as a subjective response" to Internet-based platforms, including websites or mobile apps. As technological developments have produced smaller, more convenient devices (e.g., smartphone-based mobile apps; <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Newman et al., 2018)</ref>, consumers' uptake of these is expected to be higher (vs. desktop browsers; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ciuchita et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Shankar et al., 2016)</ref>. In addition, bandwidth advances have facilitated mobile purchasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Siwicki, 2014)</ref>, and its real-time nature has the capacity to personalize the CX <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(McLean et al., 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Relationship quality</head><p>Relationship quality reflects a customers' overall evaluation of their relationship with a brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Palmatier et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Steinhoff et al., 2019)</ref>. While different conceptualizations exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Baker et al., 1999)</ref>, relationship quality is typically modeled as a higher-order construct comprising trust, satisfaction, and commitment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Itani et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Palmatier et al., 2006)</ref>. First, trust reflects a customer's "willingness to rely on an exchange partner in whom one has confidence" <ref type="bibr">(Moorman et al., 1993, p. 82)</ref>. Second, satisfaction reflects a customer's "overall evaluation of the performance of an offering" <ref type="bibr">(Gustafsson et al., 2005, p. 210)</ref>. Third, commitment reveals the customer's desire to uphold a relationship to warrant maximum efforts at maintaining it <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Moorman et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Morgan &amp; Hunt 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Existing research has addressed the effect of online customer/firm interactions on relationship quality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Steinhoff et al., 2019)</ref>. In particular, the ubiquitous nature of mobile interactions has been linked to enhanced relationship quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chan, 2018)</ref>, in turn favorably affecting consumers' brand-related judgments and behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kim et al., 2014)</ref>, social commerce (continuance) intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Liang et al., 2011)</ref>, intent to co-create value <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Tajvidi et al., 2021)</ref>, and customer loyalty intent <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Rafiq et al., 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Loyalty intention</head><p>Customer loyalty has been defined as "a deeply held commitment to rebuy or repatronize a preferred product/service consistently in the future" <ref type="bibr">(Oliver 1999, p. 34)</ref>. Customer loyalty comprises including attitudinal and behavioral loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Price &amp; Arnould, 1999)</ref>. Attitudinal loyalty reflects a customer's willingness to recommend a product/brand to their friends and family <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Wong &amp; Sohal, 2003)</ref>. Behavioral loyalty reveals the extent to which the customer repurchases a product/brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Sirdeshmukh et al., 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Relatedly, customer loyalty intent signals a customer's resolve to stay committed to a brand <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Srinivasan et al., 2002)</ref>, which may transpire to varying degrees <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1973)</ref>. Therefore, while loyalty intent comprises a strong attitudinal component, its behavioral facet can lag. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cyr et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kumar et al. (2018)</ref>, we denote a customer's platform loyalty intention as an individual's intent to re-use a brand's mobile app (vs. desktop browser system).</p><p>We next develop our research model and hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research model and hypotheses</head><p>Literature groups consumer interface platforms mainly into two key categories: mobile application platforms and desktop-browser platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Goldstein &amp; Hajaj, 2022)</ref>. As depicted in the introduction section, this study is an attempt to study CE and CX across the two platforms (mobile app vs. desktop browser). Both these platforms vary in terms of the interface, as mobile apps (unlike desktop browsers) can be accessed from anywhere, anytime, and they are highly conducive to engaging consumers and delivering personal experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Stocchi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Viswanathan et al., 2017)</ref>. The way consumer makes decision also varies across the desktop browser-based platform and mobile apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kumar et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lemon &amp; Verhof, 2016)</ref>. Consequently, the study relates the CE and CX with their subsequent proposed outcomes (i.e., relationship quality and loyalty) and examined across the two platforms. See figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for our proposed research model. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Main effects</head><p>While existing authors have previously explored the CE/CX interface, their findings remain inconclusive. For example, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Khan et al. (2019)</ref>  Though the CE/relationship quality interface has been explored in prior conceptual research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Sashi, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">So et al., 2016)</ref>, empirical validation of this relationship lags behind to date. For existing customers who have pre-established brand satisfaction levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Van Doorn et al., 2010)</ref>, trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(So et al., 2016)</ref>, and commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Vivek et al., 2012)</ref>, relationship quality appears as a CE antecedent <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brodie et al., 2011)</ref>. However, CE can also act as a relationship quality antecedent (i.e., by improving relationship quality). For example, by interacting with a brand, customers' brand trustone of relationship quality's constituent conceptsis likely to develop <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(So et al., 2016)</ref>.

We first conducted a pilot study to assess questionnaire clarity, readability, and comprehensibility <ref type="bibr">(Malhotra et al., 2017)</ref>. In the pilot study, we deployed a sample of 54 college students who were experienced users of both mobile app-and desktop browser-based interactions to verify the questionnaire's contents and psychometric properties. Few adjustments in the language of the survey questionnaire were made following the pilot survey. Five-point Likert-type scales (1= strongly disagree, to 5= strongly agree) were used to collect the responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Survey and sample</head><p>We considered products/services available for purchase on mobile app-and desktop browser-based platforms, including online banking, grocery/fashion shopping, hotel room/airline ticket bookings, and so on. Random intercept interviews were carried out on both weekends and weekdays during the morning and evening hours to reduce possible bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Davis et al., 2019)</ref>. Every potential respondent was approached by trained interviewers (e.g., high streets, shopping malls) so that they would have an equal chance to be included in the survey. The interviewers identified themselves and explained the aim of the study upon approaching the participants. Interviewers then interacted with the possible participant, and after completing the questionnaire they approached the next possible participant. Participants were requested to answer to a structured questionnaire.</p><p>Prior to the main survey, the respondents were screened to ensure they have previously used mobile app-and desktop browser-based platforms. The following screening questions were used: (i) "Have you used mobile apps to look for and/or purchase an item?" (ii) "Have you used desktop browser-based interactions to look for and/or purchase an item?" and (iii) "Please estimate the total number of days you have used mobile app/desktop browser-based platforms for shopping purposes." Only those who responded "yes" to the first two questions, and a minimum of 90 days to the third question, were invited to participate in the main survey (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Khan et al., 2019)</ref>. The respondents were assured thru questionnaire instructions regarding the respondents' anonymity.</p><p>We also explained them that there were no right or wrong answers, they should answer as per their viewpoint. The main survey questionnaire had three sections. The first section detailed the purpose of the study and instructions for completing the survey. The second part includes questions related to the construct employed in the study. Finally, the third section asked about the respondents' gender, age, among others.</p><p>Respondents were then requested to complete the questionnaire based on any mobile app they had used recently to look for products or to make a purchase. After a break, they were asked to answer the same survey questions pertaining to a desktop browser-based platform. We contacted 600 respondents to participate in the main survey. Out of 600 respondents, 438 agreed for participation and provided filled questionnaires. After that we screened questionnaires to get the valid (usable) responses for the analysis. During the screening process, we found that 18 questionnaires were incomplete having more than 10% missing data. Hence, these 18 questionnaires were dropped (as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hair et al., 2006)</ref>, leaving with us 420 valid (usable) responses for further analysis. The sample comprised 52% male (48% female) respondents, and 40% were aged 18-30, followed by 34% being 31-42, and 26% being over 42 years of age.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Data analysis</head><p>To analyze the data, we deployed a three-step data-analytical procedure using SPSS and AMOS software. First, confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the internal consistency and discriminant validity of our constructs. Second, the hypotheses were tested by examining the structural equation models for our mobile app-(desktop browser-based) platforms, respectively.</p><p>Multi-group structural equation-based invariance models were tested for the mobile appand desktop browser-based interaction samples to confirm the scale items were measuring similar cross-group traits. The invariance testing encompassed configural invariance, metric invariant model, and factor variance invariance tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Steenkamp &amp; Baumgartner, 1998)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Measure validation</head><p>Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to examine model fit and scale items' internal consistency and discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gerbing &amp; Anderson, 1988)</ref>. The mobile app-based CFA results provided a reasonably good fit to the data: χ2 = 345, df = 174, χ2/df = 1.985, CFI = 0.97, IFI = 0.97, NFI = 0.94, GFI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.048. Similarly, we attained the following results for desktop browser-based interactions: χ2=506, df=174, χ2/df=2.91, CFI=0.94, IFI=0.94, NFI=0.91, GFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.068.</p><p>Internal consistency was next tested by examining the factor loadings, Cronbach alpha, and composite reliability scores, as shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>. Each factor loading was significant and exceeded the value of 0.60 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 1988)</ref>, indicating internal consistency. Moreover, for each construct, Cronbach alpha and composite reliability values exceeded the recommended 0.70 threshold (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>). Discriminant validity was established, as the square root of the average variance extracted (AVE) exceeded the correlation between each construct pair, as shown in Table</p><p>2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>. Overall, the results strongly support the proposed measurement model across the mobile app-and desktop browser-based interactions. • Using X mobile application/desktop browser gets me to think about it.</p><p>• I think about X a lot when I'm using its mobile application/desktop browser.</p><p>• Using X mobile application/desktop browser stimulates my interest to learn more about it. • I feel very positive when I use X mobile application/desktop browser.</p><p>• Using X mobile application/desktop browser makes me happy.</p><p>• I feel good when I use X mobile application/desktop browser.</p><p>• I'm proud to use X mobile application/desktop browser.</p><p>• I spend a lot of time using X mobile application/desktop browser, compared to the other mobile application/desktop browser.</p><p>. • The layout of the X mobile application/desktop browser appeals to my senses.</p><p>• The X mobile application/desktop browser is easy to navigate.</p><p>• Results are always returned promptly when using the X mobile application/desktop browser. • The information obtained from X mobile application/desktop browser is useful.  Due to the self-report nature of the questionnaire, we also tested for potential common method bias by using Harman's single-factor test, which uses exploratory factor analysis to ensure that no single factor accounts for the majority (i.e., over 50%) of the total observed variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. The results suggested that the first factor accounted for 30.8% of the total variance, thus passing Harman's single-factor test. We further tested for common method bias by incorporating all the variables in a single-factor CFA model and comparing the fit to a multiconstruct CFA model. The analyses indicated that the single (vs. multi)-factor model is unacceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. Hence overall, the results suggest that common method bias is not an issue in our data.</p></div>

Both mobile app-(χ2=366, df=180, χ2/df= 2.03, CFI=0.96, IFI=0.96, NFI=0.94, GFI=0.93, RMSEA=0.050) and desktop browserbased interaction (χ2=548, df=180, χ2/df=3.04, CFI=0.93, IFI=0.93, NFI=0.90, GFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.068) models offered good fit to the data. The study deployed χ²-difference tests to ensure that path coefficient estimates across the mobile-app and desktop browser data are statistically greater or not. The differences were found significant in the χ 2 analysis. CE was found to have a significant, positive effect on CX for mobile app-(β=0.37, p˂0.05) and desktop browser-based interactions (β=0.02, p˂0.05), supporting H1a-b. While CE exerted a significant effect on relationship quality in mobile app-based interactions (β=0.21, p˂0.05), its association with relationship quality was non-significant for desktop browser-based interactions (β=0.04, p˃0.05), leading to H2a's acceptance and H2b's rejection. Moreover, CE was only found to have a significant impact on customer loyalty intention for mobile app-(β=0.41, p=0.000), but not for desktop browser-based interactions (β=0.08, p˃0.05), leading us to accept H3a but reject H3b. We also identified a significant, positive effect of CX on relationship quality for mobile app-based interactions (β=0.33, p˂0.05), but not for desktop browser-based interactions (β=0.08, p˃0.05), leading to the acceptance of H4a but rejection of H4b. In addition, CX was found to exert a significant, positive effect on customer loyalty intention for both mobile app-(β=0.47, p=0.000) and desktop browser-based interactions (β=0.19, p=0.001), leading us to accept H5a-b. Moreover, relationship quality was found to significantly affect loyalty intention for mobile app-(β=0.25, p=0.000) and desktop browser-based interactions (β=0.29, p=0.000), consistent with H6a-b. For the mobile app and desktop browser data, the model explained 61% and 58% of the variance of CX, 52% and 41% of the variance for relationship quality, and 29% and 16% of the variance of loyalty intention, respectively.</p><p>Note: First (second) set of numbers (italics/bold) denotes mobile app (desktop browser) results, respectively. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Theoretical implications</head><p>This study yields two main theoretical implications. First, our results offer novel insight into key consumer behavior-related dynamics across mobile app (vs. desktop browser)-based brand interactions. Though prior research has variously explored CE and CX in either the mobile app (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">McLean et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Newman et al., 2018)</ref> or the desktop browser-based context (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Morgan-Thomas &amp; Veloutsou, 2013)</ref>, few studies have compared customers' engagement and experience-based dynamics across these platform types, which each have unique features, as therefore examined in this research.</p><p>The reported empirical findings, indeed, corroborate the existence of consumer behaviorbased differences across these platforms. Specifically, we identify a stronger positive association between CE/CX on the one hand, and relationship quality/loyalty intention on the other, for mobile app-(vs. desktop browser)-based interactions, revealing the pertinence of mobile app-based interactions. Based on this finding, we empirically confirm the potential of mobile app-based marketing interactions in contemporary firms' relationship marketing strategy (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hollebeek et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Wongsansukcharoen et al., 2022)</ref>. However, despite this preliminary finding, opportunities for further research abound <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Choudrie et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Stocchi et al., 2018)</ref>. For example, what mobile app, communication, or other features optimize CE and CX, respectively, and how do these affect customer-perceived relationship quality and loyalty (intent)? How do marketers ensure consistently elevated CE and CX are attained across their different customer segments and across product/service categories?</p><p>Relatedly, unlike prior research, our findings suggest that CE does not significantly drive customer-perceived relationship quality or loyalty intent for desktop browser-based interactions.</p><p>Consequently, for these platforms, CE appears to take a less strategic role (vs. in mobile app-based interactions). This finding makes intuitive sense, as consumers tend to carry their mobile appcontaining smartphone with them most of the time, facilitating their ubiquitous engagement through platform (KPMG, 2017). However, desktop browser-based interactions see lower levels of consumer-perceived convenience (e.g., by allowing lower personalization levels; <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kumar et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Shankar et al., 2016)</ref>. Based on this finding, we recommend future scholars to further examine the strategic role and benefits of mobile app-based platforms and their most suitable contexts (vs. those for desktop browser-based interactions). For example, how might different (e.g., smartphone) screen sizes affect CE and CX? How consumers combine their mobile appbased interactions with physical (e.g., in-store) interactions? Thus, reflecting their potential phygital shopping/browsing dynamics (e.g., through (reverse) showrooming; Mele and Russo-Spena, 2021).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Managerial implications</head><p>This study also raises several important managerial implications. First, firms' inclusion of CE as a key strategic metric is more warranted on mobile app-(vs. desktop browser-based) platforms. Particularly, customers who possess higher brand-related knowledge tend to value interacting with mobile app-based interactions, which afford greater personalization and control <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kim et al., 2013)</ref>. Second, CX with mobile apps (vs. desktop browsers) was found to exert a stronger effect on relationship quality and loyalty intentions. Therefore, firms are advised to offer perceived valuable mobile apps to facilitate and leverage their customer journeys and relationships.</p><p>However, while engaging customers may improve CX for desktop browser-based interactions, based on our results its strategic benefits do not extend to fostering relationship quality. Moreover, though our results suggested CX's conducive effect on customer loyalty on desktop browser-based interactions, this association was weak, which may be due to desktop browsers' more limited personalization and less ubiquitous usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kim et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">McLean et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, important implications arise for mobile app design and implementation. To successfully engage customers and deliver superior experiences through mobile apps, managers are advised to carefully design their apps based on their segments' needs. That is, apps considered relevant are significantly more likely to succeed, given their greater ability to maintain customer attention and interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Alalwan, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Fang et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>To optimize customer learning on desktop browser-based interactions, the use of personalized content is suggested to enhance user-perceived relevance of brand-related content.</p><p>Here, opt-in content marketing can be used, which is conducive to ensuring user-perceived relevance. Moreover, differing levels of brand-related content access may be given to different customers (e.g., with those displaying high brand-related learning needs or VIP customers being afforded greater access).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Conclusions</head><p>Though CE and CX are the subject of extensive research in recent years, little remains known regarding their manifestation through mobile app (vs. desktop browser)-based interactions, as therefore investigated in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bleier et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Demangeot &amp; Broderick, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Shankar et al., 2016)</ref>. This study attempts to offer an understanding of online customers' engagement and experience across the platforms (mobile app vs. desktop browser). Identifying whether the effect of CE and CX on relationship quality and loyalty intention differs between the mobile app vs.</p><p>desktop browser-based platform. A quantitative survey-based method was used to achieve the objectives of the study. The empirical results corroborate CE's and CX's impact on customerperceived relationship quality and loyalty intention through these platforms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hollebeek et al., 2019)</ref>, with differing strength. For instance, both CE and CX has a stronger effect on loyalty intention for mobile app than desktop browser-based platforms. However, perceived relationship quality appeared as a critical driver of customer loyalty intent for both desktop mobile-app and browser-based interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Limitations and future research directions</head><p>This study is also subject to several limitations, from which we identify further research opportunities. First, while we explored a particular CE/CX-based nomological network for mobile app-and desktop browser-based interactions, alternate networks may exist that merit further scrutiny. Moreover, though we explored mobile app/desktop browser-based interactions, researchers may wish to include other online/offline platforms (e.g., artificial intelligence-based interactions) to further advance insight <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Ramaswamy &amp; Ozcan, 2016)</ref>. As most consumers tend to use multiple platform types, further investigation of the design of various platforms and their optimal composition represents an important research issue. For example, how are brand communications best designed across mobile app-, website-, online community-, social media-, and offline communications?</p><p>Second, this study did not examine potentially adverse effects of elevated CE/CX, including draining, fatigue, or addictive behavior, which warrant further study. Third, the moderating role of culture, age/gender, cashback/rewards may exist, which may affect the modeled associations. Fourth, though our findings offer important insight into consumer behavior-related dynamics pertaining to mobile app (vs. desktop browser-based) platforms, future validation of these results is required. We, therefore, recommend the undertaking of further (e.g., experimental, qualitative) research to further delve into these issues. For example, qualitative research may be used to unveil the potential existence of other salient concepts (e.g., platform attachment/love) in driving users' platform usage behaviors. Moreover, experimental research may manipulate the levels of specific variables (e.g., high-low platform exposure) to validate, refine, and extend our attained insight.</p><p>Finally, while we used social exchange theory to inform our analyses, alternate theoretical frames may be utilized to understand the associations (direction of causality) between the modeled constructs. For example, future scholars may wish to further tease out the association of CE/CX by examining CX as an antecedent of CE, and across different types of online/offline platforms (e.g., magazine/social media content; <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>, which may be compared/contrasted to the present findings.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
