<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study investigates the mediating role of organizational commitment on the relationship between principals' empowering leadership and teachers' job performance. To this end, it employed a cross-sectional design, one of the quantitative methods. Data were collected through the "Empowering Leadership Behaviors Scale", "Organizational Commitment Scale" and "Job Performance Scale". The sample consisted of 324 teachers working in different cities in Turkey. They were employed through convenience sampling and responded to the scales online. Predictive relationships between variables were revealed using a structural equation model. Before testing the structural model, the validity of the scales and measurement model was investigated. The findings indicated that validity and reliability of scales were ensured. On the other hand, the fit indices regarding the measurement model satisfied the cutoff values in the literature. Since the data did not satisfy the multivariate normal distribution assumption, bootstrapping was used. The findings indicated that empowering leadership is positively associated with teachers' job performance and organizational commitment. On the other hand, organizational commitment boosts job performance. Lastly, empowering school leadership enhances organizational commitment, which in turn teachers' job performance. The findings were discussed based on the literature and some suggestions were made based on the findings.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The leadership role of school principals on the effectiveness and development of the school has attracted considerable attention recently in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abdurrezzak &amp; Uğurlu, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Cerit &amp; Yıldırım, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">May &amp; Supovitz, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Setwong &amp; Prasertcharoensuk, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Slater &amp; Teddlie, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Tatlah &amp; Iqbal, 2012)</ref>. However, as in all other social fields, a transformation and change have become necessary for school leadership. In an increasingly complex environment, it became difficult for school principals to undertake all management and leadership responsibilities of the school alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Beycioğlu &amp; Aslan, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Carter, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Dilekçi &amp; Sezgin Nartgün, 2020)</ref>. In this context, autocratic or hierarchical leadership styles in which organizational power is concentrated are out of date, and sharing power has gained great importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bastian, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Elmazi, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Moran, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Pan, 2007)</ref>. This transformation brought the concept of "teacher empowerment" to the agenda <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Blase &amp; Blase, 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Short, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Short &amp; Rinehart, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Terry, 1995)</ref>. As for educational organizations, empowering leadership emerged from teacher empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Çelik &amp; Konan, 2020)</ref>. In order to achieve the desired outcomes from ongoing reform initiatives in education systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Lee &amp; Nie, 2016)</ref>, the effectiveness of school principal as a leader <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Maxfield &amp; Flumerfelt, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Muzvidziwa, 2014)</ref> and school as an organization and ultimately the creation of a better learning environment are associated with empowered teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Aliakbari &amp; Amoli, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Lutsilili et al., 2014)</ref>. Empowering teachers is regarded as one of the best methods for the school to realize its mission and goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Blase &amp; Blase, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, teachers' commitment is another crucial factor which enhances school effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Bogler &amp; Berkovich, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Özgenel &amp; Koç, 2020)</ref>. It is a critical antecedent of the success of educational reforms and school effectiveness because higher teacher commitment results in extra effort to achieve school vision and goals; therefore, it is important to identify the factors contributing to teachers' commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Selamat et al., 2013)</ref>. In the literature, it is stated that teachers' empowerment is one of the most effective ways to enhance teachers' commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Muhammad &amp; Hussain Ch., 2020)</ref>. Thus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Bogler and Somech (2004)</ref> found that empowered teachers display a higher level of organizational commitment which implies that empowering leadership is promising to have more committed teachers. As well as being an outcome of empowering leadership, organizational commitment is an antecedent of performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Boz et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Mailool et al., 2020)</ref> on which schools mainly rely to achieve their goals. Considering the importance of these three variables in terms of school effectiveness, there is a need to further investigate the relationships among them.</p><p>Previous literature also suggested that teachers' being more involved in critical decisions that direct the school, being more autonomous and being exposed to more school-related input, may cause stress by complicating communication processes and harm their motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Davis &amp; Wilson, 2000)</ref>. Based on this, the efforts to empower teachers can have negative outcomes. As a matter of fact, studies conducted in different sectors reveal that there is not always a linear relationship between employee empowerment and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Cheong et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Hao et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Humborstad et al., 2014)</ref>. Considering the limited empirical evidence on the effects of empowering school leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Atik &amp; Celik, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Çelik &amp; Konan, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Lee &amp; Nie, 2013)</ref>, there is a need to further examine the relationship between teacher empowerment and performance. Based on the aforementioned gap in the literature, the mediating role of organizational commitment on the relationship between empowering school leadership and teacher job performance is investigated in the present study. Thus, this study aims to provide insight into the relationship between empowering leadership and teacher performance and to reveal the processes through which empowering school leadership affect performance. Additionally, the findings are supposed to have significant implications for school administrators in terms of leadership style that they should adopt. Lastly, the study can extend our existing knowledge on empowering school leadership and guide the theoretical frameworks in further research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empowering Leadership</head><p>The concept of "empowering leadership" was first proposed by <ref type="bibr">Manz and</ref><ref type="bibr">Sims (1989, 1991)</ref>. Researchers defined the concept, which they expressed as leaders directing employees to self-management, as "super leadership" <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Knezovic &amp; Musrati, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Liu, 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Pearce et al. (2003)</ref> argued that empowering leadership could be regarded as a distinctive leadership behavior and determined that empowering leadership behaviors are gathered in a separate dimension from transformative, interactional, and directive leadership behaviors. According to the authors, directive leadership embodies organizing, problem solving, clarifying roles, and objectives, informing and monitoring; transactional leadership recognizing, and rewarding; transformational leadership planning, motivating, inspiring, and networking. On the other hand, empowering leadership covers consulting, delegating, supporting, developing, and mentoring, and managing conflict, and team building.</p><p>While leadership is defined as the process of influencing others, empowering leadership can be conceptualized as empowering subordinates to influence rather than influencing them <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Knezovic &amp; Musrati, 2018)</ref>. Empowering leadership can be regarded as an approach that offers leaders a prescription for the distribution and use of power <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Vecchio et al., 2010)</ref>. In its broadest term, empowering leadership is the behavior of the leader to share her / his power with subordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Amundsen &amp; Martinsen, 2014)</ref>. Empowering leaders increase the meaningfulness of the work for the employee by ensuring that employees understand the importance of their contribution to the overall effectiveness of the organization; express confidence in the employee's competence, and possibility of high performance by encouraging the employee to make decisions about how to do her/his job, and offering autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Audenaert &amp; Decramer, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Zhang &amp; Bartol, 2010)</ref>. Empowering leadership behaviors are listed as delegation of authority, coordination, and information sharing, encouragement of initiative, and being goal-oriented, support of effectiveness, inspiration, modeling, motivational support, participatory decision-making, showing interest, assuming responsibility, providing opportunities for professional development, coaching for innovative performance, guidance, participatory goal setting, and encouraging teamwork <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ahearne et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Amundsen &amp; Martinsen, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Arnold et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Davis &amp; Wilson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Dennerlein, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Konczak et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Pearce et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Considering school organizations, empowerment is defined as the processes that offer the school stakeholders the opportunity to take responsibility for their professional development, and solve their own problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Short et al., 1994)</ref>. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Short (1994)</ref> briefly explains the dimensions of teacher empowerment as follows:</p><p>Participation in decision making: It refers to the participation of the teacher in class and school level decisions. Achieving the desired results from participating in decisions depends only on the teachers being sure that her/his involvement in the process will affect the outcomes.</p><p>Professional development: It refers to the teacher's perception that the school offers the opportunity to develop professionally, learn continuously, increase professional skills, and work collaboratively <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Short &amp; Rinehart, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Status: It is the perception that teacher is respected and appreciated.</p><p>Self-efficacy: It is the perception that the teacher has the abilities and skills that can aid student learning and the competence to develop a curriculum for students.</p><p>Autonomy: It refers to the perception of whether the teacher has control over key elements in a professional sense or not.</p><p>Impact: It is the perception that the teacher is valuable for the school; s/he affects teaching and learning processes and her/his ideas are put into practice.</p><p>Empowering school leadership is to create a sense of trust in teachers, develop shared management structures, ensure teacher participation in problem-solving, and decision-making mechanisms, enable teacher autonomy, encourage innovation, creativity and risk-taking, reward, offer support, the delegation of authority, providing intellectual stimulation, affirming and appreciating, creating a vision, encouraging collaborative relationships, respecting the teacher's ideas, providing the teacher with resources for the benefit of students, being a role model and displaying personality traits such as being interested, enthusiastic, optimistic, honest and approachable <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bastian, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Blase &amp; Blase, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Konan &amp; Çelik, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Lee &amp; Nie, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Reitzug, 1994)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organizational Commitment</head><p>Employee commitment is very important for organizations to achieve their goals by performing at a high level <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Princy &amp; Rebeka, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Visanh &amp; Xu, 2018)</ref>, develop and maintain sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Batugal &amp; Tindowen, 2019)</ref>. Because of its importance for organizations, organizational commitment is one of the mostly discussed issues in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Al Jabri &amp; Ghazzawi, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Bogler &amp; Berkovich, 2020)</ref>. Interest in organizational commitment increased especially in the 1980s, and commitment became a rival to the concept of job satisfaction as an organizational research topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Meyer et al., 1993)</ref>. In general terms, organizational commitment is the internalization of organizational goals and values and a feeling of loyalty towards the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Kushman, 1992)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Meyer and Allen (1991)</ref> described the concept, which was previously considered as attitudinal and behavioral commitment, as a psychological condition, and discussed it in three dimensions: affective, continuance, and normative commitment. Accordingly, organizational commitment characterizes the employee's relationship with the organization and includes implications of whether s/he wants to continue organizational membership. These three dimensions of organizational commitment can be briefly explained as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Meyer &amp; Allen, 1991</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Meyer et al., 1993)</ref>. Affective commitment refers to the emotional attachment of the employee towards, the level of identification with and involvement in the organization. Employees with high affective commitment stay because they want to stay in the organization. On the other hand, continuance commitment refers to the cost that employee associates with leaving the organization. Employees who have continuance commitment remain in the organization because they must remain. Finally, normative commitment refers to the employee's feeling of obligation to work and the employee feels a moral obligation to stay in the organization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Meyer and Allen (1991)</ref> stated that any employee can experience organizational commitment dimensions at different levels. While an employee feels a strong desire or necessity to stay in the organization, s/he may feel a low-level obligation. Another employee may have a low level of desire, a medium level of necessity, and a high level of obligation. Therefore, it can be said that three dimensions of organizational commitment affect behavior interactively and a researcher who wants to better understand the employee's relationship with the organization should consider these three dimensions together <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Meyer &amp; Allen, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Considering educational organizations, we can state that teachers' commitment is important for the success of educational reforms and the effectiveness of the school and teaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Adeyemo, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Celep, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Devos et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Firestone &amp; Pennell, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Hamid et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Kushman, 1992)</ref>. Educational organizations need teachers with high organizational commitment to create/maintain a competitive edge and perform at a higher level <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bashir &amp; Gani, 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Croswell (2006)</ref> stated that teaching is not limited to activities carried out in the classroom; therefore, teacher commitment should be considered from a broader perspective.</p><p>As a matter of fact, three types of commitment are mentioned in terms of the teaching profession in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Celep, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Croswell, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Firestone &amp; Pennell, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Firestone &amp; Rosenblum, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Fresko et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Kushman, 1992)</ref> which are commitment to the students, teaching (profession) and school. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Firestone and Pennell (1993)</ref>, teachers need to feel all these commitment types to professionalize and respond to the complex demands brought about by the changes in teaching practices while following them simultaneously. This study handles organizational commitment in terms of affective, continuance and normative dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Meyer et al., 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Teachers' organizational commitment can be defined as a considerable level of loyalty towards a particular school <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Firestone &amp; Rosenblum, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Park, 2005)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Park (2005)</ref>, a consensus about the mission of the school, working conditions and social relations between teachers can contribute to the development of this loyalty. <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Tsui and Cheng (1999)</ref> described teachers' organizational commitment as the level of identification and involvement with the school. Teachers' organizational commitment can be characterized by a strong belief and acceptance of the school's goals, mission, and values; a willingness to make a considerable effort for the school; a strong desire to pursue a career in the current school; and a tendency to take on different roles on behalf of the school <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Celep, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Firestone &amp; Rosenblum, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Park, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Sheikh, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Tsui &amp; Cheng, 1999)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Kushman (1992)</ref> commitment in educational organizations can yield the effort required for the better learning of students who learn relatively difficult, the necessary loyalty to create a culture of continuous academic excellence and teacher professionalism, and a consensus among teachers towards the basic educational goals and values of the school. Additionally, Kushman stated that organizational commitment in schools can function as a powerful motivational tool when bureaucratic rules and external rewards are not appropriate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Sheikh (2017)</ref> indicated that teachers with high organizational commitment will have a low rate of absenteeism, a strong enthusiasm to come to school, and tend to display organizational citizenship behavior. In this sense, when schools create an environment to increase teachers' organizational commitment, they can have a more dedicated, enthusiastic, and responsible teaching staff which in turn can contribute to better student learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Job Performance</head><p>As the realization of organizational goals depends largely on employee performance, the performance level of employees is of great importance for organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Ramos-Villagrasa et al., 2019)</ref>. Job performance can be defined as employee actions and behaviors that contribute to or facilitate the achievement of organizational goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Fogaça et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Sackett &amp; DeVore, 2005)</ref>; the total value expected to provide the organization by different behavioral patterns the employee exhibits in a standard time period <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Motowidlo &amp; Kell, 2013)</ref>. The most commonly referred dimensions of job performance in literature are task, contextual, and adaptive performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Borman &amp; Motowidlo, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Griffin et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Sonnentag et al., 2008)</ref>. Task performance refers to the behaviors that directly include the production of products or services, or activities that indirectly support the core technical processes of the organization; contextual performance to behavioral patterns that support the psychological or social context in which task activities are carried out <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Van Scotter et al., 2000)</ref>; and adaptive performance to the ability to meet the demands of a dynamic environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Charbonnier-Voirin &amp; Roussel, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Educational organizations that train human capital, the most important asset of society, need teachers with high performance to achieve their goals. Since job performance is defined as fulfilling the requirements of a specific job successfully <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Chaithra &amp; Hiremath, 2018)</ref>, there may be job-specific performance definitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Koopmans et al., 2011)</ref>. Thus, teacher job performance is related to how effectively a teacher performs his job <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Polat &amp; Abaslı, 2019)</ref> and the level of contribution s/he offers to school's goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Duze, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Özdemir &amp; Gören, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Özdemir &amp; Yirmibeş, 2016)</ref>. The success and quality of the educational service offered by the school is closely associated with the quality and performance levels of its teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Mgbere &amp; Andrew, 2019)</ref>. Therefore, it can be stated that teacher performance is among the main factors that contribute to the academic success of students, the ultimate goal of the school <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Cerit, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Osagie &amp; Akinlosotu, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Polat, 2019)</ref>. For this reason, revealing the factors affecting teacher performance is important in terms of improving student learning, which is the purpose of the school's existence.</p></div>

Thus, based on the previous literature it can be anticipated that empowering leadership may increase teachers' organizational commitment which in turn positively contribute to performance. This implies that organizational commitment could play a mediating role on the relationship between empowering leadership and job performance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>The sample of the study consisted of 324 teachers employed through convenience sampling method <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Mertens, 2010)</ref> and the sample size can be considered satisfactory for a study in which structural equation modelling is used <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. This sampling method was chosen because it offers some advantages in terms of cost of locating participants, the geographic distribution of the sample and obtaining data from the selected elements. On the other hand, in this sampling method the researchers do not put as much focus on the representativeness of the sample as in purposive sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Lavrakas, 2008)</ref>. This is also an internal validity study which aims to validate a model including predictive relationships between variables, so it was not carried out on a sample. Internal validity seeks to demonstrate that the explanation of a particular event, issue or set of data which a piece of research provides can actually be sustained by the data while external validity refers to the degree to which the results can be generalized to the wider population, cases, or situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Cohen et al., 2005)</ref>. So, teachers from different cities were included in the study. Of the participants, 187 were women (57.7%) and 137 men (42.3%). Of the participants 312 were working in public (96.3%) and 12 in private schools (3.7%). 11 participants were working in pre-schools (3.4%), 60 in primary schools (28.5%), 81 in secondary schools (25%), 160 in high schools (49.4%) and 12 in other educational institutions (3.7%). The average age of teachers participating in the study is 39.27 (SD=7.62); of teaching experience is 15.31 years (SD=7.77), duration of working with current school principals is 2.51 years (SD=2.53) and duration of working at current schools is 5.42 years (SD=4.43).</p></div>

In the present study, empowering leadership of principals was the independent variable, organizational commitment was the mediator and teacher job performance was the dependent variable. Firstly, it was examined whether there was a multicollinearity problem between empowering leadership and organizational commitment as variables that predict teacher job performance. The findings <ref type="bibr">(Tolerance=.661;</ref><ref type="bibr">VIF=1.513;</ref><ref type="bibr">r=.586)</ref> showed that there was no multicollinearity between predictor variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Field, 2009)</ref>. Multivariate normality assumption was checked through "multivariate kurtosis and its critical ratio". The findings indicated that the data did not satisfy multivariate normality assumption (Multivariate Kurtosis=219.629; CR=36.795). Thus, non-parametric "bootstrapping" method <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Byrne, 2016)</ref>, which does not require the normal distribution of data, was employed to reveal direct and indirect relationships.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study focused on the relationships between principals' empowering leadership behaviors, teachers' organizational commitment, and job performance. The literature indicates statistically significant relationships between variables. Based on the existing literature, the main suggestion of the current study was that principals' empowering leadership behaviors increase teachers' job performance through organizational commitment. The hypotheses were investigated through structural equation model.</p><p>The first hypothesis of the study was that school principals' empowering leadership behaviors predicted teachers' organizational commitment. Previous research showed that empowering leadership positively contributed to organizational commitment by providing employees with autonomy and development opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Kim &amp; Beehr, 2020)</ref>. The findings confirmed the first hypothesis, which was consistent with previous literature. Accordingly, principals' empowering leadership behaviors increase teachers' organizational commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Aliakbari &amp; Amoli, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Batugal &amp; Tindowen, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Bogler, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Bogler &amp; Somech, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Boonyarit et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Gordon, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Gretkierewicz, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Gümüş, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Hamid et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Holliman, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Özdemir &amp; Gören, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Somech, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Wu &amp; Short, 1996)</ref>. A school environment in which the principal delegates authority and responsibility, enables teachers to participate in decisions, effectively shares information with the teacher, enables them to develop their professional skills, and coaches for innovative performance, can contribute to the teachers' adoption of the values and goals of the school and continue her/his career in school. Teacher empowerment will increase the school's effectiveness and the attractiveness of the school as an organization to work for <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Kõiv et al., 2019)</ref>. Additionally, it is stated that teachers who are empowered to take the initiative and responsibility related to their duties by school principals will have higher professional satisfaction through self-realization <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Boonyarit et al., 2010)</ref>, which can contribute to the commitment to the school as an organization.</p><p>The second hypothesis of the study suggested that principals' empowering leadership behaviors could be associated with job performance positively. The previous literature suggested that empowered employees would develop a sense of belonging to their jobs, which would reflect positively on their performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Kundu et al., 2019)</ref>. The findings showed that the direct effect of empowering leadership on job performance was not significant; however, the total indirect effect was significant supporting the second hypothesis. Based on this, we can say that empowering leadership predicted teachers' job performance. This finding is consistent with previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Özdemir &amp; Gören, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Somech, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Vecchio et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Yao et al., 2020)</ref>. These studies revealed that teacher empowerment increased performance. Empowerment enables teachers to realize their own potential and limitations and they gain competence in terms of professional development <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Balyer et al., 2017)</ref>, which can be regarded as a factor enhancing their performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Balkar (2015)</ref> stated that schools with empowering cultures had an environment convenient for increasing the professional performance of teachers. When empowered, teachers feel a higher level of responsibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Kim &amp; Beehr, 2020)</ref> and motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Boonyarit et al., 2010)</ref>. Shortly, we can argue that teachers who are empowered exert greater effort to show a higher level of performance as suggested by findings.</p><p>The third hypothesis of the study suggested that there was a significant association between teachers' organizational commitment and their performance. Committed and dedicated teachers are the most important assets of schools, and both quality and quantity of performance are closely related to commitment and dedication <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Absar &amp; Das Swain, 2009)</ref>. The findings in this study indicated that organizational commitment significantly predicted teachers' job performance. In other words, as organizational commitment increases, teacher job performance will also increase. This is consistent with previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Doğan &amp; Çelik, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Flynn, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Laily &amp; Wahyuni, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Sheikh, 2017)</ref>. Teachers who adopt the values, goals and objectives of the school and regard themselves as a part of the organization tend to exhibit both inrole and extra-role behaviors more 2019). Committed teachers will feel considerable loyalty to the school and will be willing to fulfill the organizational tasks assigned to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Firestone &amp; Rosenblum, 1988)</ref> and spend effort on behalf of the school <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Park, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Sheikh, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The last hypothesis of the study was that principals' empowering leadership behaviors had an indirect effect on job performance through organizational commitment. The findings confirmed the hypothesis, which means that empowering leadership increases teachers' organizational commitment, enhancing performance. The finding is consistent with the previous research suggesting indirect relationship between empowerment and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Bogler &amp; Somech, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Kariuki &amp; Kiambati, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Lestari &amp; Yunianto, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Muhammad &amp; Abdullah, 2016)</ref>. Additionally, studies conducted in other sectors provide empirical evidence that empowering leadership has an indirect effect on job performance through such variables as self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ahearne et al., 2005)</ref>; harmonious passion for work <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Hao et al., 2018)</ref>; team cohesion and knowledge sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Tung &amp; Chang, 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This study concluded that principals empowering leadership behaviors enhance teachers' organizational commitment and job performance. On the other hand, a higher organizational commitment means a higher level of job performance. Additionally, empowering leadership has an indirect effect on teacher job performance through organizational commitment. In other words, the commitment of the teachers who are empowered increases, which has a positive effect on their performance. If principals desire to increase teachers' commitment and performance, they should empower them by delegating authority and responsibility, sharing knowledge, facilitating professional development, involving teachers in decision making processes and providing them with guidance for innovative performance.</p><p>The current study also extended our existing knowledge regarding the effects of teacher empowerment on organizational outcomes. A thorough literature review did not yield a study examining the relationships among these variables, which means that this study has contributed considerably to educational leadership literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>The findings revealed that there are statistically significant associations among empowering leadership, teacher commitment, and job performance. Based on the findings, the current study implies the following:</p><p>• Principals should be provided with training on how to empower teachers.</p><p>• Particularly for countries with highly centralized educational systems, such as Turkey, where this study was carried out, principals should be legally supported to empower teachers.</p><p>• Principals, on the other hand, should strive to create an empowering school culture.</p><p>• They should act as a facilitator for teachers and help teachers' professional development.</p><p>• They should also create a school environment in which teachers feel valuable and realize their personal goals and organizational ones to enhance organizational commitment.</p><p>• Schools should find incentives to retain committed teachers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Although it has considerable implications, the current study was conducted within some limitations. Firstly, teachers' organizational commitment and job performance levels were measured using self-reported scales, which may bring social desirability into question. However, while social desirability may cause mean scores to increase, it does not pose a significant problem in terms of the relationships between variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Luyten &amp; Bazo, 2019)</ref>. Secondly, since this was a cross-sectional study, it does not provide evidence for causal relationships between variables. Further research may overcome this limitation by conducting studies in experimental and longitudinal design. Finally, the model tested in the study is limited to Turkish cultural context.
