<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are a common challenge faced in healthcare facilities, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Evaluating the level of KAP among healthcare personnel regarding HCAI prevention and identifying the relevant factors is important for handling and controlling these infections. Therefore, this study aimed to know the direct and indirect effects of knowledge, attitude, and practices of HCWs towards HCAIs prevention in Jimma University medical center (JUMC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method:</head><p>The primary data was collected from the sampled health professionals. The total sample size was 262 from 1354 health professionals working in JUMC using the population proportion stratified random sampling method. An institutional cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April 2022. The data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to identify the direct and indirect effects of KAP of HCWs on HCAIs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The study shows that 55% (144 respondents) were nurses and 52.7% were female participants. The goodness of fit indices for the hypothetical model specification and selection proved that the model was appropriate to analyze the data. The study findings indicated that the standardized direct effects of HCW occupational skill in HCAIs prevention on knowledge and attitudes were significant effect (βosk=1.43, Posk=0.004 and βosa=0.65, Posa=0.004).Whereas HCWs' practice on HCAIs had an effect (βosp=-0.79, Posp=0.004). The attitude of HCWs towards HCAIs prevention practice and knowledge were significant effect with p-value Pap=.002 and Pak=.003 respectively. On the other hand mediating effect showed that the attitude of HCWs toward their knowledge through practice towards HCAIs prevention was significant effects (γak=.426, Pak=.003). At the same time occupational skills of HCWs towards practice of HCAIs prevention through attitude was a significant effect (γosp=.523, Posp=.002).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>The study results indicated that both attitude and occupational skills can be improved through practice which finally brings a statistically significant improvement in the knowledge of HCWs about HCAIs prevention.</p></div>

Successful prevention and control procedures should be implemented each time, specifically by HCWs, to reduce the risk of HCAIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(WHO, 2017)</ref>. The growing need to train clinicians with adequate knowledge, attitudes, and skills to improve patient safety has encouraged research works to develop training interventions for medical students <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Alper et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Halbach &amp; Sullivan, 2005)</ref>. Occupational skills have been recognized as both crucial to patient safety and for highly trained health professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Arora et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The knowledge, attitude, and practices theory model underlines the importance of knowledge and attitude in social decision-making, explains the group of health behavior, and predicts the change of behavior by exploring the KAP of high-risk groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Korkmaz et al., 2021)</ref>. KAP theory states that health knowledge is the basis for establishing a positive attitude and healthy performance.</p><p>Attitude is the motivational influence for behavioral change to help healthy behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bettinghaus, 1986)</ref>. Earlier studies evaluated the level of KAP towards infection prevention among healthcare workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gulilat &amp; Tiruneh, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sahiledengle et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tenna et al., 2013)</ref>. According to KAP theory, there exists a causal connection between KAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Yang et al., 2005)</ref>. Although the classical multivariate statistical method can be the one that identifies the factors that affect KAP, but this could not help elucidate the complex causal relationships involved in the process <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abid et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Tarka, 2018)</ref>. A structural equation model <ref type="bibr">(SEM)</ref> which is a multivariate statistical skill that includes confirmatory factor analysis, path analysis, and multiple regression analysis is a better way to look at causal relationship. SEM can deal with latent variables and observe indicators and measurement errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beran &amp; Violato, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Zheng et al., 2021)</ref>. SEM is flexible and important to determine the direct and indirect effects of variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kline, 2015)</ref> but its applicability in health-related fields is limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beran &amp; Violato, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies in Ethiopia assessed using one-dimensional factors of KAP of healthcare workers towards infection prevention and related factors and found out that the magnitude of KAP towards infection prevention among healthcare workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Assefa et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Desta et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Geberemariyam et al., 2018)</ref>. This study is designed to employ structural equation modeling to examine the relationships that existed between the KAP of HCW on HCAIs.</p><p>Therefore, the study aimed to identify the associations found between the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of health professionals to HCAIs in JUMC. The specific objectives of the study were to (i) identify the relationship that existed between HCW's KAP with HCAIs; and (ii) this study identified the indirect link that existed between the HCW knowledge, attitudes and practices to HCAIs in JUMC.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Study area and design</head><p>A cross-sectional study was carried out among HCWs in JUMC in March and April 2022. All HCWs who were working in JUMC were considered, particularly those who were at high risk. All HCWs working in JUMC during data collection were included in the study. However, those HCWs who were on annual, maternity, or educational leave and were off work from their duty due to health problems were excluded.</p><p>The sample size required for the study was computed using the formula below to estimate population proportion in the stratified random sampling technique. The total sample size estimated for the study was 262 HCWs. Next, the sample size for each stratum was estimated using the formula of:</p><p>. The stratified sampling technique was used for selecting the sampling units, which was described below. The study includes 5 categories, which are considered strata for this study. The sample sizes in each section were considered the size of the stratum, as per the size of the population, which is proportional allocation <ref type="bibr">(Physician,</ref><ref type="bibr">50;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nurse,</ref><ref type="bibr">144;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pharmacist,</ref><ref type="bibr">27;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lab technician,</ref><ref type="bibr">28;</ref><ref type="bibr">and others 13)</ref>. Thus, the total sample sizes of the study participants were 262 from 1354 HCWs. Finally, using the database of HCWs from each division in JUMC, a simple random sampling was applied to take the sample unit (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Data collection tool and procedure</head><p>The questionnaire was constructed following the structure of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hussein et al. (2017)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bayleyegn et al. (2021)</ref>, and Thankam and Goswami (2021) centered on demographic, educational, and institutional characteristics of study participants, which could help to determine the level of KAP towards HCAIs preventions. To measure the knowledge of HCW on HCAIs prevention, participants were provided with four open-ended questions. This was developed by considering on mode of transmission and prevention, and type and site of infection.</p><p>The practice and attitude questionnaires were developed following the related literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Geberemariyam et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Tietjen et al., 2003)</ref>, and the content was adapted from related studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gulilat &amp; Tiruneh, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tenna et al., 2013)</ref>. Trained nurses managed the data collection procedure. The questionnaire has four sub-sections. The first part of the survey covers the demographic features of healthcare workers (age, sex, ethnicity, profession, year of service, prior training, workload, and availability of HH stations, and colored waste bins). The second part constitutes four questions concerning the knowledge of HCWs on HCAIs prevention. The third part consists of nine questions linked to HCAIs prevention practices. The fourth part contains six questions concerning the attitude of HCWs toward HCAIs prevention. The questionnaires were tested for completeness and reliability. The data collection tool was tested for internal consistency (reliability) using Cronbach's alpha test.</p><p>For each knowledge questions, participants were allowed to give correct answers. The answers to each question were compiled from previous published articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Doron &amp; Gorbach, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Eriksen et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Mehta et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Welliver &amp; McLaughlin, 1984)</ref>. For each correct response on the knowledge dimension, the study applied based their responses and use the Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 in which (1 = very poor for those with no correct response, 2 = poor for HCW with one correct response, 3 = fair for having two correct responses, 4 = good for having three correct responses, and 5 = excellent for correct responses of four and above). Higher scores represented better knowledge. The six questions concerning the attitude dimension of HCW towards HCAIs were evaluated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = not sure, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree). Higher scores indicated a more positive attitude towards to HCAIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Oluwagbemiga et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Xu et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>For HCAIs practices, there were nine questions on the practice dimension of HCW which were rated using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 (1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, and 5 = always) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kakkar et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>

It helps identify latent variables that are believed to exist but cannot be directly observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Curran, 2003)</ref>. SEM was used due to as it has the basic assumption of multivariate normality that assumes all univariate distributions are normal; SEM also assumes no multicollinearity because it constitutes a large number of endogenous and exogenous variables, which increases the possibility of inter-correlations among some of the variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kline, 2015)</ref>. The present research work applied structural equations and latent variable models to investigate the effects of KAP on IPC.</p></div>

It helps to assess the strength of the relationship between the items and the constructs of interest and the availability of information across the latent construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hill et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) can help examine factor analysis, construct validity, and easy for reliability analysis in several ways. CFA is another kind of SEM related to measurement models <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brown, 2015)</ref>. The implementation of CFA is valuable to support the linking items and their particular domains. This permits the fixing of the relationships in the analysis model and presents methods to assess the fit of the planned theoretical model to the collected data <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Stevens, 2012)</ref>. Therefore, we conducted CFA to verify the factorial structure of the KAP towards HCAIs among HCWs.</p><p>The unobserved latent constructed to observed variables and the measurement model is</p><p>Where y and x are vectors of observed relation with the latent endogenous vector and the latent exogenous vector , respectively. The vectors and are vectors of measurement errors, and y and x are regression coefficients relating y to , and x to , respectively. Finally, we assume that and that ϵ, δ, η, ξ and ξ are mutually independent.</p><p>The study's exogenous latent variable is an occupational skill and endogenous latent variables are knowledge, attitude, and practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reliability and validity test of data</head><p>Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficients were computed in the sub-scales of KAP to determine the internal consistency of the questionnaires. A sample of 30 healthcare providers completed a questionnaire, to examine the stability of the scale.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dziuban &amp; Shirkey, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hadi et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Also, the Cronbach alpha values are more significant than which confirmed measures of consistency in the acceptable region (J.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Characteristics of respondents</head><p>Among the total participants, 52.7% of them were female. A greater part of the study respondents, 37.4% were in the age group of 26-29 years old, 20.6%, were in the age group of 34-37 and 2.3%</p><p>were in the age group of greater than 41 years old. Regarding educational status, most of the respondents, 68.3% were master's degree holders, 24.8% were bachelor's degrees, 4.6% were specialists and the remaining 2.3% were diploma holders. Regarding professional working experience, 46.5% had 5-8 years of work experience, 36.3% had 1-4 years of work experience and around 17% of participants had more than eight years of work experience. The study result reveals that the workloads of respondents 75.2% of participants were less or equal to eight work hours per day(Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Health professions and KAP</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Knowledge about the mode of transmission and prevention of HCAIs</head><p>All health professionals have above-average knowledge of modes of HCAI transmission with slightly low in nurses. Knowledge of HCW methods of HCAI prevention, less than 15% of them had no clear knowledge of it. On the common site of nosocomial infection, 15.7% of the nurses had poor and very poor knowledge while the rest HCWs had average and above score. In addition, knowing common type of HCAI was low in nurses than the rest HCWs in JUMC (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Attitude of healthcare workers towards HCAIs</head><p>Attitudes of HCWs towards hospital-acquired infection prevention, the findings exhibited the existence of variation. For instance, about 62.9% of the HCW strongly agree and agree on the attitude of the relevance of categorizing hospital waste before disposal. However, 24.1% of HCWs (nurses) had an attitude less than average agreement on the relevance of categorizing hospital waste before disposal. For instance, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3B</ref> on attitudes of HCW to hand hygiene after removing gloves, the result showed that those who strongly agree and agree shared 10.4, 31.3, 6.1, 6.9 and 3.8% of the physican, nurses, pharmacists, lab techician and the rest HCW, respectively. Concerning the attitudes to changing gloves before moving to another patient, more than average (&gt;52%) HCWs had an attitude of strongly agreed and agreed on its relevance to preventing HCAIs but 33.2% HCWs( nurses) had below average (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a-f</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Practices of healthcare workers towards HCAIs</head><p>Responses concerning the practice of HCWs were reported in Appendix Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The practice of health professionals towards to HCAIs had shown variation.</p><p>A majority of HCW professionals in each guiding question on HCAIs prevention scored above average(always and often), which were from 56.5% to 76.3%. For instance, HCWs had differences in the frequency of hand hygiene practice after completing the procedure. From total 18.3% of the physican, 51% of the nurses, 9.5% of the lab technicians, 9.9%, and 4.2% of the other health professionals practice it always, often, and sometimes. For the rest practice guidelines of HCW, we would like to refer to appendix Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Standardized direct effect of a structural model</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Indirect effects of the structural model</head><p>One of the vital features of the SEM is that mediating variables can be introduced. This helps to report the indirect effects of the mediating variables in addition to the direct effect. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref> presents the indirect effect estimates in parentheses, along with the size of the effect, as an example of presenting the main results for mediating effects. The result showed that the attitude of HCWs toward their knowledge through practice towards HCAIs prevention was positive and indirect significant effects (γak=.426, Pak=.003). At the same time occupational skills of HCWs towards practice of HCAIs prevention through attitude was a positive and indirect significant effect (γosp=.523, Posp=.002). On the other hand, the occupational skill of HCWs towards HCAIs practice on prevention through attitude was a negative indirect significant effect (γosk=-</p><p>.755, Posp=.003). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Knowledge is the origin of varying practices, and attitude is the powerful force of change <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jiang et al., 2017)</ref>. Thus understanding the KAP of HCWs concerning HCAIs is critical in establishing HCAI prevention measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Wu et al., 2021)</ref>. This study assessed the effect of KAP on HCAIs among HCWs using latent variables.</p><p>In our study, knowledge concerning the modes of transmission of HCAI, methods of prevention of HCAI, common sites of nosocomial infection, and invasive procedures risk factor aspects of HCAIs were generally above average and following current scientific evidence. In relative terms, the knowledge level of the nurses was below average on modes of transmission of HCAIs, which constitutes 43.8%, and on common sites of nosocomial infection that share 28.4% of them.</p><p>Although the majority of HCWs in the study hospital were aware of the methods of prevention of HCAIs and invasive procedures, there were some areas where their knowledge was low, particularly regarding modes of transmission and sites of nosocomial infection in the hospital. As a result, the HCW needs to learn and train more to reduce the rate of HCAIs. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Parmeggiani et al. (2010)</ref>, continuing education is vital to continuing medical advantage in the hospital environment. This study's findings partly agreed with <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sarani et al. (2016)</ref>, who reported that most nurses (43%) had poor knowledge about HCAIs in Iran. The result supports the conclusion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ghadmgahi et al. (2011)</ref> on the KAP of nurses concerning HCAIs control in which most nurses have below-average knowledge of HCAIs. The findings of this study indicated that there could be varied according to the education level of HCW. The reason was that respondents with higher education status were more likely to know the modes of transmission and the common site of nosocomial infection in a hospital environment. This might be due to the direct link between study duration at university and thus those enrolled in university could gain more information on HCAIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Sessa et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The study finding showed that occupational skills had a direct effect on KAP. This implied that</p><p>HCWs with a great level of occupational skill towards HCAIs prevention have had better knowledge and attitude. Compared with previous studies elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adegboye et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aftab et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bayleyegn et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Desta et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ghadmgahi et al., 2011)</ref>, this study finding indicates the direct effects of occupational skills on KAP of HCWs. Our study showed that occupational skills had a direct effect on KAP. This implied that HCWs with a great level of occupational skill towards HCAIs prevention have had better knowledge and attitude. Meanwhile, the level of occupational skill of HCWs was less likely to practice HCAIs prevention.</p><p>Consistently, the knowledge and practice level of healthcare workers towards HCAIs were significantly associated with their professional status and infection prevention training <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Assefa et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Geberemariyam et al., 2018)</ref>. Similarly attitude and practice level of healthcare workers towards HCAIs in JUMC were significantly associated with their educational status, which was consistent with study findings in Gonder and Debre-Markos specialized and referral hospitals <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bayleyegn et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Desta et al., 2018)</ref>. This confirmed that KAP had a direct relationship with the education status, professional status, and infection prevention training of HCWs.</p><p>This research applied a structural equation model to assess the KAP impacts on HCAIs in JUMC.</p><p>Worldwide as well as in Ethiopia, there were sufficient research works addressing the direct impacts of KAP on HCAIs. However, this research tried to investigate the indirect association among knowledge, attitude, and practices on HCAIs using a structural equation model and confirmatory factor analysis. Thus, the factor effect is more powerful than the individual effect for KAP. The model explained that there was a positive direct effect of occupational skills on knowledge and attitude toward HCAIs prevention. Similarly, the attitude and knowledge of HCWs on the practices of HCAIs prevention have a positive direct significant effect. However, occupational skills on the other hand had a negative but direct significant effect on the practices of HCWs towards HCAIs prevention. Similarly, the attitudes of HCWs regarding their knowledge of preventing HCAIs have a negative direct significant association. This implied that increasing the degree of the attitude of HCWs towards HCAIs prevention determines their knowledge level on HCAIs and infection prevention practice. Moreover, improvement of occupational skills has positive and indirect effects on HCWs' attitudes and practices towards to HCAIs prevention.</p><p>The findings help to conclude that increasing the positive attitude and high practices toward HCAIs was a restriction of the study that limited our findings. To reduce this problem, we included adequate, useable, and reliable items, used by other authors to help with assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>The study highlights that the nurses are relatively had poor knowledge than the rest HCW on modes of transmission of HCAIs and a common site of nosocomial infection. Overall, the HCW of JUMC had a high level of KAP and the findings confirmed that there was significantly positive direct association with attitudes and knowledge toward preventing HCAIs. The high level of knowledge and attitudes of health professionals about HCAIs can be a potential for the efficient control of HCAIs transmission to patients and healthcare workers.</p><p>Based on the inferential findings, we can conclude that both attitude and occupational skills can be improved through practice which finally brings a statistically significant improvement in the knowledge of HCWs about HCAIs prevention. On the other hand, there were negative direct effects of occupational skills on the practices of HCAIs prevention. This may demand increasing the number of high-level educated healthcare workers and providing them with continuous onwork training and formal education to upgrade their academic rank. This will have a paramount significance in the future to reduce the dissemination rate of HCAIs to patients and healthcare workers in the studied hospital.</p><p>Declarations:</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>n= and where is the subpopulation proportion for stratum(i), Ni is population size for stratum (i), ), d is a marginal error, and is a critical value for normal distribution at 95% confidence interval which is equal to 1.96 (Z value at alpha = 0.05) (Al-Subaihi, 2003).

As a result, understanding the KAP of the HCWs concerning HCAIs is central to establishing these measures. Therefore, classifying the factors that have important effects on KAP is significant and can provide information basic for implementing infection prevention and intervention measures by IPC managers. Based on the relationships illustrated in the research model in Figure1, the study hypotheses are formed as follows: As depicted in Figure1, occupational skill variables have a direct and indirect impact on practices, attitudes, and knowledge of healthcare-associated infection and prevention. Next, knowledge of HCAI prevention has a direct and indirect link to practices of HCAI prevention. Finally, the attitude has a direct and indirect effect on practices of HCAI prevention.</figDesc></figure>
