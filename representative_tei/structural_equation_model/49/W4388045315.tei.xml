<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Between June and August, there was an increase in monkeypox cases in China, and the mortality rate (7%) caused by monkeypox infection among people living with HIV(PLWH) is higher than that of the general population. It is particularly important for PLWH to adopt healthy behaviors to prevent monkeypox infection. Health education activities to prevent infection have been carried out through various channels, but we know very little about the prevention and control behaviors adopted by PLWH.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>The subjects of this cross-sectional study included 467 PLWHs from Heilongjiang Province, China. The questionnaire was collected through Questionnaire Star from August 11 to September 10, 2023, including general sociological data, cues to action(CA), perceived risk (PR), perceived benefits(PB), perceived obstacles(PO) and executed safety behavior(ESB) data. The effects of CA on PR, PB, PO, and ESB were calculated using a structural equation model, as well as the effects of PR, PB, and PO on ESB. We also calculated the intermediate effects of PR, PB, and PO between CA and ESB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>There were statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) in gender, marital status, sexual orientation, fixed sexual partner, receiving HIV related treatment, heard of monkeypox, more accurate channels for obtaining information, more willing to access information channels, the most satisfactory channel for obtaining information and monkeypox cognition. There weren't statistically significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) in education level and occupation. The structural equation indicates that cues to action(CA) was predictive factors for perceived risk (PR), perceived benefits(PB), perceived obstacles(PO) and executed safety behavior(ESB) (P &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Perceived risk (PR), perceived benefits(PB) and perceived obstacles(PO) were predictive factors for the executed safety behavior(ESB) (P &lt; 0.01). PR played a mediating role of 33.99% between CA and ESB. PO played a mediating role of 6.9% between CA and ESB. PB didn't play a mediating role between CA and ESB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>This study indicates that preventing monkeypox behaviors among PLWH is better, but there is still a gap between correctly implementing preventive behavior by everyone. CA, PR, PB, and PO are predictive factors for ESB. PR and PO play a mediating role between CA and ESB. Therefore, increasing CA, PR, and PB, and reducing PO can be used to improve the ESB of monkeypox among PLWH.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. The frequency and geographical distribution of cases have mainly been concentrated across West and Central Africa in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Over the past few decades, the steady increase in monkeypox cases in Africa has been ignored by the global scientific community until last year <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Since the first discovery of monkeypox cases in the UK in May 2022 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>, many countries have reported confirmed cases of monkeypox <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref>. As of <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">May 30, 2023</ref>, 111 countries worldwide have reported 87858 cases of monkeypox and 143 deaths <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10]</ref>. Due to the increasing number of confirmed cases globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the monkeypox outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on July 23, 2022 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">13]</ref>.</p><p>Currently, monkeypox is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, infectious agents, and direct contact with infected individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[14]</ref>. Recent analysis has found that sexual transmission is the main route of transmission, mostly in males having sex with males subjects <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16]</ref>. Since the first confirmed case of imported monkeypox was reported in mainland China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) in September 2022 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17]</ref>, Local monkeypox outbreak starting in June 2023 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref>. From June to August 2023, there have been relatively high reports of confirmed cases, with 106 new confirmed cases of monkeypox reported in June <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref>, 491 new confirmed cases reported in July <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>, and 501 new confirmed cases reported in August <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref>. Among the 992 cases reported in July and August, only 5 were female (5/992), and the rest were male <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20]</ref>. And the most of the population is clearly male sexual behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21]</ref>.Many reports suggest that high-risk sexual behavior of unprotected sexual contact is a potential risk factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22]</ref>.</p><p>During the outbreak in 2022, the mortality rate caused by monkeypox infection remained below 0.1% <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">24]</ref>， but the mortality rate caused by monkeypox infection among people living with HIV (PLWH) is 7% <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>. PLWH had accounted for 38-50% of patients diagnosed with monkeypox in the 2022 multicountry mpox outbreak <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>. Cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM) and PLWH are disproportionately impacted among the monkeypox outbreak <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">26]</ref>. MSM behavior and high-risk sexual behavior may be risk factors for monkeypox transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">28]</ref>. In view of the increasing number of case reports in Chinese Mainland in July, experts analyzed that it may be related to the hidden transmission of monkeypox epidemic among MSM, and suggested doing a good job in identifying and self monitoring monkeypox to avoid infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[29]</ref>. On May 10, 2023, although the monkeypox is no longer as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern of the WHO <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[30]</ref>. But in August, the reported cases of monkeypox continued to increase despite not decreasing.</p><p>Due to the hidden transmission characteristics of monkeypox <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[29]</ref>, the monkeypox epidemic and prevention knowledge have been transmitted through various channels such as traditional (such as Television, Newspapers, and Radio), new Media channels (such as the Internet, WeChat) and professional channels (such as Communities and Hospitals). However, the number of PLWH with monkeypox is still high <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25]</ref>. The health belief model (HBM) is widely used to predict health-related behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">33]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ESB and Participant Characteristics</head><p>A total of 467 PLWH were enrolled in this study. The average age of the participants was 42.34 years (SD = 13.46). Among the participants, most individuals (94.6%) were male, most individuals (48.1%) were of unmarried, most of them (42.0%) were from middle school or below, most of them (98.5%) were non medical related professions, many had a same-sex sexual orientation (57.6%) and had no fixed sexual partner (68.7%), everyone receives ART treatment (100.0%) and doesn't infected with monkeypox ever or currently(100.0%), 82.7% of participants had heard of monkeypox, 43.4% of participants believed that more accurate channels for obtaining information was professional channels, 40.5% of participants believed that more willing to access information channels was professional channels, 45.4% of participants believed that the most satisfactory channel for obtaining information was professional channels, and 40% of participants' score were 4 or less (see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2 for details</ref>).  </p></div>

As shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, PB had no mediating effect between CA on ESB, PO played a 6.9% mediating role between CA on ESB, and PR played a 33.99% mediating role between CA on ESB(see Tables <ref type="table">3 for details</ref>).</p><p>Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Mediating effect test.</p><p>Note: IV = independent variable; M = mediator; DV = dependent variable. Our findings showed that the healthy behavior of female PLWH in preventing monkeypox is better than that of male, and the difference is statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). Similar findings have been observed in other studies, indicating that women take more preventive measures than men <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[36]</ref>. There is also a statistically significant difference (P&lt;0.001) in the adoption of safe behaviors to prevent monkeypox among different marital states, and the order of scores from highest to lowest is widowed, married, unmarried, and divorced. There is no statistical difference (P&gt;0.05) in the adoption of preventive behavior among different levels of education and professions. No research has been found on the relationship between marital status and monkeypox prevention behavior. This may be related to the less attention paid to monkeypox in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Previous research on the relationship between marital states, occupation, education level, and monkeypox had focused more on knowledge of monkeypox, and less on preventive behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">38]</ref>. There is a statistically significant difference (P&lt;0.001) in the prevention of monkeypox behavior among PLWH with different sexual orientations, and the order of scores from highest to lowest is bisexual, opposite sex and same-sex. The score of PLWH with a fixed sexual partner is higher than that with out a fixed sexual partner, and the difference is statistically significant (P&lt;0.01). There is limited research on the correlation between sexual orientation, fixed sexual partner and monkeypox prevention behavior, but previous studies have confirmed a significant correlation between sexual orientation, fixed sexual partner and monkeypox infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[39]</ref>. Every PLWH has received ART related treatment and doesn't infect with monkeypox ever or currently. PLWH scores of those who have heard of monkeypox are higher than those who have not, and the difference is statistically significant (P&lt;0.01). For the project of more accurate channels for obtaining information, professional channels (such as communities and hospitals) have the highest scores for monkeypox prevention behavior among PLWH, followed by traditional media channels(such as television, newspapers, and radio), and new media channels(such as the internet, WeChat) has the least, with statistically significant differences(P&lt;0.001). For the project of more willing to access information channels, professional channels (such as communities and hospitals) have the highest scores for monkeypox prevention behavior among PLWH, followed by traditional media channels (such as television, newspapers, and radio), and new media channels (such as the internet, WeChat) has the least, with statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.001). For the project of the most satisfactory channel for obtaining information, professional channels (such as communities and hospitals) have the highest scores for monkeypox prevention behavior among PLWH, followed by traditional media channels(such as television, newspapers, and radio), and new media channels(such as the internet, WeChat) has the least, with statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.001). Different cognitive states of monkeypox lead to different prevention behaviors. The higher the score, the better the prevention behavior, and the difference is statistically significant (P&lt;0.01). There is limited research on the correlation between health education channels, cognition, and monkeypox prevention behavior, which may be related to the lack of attention paid to monkeypox in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>As hypothesized, we found that cues to action of the recent increase in monkeypox infection cases and the higher mortality rate among PLWH than other populations had a positive impact on perceived risk. The study results indicated that cues to action of the recent increase in monkeypox infection cases and the higher mortality rate among PLWH than other populations had a positive impact on perceived benefits. Our study showed that cues to action of the recent increase in monkeypox infection cases and the higher mortality rate among PLWH than other populations had a negative impact on perceived obstacles. Until the outbreak of monkeypox in 2022, monkeypox once again caught people's attention. The epidemiological survey shows that the proportion of PLWH infected with monkeypox is higher than that of the general population, and the mortality rate is higher than that of other populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">24]</ref>. Cues to action of the recent increase in monkeypox infection cases and the higher mortality rate among PLWH than other populations had a positive impact on executed safety behavior. There is relatively little research on the correlation between action clues and monkeypox prevention behavior, but there is more research on prevention behavior in other diseases, and it has a good positive impact on prevention behavior, which is consistent with the results of this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">41]</ref>. Perceived risk of monkeypox infection among PLWH had a positive impact on executed safety behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[42]</ref>. Perceived benefits to execute safety behavior among PLWH had a positive impact on executed safety behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[43]</ref>.</p><p>Perceived obstacles to execute safety behavior among PLWH had a negative impact on executed safety behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[44]</ref>.</p><p>Our research results indicated that cues to action of the recent increase in monkeypox infection cases and the higher mortality rate among PLWH promoted the implementation of preventive behavior via perceived risk. We found that cues to action regulated ESB via perceived obstacles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Our study explored several factors (cues to action, perceived risk, perceived benefits, and perceived obstacles) that influence the monkeypox prevention behavior among PLWH. Our findings demonstrated that CA had a significant positive impact on PR, PB and ESB, CA had a significantly negative effect on PO, PR and PB had a significant positive impact on ESB, and PO had a significantly negative effect on ESB. The structural equation model confirmed that the mediating effect of perceived risk and perceived obstacles between cues to action and executed safety behavior. Future intervention measures should focus on improving cues to action, perceived risk, perceived benefits and perceived obstacles to directly or indirectly benefit executed safety behavior for preventing monkeypox infection among PLWH.</p></div>

Therefore, it deepens our understanding of the factors influencing the improvement of monkeypox prevention behavior for PLWH. The structural equation model supported our hypothesis that CA, PR, PB and PO are crucial predictors of monkeypox prevention behavior for PLWH.
