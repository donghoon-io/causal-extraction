<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Drawing on an overarching framework of marketing on tourism management. This study develops and tests an integrated model of electronic word of mouth (e-WOM), destination Image, and satisfaction toward visit intention. The model is tested using data and survey of 215 respondents using purposive sampling technique. The analysis was carried out by employing Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The data was processed with WarpPLS 3.0. The result confirm that; e-WOM is positively and significantly related to satisfaction, and visit intention but insignificant with destination image. On the other hand, destination image is positively and significantly related to visit intention and satisfaction are shown to have insignificant influence on visit intention. The theoretical and empirical implications of these results are discussed.</p></div>

Although WOM has traditionally been studied from the perspective of face-to-face communication Word of mouth <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Gupta &amp; Harris, 2010)</ref>. WOM is communication about products and services between people who are perceived to be independent of the company providing the product or service, in a medium perceived to be independent of the company and WOM is acknowledged to play a considerable role in influencing and forming consumer attitudes and behavioral intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Jalilvand, Ebrahimi, &amp; Samiei, 2013)</ref>. With the spread of the Internet, virtual interactions among tourists have become common place, which has led some tourism researchers to point out that e-WOM plays an important role in the acquisition and retention of tourists in the ecommerce era <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Litvin, Goldsmith, &amp; Pan, 2008)</ref>. The concept of e-WOM is a change of word of mouth which is on a limited basis as talks about products and services with the development of the times, the word of mouth turned into e-WOM internet-based so it can encompass a wider audience <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Sen &amp; Lerman, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>e-WOM is an informal communication tool was directed at consumers through internet-based technologies which is relating to the usage or the particular characteristics of goods and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ladhari &amp; Michaud, 2015b)</ref>.

Therefore, the destination image, satisfaction, and visit intention also influenced by e-WOM of a tourist destination <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abubakar &amp; Ilkan, 2016)</ref>. From the research e-WOM can affect the tourism destination image somewhere to visit by tourists such as research <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abubakar &amp; Ilkan, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Setiawan, 2014)</ref>. e-WOM plays an important role in creating destination image that tourists made after their vacation. e-WOM can also affect the satisfaction of tourists received when obtaining information is received for a visit to a place such as research <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Setiawan, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Woo, Jin, &amp; Sanders, 2015)</ref>. e-WOM can also affect the visit intention somewhere tour <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abubakar &amp; Ilkan, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen, Shang, &amp; Li, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jalilvand et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kim &amp; Jun, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ladhari &amp; Michaud, 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Luo &amp; Zhong, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Destination image and satisfaction can also affect to visit intention tourists <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abubakar &amp; Ilkan, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hultman, Skarmeas, Oghazi, &amp; Beheshti, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Reza, Ebrahimi, &amp; Samiei, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Reza Jalilvand, Samiei, Dini, &amp; Yaghoubi Manzari, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Shawn &amp; Feng, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Stylos, Vassiliadis, Bellou, &amp; Andronikidis, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tan, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Malioboro street is the most famous street in Yogyakarta. Located in the heart of Yogya, this is the city's main street, and was once the ceremonial avenue for the Sultan to pass through on his way to and from the Keraton. During such occasions Malioboro would be festively decorated with flowers. Some say that the name "Malioboro" derives from the name of the British governor Marlborough from the era when Britain ruled the archipelago, between 1811-1816. The street is the centre of Yogyakarta's largest tourist district surrounded with many hotels, restaurants, and shops nearby. Sidewalks on both sides of the street are crowded with small stalls selling a variety of goods. In the evening several open-air street side restaurants, called lesehan, operate along the street. This is the street of the artists. Street musicians, painters, and other artists exhibit their creations on this road. Less obvious to the tourist, but more for the local population, side streets, lanes and structures that lead on to Malioboro are as important as the street itself.</p><p>This paper studies : (1) the effect of e-WOM on destination image; (2) the effect of e-WOM on Satisfaction; (3) the effect of e-WOM on the visit intention of the visit intention of Malioboro street; (4) the effect of destination on visit intention of Malioboro Street; (5) the effect of Satisfaction on the visit intention of Malioboro street. The paper then outlines challenges and opportunities for the tourism industry and suggests relevant marketing strategies to manage and enhance interpersonal influence online. Finally, the study aims at building a conceptual model to empirically describe and confirm the increase in visit intention through a tourism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LITERATURE REVIEW AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. e-WOM, Destination Image, and Satisfaction</head><p>The importance of word of mouth (WOM) in business has been widely discussed and researched, especially the worldwide adoption of Internet technology, which has revolutionized the distribution and influence of word of mouth <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Jalilvand et al., 2013)</ref>. e-WOM (electronic word of mouth) is defined as ''any positive or negative statement made by potential, actual, or former customers about a product or company, which is made available to a multitude of people and institutions via the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Woo et al., 2015)</ref>. e-WOM is an informal communication tool was directed at consumers through internet-based technologies which is relating to the usage or the particular characteristics of goods and services. So with the progress of internet technology, it increases the number of tourists who use internet to search for information purposes and to conduct online transactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Litvin et al., 2008)</ref>. The easy way for tourist who are looking for information about travel destinations is the use of e-WOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ladhari &amp; Michaud, 2015a)</ref>. There are so many tourists are looking for sites using e-WOM for more modern, fun, and easier reliable than information supplied by travel companies. The concept of e-WOM is a change of word of mouth which is on a limited basis as talks about products and services. With the development of the times, the word of mouth turned into e-WOM internet-based so it can encompass a wider audience <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Sen &amp; Lerman, 2007)</ref>. e-WOM communicates with so many ways example, website, twitter, facebook, instagram, and platform with web-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hennig-Thurau et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Destination image is defined as an individual's mental representation of knowledge, feelings and overall perception of a particular destination and destination image has also been found to influence tourists' behavioral intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Assaker, Esposito, &amp; Connor, 2011)</ref>. Destination image is a combination of products variation, attractions, and attributes are added to the impression from selection process based on various information <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Whang, Yong, &amp; Ko, 2016)</ref>. Destination image is a person's perception of products, objects, behaviors and events that are driven by beliefs, feelings and set of goals that have ideas and hopes for a specific place or trip <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Stylos et al., 2016)</ref>. Destination image plays two important roles in behaviors: (1) to influence the destination choice decisionmaking process and (2) to condition the afterdecision-making behaviors including participation (on-site experience), evaluation (satisfaction) and future behavioral intentions (intention to revisit and willingness to recommend) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ã &amp; Tsai, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Satisfaction is another important term that has received much attention in general consumer behavior research as well as tourism research because satisfaction brings positive behavioral outcomes and the understanding of satisfaction provides managerial guidance in the industry defined satisfaction as customer judgment about product or service fulfillment. proposed a definition that satisfaction is the outcome of the subjective evaluation about whether or not the chosen alternative meets or exceeds the expectation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Shawn &amp; Feng, 2007)</ref>. Satisfaction has received much attention in the marketing literature. Satisfaction is defined as customers' judgments about products or service fulfillment (Ramseook-Munhurrun, Seebaluck, &amp; Naidoo, 2015).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The Influence of e-WOM on Destination</head><p>Image, Satisfaction, and Visit Intention e-WOM communicates with so many ways example, website, twitter, facebook, instagram, and platform with web-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hennig-Thurau et al., 2004)</ref>. With the e-WOM can provide information that is more into details about a place that will create an image of a place to visit <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Reza Jalilvand et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Setiawan, 2014)</ref>. e-WOM also plays an important role in creating destination image that tourists made after their vacation. e-WOM affects the image of destination image on tourists visiting to Turkey <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abubakar &amp; Ilkan, 2016)</ref>. Therefore, e-WOM positively influences to destination image in Teheran, Iran <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Reza Jalilvand et al., 2012)</ref>. While the influence of e-WOM toward satisfaction, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Woo et al., 2015)</ref> find that e-WOM has a positive and significant impact on satisfaction in market place. Then, (San-martín, Prodanova, &amp; Jiménez, 2015) find that WOM has a positive and significant impact on satisfaction. But, from the research <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Setiawan, 2014)</ref> find that e-WOM has not positive and significant impact on satisfaction.</p><p>In their research, The easy way for tourist who are looking for information about travel destinations is the use of e-WOM <ref type="bibr">(Ladhari &amp; Michaud, 2015)</ref>. Visit intention emphasizes tourists to visit again in tourism context within a certain period so it can create an intention to visit <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ferns &amp; Walls, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kim &amp; Jun, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wisata et al., n.d.)</ref>. Visit</p><p>Intention also refers to the probability of what tourists feel for a certain time so it can build subjective perception that affects the behavior and the final decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Whang et al., 2016)</ref>. Intention of tourists to visit the hotel is also influenced by information which is derived from e-WOM <ref type="bibr">(Ladhari &amp; Michaud, 2015)</ref>. Then, e-WOM is very influential on helping tourists to find information on determining the intention of visit travel to certain places in Turkey <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abubakar &amp; Ilkan, 2016)</ref>. Therefore, the hypotheses ar as follows :</p><p>H1 : e-WOM has a positive and significant effect on destination image H2 : e-WOM has a positive and significant effect on satisfaction H3 : e-WOM has a positive and significant effect on visit intention</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The Effect of Destination Image and Satisfaction on Visit Intention</head><p>Destination image has greatly contributed to the visit Intention of tourists to come to the tourist attractions. The decision on the visit Intention of tourists are very influences to the destination image which is owned by a particular tourist spot in Iran <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abubakar &amp; Ilkan, 2016)</ref>. Then, the visit intention destinations is directly influenced by the destination image which is owned by a tourist <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Whang et al., 2016)</ref>. Furthermore, the results is reinforced that destination image has a positive and significant effect on the tourist destinations to determine the intention of their visits to a beautiful place in Iran <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Reza Jalilvand et al., 2012)</ref>. With variety of earlier researchs, the destination image is an impression or expression which is obtained by a tourists on their journey. So with the image of tourist destinations may affect decision of visit those places.</p><p>In their research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kuo, Wu, &amp; Deng, 2009)</ref> find that the satisfaction has positive and significant effect on visit intention. Then, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hultman et al., 2015)</ref> finds that satisfaction has effect on visit intention. But, research <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hultman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Shawn &amp; Feng, 2007)</ref> finds that the satisfaction has not positive and not significant effect on visit intention. Therefore, the hypotheses are:</p><p>H4 : Destination image has a positive and significant effect on visit intention H5 : Satisfaction has a positive and significant effect on visit intention</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Model</head><p>Below is the model used in this study : </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Design</head><p>This study is based on a survey which was conducted between Juni and Juli 2016. The population is all tourists visit to Malioboro street. The data were collection by means of a direct survey of Malioboro street. This study uses a purposive sampling technique according to the following criteria that the respondents visit to Malioboro street. The number of respondents targeted was 250 people. Out of 250 questionnaires, 215 were completed and returned, and all of them were counted as valid. The type of questionnaire given to the respondents in this study was a closed questionnaire, inquiring about the perceptions of each respondent. The measurement used in this study is a scale of 1 to 5 (Likert).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a. Description of The Respondents</head><p>There were a total of 215 respondents, 106 of whom were male and 109 were female. Most respondent were aged between 20 and 27 years at the time of the survey. 111 respondents had bachelor's degrees, 81 respondents had high school, and 23 of them had master's degree.  Malioboro is place that can make me satisfied (X9), the information I received about malioboro street makes me satisfied to make a visit (X0), I make a visit to malioboro street because it has a satisfaction in seeking information from the internet (X11)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI</head><p>Visit Intention refers to the probability of what tourists feel for a certain time so it can build subjective perception that affects the behavior and the final decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Whang et al., 2016)</ref> I predict I will visit Malioboro street in the future (X12), I would visit Malioboro street rather than any other tourism destination(X13), If everything goes as I think, I will plan to visit Malioboro street in the future (X14)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>c. Analytical techniques</head><p>The model used in this research is Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with WarpPLS 3.0 statistical techniques as a tool to test the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>d. Validity and reliability</head><p>In this study, reliability is measured by using composite reliability. Generally, the minimum value of the composite reliability is 0.5 <ref type="bibr">(Ringle, n.d, 2014)</ref>. All variables have reliability, since their respective values are shown to surpass the required value. Composite reliability of e-WOM 0.776; destination image is 0.747; satisfaction is 0.743; and visit intention is 0.749. The are two measurements of composite validity. The first measurement is convergent validity. The minimum convergent validity requirement in this study is set at 0.5 <ref type="bibr">(Ringle, n.d, 2014)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows all the indicator values are calculated at more than 0.7. Therefore, all the indicator in this study are valid. The second measurement employed is the Average Variance Extracted (AVE). The following are the AVE values for each variable, respectively: 0.668; 0.552; 0.595; and 0.563. the overall AVE values are calculated at above the required (0.5). Therefore, all variable are confirmed as valid. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULT</head><p>This study has shown a very good model fit (APC=0.278; ARS=0.171; AVIF=1.269). The test results show that hypotheses H2, H3, and H4 are supported. The e-WOM variable has positive and significant effect on satisfaction, e-WOM has positive and significant effect on visit intention, and destination image has positive and significant effect on visit intention. On the other hand, H1 and H5 indicate that this effect has proven to be insignificant. e-WOM does not have a significant effect on destination image, and satisfaction does not a significant effect on visit intention. See the result of the hypothesis testing in table 5 and the path diagram in the figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Effect of e-WOM on Destination Image</head><p>This study finds that the relation between e-WOM and destination image positively but insignificant. witch mean that hypothesis H1 has been rejected (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>). These result are not in line with the opinion of previous researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abubakar &amp; Ilkan, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Reza et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Setiawan, 2014)</ref>. Some of the experts did not directly examine destination image. However, the relationship between e-WOM and destination image can be generalized in various fields which are studied. This can be explained from the fact that there is e-WOM on information Malioboro street which directly effect destination image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of e-WOM on Satisfaction</head><p>The finding in this study show that e-WOM has a positive and significant impact on satisfaction, which mean that hypothesis H2 has been proven (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>). This also reinforces that belief of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Litvin et al., 2008</ref>) about e-WOM being seen as a driving factor to give information tourist satisfaction. Tourist satisfaction is derivert from the e-WOM about Malioboro Street. Tourist are satisfied because more information about Malioboro Street in the internet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of e-WOM on Visit intention</head><p>Positive e-WOM also has a positive and significant effect on visit intention, which means that hypothesis H3 has been proven (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>). This also reinforces that belief of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Setiawan, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Student &amp; Juni, n.d.2014</ref>). This may imply that when tourist come to some place they need information to visit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of Destination Image on Visit intention</head><p>Positive destination image has a positive and significant effect on visit intention, which means that hypothesis H4 has been proven (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>). These result are line with the opinion of previous researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ã &amp; Tsai, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ferns &amp; Walls, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ramseook-Munhurrun et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tan, 2016)</ref>. This finding indicates that before tourist want to go somewhere, may they are see cognitive image, affective image and cognitive image in some place and they are visit intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of Satisfaction on Visit intention</head><p>Satisfaction positively but not significantly influences visit intention. there for, hypothesis H5 was rejected (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>). This result are not in line with the opinion of previous researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hultman et al., 2015)</ref>. Some of the experts did not directly examine satisfaction. However the relationship between satisfaction and visit intention can be generalized in various fields or studied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>From the analyzed driving factors, it can be concluded that (H1) e-WOM does not have a significant effect on destination image, (H2) e-WOM has a positive and significant effect on satisfaction,(H3) e-WOM has a positive and significant effect on visit intention, (H4) destination image has a positive and significant effect on visit intention, (H5) satisfaction does not have a significant effect on visit intention. Therefore, the results of this research show that e-WOM insignificant on destination image. This is because message/value it brings is not effective for creating image someplace. Than, satisfaction have not a significant on visit intention because discrepancy information sought about a place.</p><p>The managerial implication of this research is that it can directly influence the behavior of tourism Indonesia. This research provide input that information over the internet (e-WOM) very function is to attract tourists and visit tourist destinations in Indonesia. then, the image of the destinations must be constantly improved for the sustainability of tourism in Indonesia.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
