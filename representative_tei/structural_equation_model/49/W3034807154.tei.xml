<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The current competitive environment has forced small and medium-sized enterprises <ref type="bibr">(SMEs)</ref> to change and adapt to meet new challenges continuously. These challenges have contributed to increasing the importance of information quality in the decision-making process. In this context, management accounting systems (MAS) become a powerful decision support tool to assist business processes management <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Faherty and Stephens, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Soobaroyen and Poorundersing, 2008)</ref>. The information provided by these systems has also become an essential management tool that can contribute to increasing the competitiveness of SMEs in the global marketplace.</p><p>Research relating management accounting (MA) has been quite considerable and cuts across different industries and different countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ahmad and Zabri, 2015)</ref>. Traditionally, this research stream has associated MA with large, established companies, questioning its usefulness for small and medium enterprises <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bisbe and Malagueño, 2009)</ref>. One of the arguments against the use of MA in SMEs is that it would encourage a command and control mechanism that can eliminate innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Davila et al., 2009)</ref>, which is one of the strongest competitive resources of these companies. However, this traditional view where management accounting is unsuitable for innovation has been challenged <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chenhall and Moers, 2015)</ref>, leading to a paradigm shift in the use of MAS by the executives of small and medium enterprises <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Davila et al., 2009)</ref> being able to assist them in the continuous process of change <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aaltola, 2019)</ref>. As such, MA approaches in SMEs should be differentiated from those for large companies, taking into account their innovative and organizational characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Pelz, 2019)</ref> We can find several research topics on management accounting, which deepened our understanding of how enterprises can use this management tool to improve their performance and therefore improve their competitiveness. Sometimes the literature uses the terms management accounting (MA), management accounting systems (MAS), management control systems (MCS), and organizational controls (OC) interchangeably <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chenhall, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>This blurring seems to exist because of the difficulty in distinguishing between control systems and decision support systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Zimmerman, 2001)</ref>. Given the organizational characteristics of SMEs and their difficulties in competing in the global marketplace, it seems more appropriate to use the management accounting system as a decision support system. As such, it should be designed to support decision-making at any organizational level <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Malmi and Brown, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In this context, the management accounting systems and the information they provide are topics that have gained increasing research relevance. As such, recent literature has been calling for more research on this subject for SMEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Azudin and Mansor, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ismail et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lavia López and Hiebl, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pelz, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sandalgaard and Nielsen, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the literature reviewed, different approaches to measuring the effectiveness of management accounting systems were found <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chong, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Etemadi et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gunarathne and Lee, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Heidmann et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ivankovič et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mia and Patiar, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Novas et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sharma et al., 2006)</ref>. However, these different approaches have prevented the comparability of research results, which can hinder the advancement of knowledge on this important subject. They can also reduce the practical contributions for enterprises, by decreasing their benchmarking capability, and thus make it harder to increase their competitiveness.</p><p>To fill this gap in management accounting literature, we need a clearer understanding of the definition of management accounting systems (MAS) and their informational dimensions, along with a new operational approach to measure their effectiveness. As such, an additional research effort is needed to understand the implications of MAS being integrated into a network of strategic organizational resources in response to the external competitive environment.</p><p>In this context, the objective of this study is to present and validate a multidimensional approach to measure the effectiveness of management accounting systems.</p><p>The main results of this study suggest that the effectiveness of management accounting systems can be measured using a second-order construct, covering four dimensions of management information characteristics, recognizing MAS overall contribution, and maintaining the distinct nature of each first-order construct. This new multidimensional approach can be very important for future research, allowing to capture synergies resulting from the balanced development of its four dimensions of information and, consequently, offer new contributions to the knowledge of management accounting.</p><p>This new approach will also provide useful managerial implications to SMEs operating in competitive markets. They will benefit from a clear vision of how they can take advantage of MAS opportunities embedded in direct and indirect resource relationships. It will also be an important contribution to the benchmarking process in SMEs and the consequent increase in their competitiveness in the global market.</p><p>This paper consists of five sections. In the next section, a background of management accounting systems is provided, based on the literature reviewed for the last fifteen years.</p><p>Section three describes the research methodology, including the research instrument, sample characteristics, and data collection. Section four presents and discusses the research results.</p><p>Section five presents the conclusions of this study, including the contributions to literature, implications for enterprises, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head><p>The implementation and use of management accounting, like other business management practices, have benefited from the latest developments in information technology. As such, the implementation and utilization of management accounting practices are usually supported by the management accounting systems. Several directions have been followed to evaluate the effectiveness of management accounting and its interaction with other variables in the business environment. Based on the literature reviewed, the following approaches to the study of management accounting interaction with the organizational environment were identified:</p><p>• management accounting information <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Choe, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cleary, 2009)</ref>;</p><p>• the characteristics of the information provided by the management accounting systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bouwens and Abernethy, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ern et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ismail et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Ramli and Iskandar, 2014)</ref>;</p><p>• the structure of management accounting systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cohen and Kaimenaki, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Macinati and Anessi-Pessina, 2014)</ref>;</p><p>• changes in accounting and management control systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hoque, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Williams and Seaman, 2002)</ref>;</p><p>• management accounting practices used by organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ahmad and Zabri, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Angelakis et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Pavlatos and Paggios, 2009)</ref>;</p><p>• the use of strategic management accounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cadez and Guilding, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cinquini and Tenucci, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In this context, the information characteristics of the management accounting system (MAS) was found to be the topic of more relevance in the literature, as MAS is a fundamental source of information for supporting decision-making.</p><p>The literature reviewed shows that management accounting systems interact with a wide variety of organizational and environmental variables. Some of these variables are: top management support <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fong and Quaddus, 2010)</ref>, task uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Soobaroyen and Poorundersing, 2008)</ref>, organizational interdependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chenhall and Morris, 1986)</ref>, users satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fong and Quaddus, 2010)</ref>, perceived environmental uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chenhall and Morris, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hammad et al., 2013)</ref>, decentralization <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chenhall and Morris, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ern et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hammad et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Soobaroyen and Poorundersing, 2008)</ref>, managerial performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Soobaroyen and Poorundersing, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Etemadi et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hammad et al., 2013)</ref>, and organizational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Harrison, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ismail et al., 2018)</ref>. Both the influence of these factors on the MAS effectiveness and the influence of MAS on performance have been investigated. However, different conclusions were reached across these studies.</p><p>The most cited operationalization of the management accounting system concept was introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chenhall and Morris (1986)</ref>. They defined MAS regarding four information characteristics, namely, scope, timeliness, level of aggregation, and level of integration. Since then, several authors have used the constructs representing these informational dimensions. However, in the last fifteen years, only a few authors choose to measure MAS using all these four dimensions individually (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[Insert Table 1]</head><p>Some authors only used the constructs representing the scope and timeliness dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Etemadi et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Heidmann et al., 2008)</ref> , while others decided to evaluate only the scope dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Naranjo-Gil and Hartmann, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Pondeville et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sharma et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Along with the differences in the number of the constructs used, other differences were found relating to how these constructs were used. Some were used to assess the availability of the information <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chenhall and Morris, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Etemadi et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Soobaroyen and Poorundersing, 2008)</ref>, while others were used to assess the extent to which the information was utilized <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chong, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Agbejule, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sharma et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Fong and Quaddus, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hammad et al., 2013)</ref>. Differences in the constructs' structure were also found. Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chenhall and Morris (1986)</ref> used four items to measure timeliness, some authors used two items <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abdel-Kader and Luther, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Choe, 2002)</ref>, while other authors used only one item <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Mia and Patiar, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ivankovič et al., 2010)</ref>. Given the differences in utilization of the constructs described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chenhall and Morris (1986)</ref>, and used by many other authors, it seems to be difficult to compare the research results obtained by them. Moreover, these studies do not investigate management accounting systems as a comprehensive concept: they examine their components using several empirical approaches. As such, it becomes tough to compare the theoretical and practical implications of these studies.</p><p>Therefore, it seems very important, for academics and executives of small and medium-sized enterprises, to operationalize a construct that can conceptually represent management accounting systems as a comprehensive multidimensional concept. This new approach can also be helpful for developing management accounting theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Malmi and Granlund, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Research instrument</head><p>The research instrument used in this study was designed based on an extensive literature review, which leads us to choose four informational dimensions to measure the management accounting systems effectiveness, developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chenhall and Morris (1986)</ref> and further used by several others authors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ghasemi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gunarathne and Lee, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ismail et al., 2018)</ref>. For measuring the managerial performance, we used a construct developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mahoney et al. (1963)</ref> and further used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hall (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hammad et al. (2013)</ref>. This construct evaluates managers in the performance of their daily tasks and activities of planning, investigating, coordinating, evaluating, supervising, staffing, negotiating, and representing. It also evaluates managers' overall performance.</p><p>In the first phase of developing the questionnaire, it was translated and adapted to the Portuguese business environment. In the second phase, the instrument was submitted to a panel of experts from several organizations to fit the SMEs' environment. During this phase, particular attention was given to the use of terminology consistent with the background of the survey participants.</p><p>The final version of the research instrument contains nineteen items representing the observed characteristics of the information provided by the management accounting systems.</p><p>For these information characteristics (see Appendix A), the respondents were asked to rate the extent they use them, ranging from 1 (never) to 7 (always). The research instrument also includes nine items representing the dimensions of managerial performance along with the overall performance. For these items (see Appendix B), the respondents were asked to rate their performance in executing their daily tasks and activities, ranging from 1 (unacceptable) to 7 (excellent). It also was possible to choose "not applicable" if they did not execute any of those tasks or activities.</p><p>The research instrument also includes questions on the characteristics of the enterprises, including turnover, assets, the number of employees, and industry type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Sample</head><p>For this study, the data was collected through an online survey questionnaire. Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) of Portuguese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were invited to participate in the study.</p><p>The names and addresses of 1500 SMEs were obtained from Informa DB, which belongs to the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Worldwide Network. All these enterprises were contacted by phone to explain the objective of the research study and to obtain the name of their CFO. Twelve of them, despite several attempts, never answered the phone. Ninety-three enterprises declined to collaborate in this research study for several reasons, such as no longer operating, and lack of autonomy to answer this kind of questionnaire. After these contacts, an email explaining the purpose of the research and containing the link to the online survey was sent to 1407 CFOs of Portuguese SMEs. A reminder email was sent every two weeks over the next five months.</p><p>As an incentive to increase the respondent's participation, they were promised a summary of the research findings. A total of 284 usable responses were obtained from CFOs, which was a response rate of 20.23 percent. This response rate cannot be considered high. However, it is consistent with similar reported studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hall, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Moores and Yuen, 2001)</ref>.

To test unidimensionality, exploratory factor analysis was executed for each construct, using principal components analysis and the varimax rotation method. As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows, all the construct data has a good level of adequacy, with KMO values above 0.745 and significance level &lt;0.00 for Bartlett's test of sphericity.</p></div>

All regression weights are statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.001) and their standardized estimates are greater than 0.5. However, the first model revealed an insufficient fit (χ 2 /df = 5.317; CFI = 0.851; TLI = 0.825; RMSEA = 0.124; PCFI = 0.726).</p><p>Modification indices and standardized residuals analysis provided some re-specification suggestions to improve the model fit. To avoid correlating error terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Anderson and Gerbing, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hair et al., 2014)</ref>, items SCO04, SCO05, TIM02, AGG05, and AGG07 were dropped during the re-specification process.</p><p>After the above changes, the fit of the model was improved (χ 2 /df = 3.555; CFI = 0.937; TLI = 0.919; RMSEA = 0.095; PCFI = 0.731). All regression weights are statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.001) and their standardized estimates are greater than 0.5, which indicates internal consistency of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Anderson and Gerbing, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hair et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Convergent validity and reliability were assessed using composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE) indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref> and Cronbach alpha <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cronbach, 1951)</ref>. According to the results (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>), all CR values are higher than 0.846, which indicates internal consistency. All the AVE values are higher than 0.593, which suggests suitable convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hair et al., 2014</ref>). Cronbach's alpha also indicates construct reliability with values greater than 0.839.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[Insert Table 4]</head><p>Construct validity also implies that the constructs are distinct from each other. There is discriminant validity if the AVE for any two constructs is greater than the square of the correlation estimates between these two constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref>. The results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> show small differences between values for integration, timeliness, and aggregation, which could indicate a lack of discriminant validity between these constructs. However, these results may also indicate the need for a second-order construct <ref type="bibr">(Bollen, 1989)</ref>. The high correlations between constructs also could suggest the need for a second-order construct, including the four validated first-order constructs, which supports the objective of our study.</p></div>

In these cases, a higher-order modeling approach would be the most appropriate technique to represent such structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Koufteros et al., 2009)</ref>. Therefore, based on the results, it seems justifiable to suggest MAS as a second-order factor, formed by the four first-order constructs representing the informational dimensions Scope, Timeliness, Aggregation, and Integration.</p><p>The second-order factor model revealed a similar model fit compared with the first-order model, having the following goodness-of-fit indices: χ 2 /df = 3.507; CFI = 0.936; TLI = 0.921; RMSEA = 0.094; PCFI = 0.751.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Discussion</head><p>The objective of this study is to present and validate a multidimensional approach to measure the effectiveness of management accounting systems (MAS). To achieve this objective, this study used and extended the theoretical work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chenhall &amp; Morris (1986)</ref> which has been widely used by the management accounting literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Agbejule, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ern et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gunarathne &amp; Lee, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hammad et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">K. Ismail et al., 2018)</ref>. However, these MAS dimensions have been only studied separately and do not allow comparability of results regarding the impact of MAS on business management.</p><p>The results of this study confirm the four dimensions of MAS and also show that these dimensions are distinct and interrelated. The results also show the relative importance of the first-order constructs, along with the SMEs executives concerns relating the information provided by the management accounting systems. In this context, the aggregation dimension seems to be the one that most influences the effectiveness of the management accounting system. This result shows that SMEs executives prefer organized information in a way that reflects the activities carried out in the different functional areas and their visibility in the reports that support the strategic decisions. It also shows a strong concern that the information provided by MAS reflects the impact of key market events on the various functional areas. These concerns and information needs stem from the volatility of the market in which SMEs are positioned. In a context of high market volatility, information has become a resource that can provide competitiveness. Therefore, these information characteristics of MAS can add competitiveness to SMEs. To be noted, that SMEs executives do not seem to value costs information separated into fixed and variable components. Perhaps because efficiency is no longer the stronger competitive weapon or because executives have taken for granted this information. In other words, maybe they look at this information as a qualifier.</p><p>This result is interesting because it may show an evolution of management practices of SME executives, which could confirm the paradigm shift suggested by the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Davila et al., 2009)</ref>. On the one hand, it contradicts some of the literature results <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hammad et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, it confirms more recent literature regarding the use of this MAS dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Ismail et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The integration dimension seems to be the second most influential dimension in MAS. SMEs executives are interested in obtaining information that can reflect not only the impact of their decisions but also the impact of the decisions of other functional managers in their department. They are also interested in the activities of all functional areas having precise goals. This information has become increasingly important in a highly competitive global market where SMEs compete with large companies, requiring information-driven decision support tools that can reflect their companies' multidimensional performance. This result seems to contradict the literature on the use of this dimension in large organizations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ghasemi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hammad et al., 2013)</ref>. However, it is aligned with the importance that SMEs executives attach to the availability of integrated management accounting information <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Soobaroyen and Poorundersing, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The timeliness dimension was found to be in third place. This dimension reflects the concern of executives to obtain information frequently and without delays. This characteristic is one of the most important features for information to be used to support decision-making. In this context, the need for information technologies that can automate information collection, processing, and provision processes is often mentioned. However, more important than information technology is the existence of a culture of effectiveness in which everyone in the organization feels that information is used to support decision-making and will help the company increase its competitiveness. This result seems to confirm that this MAS dimension will be important both for large organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hammad et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Naranjo-Gil, 2009)</ref> as well as for SMEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Soobaroyen and Poorundersing, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Velez et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The scope dimension seems to be the one that least influences the effectiveness of the management accounting system. This dimension reflects the need to obtain external information as well as the predictive characteristics of this information. The smaller influence of this dimension may be related to the difficulty of obtaining information with these characteristics. In this context, SME executives may have incorporated this difficulty in their response to the questionnaires on which the empirical study was based. This is the most studied dimension in the literature. Sometimes it was used alone to represent the MAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chong, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naranjo-Gil and Hartmann, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sharma et al., 2006)</ref> and other times used with other dimensions, representing MAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ghasemi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ismail et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naranjo-Gil and Hartmann, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Soobaroyen and Poorundersing, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Velez et al., 2015)</ref>. In all cases, the positive relationship with the performance was evidenced, which is also confirmed by this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Small and medium-sized enterprises are an important lever of each country's economies. Their competitive strength, which lies in their capacity for innovation, has made them important players in the global market, where they fight against large companies. In this context of competition, SMEs have to adapt the decision support tools used by large companies to their organizational realities. Thus, in recent years, we have seen a paradigm shift towards the use of MAS by SMEs. What appeared to be a rigid decision support tool that could eliminate innovation has been turned into a resource that provides competitiveness to these companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chenhall and Moers, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Davila et al., 2009)</ref> and can even help them to support their effective strategic change initiatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aaltola, 2019)</ref>. Despite the importance and the high number of these companies, which reach 95% in the European Union, there are still few authors who have studied management accounting systems in SMEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ismail et al., 2019)</ref>. With this study, we intend to contribute to closing this gap.</p><p>Based on an extensive and comprehensive literature review covering the past fifteen years, we found that MAS has been measured through various individual constructs. However, we did not find any operationalization of this concept that represents a comprehensive and integrated approach. This means that researchers have investigated the role of each of the MAS dimensions and their impact on business management, but they have not investigated the MAS as a resource that, in addition to its separate dimensions, also represents the interrelationship between them.</p><p>To fill this gap in the management accounting literature, we presented and validated a multidimensional approach to measuring the effectiveness of management accounting systems. This approach was operationalized through a second-order construct, which includes four first-order constructs representing the information dimensions most used and cited in the literature reviewed.</p><p>Through a systematic process of validation, the four constructs were considered appropriate to the sample used, which represents Portuguese SMEs. The high correlation between the four first-order constructs and their more comprehensive representation of the MAS concept, justified by the literature reviewed, confirms that the objective of this study was fulfilled.</p><p>Based on the results of this study, some important considerations can be presented. First, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to develop and validate a second-order construct to measure the effectiveness of management accounting systems. The existence of this second-order construct recognizes the contribution and retains the distinctive nature of each first-order construct, namely scope, timeliness, aggregation, and integration of MAS information. As such, it treats these constructs as facets of the management accounting systems. This multidimensional construct could be very important for future research by allowing the study of new hypotheses and consequently offering new contributions to management accounting knowledge.</p><p>Second, the existence of a second-order construct suggests not only that the MAS is a multidimensional concept, but also that there may be synergies resulting from the balanced development of its four information dimensions.</p><p>Third, this multidimensional tool could be helpful for study the benefits of the MAS utilization in small and medium-sized enterprises, and for developing new management accounting theories, responding to the recent calls for additional research on these subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Azudin and Mansor, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ismail et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lavia López and Hiebl, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pelz, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sandalgaard and Nielsen, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Fourth, this study contributes to the advancement of knowledge by offering researchers a new tool to measure MAS effectiveness and its influence on performance.</p><p>This study also brings practical contributions. The multidimensional tool presented and validated in this study can be used by executives of SMEs for assessing the effectiveness of their management accounting systems. This tool allows executives to adapt MAS to the specific characteristics of their SMEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aaltola, 2019)</ref>, and to evaluate the effectiveness of its utilization.</p><p>As such, managers can aggregate their evaluation of the four facets to form their perception of the second-order overall construct, which can help to improve SMEs' performance measurement and benchmarking processes. However, managers should also be concerned with factors that may influence the implementation and effectiveness of MAS utilization,         </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: CFA results for second-order model</figDesc><graphic coords="28,113.40,122.04,382.20,315.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
