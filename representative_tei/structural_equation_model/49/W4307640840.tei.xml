<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose:</head><p>The purpose of this research is to establish a conceptual model to understand the impact of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) on the transition of a Circular Economy (CE). Also, the paper explores the combined impact of TPM, I4.0, and CE on the sustainability performance (SP) of manufacturing firms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology:</head><p>The conceptual model is proposed using the dynamic capability view (DCV) and empirically validated by partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) using 304 responses from Indian manufacturing firms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings:</head><p>The results suggest that I4.0 positively impacts TPM, CE, and SP, also showing TPM's positive impact on CE and SP. In addition, CE has a positive influence on the SP of manufacturing firms. Furthermore, CE partially mediates the relationship between I4.0 and SP with TPM and SP. The study also identifies TPM, I4.0, and CE as a new bundle of dynamic capabilities to deliver SP in manufacturing firms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Originality:</head><p>The present research adds to the knowledge and literature on DCV by identifying the importance of CE in the settings of I4.0 and TPM, especially in the context of sustainability. Also, the current study offers a new set of dynamic capabilities and provides some significant future recommendations for researchers and practitioners.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The notion of sustainability swiftly went worldwide after the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) first raised its concerns about the issue related to "our common future" in 1987 <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Khodeir and Othman, 2018)</ref>. Organisations are under pressure to evolve into social, economic, and environmentally (Triple bottom line (TBL)) sustainable corporations <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Naseem and Yang, 2021)</ref>. Ecological degradation from economic behaviour has become more and more of an issue worldwide in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Laari et al., 2017</ref>). Organisations at the present time face serious dangers from sustainability problems due to economic, environmental, and social implications <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dantas et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Past research has claimed that, even with a greater focus on sustainability challenges, existing literature lacks a thorough approach to recognising and managing these concerns both through novel scholarly reasoning and at a company level in such a period of peak awareness and immediacy pertaining to sustainability challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Touboulic and Mccarthy, 2019)</ref>. This has prompted a large number of industrial enterprises to investigate the feasibility of recycling materials or elements of goods in order to extend the useful life of their materials and energy investments for an extended span of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Rajput and Singh, 2019)</ref>. This will result in the transformation of the economies throughout the globe into ones that are more ecologically acceptable and sustainable.</p><p>In spite of the fact that the concept of sustainability has existed for some time, the Circular Economy (CE) approach has just lately began to occupy a more prominent place in the thoughts of decision-makers in an effort to find solutions to problems associated with environmental sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Brennan et al., 2015)</ref>. The CE model is one of the key cornerstones that a number of nations and international organisations have included in their respective strategies for sustainable development <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Laskurain-Iturbe et al., 2021)</ref>. Manufacturing firms are investing large sums of money into developing more sustainable goods and circular operations. In this regard, a variety of approaches, including reusing, reprocessing, and recycling, have been examined in earlier research <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(André et al., 2019)</ref>. In addition, certain commercial methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Rosa et al., 2019a)</ref> to enable the pragmatic deployment of CE and achieve genuine benefits from this have been assessed <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Rosa et al., 2019b)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Silvestre and Tirca (2019)</ref> suggest that sustainability performance will be impossible to accomplish without digital transformations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Massaro et al. (2021)</ref> indicate that a large majority of practitioner and academic publications trumpet the capacity of I4.0 technologies to improve sustainability outcomes, particularly in the circular economy (CE). CE has now been adopted by academia and practitioners <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Zhang et al., 2021)</ref>, and is considered as a new sustainability perspective that might improve value development by reducing the consumption of environmental commodities and waste generation to preserve ecological integrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Geissdoerfer et al., 2017)</ref>. I4.0 technologies, such as IoT, have the potential to facilitate the move to CE practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Zhang et al., 2019)</ref>. However, emerging closed-loop processes, which are entirely oriented toward harmonising economic, environmental, and societal consequences, are gradually attempting to replace previous industrial methods <ref type="bibr">(Sassanelli et al., 2021)</ref>. CE is driven by I4.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Rosa et al., 2020)</ref>, which jointly offers a large capacity for achieving SP targets, including lower resource usage and gas discharge rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Tseng et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Wang et al. (2018)</ref> argue that strengthening manufacturing activities is critical to promoting lifecyclebased CE.</p><p>However, although there is an assumption that I4.0 technologies will help businesses accomplish their CE goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Lacy and Rutqvist, 2016)</ref>, the converse may also be true <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Di Maria et al., 2022)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Frank et al. (2019)</ref> stress that there is no consensus regarding the impact that I4.0 technologies have on circularity or the opportunity for transformation that they provide to businesses. In addition, earlier studies indicate that limited research has investigated the interconnections among the various I4.0 technologies and CE <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bag and Pretorius, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Dalenogare et al., 2018)</ref>. Therefore, earlier research provides evidence for a dispute over the direction of the link between I4.0 and CE. This debate addresses a critical academic research gap, resulting in the formulation of the subsequent research question: RQ1: What is the association between I4. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">0</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>and CE in the context of sustainability of manufacturing firms?</head><p>The Ellen Macarthur Foundation is a leader in CE research. It defines CE "as a systems solution framework that tackles global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution" <ref type="bibr">(Ellen MacArthur Foundation., 2021)</ref>. CE principles may be used to explain the optimal functioning of the economy as a whole and they can also be used to pinpoint particular areas where economic value can be generated <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Obrien et al., 2014)</ref>. Economic and comparative proposals (e.g. reuse versus reprocess versus recycling) might vary dramatically in every single supply chain region for various goods, parts and other kinds of resources. The ideas of circular value creation, however, can be easily grasped <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Sobral and Ferreira, 2018)</ref>. In addition, CE recommends that in order for organisations to be successful, they should maximise their utilisation of resources while minimising their waste to create progress that is both harmonic and sustainable <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ghisellini, 2016)</ref>, since CE orientation is zero waste <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Farooque et al., 2019b)</ref>.</p><p>A report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2015) suggests that maintenance represents the most cost-effective, material and resource-efficient CE system solution, making it the most efficient and accessible alternative, as maintenance is primarily about keeping the same machinery, materials, and commodities in use. Maintenance is becoming an appealing approach to start CE and develop pace in a more sustainable path as raw materials and endof-life treatment expenses rise <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Allen, 2021)</ref>. Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) places a focus on maintenance by treating it as an essential component of the company that must be carried out <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Venkatesh, 2007)</ref>. It enlists the engagement of a firm's entire workforce, boosts the efficiency of its machinery, cuts down on the number of breakdowns that occur, and encourages autonomous maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ahuja and Khamba, 2008)</ref>. TPM looks to be the quickest and most effective way to achieve continual growth in maintenance while also having a positive influence on CE. Machinery performance can be continually improved through an ongoing operation that entails all company departments and employees in order to create an efficient framework of preventive maintenance for as long as the machinery is in service <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Sobral and Ferreira, 2018</ref>). TPM's various tools and pillars help firms reduce waste <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Vukadinovic et al., 2018)</ref>, reduce toxicants and leakages <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chiarini, 2014)</ref>, and offer better environmental performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Garza-Reyes et al., 2018)</ref>. Also, TPM assists a firm to obtain a better monetary performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Gu et al., 2017)</ref> by improving its operational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Gupta and Vardhan, 2016)</ref>. Therefore, TPM can be an enabler of company sustainability. Also, waste reduction and optimal resource consumption indicate the possibility that TPM can enable enhanced CE outcomes. Nevertheless, no academic study has been previously conducted to determine the direct connection in both TPM and CE, especially in the context of business sustainability. The dearth of research in this area leads to the formulation of the second research question:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RQ2: What is the association between TPM and CE in the context of sustainability of manufacturing firms?</head><p>The integration of I4.0 technologies into classical maintenance fosters the development of contemporary maintenance practices, which ultimately results in efficient data and mechanical operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Silvestri et al., 2020)</ref>. I4.0 requires conventional machines to be transformed into self-cognizant and autodidactic machines to enhance the comprehensive operation and maintenance management by environmental stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Vaidya et al., 2018)</ref>. The findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Raji et al. (2021)</ref> suggest that I4.0 positively influences the implementation of lean manufacturing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Thanki et al. (2016)</ref> suggest that TPM has proved itself to be the most effective and influential lean manufacturing shop-floor practice. I4.0 has a favourable impact on how manufacturing shop floors are governed and structured as well as on the business models, goods, and operation of enterprises <ref type="bibr">(Tortorella et al., 2019)</ref>. A real-time machine monitoring system is made possible by I4.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Shafiq et al., 2021)</ref>. In addition to keeping track of the health of the equipment, the environment is also monitored. The findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Tortorella et al. (2021)</ref> suggest that integrating I4.0 technology into TPM enhances decision-making and assists businesses in achieving better functional performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Tortorella et al. (2022a)</ref> indicate that I4.0 has a positive influence on TPM philosophy. However, no research has empirically examined the relationship between I4.0 and TPM within a sustainability context. In order to fill this void, the present research has developed a third research question:</p><p>RQ3: What is the relationship between I4.0 and TPM in the context of sustainability of manufacturing firms? CE is one of the most recent approaches to achieving environmental sustainability (Clarke <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Murray et al., 2015)</ref>. Industry choices to develop sustainable production strategies demand a rigorous and ongoing practice, notably in process safety and the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Toha et al., 2022)</ref>. Two reports, one from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the other from the academics and modelling experts at the McKinsey Centre for Business and Environment, imply that in a CE situation, the amount of materials that are used may be reduced by approximately 32% within 15 years and by over half (53%) by 2050 <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Toha et al., 2022)</ref>. Furthermore, switching to a CE has the power to remove 100 million tonnes of material pollution worldwide over the next five years. This indicates the significant contribution of CE in leading a firm towards sustainability. Also, by incorporating CE concepts into scientific operations, establishing additional employments, and allowing a diversity of assets that may usually be regarded as waste into the financial loop, high energy effectiveness and energy reductions can be obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Toha et al., 2022)</ref>. Therefore, investigating the role of CE in the sustainability context is important; this leads to examining the CE contribution in the overall SP of manufacturing firms. Additionally, previous research has investigated the direct association between CE with I4.0 and TPM in a sustainability context. This motivated the present research to explore how CE may act as a mediator (not a moderator) between TPM and SP, and I4.0 and SP. As a result, the following constitutes the formulation of a fourth research question: RQ4: What is the mediation effect of CE on the relationship of TPM and I4.0 with SP? Dynamic capabilities help enterprises overcome problems by quickly evolving environments through fostering capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Teece et al., 1997)</ref>. Dynamic capabilities are often identified to meet the complicated challenges associated with accomplishing organisations' sustainability goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Beske et al., 2014)</ref>. Sustainability oriented past research has emphasised the requirement for further investigations in choosing appropriate dynamic capabilities that companies could use to boost their sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Amui et al., 2017)</ref>. Therefore, the current study fills this gap in past research by presenting TPM, I4.0 and CE as dynamic capabilities to practise sustainability and empirically assess the impact of their relationships on the SP of a manufacturing firm.</p><p>Following a comprehensive analysis of the existing research, a conceptual framework is presented here. The framework is then validated by Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), using 304 responses from Indian manufacturing organisations for the analysis.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the theory background and hypothesis development, followed by the proposed conceptual framework. Section 3 illustrates the methodology used for the research of this paper, followed by Section 4, which introduces the results and findings of the investigation. Section 5 offers the discussion and implications of the present research. Finally, Section 6 offers the conclusions, limitations, with the future research scope of the current study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Dynamic Capability View (DCV)</head><p>Changing consumer demands and increased supply chain competitiveness have driven organisations to employ technological innovations to enhance conventional into intelligent manufacturing operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Kamble and Gunasekaran, 2021)</ref>. I4.0 intends to improve business productivity and competitiveness by utilising digital technology to integrate businesses through their supply chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Nounou et al., 2022)</ref>. I4.0 gives businesses tactical and functional leverage over their competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Müller et al., 2018)</ref>. Also, organisations using I4.0 aim to coordinate smart machines throughout the entire end-to-end operation, including vendors, production, and item delivery. I4.0 is considered as a combination of precious assets owned by businesses with a high natural ability for combining goods and manufacturing operations. I4.0 technologies have significantly integrated production activity structures with networking, data, and smart platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Wang et al., 2017)</ref>. I4.0 has the capability to deliver numerous benefits to businesses, including more lucrative business models, increased productivity and quality, and enhanced working environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hofmann and Rüsch, 2017)</ref>. It is possible that I4.0 will be able to solve several environmental and social problems caused by conventional industrial practices and technologies, thereby leading to a path for a more sustainable society <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Morrar and Arman, 2017)</ref>. Many businesses have recognised the potential for sustainability to provide them with a competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cantele and Zardini, 2018)</ref>. The findings of past research help in the establishmentt of the proposed investigation based on the Dynamic Capability View (DCV). Scholars have defined DCV as "capabilities that enable businesses to develop novel goods and operations and adapt to shifting market trends" <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Helfat, 1997)</ref>. Some other perspectives of DCV can be understood as "The capability of organisations to effectively address their organisational challenges is fundamentally dependent on their abilities" <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Dosi et al., 2000)</ref>. DCV is an augmentation of the resource-based theory's fundamentally static vision. It investigates how resources are developed and renewed throughout time in response to shifting business contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Helfat and Peteraf, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The merits of CE practices include minimising environmental impact through waste reduction to redesign goods with more monetary benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Coghlan et al., 2021)</ref>. Therefore, CE practices can also be a strategic tool to offer competitiveness in an organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Diéguez-Santana, 2022)</ref>. Also, CE practices have been highlighted as a possible sustainable development solution to fulfil the company's objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Ogunmakinde et al., 2022)</ref>. However, in implementing CE practices, organisations must replace their capabilities with new ones to maintain their competitive edge. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Sirmon et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Lieder and Rashid (2016)</ref>, information technology in manufacturing has advanced CE implementation. CE seeks to substitute the "end-of-life paradigm" by completing material loops and prolonging item lifespan <ref type="bibr">(Batista et al., 2019)</ref>. However, one of the most difficult issues is eliminating waste in terms of time and resources spent on maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Basten et al., 2014)</ref>. To overcome this issue, TPM can be used as a maintenance management strategy in manufacturing firms, leading to the elimination of numerous wastes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chiarini, 2014)</ref>. Additionally, TPM helps to deliver cleaner production in manufacturing companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Amjad et al., 2021)</ref>. TPM practices have assisted in the optimal utilisation of available resources in a production line, enabling productivity improvements <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Wudhikarn, 2012)</ref> and leading manufacturing firms towards increased competitiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Chen, 2013)</ref>. Therefore, TPM has been considered in this study as an important operational tool to offer CE through waste reduction, efficient resource consumption, and greener production. The performance of TPM can also be improved from the incorporation of I4.0 technologies. I4.0 technologies enable real-time monitoring of machines to offer accurate results <ref type="bibr">(Tortorella et al., 2021a)</ref>. Also, the nature of I4.0, CE, and TPM is to deliver the SP of a manufacturing firm. Nevertheless, no past research has examined the relationship between I4.0, TPM, and CE within the context of sustainability. Therefore, the purpose of the current investigation is to provide a contribution in the field of DCV by studying the impact of I4.0, TPM, and CE interactions on the SP of manufacturing firms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Hypothesis Formulation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">TPM and CE</head><p>As climate issues have risen, manufacturers have been forced to reconsider attaining operational excellence while also making their activities and operations more environmentally sustainable <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Garza-Reyes et al., 2018)</ref>. CE practices suggest that organisations should optimise resource usage and eliminate waste to accomplish harmonious, sustainable development <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ghisellini et al., 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Smith and Hawkins (2004)</ref> identified the most frequent factors in process industries that lead to waste. These include "equipment condition", "non-optimised operation", "equipment availability", and "project and technology". TPM is a maintenance management philosophy that overcomes the factors that cause waste. For instance, TPM helps to improve and restore the condition of equipment through its maintenance pillars <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Tsarouhas, 2013)</ref>. TPM offers optimised operations through preventive maintenance procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Sobral and Ferreira, 2018)</ref>. TPM restores equipment's health, enabling adoption to new technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Sobral and Ferreira, 2018)</ref>. Also, TPM prevents machine breakdowns to ensure the availability of equipment when needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ahuja and Khamba, 2008)</ref>. In this way, TPM can lead a firm to deliver CE outcomes by eliminating waste and optimising resource consumption. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ghisellini et al. (2016)</ref> suggest that some dimensions of CE are cleaner production, green consumption, and product recycling. TPM has been implemented in manufacturing firms as the most effective lean tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Belekoukias et al., 2014)</ref>. TPM adoption in manufacturing enterprises aids in the reduction of pollutants such as fume emissions and oil leaks <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chiarini, 2014)</ref>. Also, TPM implementation helps optimise energy usage in manufacturing processes. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Amjad et al. (2021)</ref>, TPM is extremely beneficial in building a more effective and greener production operation by reducing toxic gas emissions by 55%. Therefore, outcomes such as waste reduction, cleaner production, and better environmental performance of TPM implementation in manufacturing firms indicate that TPM could lead manufacturing companies to adopt and implement better CE practices. However, no previous studies have addressed this relationship. Thus, H1 has been formulated as follows:</p><p>H1: TPM positively influences CE practices in manufacturing firms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">I4.0 and TPM</head><p>TPM promotes operational consistency by maintaining manufacturing machinery efficiently, resulting in minimal failures and quality faults <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Wickramasinghe and Perera, 2016)</ref>. Furthermore, TPM incorporates various aspects of conventional maintenance, such as reactive, planned, proactive and predictive maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Coleman et al., 2017)</ref>. The digitalisation of these maintenance practices complements each other and offers enhanced operational performance and unique potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Nowakowski et al., 2018)</ref>. I4.0 could potentially improve maintenance operations by utilising embedded sensors and fast data computation, allowing for the creation of innovative methods and increasing machine performance and longevity <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Klathae and Ruangchoengchum, 2019)</ref>. Technology incorporation also boosts maintenance performance standards because it may aid in enhancing maintenance schedules, facilitating decision-making, and reducing human failures <ref type="bibr">(Mourtzis et al., 2020a, b)</ref>. I4.0 technologies can aid in the optimisation of maintenance scheduling by spotting machine flaws early on <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Felsberger et al., 2020)</ref>. Simultaneously, augmented reality may offer more precise instructions for detecting and checking machinery <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Silvestri et al., 2020)</ref>. Therefore, this discussion suggests the positive influence of I4.0 on the performance of TPM practices. Nevertheless, past research has not yet empirically investigated the relationship between I4.0 and TPM. Thus, the following hypothesis has been formulated: H2: I4.0 positively influences TPM practices in manufacturing firms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">I4.0 and CE</head><p>Industry 4.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Thoben et al., 2017)</ref>, a German governmental project, has gained interest from academics and professionals alike, opening the path for a whole new concept of value generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Reinhard et al., 2016)</ref>. I4.0 has been outlined in detail by the German government and academic institutions, with the following overview: "In the future, businesses will establish global networks that incorporate their machinery, warehousing systems and production facilities in the shape of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). In the manufacturing environment, these Cyber-Physical Systems comprise smart machines, storage systems and production facilities capable of autonomously exchanging information, triggering actions and controlling each other independently. This facilitates fundamental improvements to the industrial processes involved in manufacturing, engineering, material usage and supply chain and life cycle management. The smart factories that are already beginning to appear employ a completely new approach to production. Smart products are uniquely identifiable, may be located at all times and know their own history, current status, and alternative routes to achieving their target state" <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Kagermann et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>A growing number of practitioners and academics are advocating the use of I4.0 technologies, notably within the framework of the CE, to obtain superior environmental outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Massaro et al., 2021)</ref>. Implementing I4.0 technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical system, big data analytics, and some innovative business frameworks are envisaged to support CE practices to develop a sustainable industrial ambience <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bressanelli et al., 2018)</ref>. The operation, functional status, and availability of smart products may be tracked in actual time after incorporating I4.0 technologies into traditional systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Pagoropoulos et al., 2017)</ref>. Knowledge of intelligent devices may assist organisations in upgrading device firmware, decreasing expiration issues, increasing item longevity, and supporting CE <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Pialot et al., 2017)</ref>. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and IoT have been found to perform a vital function in item and repair parts traceability <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Franco, 2017)</ref>, helping to achieve CE goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Nobre and Tavares, 2017)</ref>. The studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Kamble and Gunasekaran (2021)</ref> and Lopes de Sousa Jabbour et al. ( <ref type="formula">2018</ref>) indicate the positive influence of I4.0 technologies on CE practices. Some contradictory research is also available in past literature. For instance, Di <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Maria et al. (2022)</ref> suggest that due to inherent tensions between achieving economic results and doing what is best for the environment, certain I4.0-related technologies, such as robotics, 3D printing, and augmented reality, may make it more difficult to put environmental initiatives into action. In addition, there may be trade-offs in the link between digitisation and CE. It is possible that digitalisation may boost resource productivity; nevertheless, this may also promote energy consumption and waste generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chen et al., 2020)</ref>. It is still unclear how I4.0 technologies will improve the results of CE practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Di Maria et al., 2022)</ref>. Therefore, previous research offers debatable findings. Very limited empirical research has been conducted to investigate this relationship, which creates the need of investigating this relationship empirically. Thus we hypothesise that: H3: I4.0 positively influences CE practices in manufacturing firms. <ref type="bibr">et al. (2021)</ref> indicate that the deployment of TPM practices in a manufacturing firm enhances its financial performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Hofer et al.

A manufacturing company's social sustainability performance is measured by a healthier, safer work environment and outstanding personnel communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abid et al., 2020)</ref>. Therefore, previous research has suggested the positive impact of TPM on TBL sustainability. Nevertheless, no previous research has examined the relationship between TPM and the overall sustainability (as a single index) of a firm. The dearth of empirical evidence for the relationship between TPM and SP leads this research to examine the relationship. Thus, we hypothesise that:</p><p>H4: TPM has a positive impact on the SP of manufacturing firms. 2.2.5 I4.0 and SP I4.0 supports reaching the sustainability goals of manufacturing companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Kamble and Gunasekaran, 2021)</ref>. I4.0 helps to improve operational agility and item quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ghaithan et al., 2021)</ref>. I4.0 digitalisation aspects lead to shorter production times, shorter lead times, and lower shipping and manufacturing costs, all of which result in better consumer satisfaction and, as a consequence, increased market position and profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Stock and Seliger, 2016)</ref>. I4.0 enables actual-time data and information exchange among supply chain collaborators that aid in the efficient distribution of primary goods, water, power, and personnel time <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(De Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018)</ref>; this leads to eliminating resource scarcity, greenhouse gas releases, and wastage production <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Wang et al., 2016)</ref>. Also, incorporating I4.0 technologies in enterprises enhances workplace surroundings, ensures safer operating situations for staff, and introduces new technologies to employees, all of which boost enthusiasm and satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Herrmann et al., 2014)</ref>. Therefore, evidence from past research indicates that TPM could offer enhanced SP for a manufacturing firm. Thus, the following hypothesis has been proposed: H5: I4.0 has a positive effect on the SP of manufacturing firms.</p></div>

CE was highlighted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Geissdoerfer et al.

CE is predicted to be a critical aspect of emerging supply chains to achieve sustainability-oriented outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Manninen et al., 2018)</ref>. These insights from literature lead to the subsequent hypothesis:</p><p>H6: CE has a positive influence on the SP of manufacturing firms.</p><p>CE is among the most intriguing concepts for structuring upcoming financial operations in a sustainable manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Del Giudice et al., 2020)</ref>, and as an approach to reverse the environmental deterioration that affects the world's ecosystem <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Hazen et al., 2020)</ref>. Looking at the rapid adoption of CE for a manufacturing firm's sustainability and assessing CE as a pre-requisite of sustainability, CE could be an enabler for achieving sustainability outcomes. Therefore, CE can act as a mediator/moderator for I4.0 and TPM to offer better sustainability outcomes. The present research investigates the direct connection among I4.0, TPM, and CE in the sustainability framework. Thus, it is not possible that a moderating variable (in this case CE) can have a direct association with independent variables (in this case I4.0 and TPM). Either way, a third variable (moderating) can have a direct association with the independent variable or a third variable can moderate the association of independent variables (I4.0 and TPM) and dependent variables (in this case SP).</p><p>The direct interconnection among TPM, I4.0, and CE does not open the possibility of having a moderating effect of CE on the connection of TPM and I4.0 with SP. Also, no previous studies have investigated the mediating impact of CE on the association of I4.0 and TPM with the overall SP of the firm. Thus, the lack of research in this area necessitates further research on the mediation of CE. Therefore, we hypothesise that:</p><p>H7: CE has a significant mediation effect on the association of TPM and SP.</p><p>H8: CE has a significant mediation effect on the association of I4.0 and SP.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Phase 2: PLS-SEM for Conceptual Framework</head><p>The method of path modelling known as partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to carry out the data analysis for the present investigation. PLS-SEM is a multivariate statistical method that has been developed recently and is effective in analysing the connection among latent variables and the indicators that represent them <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2017a)</ref>. Sample size has been one of the biggest prominent justifications for utilising PLS-SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Ringle et al., 2012)</ref>. However, other motivations also include prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>, non-normal data, sophisticated models and advanced analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hair et al., 2018)</ref> as well as a desire to uncover previously undiscovered variability in a population <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2016a)</ref>. PLS-SEM uses soft modelling to conduct SEM, which does not require data dispersion restrictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Vinzi et al., 2010)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Scale development</head><p>21 items were adopted from the literature review.

CE was assessed through five items considered from the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Khan et al. (2020)</ref>. I4.0 was evaluated through five items adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bibby and Dehe (2018)</ref>. Finally, SP was assessed by four items adopted from the studies of Abdul-Rashid et al.

A total of five academics and four professionals carried out the initial assessment of the questionnaire. The five academics had extensive knowledge of I4.0, CE, and logistics operations, and they belonged to the sustainability and TPM groups. The four industry practitioners worked for reputable logistics organisations in India. They currently manage logistics supply chain operations and are working towards transitioning from traditional supply chain methods to I4.0. The experts provided their insightful feedback in the form of comments and suggestions about other metrics that may be included in the questionnaire. In addition, the revised questionnaire was subjected to a pilot test with around 12 industry professionals in the field of logistics; this was followed by a further consultation on LinkedIn. All of the suggested changes were implemented, which included making some small adjustments to the questionnaire architecture, scale, and the inclusion or deletion of measurements. The study employed a 5-point Likert scale (interpreted as "1= strongly disagree, 2= disagree, 3= neutral, 4= agree, and 5= strongly agree") to evaluate the 21 items of the questionnaire.</p></div>

The respondents were from different backgrounds such as senior managers, floor supervisors, TPM and CE consultants, and I4.0 practitioners with more than 15 years of experience. To obtain the responses, continuous reminder emails were sent to the respondents within a period of 2 months. Some responses had missing or incorrect data, which led to 304 useful responses (with a response rate of 41.47%) for the final empirical analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Common method bias (CMB)</head><p>Questionnaire-based research is operationalised using a set of items that make up a preexisting or freshly constructed scale. While surveys are one of the most widely used methodologies in social sciences, they also carry the risk of common method variance and bias, compromising the reliability and validity of empirical findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Baumgartner and Steenkamp, 2001)</ref>. The common method refers to a systematic error variance resulting from a common method used to evaluate the study's constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The questionnaire was confidential and self-reported. It was made clear to the participants that their replies would not be used to identify them or their companies. CMB concerns were alleviated by changing the construct and measurement scales. Following <ref type="bibr">Nederhof (1985)</ref>, the present research used the manufacturing firm as a dummy subject at the construct level instead of the individual. Similarly, to avoid the influence of consistency in response trends, the current study employed distinct measuring scales in the survey. In aggregate, these variances enabled us to assess respondents' participation in the process and to screen out nonengaged responses.</p><p>Since all data for this study came from a single source via a self-report questionnaire, CMB may be a cause for concern <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Guide and Ketokivi, 2015)</ref>. Therefore, the research conducted two tests to determine the existence and degree of CMB. Harman's single factor test was deployed as a first test to examine the CMB of the investigation. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Podsakoff et al. (2003)</ref>, the single factor variance should be less than 50%. The current study used principal axis factoring as an extraction method while performing Harman's single factor test; this resulted in a 40.78% variance value for a single factor (less than the threshold of 50%). Therefore, the result suggested that CMB was low in the received responses. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was utilised as a second test in this work; this is a comprehensive collinearity test that has been frequently employed in past studies (using SmartPLS 3.0) to examine the CMB <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hair et al., 2019)</ref>. The findings of VIF (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>) were significant (VIF&lt; 3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hair et al., 2019)</ref>, suggesting that a low CMB was present in the study. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">PLS-SEM</head><p>In this investigation, the SmartPLS 3.0 software <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Ringle et al., 2015)</ref> was used for framework estimation and inside approximation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Assessment of measurement model</head><p>Internal consistency (as evaluated by Cronbach Alpha), reliability (as assessed by outer loadings), and validity are used to evaluate the reflecting measurement model <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Hair et al., 2016b)</ref>. Specific measurements include composite reliability (CR), convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Internal consistency implies an evaluation of the intercorrelations of indicators. The degree to which a scale corresponds to other measures of the same construct is referred to as its convergent validity. It is evaluated depending on the outer loadings of indicators and the average variance extracted (AVE). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Hair et al. (2016)</ref>, the threshold values of various relevant indicators should be as follows:</p><p>• "Outer loadings" &gt; 0.6</p><p>• "Cronbach Alpha (CA)" (Threshold 0.7)</p><p>• "rho_A" (Threshold 0.7)</p><p>• "Composite reliability (CR)" (Threshold 0.7)</p><p>• "Average variance extracted (AVE)" (Threshold 0.5)</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the results of the PLS-SEM analysis of all important indicators for each construct item with the exceeded value of the threshold. These results indicate that the model was internally consistent, reliable and valid. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>0.847</head><p>The next critical aspect of the analysis was discriminant validity, which assesses the different predictions of latent variables from dependent variables. Two criteria can measure discriminant validity i.e. "Fornell Larcker" and "heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT)". However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Henseler et al. (2015)</ref> indicate that HTMT is more reliable than Fornell Larcker criteria to measure discriminant validity. Therefore, the present research used the heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio to evaluate the discriminant validity of the measurement model. With this criteria, the threshold value should be less than 0.9. The results presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> illustrate that all values were lower than 0.9. Therefore, the study met the criteria of discriminant validity. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Assessment of the structural model</head><p>Examining the model's findings can reveal the structural model's capacity to forecast one or more planned constructs. The investigation used non-parametric bootstrapping with 5000 sub-samples to test the error estimation. Model fitness was checked with the help of standardised root mean square (SRMR) values. This should be less than 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cho et al., 2020)</ref> for a population more than 100 (in this case, it is 304). For the present study, the value of SRMR was 0.05, see Table <ref type="table">8</ref>; this is lower than 0.08. Thus, the findings of the SRMR values indicated the goodness of fit of the model. The values of R 2 and Q 2 are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>. The acceptable value of R 2 must be greater than 0.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Hair et al., 2016b)</ref>. Moreover, the Stone-Geisser (Q 2 ) test was evaluated through blindfolding. The values 0.245, 0.240, and 0.226 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>) were found to correspond to Q 2 for the present model. The fact that the value of Q 2 was more than zero was evidence that the path model had enough predictive significance <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Nath and Agrawal, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hair et al., 2017b)</ref>. In addition, the f 2 effect size for each of the independent factors was computed so that it could be determined whether or not the independent variables significantly contributed to the accuracy of the prediction of the dependent variable. The f 2 effect size for each independent variable is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>. According to the standards established by <ref type="bibr">Hair et al. (2017b)</ref>, the magnitude of these falls somewhere in the range of small to medium. To provide statistical significance of paths and hypothesis acceptability, the value of different standard coefficients, such as β, must be more than zero, and the p-value must be less than 0.05. The results shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> indicate that all of the hypotheses provided in this study were accepted.  The outcomes of the PLS-SEM method and the bootstrap technique in SmartPLS comprised the direct effect, total indirect effect, particular indirect effect, and overall effect. These results, which have been accessible in the SmartPLS results reports, allowed the execution of a mediation assessment <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2017b)</ref>. The outcomes offered in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> suggest that the direct association between TPM, I4.0, and SP was significantly positive. Moreover, the indirect relationship between TPM, I4.0, and SP was positive, indicating a positive mediation of CE on their relationship. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Nitzl et al. (2016)</ref>, partial mediation occurs when both influences are substantial and direct impacts are negligible, but if the indirect impact is significant and positive, significant partial mediation occurs. The results shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> suggest that CE has a partial mediation effect on the interconnection between TPM and SP, and I4.0 and SP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion and Implications</head><p>The present research investigates how TPM, I4.0, and CE respond to each other within the context of sustainability of manufacturing firms from the perception of the DCV theory (RQ1-RQ3). Furthermore, the study explores the role of CE as a mediator in the association of TPM and I4.0 with SP (RQ4). The outcomes of the research identify TPM, I4.0, and CE as dynamic capabilities of manufacturing firms that can enhance their SP. Further, the testing of the hypotheses addresses the proposed research questions of the present study as discussed below.</p><p>Hypothesis 1 (H1) was accepted with the significant values of standard coefficients (β = 0.285 and p &lt; 0.000); this indicates that TPM affects CE positively. No previous research that has investigated the association of TPM and CE exist. However, the results of this study corroborate some investigations that suggest the acceptance of H1, including Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2015), <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Allen (2021)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Vukadinovic et al. (2018), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Amjad et al. (2021)</ref>.</p><p>The second hypothesis (H2) was likewise supported by significant standard coefficient values (β = 0.580 and p &lt; 0.000), showing that I4.0 technologies have a beneficial effect on TPM practices. The findings support the studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Nowakowski et al. (2018)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Klathae and Ruangchoengchum (2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">), Felsberger et al. (2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">), and Tortorella et al. (2022a)</ref>. On the other hand, the substantial values of standard coefficients (β = 0.399 and p &lt; 0.  <ref type="bibr">(2018)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Madueke et al., 2020, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Tang et al. (2022)</ref>.</p><p>The hypotheses H7 and H8 suggest a mediation effect of CE on the relationship of TPM and SP, and I4.0 and SP, respectively. The values of the standard coefficient for H7 (β = 0.075 and p &lt; 0.007) and H8 (β = 0.105 and p &lt; 0.001) indicate that CE mediates both relations. The analysis indicates that the 76.91% size provides evidence confirming the CE partial mediation effect on the connection between TPM and SP. In addition, a total of 33.96 % of the effect size indicates that CE does, in fact, partially mediate the association between I4.0 and SP. This suggests that Indian manufacturing practitioners believe that the successful adoption of CE practices can lead to SP success in an environment characterised by I4.0 technology and TPM procedures. Finally, the values of R 2 (more than 0.1) and Q 2 (greater than 0) for all latent variables suggest that the study is substantial and reliable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Theoretical implications</head><p>The majority of the extant work on I4.0, TPM, and CE has been of an explorative nature, providing conceptual predictions about how they affect an organisation's sustainability objectives. This investigation analyses the influence of I4.0, TPM, and CE on SP, thus filling a research gap in academic literature. Two substantial theoretical contributions are made in this work to current literature. This research advances the theory of dynamic capability by conceptualising I4.0, TPM, and CE as dynamic capabilities of manufacturing enterprises that enable them to achieve superior sustainable performance results. Thus, this investigation fills a major gap in literature by proposing a novel combination of dynamic skills in the form of I4.0, TPM, and CE; this will empower an organisation's sustainability to become a competitive foundation.</p><p>Secondly, the literature indicates that CE is necessary for a manufacturing firm's SP. Therefore, the current investigation explores the mediating influence of CE on the association of I4.0 and SP, and TPM and SP. To address this gap, the present investigation uncovers and confirms that CE practices offer the partial mediation effect on the association of I4.0 and SP and the relationship between TPM and SP.</p><p>Additionally, the literature suggests that I4.0 could affect TPM <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Felsberger et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Tortorella et al., 2022a)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">, 2015)</ref>. Therefore, this is the first study that examines these relationships and concludes that I4.0 technologies have a significant positive impact on TPM practices, I4.0 technologies have a significant positive impact on CE practices, and TPM practices have a significant positive impact on CE practices. This suggests that I4.0 technologies enable manufacturers to improve their CE practices. Additionally, in an I4.0 context, TPM implementation can improve results by minimising the possibility of monitoring and scheduling problems. Finally, TPM procedures can contribute to a more favourable atmosphere for CE activities. When these three practices (I4.0, TPM, and CE) are used together, they can help a business achieve sustainability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Practical implications</head><p>The current study has a number of important managerial implications. The findings show that the application of TPM procedures has a favourable effect on CE practices. Consequently, practitioners can apply TPM strategies in manufacturing firms and their supply chains to optimise and remove waste to achieve harmonious and sustainable outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ghisellini et al., 2016)</ref>. For instance, TPM practices offer the prevention of breakdowns and improved green outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Amjad et al., 2021)</ref>, leading firms towards cleaner production and better environmental outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Garza-Reyes et al., 2018)</ref>. Such outcomes can motivate managers to see TPM as a practice that offers green and cleaner logistics to achieve better environmental performance throughout the supply chains of their organisations.</p><p>Additionally, I4.0 technologies have a favourable impact on TPM procedures, allowing practitioners to more effectively regulate and monitor operating environments; this in turn reduces waste and allows for more proactive decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Zheng et al., 2021)</ref>. With the support of I4.0 technologies, for example, a machine's data may be accessed and monitored in realtime <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Tortorella et al., 2022b)</ref>, resulting in better operational outcomes (e.g. fewer faults, faster deliveries, fewer breakdowns) and sustainable outcomes (e.g. waste reduction, safer working environment, and better environmental outcomes). Such results can inspire management to adopt I4.0 technologies in manufacturing logistics to explore the role of digital TPM outside of the shop floor. Furthermore, it can improve decision-making in manufacturing logistics and its entire supply chain to prevent breakdowns and achieve other TPM outcomes more accurately.</p><p>The impact of I4.0 technologies on CE practices has been positive. This may assist managers in the creation of a more environmentally friendly industrial atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bressanelli et al., 2018)</ref>. For example, the incorporation of I4.0 technologies can transform a conventional into an intelligent system <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Kamble and Gunasekaran, 2021)</ref>. These smart systems perform an essential role in the traceability of goods and repair components <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Franco, 2017)</ref>, contributing to the accomplishment of CE goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Nobre and Tavares, 2017)</ref>. Moreover, traceability due to the adoption of I4.0 technologies in a manufacturing firm can help practitioners to promote a hassle-free reverse logistics supply chain with greener outcomes.</p><p>The partial mediation of CE indicates that TPM practices and I4.0 technologies implementation can help firms to deliver sustainability if both approaches (TPM and I4.0) focus on achieving CE targets. For instance, if firms that are implementing TPM practices focus more on waste elimination and cleaner production, they can achieve sustainable targets more efficiently. Therefore, they do not have to focus on achieving other aspects while implementing TPM. Similarly, the incorporation of I4.0 technologies can deliver SP by focusing on optimal resource consumption and waste minimisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(De Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018)</ref>. Such results can develop the required motivation in managers to focus on CE outcomes while adopting TPM and I4.0 technologies.</p><p>Finally, the results indicate that the combined implementation of I4.0, TPM, and CE can lead firms to a better SP which could assist managers to obtain a competitive edge <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cantele and Zardini, 2018)</ref>. The findings imply that adopting and implementing I4.0 technologies allows real-time data and data interchange among supply chain stakeholders; this aids in resource efficiency and the reduction of waste and toxicants. For instance, I4.0 technologies can enable better decision-making of TPM <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Tortorella et al., 2022a)</ref> and help to trace items for CE objectives. Next, digital TPM can perform more precisely <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Tortorella et al., 2022b)</ref> to reduce emissions, breakdowns, accidents, and improve quality, machine and product life. Furthermore, digital TPM can promote and produce a greener and more sustainable ambience in terms of better working conditions, increased monetary benefits, and a better ecological environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Policy implications</head><p>The first and most important implication for policymakers is that they need to have a comprehensive insight into I4.0 technologies, TPM practices and CE, as well as how these factors contribute to the sustainability of various industries and their supply chains such as manufacturing, logistics, and automotive. This study focuses primarily on the impact of I4.0, TPM, and CE on manufacturing enterprise sustainability. Because of resource consumption restrictions posed by implementing I4.0 technologies at various stages of the supply chain and logistics, previous literature on this topic makes conflicting claims. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Kiel et al. (2017)</ref> suggest that Industry 4.0 may facilitate process optimisation and favourably impact ecological sustainability by maximising resource use. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ford and Despeisse (2016)</ref> indicate that incorporating I4.0 technologies may result in higher waste creation, such as electronic waste and a greater need for energy resources. However, governmental interventions may be able to relieve the impact of these barriers. More strict government rules are needed to keep up with the present supply chain's emphasis on minimising waste and extending the useful life of products and machinery. An increase in productivity is expected as a result of this. For instance, Japan's early embrace of CE ideas is largely responsible for the country's impressive achievements in resource productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Schröder, 2017)</ref>. With the rise of reverse logistics and manufacturing industries, the need for a well-functioning supply chain has never been greater. It is recommended that businesses experiencing a digital transition give these TPM practices high priority since they stand to gain most from adopting the technologies of I4.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Tortorella et al., 2022b)</ref>. Regulatory bodies (e.g. regional, national, and global) tend to be established by governments to outline the justification for the digital transformation of supply chains and thus provide a strategic roadmap for its execution <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Saha et al., 2022)</ref>. It is essential to understand that the only way to achieve sustainable development is for social and ecological sustainability to push towards economic sustainability, and vice versa <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Velenturf and Purnell, 2021)</ref>. The appropriate blend of I4.0, TPM, and CE to address alleviation of sustainability of manufacturing, logistics, and automobile industry with their relevant supply chain and stakeholders should be considered by policymakers as an area that they have to encourage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Research Scope</head><p>This investigation draws on the experiences of professional experts from Indian manufacturing enterprises that have developed or integrated TPM, I4.0, and CE into their operations. The conclusions obtained from the study can act as a guide for organisations considering using TPM, I4.0, and CE to obtain SP oriented improvements. The results also shed light on how CE practices may be included within I4.0 and TPM implementation plans.</p><p>The data demonstrates the significant advantage of TPM and I4.0 in improving CE practices and SP, hence suggesting to manufacturing companies to use both technologies concurrently.</p><p>The present investigation offers a comprehensive overview of the role of TPM, I4.0, and CE on the SP of manufacturing firms. Still, there are limitations and future propositions of the present study to be considered:</p><p>• The current research used I4.0 and TPM as a whole term to investigate their impact on CE and SP. However, I4.0 and TPM practices have their own tools, acting differently from overall I4.0 or TPM. Therefore, investigating the effect of individual tools/ technologies of I4.0 and TPM practices on CE and SP is needed. • The present research investigates the impact of TPM, I4.0, and CE on the overall SP of manufacturing companies. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that all three practices/ technologies (TPM, I4.0, and CE) do not offer all the sustainable outcomes for a manufacturing firm. Therefore, future researchers can identify the actual factors of the individual sustainability dimensions that are affected by I4.0, TPM, and CE. • The current study does not offer the prioritisation of I4.0, TPM, and CE in the context of sustainability. Hence, in future, some ranking methods can be considered to provide a hierarchical structure of various technologies/practices (internally and externally) based on their impact on the SP of manufacturing firms. • The present investigation examines the mediation effect of CE on the relationship between I4.0 and SP with TPM and SP. Therefore, there is a possibility of exploring the moderation effect of CE on both associations. Also, there is a possibility of examining CE's mediating and moderating effect on the association of I4.0 and TPM.</p><p>• These results would not apply to different nations since the researchers only included experts representing Indian manufacturing companies in this study. However, researchers believe that the consequences might be compared to industrial enterprises functioning in developing countries. Upcoming research should take into account a wider range of sectors and nations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>From</head><label></label><figDesc>the previous discussion and proposed hypotheses, a conceptual framework is developed as demonstrated in Figure 1.

The acceptance of H3 is supported by the studies of Pialot et al. (2017), Lopes de Sousa Jabbour et al. (2018), and Kamble and Gunasekaran (2021).The fourth hypothesis (H4), proposing a relationship between TPM and SP, was accepted with the standard coefficient value of β = 0.225 and p &lt; 0.000. Past scholars have ignored the impact of TPM on the overall SP of manufacturing firms. Still, some scholars have examined the relationship of TPM with some of the individual dimensions (economic, social, or environmental) of TBL sustainability. Therefore, the findings support previous studies investigating the relationship of TPM with an individual dimension of TBL sustainability. These studies include those of Hofer et al. (2012), Vukadinovic et al. (2018), Agustiady and Cudney (2018), Garza-Reyes et al. (2018), Chen et al. (2019), Heravi et al. (2020), and Dieste et al. (2021).The fifth hypothesis (H5), investigating the direct relationship between I4.0 and SP, was supported with significant standard coefficient values of β = 0.204 and p &lt; 0.002. The results are in line with the studies of<ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Herrmann et al. (2014)</ref>,<ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Stock and</ref> Seliger (2016), De Sousa  Jabbour et al.

In the case of H6, it examined the last direct relationship, indicating the positive influence of CE on the SP of manufacturing firms. The results support H6 with significant standard coefficient values of β = 0.263 and p &lt; 0.000. The findings support the past studies of<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Geissdoerfer et al.
