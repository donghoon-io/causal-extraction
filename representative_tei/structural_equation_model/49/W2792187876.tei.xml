<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Palliative care nurses need to develop specific competencies in order to effectively care for patients during their end-of-life phase and support their families <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Sand et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Clark et al., 2015)</ref>. Several scholars focussed on the meaning of the term 'competency' <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fernandez et al., 2012)</ref>, as well as the identification of the core competencies in palliative nursing care <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Becker, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Slatten et al., 2014)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Parry (1996: 50)</ref>, a competency is "a cluster of related knowledge, skills, and attitudes that affect a major part of one's job, correlates with performance on the job, can be measured with well accepted standards, and can be improved via training and development". While the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) identified the 10 most important skills for clinical practice in palliative care <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gamondi et al., 2013)</ref>, several profession-specific curricula have emerged at national level. In Italy, the Society for Palliative Care developed the Core Curriculum in Palliative Nursing <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(SICP, 2013)</ref>, in line with the needs for health, professionalism, and scientific development.</p><p>Although assessing the level of professional competency is crucial, it can represent a challenge, as it requires a multi-perspective and situation-specific approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Caruso et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Reville &amp; Foxwell, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>One of the easiest ways is to use self-report instruments, but self-assessment cannot accurately measure the real level of competency, because of its subjective nature. Nevertheless, the nurses' confidence in their professional competency, that is their self-efficacy beliefs, can play an important role in determining their caring behaviour and clinical choices undertaken, as well as their time and effort invested in their clinical activities. Indeed, the perceived level of professional-competency may hold an intrinsic psychological value and result as a determinant of quality palliative care <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Desbiens et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Higher levels of professional competency are associated with greater performance as well as better individual and organizational outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Greenslade &amp; Jimmieson, 2011)</ref>. Among individual outcomes, job satisfaction (JS), defined as a positive emotional state resulting from the appraisal of one's job experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Locke, 1976)</ref>, is a fundamental component of work life and can negatively predict nurses' turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Galletta et al., 2016)</ref>. Job satisfaction is influenced by several factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Caricati et al., 2014)</ref>, including structural and psychological empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cicolini et al., 2014)</ref>, but nurses cannot appreciate a job if they do not feel confident to do it effectively, in particular if patients' health is at risk. Among organizational outcomes, organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB) is increasingly recognised as indicating positive contextual performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Greenslade &amp; Jimmieson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Podsakoff et al., 2009)</ref>. OCB has been described as those contributions to organisational effectiveness that are neither mandated by own job requirements nor recognised by the formal reward system <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Organ, 1988)</ref>. OCB could be directed towards organisation (civic virtue), or towards co-workers (altruism). Nurses who believe to effectively care for palliative patients might engage more often in OCB, because their confidence in their own role could lead them to act in favour of their colleagues and organization.</p><p>Although self-efficacy beliefs, job satisfaction, and extra-role behaviours have been the subject of increasing interest among scholars, to the best of our knowledge, no study has addressed the role of professional competency in predicting JS and OCB in the palliative care context. While scholars reported promising results about the predictive role of self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Petitta et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Salanova et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Walumbwa et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chen &amp; Kao, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Todd &amp; Kent, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ko, 2008)</ref>, palliative care nurses were the objects of few studies investigating these constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Zaghini et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Qaseem et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fillion et al., 2009)</ref>. In this study, we speculate that the more palliative care nurses have confidence in their professional competency, the more they are satisfied with their job and engage in OCB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and Participants</head><p>A cross-sectional correlational study was conducted using on-line data. Participants were palliative care nurses working in hospice and/or at home, from public, non-profit, or private organisations across Italy. All nurses from selected palliative services were invited to participate in on-line survey if they were currently working as staff or head nurses, being contactable via e-mail, and able to read and understand Italian.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments</head><p>Professional-competency. Participants were asked to self-assess the level of their professional competency using the questionnaire Professional Competency of the Core Curriculum in Palliative Nursing (PC-CCPN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Prandi et al., 2015)</ref>. This curriculum includes 26 competencies with associated learning objectives. Among these 26 competencies, a group of experts selected five as the most important (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). They refer to (1) practicing the profession in accordance with ethical principles, (2) personalising the care, (3) remaining sensitive, (4) ensuring respect, and (5) communicating effectively. The PC-CCPN scale includes these five dimensions. The learning objectives described for each competency were adapted into a self-report scale to assess how much nurses believe to be competent in each specific area. The PC-CCPN is a 24-item scale ranging from 0 (not competent at all) to 10 (completely competent), with higher scores indicating greater perceived competency. In the present study, the internal consistency of the scale was α = 0.97 (Cronbach's alpha).</p><p>Job satisfaction. Nurses' JS was assessed using the subscale "job in general" of the Job Descriptive Index (JDI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Smith et al., 1969)</ref>. It includes 18 adjectives describing positive and negative aspects of the work experience. Participants can answer using "Y" if they agree, "N" if they disagree and "? " if they are undecided. Scores can range 0-18, with higher values indicating greater JS. In the present study, internal consistency of the JDI scale was 0.72 (Kuder-Richardson reliability coefficient).</p><p>Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Self-reported OCB was assessed using the Italian version <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Argentero et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Zaghini et al., 2015)</ref> of the questionnaire by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Podsakoff et al. (1990)</ref>. It includes 15 items measuring three dimensions: altruism, civic virtue, and conscientiousness. Participants are asked to rate their level of agreement on a 5-point Likert type scale; higher values indicate more OCB. In the present study, internal consistency of the OCB scale was α = 0.87.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>A researcher first emailed a contact person for each selected centre for palliative care. The contact person, who was usually a nurse manager, emailed palliative care nurses working in that centre to ask if they wanted to be involved in the survey. This email included the link to the on-line form, whose completion was voluntary and anonymous. The first author received the completed forms for data analysis. Ethics approval to conduct the study was obtained from the University of Rome "Tor Vergata" collaborating to the research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation [SD], frequencies and percentages) were used to describe the socio-demographic and work characteristics of the sample. Study variables (competency, JS, and OCB) were analysed using means, SDs, and Pearson's correlations. The hypothesised model, examining the role of professional competency in influencing JS and OCB, was tested through structural equation modelling (SEM) technique <ref type="bibr">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">-2017)</ref>. Robust maximum likelihood estimator method (MLr) was used to produce standard maximum likelihood parameter estimates with corrected standard errors and chisquare test statistic robust to non-normality and to non-independence of observations <ref type="bibr">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">-2017)</ref>. To evaluate the adequacy of the model, the following fit indices were considered: the Comparative Fit Index (CFI; good fit &gt; 0.90), the Tuker and Lewis Index (TLI; good fit &gt; 0.90), the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR; good fit ≤ 0.08), and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA; good fit &lt; 0.06). Traditional chi-square statistics were also reported <ref type="bibr">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>. Statistical analyses were performed using Mplus 7.1 (Muthén and Muthén, Los Angeles, CA, USA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characteristics of the sample</head><p>A sample of 107 palliative care nurses completed the survey. Participants were mainly females (n=90; 84.9%), with a mean age of 42 years (SD=9.6; range=24-63), and more often married (n=74; 70%). Their level of education was university degree for 64% (n=69) and regional school for 33.7% (n=35), but only 13.5% (n=14) of participants completed masters courses in palliative care. Most of them (n=92; 87%) were working as staff nurses within a hospice (n=63; 61%). Their mean work experience was of 17.9 years (SD=11.0) as nurses and 6.8 years (SD=5.2) as palliative care nurses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlations among study variables</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> shows scores and correlations among study variables. Participants reported high levels of professional competency in all of the five dimensions, especially in their ability to take care of each person, with sensitivity and attention in a comprehensive, tolerant, and non-judgmental manner. Their JS was high.</p><p>Participants reported to frequently engage in OCB, showing in particular high conscientiousness. Overall, all of the study variables were positively correlated with each other. The more palliative care nurses believed to be professionally competent, the more they were satisfied with their job and engaged in OCB, and viceversa. Greater JS was also associated with higher OCB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The hypothesised model</head><p>The model tested fitted the data well: χ 2 (df = 25, N = 107) = 33.50 p = 0.12, CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.06 (90% CI = 0.00 -0.10) p = 0.39, SRMR = 0.04 (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Perceived professional competency positively influenced JS (β = 0.39) and OCB (β = 0.53). The more participants believed to practice their profession in accordance with ethical principles, to personalise care, to remain sensitive, to ensure respect, and to communicate effectively, the more they were satisfied with their job and engaged in OCB. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>This study highlighted the importance of the perception of high professional competency among palliative care nurses. Caring for patients during their end-of-life period can represent a challenge at different levels, especially when specific education is lacking (Martins Pereira &amp; Hernandez-Marrero, 2016), thereby nurses may feel unprepared and lack the necessary confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Henderson et al., 2016)</ref>. In this study, however, nurses reported high professional competency in taking care of each person with sensitivity and attention in a comprehensive, tolerant and non-judging manner. This is a core competency in palliative care, as patients and their families wish to receive end-of-life care from health professionals able to be present, reassuring, and honouring choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ciemins et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In order to ensure high quality patient care and achieve positive organisational outcomes, palliative care nurses should develop specific competencies, such as practicing their profession in accordance with ethical principles, personalising care, remaining sensitive, ensuring respect, and communicating effectively, but also perceive themselves as effective in implementing those competencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bandura, 1997)</ref>. In particular, this study showed that the more nurses were confident about being professionally competent, the more they were satisfied with their job and engaged in OCB. The first finding of this study suggests that nurses' JS is influenced by the level of their perceived competency. This is in line with previous studies reporting positive associations between JS and self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bryant-Lukosius et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">DeLoach &amp; Monroe, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sand et al., 2017)</ref>. Indeed, nurses who report more professional competency can show higher confidence in performing their job activities, feel more prepared and adequate, and thereby consider their job easier, less demanding, and more rewarding. Since several factors can hamper nurses' JS, such as hard task requirements, strict organizational policies, and poor career progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Sansoni et al., 2016)</ref>, it is crucial to empower nurses by promoting and recognising their professional competency. Strategies to enhance nursing competency includes improving theoretical knowledge, promoting professional understanding, fostering reflection, and developing specific attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Sand et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mastroianni et al., 2015)</ref>. Nurses' self-competence can be also enhanced by a supportive organisation that cares about their well-being and fosters their work commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Battistelli et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The second finding of this study revealed that nurses with higher perceived competency have greater inner resources to perform their work conscientiously, participate in organisational life, and engage in altruistic behaviour towards colleagues (OCB). This seems reasonable as health professionals who believe to be highly competent in their work activity could translate that belief into a desire to help colleagues and/or their organisation, motivated by their high work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Salanova et al., 2011)</ref>. Our results agree with scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bandura et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bandura et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Staub, 2013)</ref> suggesting that self-efficacy beliefs exert a protective role in contrasting antisocial behaviors and in promoting prosocial behaviors.</p><p>Findings are also in line with research in the work setting arguing that the convictions of success are likely to support the workers' spontaneous initiative to engage in actions beyond what is formally expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Speier &amp; Frese, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Somech &amp; Drach-Zahavy, 2000)</ref>. Thus, prosocial behaviour at work might be associated not only with personal characteristics, such as prosociality <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Biagioli et al., 2016)</ref>, or contextual factors, such as a compassionate and caring organisational culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chu, 2016)</ref>, but also with higher self-competence.</p><p>Therefore, fostering the development and the perception of nurses' professional competency can be beneficial to the nurses themselves, as they can experience a greater JS; to their colleagues, who can receive help through altruistic behaviour; and to their organisation, as civic virtue is cultivated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limits</head><p>This study is not without limitations. The small sample size might reduce the validity of the findings and limit the representativeness of the sample, as nurses with higher resources are more likely to participate in research studies. Another limitation is the possibility of the social desirability bias, with participants reporting higher values then real to appear more competent and professionally engaged. In addition, crosssectional data may limit the causal directions of the model tested. Bidirectional associations are also possible: nurses who help their co-workers during their job might get, in turn, an improved self-concept. Future studies should examine the predictive role of professional competency over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This study confirmed the hypothesis that the more nurses believe in their professional competency, the more they are satisfied with their job and show altruism, civic virtue, and conscientiousness (OCB). Since delivery of high quality palliative care depends on the competency of health professionals and a supportive work environment, it is crucial for health organisations to empower palliative care nurses. One of the best way to empower nurses is to enhance their beliefs in their professional competency, which in turn will contribute to improve their JS and extra-role performance, resulting in benefit for the nurses themselves, the organisation, and their co-workers. It is relevant to understand how palliative services may better help their employees in enhancing their beliefs about the different professional competencies, creating a sense of professional agency for the management of end-of-life situations and building a more resilient work environment. Palliative services able to promote nurses' self-competence in caring for patients during their end-of-life are likely to attract and retain staff and improve patients' and workers' satisfaction, safety, and outcomes, while delivering cost-effective services.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The five competencies of the core curriculum in palliative nursing rated as the most important by experts.</p><p>1 Ability to practice the nursing profession in accordance with ethical, deontological, and legal principles, recognising and addressing, as a team, the ethical\ moral issues and the clinical situations that are difficult and controversial.</p><p>2 Ability to personalise the care to improve the quality of life of the patient and his/her family, relieving the physical, psychosocial, and spiritual suffering, as a team and across all of the services of the palliative network.</p><p>3 Ability to take care of each person, with sensitivity and attention in a comprehensive, tolerant, and nonjudgmental manner.</p><p>4 Ability to take care of the patient and his/her family, ensuring respect for their rights, their beliefs, their system of values and their desires.</p><p>5 Ability to communicate effectively with the patient and with his/her family, even in cases where the patient show deterioration of verbal and/or nonverbal communication. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
