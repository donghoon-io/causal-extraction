<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The purpose of this study was to develop and empirically test a model for predicting the key factors affecting nurses' behavioral intention to use mobile learning (mlearning). We explored behavioral intention from users' perspectives by applying an extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model with the addition of information quality, system quality, technostress, and satisfaction. We conducted a survey of the district and regional hospitals in central Taiwan. Data were derived from 434 respondents. Structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the causal effects of 15 hypothesized predictive factors. We determined that satisfaction, social influence, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and effort expectancy positively impacted nurses' behavioral intention to use m-learning. In addition, technostress was a negative antecedent of effort expectancy. Information quality and system quality had significantly positive effects on satisfaction, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy. This study provides hospital managers with a reference when assessing future developments and informs approaches to promote m-learning.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Following the proliferation of Internet technology and mobile devices, the way people communicate changes. The impact also extends to how people obtain knowledge and information, which leads to how people approach life and work. The revolution in mobile eLearning has taken off. The concept of mobile learning (m-learning) has evolved from distance learning to e-learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chao, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chavoshi and Hamidi, 2019)</ref>. Using mobile technologies to establish a learning environment that is not limited by time and space, m-learning is a key form of e-learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hamidi and Chavoshi, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chao, 2019)</ref>. How to best implement m-learning is a vital issue for learners and educational policymakers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Christensen and Knezek, 2018)</ref>. In recent years, the issues related to m-learning have been widely discussed around the world. M-learning has been defined as "learning that occurs when learners have access to information anytime and anywhere via mobile technologies to perform authentic activities in the context of their learning" <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Martin and Ertzberger, 2013)</ref>. However, the development and application of m-learning in nursing education still lack a systematic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kim and Park, 2019)</ref>. Therefore, implementing mobile technology in nursing education may not only helps nursing students learn effectively and improve learning satisfaction and performance within limited clinical learning time but also helps nursing staff conduct training and reinforce professional skills. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chang et al. (2018)</ref> suggested that the application of mobile technology in nursing education can elucidate the behavioral intention of m-learners in nursing education. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wu et al. (2011)</ref> developed a mobile guiding system for a clinical nursing course. Through mobile devices, learners were guided to interact with simulated standard patients in real scenarios. This can lower the barrier between practical and theoretical knowledge. The results showed that the nursing students who used the mobile guiding system outperformed those using conventional methods in disease identification, which confirmed that m-learning can effectively improve nursing students' results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kim and Park (2019)</ref> conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of smartphone-based m-learning on nurses and nursing students. They found that smartphone-based m-learning may be an alternative method for more effective nursing education. However, most studies were conducted with nursing students rather than with nurses. In sum, understanding nurses' experiences with m-learning in nursing education and their behavioral intention for its use is valuable.</p><p>Recently, mobile technology is widely used in the healthcare industry, include: mobile health education, mobile health <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Duarte and Pinho, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yu et al., 2021)</ref>. To understand users' behaviors concerning technology acceptance, most studies utilized the theory of planned behavior (TPB; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ajzen, 1991)</ref>, the technology acceptance model (TAM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Davis, 1989</ref>), the information system success model (ISSM), and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Venkatesh et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Karimi, 2016)</ref>. In the past, TAM was one of the most prevailing models used to understand technology acceptance. However, under mobile technology learning circumstances, the idea of integrating mobile devices with learning ensures that the learner will consider the social influence and the facilitating conditions owing to the characteristics of m-learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Wang and Shih, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Briz-Ponce et al., 2017)</ref>. In short, we utilized the UTAUT model in this research proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref>. The importance of UTAUT lies within it being recognized as the most comprehensive theoretical model with strong explanatory power. UTAUT explains 40 and 70% of the users' intention of adopting technological solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Pappas et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chopik and Francis, 2022)</ref>. The model also integrates elements across eight prior models, including the TPB <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>, the TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Davis, 1989)</ref>, the theory of reasoned action (TRA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975)</ref>, a combined version of TPB and TAM (c-TAM-TPB; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Taylor and Todd, 1995)</ref>, a motivational model (MM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Davis et al., 1989)</ref>, a model of PC utilization (MPCU; <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Thompson et al., 1991)</ref>, the innovation diffusion theory (IDT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rogers, 2003)</ref>, and the Social cognitive theory (SCT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bandura, 1986)</ref>. The UTAUT model integrates performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions that directly impact behavioral intention. Therefore, we utilized the UTAUT model in this research.</p><p>The ISSM is used to investigate end-user's computing satisfaction. It includes information quality, system quality, satisfaction, and system use <ref type="bibr">(DeLone and</ref><ref type="bibr">McLean, 1992, 2003)</ref>. However, previous studies have rarely addressed the impact of information quality and system quality on performance expectancy and effort expectancy, respectively. System use can be noted as the degree and manner in which nurse learners utilize the capabilities of an m-learning system. Therefore, this study integrates two constructs-performance expectancy and effort expectancy-from the UTAUT model to represent system use. By integrating the UTAUT model and the ISSM, this study expects to predict nurses' behavioral intention to use m-learning in Taiwan. In addition, m-learning is an information communication technology; it has created the stress called "technostress" when nurses use m-learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lee et al., 2016)</ref>. Technostress combines the positive and negative effects of technology tasks to create uncertainty in m-learning: this stress involves both physical and psychological symptoms. This study examined technostress to clarify how it impacts performance and effort expectancy.</p><p>Scant research has attempted to identify and analyze external factors and their impact on the main determinants of users' behavioral intention, such as effort expectancy and performance expectancy. Moreover, factors, such as technostress, have seldom been discussed. This study is thus the first attempt to understand the antecedents of UTAUT in the context of m-learning. The base theoretical models can be extended with different types of external factors, for which different classification schemas have been proposed in the existing literature. Thus, this study extends the constructs to include the ISSM and technostress to further examine the acceptance of m-learning. Specifically, in this study, external factors were classified into (1) system technology factors (such as information quality and system quality) and (2) individual factors (such as nurses' technostress and satisfaction). Our purpose areas follows: (1) to investigate the factors affecting nurses' behavioral intention to use m-learning;</p><p>(2) to the individual differences in the integrating model and to examine the relationships among the ISSM, the UTAUT, and technostress; and (3) to add new external variables to the UTAUT construct, the ISSM (information quality, system quality, and system satisfaction), and technostress, as well as to empirically assess the relationship between this construct and the UTAUT of m-learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES E-Learning and M-Learning</head><p>With rapid Internet infrastructure development, information resources are abundant with users' access to necessary devices and Internet service. E-learning can be defined as rendering knowledge anytime and anywhere with access to the Internet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cidral et al. (2018)</ref> suggest that "e-learning provides people with a flexible and personalized way to learn; allowing learning on demand and reducing the cost of learning. A variety of core technologies that can facilitate the design and implementation of e-learning systems are emerging, and therefore a far-reaching impact on learning is achieved in the new millennium."</p><p>Along with mobile technology development, e-learning branches out to m-learning. M-learning goes beyond the limitations of e-learning, including that educators and students can use hand-held devices to achieve and perform learning goals-anywhere and at any time-beyond traditional classroom techniques. M-learning also provides an opportunity to render customized learning experiences through the use of online storage applications or online content. For example, e-books, demonstration videos, massive graphics, or article content are available via Google suite for Education, which highlights the significant potential for m-learning. It is also worth noting that mobile users have passed desktop users in population and minutes of use; consistently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chaffey (2018)</ref> illustrates that the digital future is on mobile devices. Thus, it is relevant that m-learning is playing a pivotal role in e-learning moving forward.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology</head><p>Venkatesh and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Davis (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref> developed UTAUT. The UTAUT model is a modified model of the TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. TAM suggests that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use together are thus associated with individuals' behavioral intention to use technology, which, in turn, leads to actual use <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980)</ref>. Therefore, UTAUT adopts the two variables of the TAM and expands them into four constructs: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. These constructs influence behavioral intention to use technology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Venkatesh et al. (2012)</ref> suggested that UTAUT is a "comprehensive synthesis of prior technology acceptance research." Evolving from TAM, UTAUT also integrates TRA, MM, TPB, C-TAM-TPB, MPCU, IDT, and SCT. UTAUT explains <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chao, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Duarte and Pinho, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Arfi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chopik and Francis, 2022)</ref>, more precisely, how people adopt technology and use technology compared to the other related models. "In longitudinal field studies of employee technology acceptance, UTAUT explained about 70 percent of the variance in behavioral intention to use a technology and about 50 percent of the variance in technology use" <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance Expectancy</head><p>Performance expectancy is the level of expectancy the information technology provides to enhance performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Arfi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chopik and Francis, 2022)</ref>. In m-learning courses for nurses, if the tool can provide a better learning result, or the m-learning experience can escalate work performance, then nurses will have more intention to use it. This is comparable to perceived usefulness in TAM, in which the technology is more accepted when users perceive it as beneficial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effort Expectancy</head><p>Effort expectancy is related to the easiness to use. If it requires less effort to utilize the technology, the more a user will be inclined to use it. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Magsamen-Conrad et al. (2015)</ref>, "Effort expectancy refers to the level of ease related to the utilization of the system. Its root constructs are perceived ease of use." Many researchers have found that effort expectancy has a significant influence on the intention to adopt new technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alraja, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chao, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Arfi et al., 2021)</ref>. For nurses completing m-learning, how the interface fares with their expectations may lead to their increased or decreased interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Influence</head><p>People may follow others' steps to adopt new technology. The reasons vary, such as to meet expectations, the competition, or being motivated by rewards; however, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Alraja (2016)</ref> defines social influence as "the degree to which that others (family, friends, peers, etc.) believe (either positive or negative) will affect someone to use the new system." From <ref type="bibr">Bozan et al.'s (2016)</ref> perspective, in the UTAUT model, performance expectancy and effort expectancy are defined as individual factors, and "the social factors-social influence-are more uniform aspects that affect the behavioral intention." For nurses taking m-learning courses, the primary reasons for completing said courses may be for peer acceptance, to elevate one's social status, or being forced by the circumstances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Facilitating Conditions</head><p>Alraja (2016) argues that "facilitating conditions refers to which extent people believe that an organizational and technical infrastructure exists to support the system." <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Thomas et al. (2013)</ref> argue that "facilitating conditions significantly affect behavioral intention even when the effects of performance expectancy and effort expectancy on behavioral intention are included." In m-learning settings, technical support teams can be considered as a facilitating condition that helps users feel comfortable when participating, thus increasing their behavioral intention. In sum, we proposed the following seven hypotheses (H):</p><p>H1: An increase in performance expectancy will increase nurses' behavioral intention to use m-learning.</p><p>H2: An increase in effort expectancy will increase nurses' behavioral intention to use m-learning.</p><p>H3: An increase in social influence will increase nurses' behavioral intention to use m-learning.</p><p>H4: An increase in facilitating conditions will increase nurses' behavioral intention to use m-learning.</p><p>H5: An increase in satisfaction will increase nurses' behavioral intention to use m-learning.</p><p>H6: An increase in effort expectancy will increase nurses' performance expectancy.</p><p>H7: An increase in social influence will increase nurses' performance expectancy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information System Success Model</head><p>Information system success model renders a precise identification, description, and explanation of the most critical elements to review system information, which is one of the pivotal scholarly works impacting the Internet era to date. For an information system, the key to success is to improve users' perception of its quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">DeLone and McLean (1992)</ref> established ISSM. It was extended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Seddon (1997)</ref>, who suggested that system quality and information quality affect perceived usefulness and user satisfaction.</p><p>For m-learning to be successful in clinical nursing courses, system quality must reflect m-learning system characteristics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Seddon (1997)</ref> defined system quality as being "concerned with whether or not there are bugs in the system, the consistency of the user interface, ease of use, quality of documentation, and sometimes, quality" as well as the "maintainability of the program code." <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stefanovic et al. (2016)</ref> argue that system quality should be user-friendly and easy to use. In practical application, the professionalism and complexity of the information will directly affect the user experience. Without a reliable and friendly user interface, participating nurses cannot properly use the m-learning course to obtain necessary information and knowledge, nevertheless fostering nurses' course satisfaction.</p><p>Information quality is correlated with the content of m-learning nursing courses. This includes up-to-date information and accurate and relevant data for participants. Information quality is "concerned with such issues as the relevance, timeliness, and accuracy of the information generated by an information system" <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Seddon, 1997)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stefanovic et al. (2016)</ref> define information quality as providing precise, up-todate, sufficient, reliable, and useful information. This will affect participants' perceived usefulness of the m-learning course, and whether they will be satisfied with the course. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Seddon (1997)</ref> suggests that user satisfaction is "a subjective evaluation of the various consequences evaluated on a pleasant-unpleasant continuum." Further, the more satisfied one is with the system itself, the more likely one is to find the system to be easy to use. This notion of "easy to use" thus reinforces effort and performance expectancy. Accordingly, we maintained that information quality and system quality would be correlated with satisfaction, effort expectancy, and performance expectancy. Specifically, we proposed the following six hypotheses:</p><p>H8: An increase in information quality will increase nurses' performance expectancy.</p><p>H9: An increase in information quality will increase nurses' effort expectancy.</p><p>H10: An increase in information quality will increase nurses' satisfaction.</p><p>H11: An increase in system quality will increase nurses' performance expectancy.</p><p>H12: An increase in system quality will increase nurses' effort expectancy.</p><p>H13: An increase in system quality will increase nurses' satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technostress</head><p>Psychiatrists believe that technology triggers human reactions to become a stress. The idea of technostress was first introduced to the field of technology and psychology by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brod (1984)</ref>: "Technostress is a modern disease of adaptation caused by an inability to cope with the new computer technologies in a healthy manner. It manifests itself in two distinct and related ways: in the struggle to accept computer technology, and in the more specialized form of over-identification with computer technology." <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tarafdar et al. (2007)</ref> found that users "feel inundated with information and are forced to work faster to cope with increased processing requirements. Also, they feel compelled to acquire and process the information simply because it is available. This may impair performance and lead to stress." For m-learning users, courses affect their working hours and their performance will be under scrutiny; thus, we proposed the following hypotheses: H14: An increase in technostress will decrease nurses' performance expectancy.</p><p>H15: An increase in technostress will decrease nurses' effort expectancy.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> provides a pictorial depiction of the research framework, which combines two models-UTAUT and ISSMto elucidate the factors that influence nurses' behavioral intention to use m-learning. The independent variables were information quality, system quality, technostress, social influence, and facilitating conditions. The dependent variables were satisfaction, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, and behavioral intention. The final construct we measured was behavioral intention to use m-learning, which we posited would be directly influenced by satisfaction, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions-with information quality and system quality additionally influencing users' level of satisfaction, effort expectancy, and performance expectancy. In addition, technostress would influence effort and performance expectancy. These nine predictors form an extended UTAUT model for predicting behavioral intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Instrumentation and Data Collection</head><p>This study adopted the back-translation method to ensure the validity of the translation of the questionnaire <ref type="bibr">(Brislin, 1970)</ref>.</p><p>We translated the previously developed questionnaire items from English to Chinese since the survey was conducted in Taiwan. We also modified the wording to match the context and the target audience. To reduce any differences in the questionnaire project, items were then back-translated by an experienced m-learning researcher. Then, we performed a pilot test to determine the clarity of the measurement items and improve the face validity of the instrument. Data were collected by a cross-sectional questionnaire with close-ended questions. The questionnaire was designed in two parts. The first part contained five questions that collected basic information about participants, including age, education level, time of mobile device used, type of hospital, and position. The second part included 47 items to measure the nine variables of the model in the context of m-learning: technostress, information quality, system quality, satisfaction, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and behavioral intention. All items were adopted from previous literature and modified slightly to fit the current research context. Each item was responded to using a five-point Likert scaleranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree)-and higher scores indicated higher agreeance with each item.</p><p>To develop the instrument for our research purposes, we adapted scales from previous literature. The measuring items for the UTAUT model constructs were adapted from the measurements developed by several previous researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Venkatesh et al., 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Venkatesh et al., , 2012;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Alraja, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Alraja, , 2016;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Magsamen-Conrad et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Karimi, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chao, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Duarte and Pinho, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Arfi et al., 2021)</ref>, including performance expectancy (five items), effort expectancy (six items), social influence (six items), facilitating conditions (five items), and behavioral intention (six items). Items for the ISSM variables, that is, information quality, system quality, and satisfaction, were adopted from several previous researchers <ref type="bibr">(DeLone and</ref><ref type="bibr">McLean, 1992, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Seddon, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stefanovic et al., 2016)</ref>. The information quality measure contained five items, system quality had five items, and satisfaction had four items. Finally, technostress was measured using five items <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tarafdar et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lee et al., 2016)</ref>. The measurement items included in each construct are depicted in the Supplementary Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pilot Test</head><p>In the pilot test, we collected data from 96 nurses (N1, N2, N3, and N4) from four hospitals in central Taiwan. Nurses who participated in the pilot test were excluded from the subsequent study. In addition, the pilot test of the questionnaire was conducted using convenience sampling. The results of the pilot study showed that Cronbach's alphas (α) ranged from 0.911 to 0.955. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hair et al. (2010)</ref>, the Cronbach's α of each construct should be ≥0.7, indicating the reliability of the questionnaire items used in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited 500 nurses from five hospitals (including regional and district hospitals) in Taiwan. These hospitals were classified by the Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation. One hundred nurses were randomly selected from each sample hospital. The lists of nurses provided by the human resources or nursing departments were cleared before sampling by removing nurses on long-term leave (sick leave, maternity leave, study leave, etc.). All participating nurses had experience using m-learning. The data were anonymous and there is no way for readers to identify the participants. In addition, all participants were volunteers and could refuse participation at any time without consequences. In total, 472 completed questionnaires were submitted.</p><p>The research team reviewed the questionnaires and discarded the questionnaires that were incomplete/missing data. Finally, 434 useable questionnaires were obtained (valid response rate = 86.8%, 434/500). Among the valid responses, 265 (61.1%) were from district hospitals and 169 (38.9%) were from regional hospitals. Nurses' mean age was 31.06 years (SD = 5.65), with a range from 22 to 50 years. Three-quarters had a faculty degree/bachelor's degree (n = 325), 13.4% (n = 58) had a nursing college degree, and 11.8% (n = 51) had a master's degree or above. Most participants (89.2%) declared that they had used a mobile device for more than 3 years, followed by 2 to 3 years (6.2%). About half (46.1%) had an N2 (n = 200), followed by an N1 (35.9%, n = 156; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>We used a structural equation model (SEM) to conduct this research, and we employed partial least squares (PLS) software to analyze the proposed conceptual model and test the hypotheses. In addition, this study followed the two-stage analytical technique suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hair et al. (2017)</ref>, which are: (1) the measurement model assessment (validity and reliability) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) the structural model assessment (testing the hypothesized relationships).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model Evaluation</head><p>This study first examined the measurement model to test the internal reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity (DV). To evaluate the internal reliability for all constructs, Cronbach's α and composite reliability (CR) were used. To assess the convergent validity for all constructs, average variance extracted (AVE) was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hair et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bagozzi and Yi, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, the factor loadings of all items were higher than the recommended levels of 0.7, and they were all significant (p &lt; 0.05; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hair et al., 2010</ref>). Cronbach's α ranged from 0.916 to 0.950, thereby suggesting high internal reliability. The CR values ranged from 0.937 to 0.962, exceeding the recommended cutoff of 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hair et al., 2010)</ref>. The AVE values ranged from 0.719 to 0.834, exceeding 0.5 for each construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref>. Finally, concerning DV, the values of all constructs were greater than 1.0, indicating an appropriate level of DV <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis and Hypotheses Testing</head><p>Regarding the overall quality of the research model, the SEM procedure based on PLS regression was applied to analyze the goodness of fit (GoF), path coefficients, and coefficient of determination (R 2 ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alolah et al. (2014)</ref> suggested using GoF as a global fit metric for PLS path modeling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Tenenhaus et al. (2005)</ref> suggested that GoF must be higher than the proposed 0.36 benchmark. According to the above results, the GoF value was 0.581, exceeding this noted the cut-off and indicating that the model structure was fitted to the data.</p><p>The model had five exogenous variables (information quality, system quality, technostress, social influence, and facilitating conditions) and four endogenous variables (satisfaction, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and behavioral intention). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> present the hypothesis testing results, the amount of variance explained (R 2 ), the standardized path coefficients for each hypothesized path, and the associated t-values for each construct. According to the path analysis, 14 of the 15 hypotheses were supported in the model.</p><p>In the final model, information quality and system quality were all crucial antecedents of satisfaction (βs = 0.365 and 0.263, respectively), thereby supporting H10 and H13. In summary, information quality and system quality variables jointly explained 33.2% of the variance in the satisfaction variable (R 2 = 0.332). Information quality, system quality, and technostress were significant determinants of effort expectancy (βs = 0.151, 0.240, and -0.253, respectively), thereby supporting H9, H12, and H15. These three constructs explained 21.1% of the variance in the effort expectancy variable (R 2 = 0.211). Effort expectancy, social influence, information quality, and system quality were significant determinants of performance expectancy (βs = 0.384, 0.277, 0.173, and 0.081, respectively), thereby supporting H6 to H8 and H11. However, technostress had a non-significant effect on performance expectancy, thereby not supporting H14. Therefore, four constructs explained 53.7% of the variance in the performance expectancy variable (R 2 = 0.537): effort expectancy, social influence, information quality, and system quality. Finally, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and satisfaction were significantly positive determinants of behavioral intention (βs = 0.243, 0.140, 0.310, 0.158, and 0.324, respectively), thereby supporting H1 to H5. These five constructs explained 65.4% of the variance in the behavioral intention variable (R 2 = 0.654). In sum, satisfaction had the most significant effect on behavioral intention, followed by social influence, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The conceptual model of this study combined two models-UTAUT and ISSM-to clarify the factors that affect nurses' behavioral intention to use m-learning in Taiwanese hospitals. Indeed, this study successfully integrated factors from both models into this research framework. This study found that the four UTAUT constructs-effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditionsand one of the ISSM constructs-satisfaction-influenced nurses' behavioral intention to use m-learning. Further, two  of the ISSM constructs-information quality and system quality-influenced nurses' satisfaction, effort expectancy, and performance expectancy. Technostress also influenced nurses' effort expectancy. These results highly support the predictive validity of the current model. According to the path coefficient analyses, the four factors from the UTAUT had significant relationships with behavioral intention. This finding is consistent with earlier research <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Venkatesh et al., 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Venkatesh et al., , 2012;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Alraja, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Magsamen-Conrad et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chao, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Duarte and Pinho, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Arfi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chopik and Francis, 2022)</ref>. The social influence had the most significant effect and was among the strongest predictors of behavioral intention to use m-learning, because its adoption depends very much on nurses' level of engagement, hospital, and The results also showed that performance expectancy was a significant predictor of behavioral intention to use m-learning. Most nurses do not have enough time to acquire learning, training, and reinforce their professional skills; therefore, they may be looking at m-learning as an effective solution. In addition, facilitating conditions significantly affected nurses' behavioral intention to use m-learning, which could reflect the extent to which nurses use mobile technology and information and communication technologies resources in m-learning. Consequently, they are aware of the importance of mobile technical and infrastructural resource requirements and their impact on behavioral intention to use m-learning.</p><p>Previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Davis et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Venkatesh and Davis, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Liu et al., 2010)</ref> suggest that, to better explain the adoption of technology, it is important to understand the antecedents of the key constructs. However, little is known about the impact of information quality and system quality on performance expectancy and effort expectancy, respectively. Therefore, this study used ISSM, satisfaction, information quality, and system quality as antecedents of the key constructs of UTAUT. We found that satisfaction was a key determinant on nurses' behavioral intention to use m-learning. Moreover, information quality and system quality had a positive impact on satisfaction, corroborating similar results on the success of e-learning systems <ref type="bibr">(DeLone and</ref><ref type="bibr">McLean, 1992, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stefanovic et al., 2016)</ref>. Information quality and system quality also had positive impacts on effort expectancy and performance expectancy. During the m-learning process, if the m-learning platform is easy to use while providing nurses useful, updated, and correct information applicable at work. Therefore, nurses will consider m-learning a valuable tool to improve their job performance and easy to use. Said feelings toward the system increased nurses' system satisfaction, effort expectancy, and performance expectancy. Subsequently, they felt that m-learning helped them learn and enhance their learning results, which elevated their behavioral intention to use m-learning. In addition, nurses thought more favorably of m-learning system quality if they perceived the m-learning system as offering complete functions, was easy to understand and manipulate, and was stable. Said feelings elevated their m-learning satisfaction, effort expectancy, and performance expectancy, thereby elevating their behavioral intention to use m-learning.</p><p>The role of technostress had not been previously analyzed in the context of behavioral intention to use m-learning. In this study, technostress negatively influenced effort expectancy; however, it had no significant impact on performance expectancy. The results imply that nurses who are stressed because they feel that they are unable to keep up with new information technology are reluctant to utilize m-learning, which lowers their effort expectancy. They may even consider m-learning to have no positive effects on their learning. Thus, hospitals are recommended to lower nurses' technostress before promoting m-learning and incorporating new technology when providing educational training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>This study was to develop and empirically extend the UTAUT model with the addition of information quality, system quality, technostress, and satisfaction to offer a more comprehensive explanation for the key factors affecting nurses' behavioral intention to use m-learning. Therefore, the purpose of this study are as follows: (1) to investigate the factors affecting nurses' behavioral intention to use m-learning; (2) to the individual differences in the integrating model and to examine the relationships among ISSM, UTAUT, and technostress; and</p><p>(3) to add new external variables to the UTAUT construct, the ISSM (information quality, system quality, and system satisfaction), and technostress, as well as to empirically assess the relationship between this construct and the UTAUT of m-learning. To this end, data collected from a sample of 434 respondents in regional hospitals in central Taiwan were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results revealed that satisfaction, social influence, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and effort expectancy are important antecedent factors in nurses' behavioral intention to use m-learning. In addition, technostress was a negative antecedent of effort expectancy. Finally, information quality and system quality had significantly positive effects on satisfaction, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy. This study provides hospital managers with a reference when assessing future developments and informs approaches to promote m-learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDIES</head><p>This study had some limitations that future research should address. First, data were collected using a cross-sectional design. Therefore, future studies should consider using a longitudinal design, which may result in more accurate findings from specific groups. In addition, different methods can be used as Quantum Machine Learning Architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Amin et al., 2021)</ref>. Although we considered several theories to devise our model, we did not include expectations-confirmation theory, flow theory, UTAUT 2, mobile literacy, or mobile self-efficacy. Future research may wish to do so to produce a more comprehensive study. Finally, this study was conducted at five hospitals in Taiwan; thus, the model may not be generalizable to other areas. Future research should expand data to investigate long-term effects. In addition, the model should be tested in other countries and refined accordingly to improve its predictive power.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head>TABLE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Profiles of respondents (N = 434).</figDesc><table><row><cell>Factor/level</cell><cell>N</cell><cell>%</cell><cell>Factor/level</cell><cell>N</cell><cell>%</cell></row><row><cell>Formal education</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Type of hospital</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Nursing college</cell><cell>58</cell><cell>13.4</cell><cell>District hospitals</cell><cell cols="2">265 61.1</cell></row><row><cell cols="6">Faculty degree/bachelor degree 325 74.9 Regional hospitals 169 38.9</cell></row><row><cell>Master degree or above</cell><cell>51</cell><cell>11.8</cell><cell>Position</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Time of mobile device used</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>N1</cell><cell cols="2">156 35.9</cell></row><row><cell>Less than 1 years</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>2.3</cell><cell>N2</cell><cell cols="2">200 46.1</cell></row><row><cell>1-2 (included) years</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>2.3</cell><cell>N3</cell><cell>39</cell><cell>9.0</cell></row><row><cell>2-3 (included) years</cell><cell>27</cell><cell>6.2</cell><cell>N4</cell><cell>39</cell><cell>9.0</cell></row><row><cell>More than 3 years</cell><cell cols="2">387 89.2</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
