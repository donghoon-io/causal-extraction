<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study proposes a model based on competitive advantage and signaling theories that show how green human resource management (GHRM) leads to corporate environmental sustainability and corporate social sustainability and is thus source of employer branding. Structural equational modeling was used for data analysis through Smart PLS. The results confirm that GHRM positively influences on corporate environmental sustainability, which in turn positively influences corporate social sustainability. Furthermore, the results confirm that corporate social sustainability has a positive influence on employer branding. The results also support the mediating effects of corporate environmental sustainability between GHRM and corporate social sustainability. Additionally, we show the mediating effect of corporate social sustainability between corporate environmental sustainability and employer branding. In the human resource literature, previous studies emphasize on corporate environmental sustainability. By contrast, this study confirms that a corporate social sustainability is a source of employer branding. By implementing GHRM, organizations can gain a competitive edge, which helps them attract potential employee.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">| INTRODUCTION</head><p>In recent years, environmental problems like climate change have gained considerable attention, and business organizations are increasingly called upon to take responsibility for addressing society's escalating challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Ren et al., 2020)</ref>. Global environmental concerns and stakeholder pressures that demand organizations deploy green processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Meuer et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Yu &amp; Ramanathan, 2015)</ref> and pay attention to social issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Mani et al., 2016)</ref>. Organizations must do so for their effectiveness and longterm viability <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Paillé et al., 2014)</ref>. In modern societies business organizations that convert natural resources into products of wealth are at the center of discourses on unsustainable practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Imbrogiano, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Sustainability is an emergent field related to the environment (Piwowar-Sulej, 2021). The idea of sustainable development extremely popular as it sets common trends for all spheres of human and business activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hojnik et al., 2022)</ref>. It is recognized as development without compromising the needs of future generations and harming the environment. Sustainability in the corporate environment will be fully achieved if organizations pay attention to all stakeholders in their business models <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Khan et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Konietzko et al., 2020)</ref>. Additionally, sustainability awareness is critical in implementing sustainability management tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Talbot et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>To promote sustainability, the United Nations UN in September, 2015 through the members' consensus developed 17 Sustainable Development Goals <ref type="bibr">(SDGs)</ref>. The SDGs aim to tackle in depth issues by setting 17 goals and 169 associated targets that are to be achieved in the next 15 years, starting from 2016. SDGs focus on achieving sustainable development in economic, social, and environmental dimensions (UN SDGs, 2016). The 17 goals are directly or indirectly relevant to the business sector as they can contribute to the alleviation of global crises <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Poddar et al., 2019)</ref>. However, achieving the 17 SDGs is challenging for organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Tsalis et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The need for sustainable environment management has increased and green management has emerged as an important tool for organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Úbeda-García et al., 2022)</ref>. The need to build a sustainable environment has invoked the concept of Green Human Resources.</p><p>The amalgamation of Human Resource Management (HRM) with environmental sustainability is described as green human resource management (GHRM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Renwick et al., 2013)</ref>. GHRM has emerged as a new research trend <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Jabbour &amp; Dee Sousa Jabbour, 2016)</ref>, provides a competitive edge and is a success factor for organizational strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Garzella &amp; Fiorentino, 2014)</ref>. It is one of the key tools that helps organizations to incorporate green strategies into their business models. It plays a substantial role in building environmental sustainability in organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Schuler &amp; Jackson, 2014)</ref>. GHRM practices involve using HRM policies to support the sustainable use of organizational resources and to corporate sustainability (CS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Amjad et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>CS is a vibrant business strategy that utilizes sustainability practices to achieve shareholders' goals and satisfy stakeholders. CS broadly refers to "company's activities demonstrating the inclusion of social and environmental concerns in business operations and in interactions with stakeholders" <ref type="bibr">(van Marrewijk &amp; Werre, 2003, p. 107)</ref>. It involves creating environmental, social and economic value <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Mio et al., 2022)</ref>. This study focuses on corporate environmental sustainability (CES) and corporate social sustainability (CSS); the latter has not been thoroughly explored in organizational contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahi &amp; Searcy, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>CES is significant to economic development <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Li et al., 2020)</ref>. It is essential to align HRM functions with the environmental management system to achieve organization's environmental sustainable goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Ren et al., 2018)</ref>. CES improves environmental performance, provides a sustainable competitive edge <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Goyal et al., 2018)</ref>, and enhances CSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Landorf, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Competition among organizations prompts them to focus on incorporating social sustainability in their business <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Vachon &amp; Mao, 2008)</ref>. However, information regarding CSS is scare as the topic has been not adequately investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Taticchi et al., 2013)</ref> and needs more exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Popovic et al., 2018)</ref> especially from the GHRM perspective.</p><p>CSS's impact on business has been under investigated in corporate culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Schonborn et al., 2019)</ref>. However, the literature has underlined a scarcity of empirical evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Galbreath, 2010)</ref> regarding the relationship between CSS and corporate success. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Schonborn et al., 2019)</ref>. Organizations that care for society and their employees, build a good reputation in society. Moreover, dealing with employees in a socially sustainable way is one of the pathways for an organization to cope with labor market challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ehnert, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Organizations desire to be the first choice of job aspirants and try to attract the best talent. Appealing to talented and experienced employees is the primary task in the "war of talent." Therefore, to attract potential employees, organizations, focus on employer branding and with the aimed at making the organization an "employer of choice" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Armstrong, 2006)</ref>. The image and reputation of an organization are called employer branding. For organizations, employer branding becomes important as they are enthusiastic about attracting, developing, and retaining the right talent <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kashive et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Limited studies in the GHRM literature emphasis on CSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Amrutha &amp; Geetha, 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Pham et al. (2019)</ref> suggest that future studies must look into the relatioinship between GHRM practices, and candidate attraction. Additionally, there is a substantial gap in the literature developing GHRM practices and introducing a new comprehensive framework to rank enablers of GHRM practices, particularly in developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Mehrajunnisa et al., 2021)</ref>. Generally, in developing countries, insufficient consideration is given to CSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Huq et al., 2014)</ref>, and CSS has not attracted as much attention as CES <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Silva et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Yawar &amp; Seuring, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>This study aims to identify the research gaps and propose a model based on the theoretical framework of competitive advantage and signaling theories. The model confirms that GHRM is also a source of employer branding. Further CES and CSS can be achieved by introducing GHRM practices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">| This study makes numerous contributions to literature</head><p>First, it contributes to the literature regarding the perceived GHRM role in shaping prospective employee outcomes, which is nearly nonexistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chaudhary, 2020)</ref>. Partial literature regarding GHRM primarily connects it to the existing employee outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Shen et al., 2018)</ref>. Previous studies have not explored how GHRM is a source of branding for an organization to attract potential employees. This study covers this and extends the GHRM literature.</p><p>Second, it extends the literature on CSS which is insufficiently investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahi &amp; Searcy, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Taticchi et al., 2013)</ref>. We also respond to the scholarly call made by <ref type="bibr">Staniškiené and Stankevičiuté (2018)</ref> that future research should cover social sustainability. Third, based on competitive edge theory, this study confirms that an organization that implements GHRM has an edge over its competitors and that GHRM is a source of employer branding. Fourth, this study draws on signaling theory that considers CSS as a factor that attracts potential employees.</p><p>Fifth, based on signaling theory this study shows that organizations that emphasize on CES and CSS have good public reputation, which is a factor that attracts potential employees. Sixth, this study answer <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Amjad et al. (2021)</ref> to conduct more studies on Pakistan's textile industry relating to GHRM practices.</p><p>Seventh, previous studies explored antecedents and barriers in GHRM, whereas this study focuses on the impact of GHRM practices. Last, the mediating role of CES and CSS has not been studied before. This study's theoretical framework built on the arguments from the competitive advantage and signaling theories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">| Competitive advantage theory</head><p>A competitive advantage is an organization's advantage over competitors in a given market, strategic group or industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kay, 1993)</ref>. An organization may have many advantages over others, such as a improved production system or an ability to provide exceptional customer service <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Coyne, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>Competitive advantage theory delivers a sophisticated tool for evaluating competitiveness with all its implications. According to this theory, organizations compete in international markets and to gain a competitive edge in the international market. Therefore, organizations need to sustain their competitive advantage. Green innovation is a source of an organization's competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen et al., 2006)</ref> and smart companies use environmental strategies to gain a competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Esty &amp; Winston, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ambec (2017)</ref> argued that green industrial policy could improve green competitive advantage. Protecting the environment and creating awareness regarding green production through eco-labeling can improve an organization's competitiveness. Green production serves as competitive edge for organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Zameer et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Competitive advantage theory further states that businesses should pursue policies that create highquality products that can be sold in the market at high prices. Competitive advantage rests on the notion that cheap labor is pervasive and natural resources are not essential for a good economy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barney (1991)</ref> suggested that the resources that are simultaneously scarce and valuable can create a competitive advantage, and if these resources are also difficult to duplicate, substitute and hard to deliver, they can sustain the advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Wang et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Competitive advantage can help stay ahead of present or potential competition. Thus, superior performance via competitive advantage will ensure market leadership. Organizations gain competitive advantages by focusing on human, physical, knowledge, capital and infrastructure resources. Therefore, in this study, we assume that organizations implementing GHRM can gain a competitive edge over their competitors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">| Signaling theory</head><p>This study uses signaling theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Spence, 1973)</ref> as a broader lens. Signaling theory gives a message of effective signal crating and has considerable promise for branding research <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Nyagadza et al., 2021)</ref>. The theory refers communication by organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bergh et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Connelly et al., 2011)</ref> and is presented as an approach to advance the study of HRM processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Guest et al., 2021)</ref>. At its core, it is concerned with the roles of the signaler, the signal, and the receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Guest et al., 2021)</ref>. The theory describes the process through which a sender attempts to convince the intended receivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Berger, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>According to this theory organizations (signaler), via their behavior and their business practices deliver a message (signal) to the general population (receiver), based on which the general population makes assumptions about the organizations. These business practices serve as a branding tool for organizations. In doing so, we disclose how signaling theory offers novel and hitherto mainly neglected perspectives on the HRM process.</p><p>Outsiders, deemed external stakeholders of the organizations, tend to gain more information on inside operations "signals" <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Perkins &amp; Hendry, 2005)</ref>. Signaling theory suggests that negative or positive information when illustrated by a signaler will be useful to a receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kirmani &amp; Rao, 2000)</ref>. The signal is either new information or in addition to previously held information by a receiver. The signal itself is significant, but for the receiver to show interest, it must be of significant quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Connelly et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>From the HRM perspective, signaling theory indicates that job seekers get information about the organizational culture, workplace atmosphere, and leadership of the organization, this information builds an image of organization in their minds. Job seekers create image of an organization into their minds based on this information. Based on such images job seekers categorize organizations. Just like how organizations try to get the best available human resource, employees are also keen to work for the best organization. Therefore, organizational practices are a source of signals for potential employees. If these signals are strong, more employees are interested in applying for jobs.</p><p>Organizations that carry out GHRM and engage in environmental and social sustainability are likely to attract potential employees due to certain organizational characteristics and traits. For example, they may be positively view such organizations dedicated to the natural environment as a good corporate citizens. Applicants then recognize that organization is concerned about the natural environment, workplace safety, and society, it should offer valuable concentration on the employees and their welfare. Thus, organizations anticipate improving their external prestige by sharing information on their green working environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Amaya et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">| LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>GHRM is a set of specific HRM practices that empower and sustain a proactive attitude toward environmental management and the accomplishment of high-performance outcomes concerning CES and other business objectives. GHRM practices accelerate information sharing and the formation of alliances with employees to advance a proactive natural environmental strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Aragón-Correa et al., 2013)</ref>. GHRM is believed to have a holistic view to associating employees with the organization's environmental strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Mishra et al., 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">| Relationship between GHRM and CES</head><p>GHRM practices are aligned with environmental sustainability goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Jackson et al., 2011)</ref>. GHRM designs and implements HRM practices to achieve organizations' environmental goals and employee behavior to improve organizational environmental performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Ren et al., 2018)</ref>. Organizations achieve environmental sustainability goals through employee green behavior (DuBois &amp; Debois, 2012; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Goyal et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Implementing GHRM policies and practices contribute toward environment conservation, by making, employees work toward the accomplishing the organization's green goals. Promotions and rewards based on employee green performance inspire employees to engage in and promote green activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Renwick et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dumont et al. (2017)</ref> also endorsed these arguments in the case of Chinese employees; the researchers stated that GHRM directly and indirectly influences green behaviors by creating a psychological green climate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Saeed et al. (2019)</ref> affirmed that GHRM practices positively affect on employee pro-environmental behaviors.</p><p>GHRM practices involve focusing on candidates' environmental values in the recruitment and selection process, providing environmental awareness and management training, encouraging employee involvement in environmental management and considering employee green performance and behaviors during the appraisal and reward process <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Tang et al., 2018)</ref>. By implementing GHRM policies organizations build a sustainable environment at the workplace. Moreover, GHRM practices influence employee green behaviors which is expected to lead to organizational green culture, where employees adopt green habits in their daily routines <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dumont et al., 2017)</ref>. Thus, we assume that by adopting a GHRM practices, Pakistan textile industry will attain CES which will provide it with a competitive advantage.</p><p>Therefore, based on competitive advantage theory, we purpose. H1. GHRM is positively related to CES.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">| Relationship between CES and CSS</head><p>Environmental management has become a key management research area <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Guerci et al., 2016)</ref>. In the corporate world, environmental sustainability has gained increasing momentum <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Edoho, 2008)</ref>. Additionally, increased consumer pressure to enhance environmental sustainability has catalyzed the advancement and execution of corporate strategies to reduce the environmental impacts of the products and services offered by organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Smith &amp; Perks, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Environmental initiatives increase employee awareness regarding improving the environmental efficiency of processes (e.g., reduction in consumption levels and residues, improved waste sorting and handling) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Granly &amp; Welo, 2014)</ref>. CES is achieved by implementing clean technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hohnen &amp; Hasle, 2011)</ref>. Organizations that focus on environmental sustainability take initiatives by introducing clean technologies. With the help of green technologies, they make their work environment safe for employees and society. Thus, CES leads to CSS.</p><p>CSS can be accomplished when a project works harmoniously agreeably with the environment while diminishing social disparities and distinction and enhancing personal satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Enyedi, 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chiu (2003)</ref> describes CSS as an aspect that contributes to the enlightening and sustaining the human welfare.</p><p>Socially sustainable organizations ensure appropriate labor conditions, offer a hazard free and safe environment, offer equal opportunities, promote cultural diversity, and engage in social innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Spangenberg &amp; Omann, 2006)</ref>. Thus, CES is a source of CSS. We assume that when Pakistan's textile industry cares for the environment, they are concerned about society and not just their profits.</p><p>Therefore, based on competitive advantage theory we propose that.</p><p>H2. CES is positively related to CSS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">| Relationship between CSS and employer branding</head><p>CSS is a way which a society is formed based on people's wants and needs. The process helps provide social amenities, which promote participation in social and cultural efforts among residents and serves as a place for personal development <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Woodcraft et al., 2011)</ref>. When an organization engages in human welfare and offers equal opportunities to everyone, it builds a good societal reputation. An organization that deals with its employees in a socially sustainable way; paves the way for organizations to cope with labor market challenges such as labor force shortages, employee resentment or turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ehnert, 2011)</ref>. Additionally, a socially sustainable organization provides a safe working environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Luo, 2020)</ref> making the organization stand out.</p><p>Organizational uniqueness becomes a source of employer branding for existing and potential employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Love &amp; Singh, 2011)</ref>. Organizations attract prospective employees by nurturing a conducive organizational culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kupper et al., 2020)</ref>. Employer branding creates an organization's brand knowledge that influences job seekers, influences job search and choice along with employees work motivation and retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kupper et al., 2020</ref>). An organization's social strategy is one of the crucial factors attracting prospective employees to apply for a job.</p><p>Job seekers collect information regarding an organization's activities and description to understand how organizations treat their employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Jones &amp; Willness, 2013)</ref>. Furthermore, organizations with positive green signals can attract job seekers <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Jabbour, 2011)</ref>. Thus, branding is an effective method to attract and select potential employees who are positive about CSS. Therefore, we assume that if Pakistan's textile industry is conscious of society, it can create good will in the market and signal to all stakeholders that it cares about both profit and society, these signals become a source of its branding. Therefore, based on signaling theory, we propose that.</p><p>H3. CSS is positively related to employer branding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">| Mediating role of CES</head><p>CES has emerged as an important strategic issue for every organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Edoho, 2008)</ref>. Stakeholder awareness and regulatory bodies' strict laws regarding environmental issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Tan et al., 2010</ref>) push organizations to focus on GHRM to attain environmental sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Renwick et al., 2013)</ref>. Organizations fulfill environmental responsibilities to strengthen their market position <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brammer et al., 2012)</ref> and organizational investment in environmental management reduces environmental disasters <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kassinis &amp; Vafeas, 2006)</ref>. GHRM focuses on implementing a clean work environment and this green working environment leads to CSS. If Pakistan's textile industries adopt GHRM practices it will help the industry thus, the environment impacts society.</p><p>Thus, we propose that.</p><p>H4. CES mediates the relationship between GHRM and CSS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">| Mediating role of CSS</head><p>Organizations have started recognizing the need to incorporate social sustainability into their business due to increased competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Vachon &amp; Mao, 2008)</ref> and CSS is considered a cornerstone for every business <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Popovic et al., 2018)</ref>. The Global Reporting Initiative classified CSS into four sub-categories: labor practices and decent work, human rights, society and product responsibility. A strong sustainable approach will attract new talent <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Phillips, 2007)</ref>. CES pushes organizations to focus on a safe working environment, thus reducing the number of occupational accidents and providing a safe working environment to satisfy the existing employees and attract potential employees.</p><p>Socially sustainable organizations ensure labor rights, offer good working conditions, wages and focus on equity and social welfare <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hutchins &amp; Sutherland, 2008)</ref>. They adopt workplace safety practices, which are also a source of work efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Haas &amp; Yorio, 2016)</ref>. Furthermore, a socially responsible organization offers a discrimination free working environment and is concerned about occupational health and work life balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Sorribes et al., 2021)</ref>. Additionally, a socially sustainable organization concerned about society and actively engages in societal welfare programs. When an organization offers a safe working environment to its employees, engages in human welfare and offers equal opportunities to everyone, it has a good reputation in society. Thus, when an organization focuses on CES, its increases workplace safety and offers employees a healthy working environment. When Pakistan's textile industries care about the environment and adopt operations that do not harm the environment, this will impact society. When society knows that organizations care about it and the environment, it builds a positive image and becomes a source of employer branding (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Thus, we propose that.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">| Importance of the textile sector in Pakistan</head><p>The survey concentrated on textile sector because it is the backbone of Pakistan's economy, and is the second major contributor to the export income <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Amjad et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Ortolano et al., 2014)</ref>. The literature suggests that the textile sector of developing countries face diverse environmental problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Rehman et al., 2016)</ref>. However, developing countries like Pakistan face challenges in executing environmental regulations due to factors such as, lack of resources and consent from officials <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Amjad et al., 2021)</ref>. The biggest challenge for the Pakistani textile industry is how to reduce its environmental burdens to meet international standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Muneer et al., 2006)</ref>. Additionally, disaster in Pakistan's textile industry, for example, Karachi Baldia town factory incident affects the social environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Fontana et al., 2021)</ref>. In Pakistan, this sector is facing a challenge in meeting global environmental standards and international buyers switch to other countries because of environmental issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Amjad et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Muneer et al., 2006)</ref>. These all are the primary factors that motivated this research on GHRM practices in the textile sector of Pakistan, while also covering environmental and social sustainability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">| Procedure and sample</head><p>Data collection was done through a survey questionnaire filled by employees working in the production department of the textile sector in Pakistan. Two professionals working in Pakistan's textile industry and two academicians reviewed the questionnaire, to detect wording, content and obscurity problems before the survey execution. Some minor modifications were recommended in the questionnaire. First, the researchers contacted the HR department of textile mills in Pakistan and briefed them about the purpose of the study. After they agreed to participate, a total of 600 questionnaires were distributed to full-time employees working as line managers, managers and departmental heads. A total of 329 usable questionnaires were received, a 54.83% response rate. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the response rate. Respondents' demographics are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The time-lagged design was adopted to gather data at two time points with a lag of 2 weeks to minimize the potential common method bias. In the first time point (T1), data concerning demographic details, GHRM and CES were gathered. Data regarding, CSS and employer branding were collected in the second time point (T2). The study methodology follows that used by previous researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carmeli et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Javed et al., 2018)</ref>. Self-generated identification codes were employed (e.g., grandfather's name) to match the two different surveys completed by employees and maintain privacy and confidentiality.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">| Measures</head><p>Items used in this study were adapted from previously published studies. These items' reliability and validity have already been tested, so they serve a valuable source for data collection. All items were scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from '1' "strongly disagree" to '5' "strongly agree." GHRM was measured by six items taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dumont et al. (2017)</ref> and CES was measured by three items adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Severo et al. (2015)</ref>. CSS was adapted from the 15 items scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Mani et al. (2018)</ref>. Finally, employer branding was measured by the 14 items scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Sivertzen et al. (2013)</ref>. Items used in this study are given in Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">| DATA ANALYSIS</head><p>Smart PLS version 3.2.7 was used to examine the measurement and structural model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">| Assessment of the measurement model</head><p>The measurement model was assessed to confirm the measurement items validity and reliability (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). In the first step, the loadings, average variance extracted (AVE), and composite reliability (CR) were assessed to confirm the measurement model convergent validity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The loadings of each item should be at least 0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. Therefore, items with a loading of less than 0.5 were deleted, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. We further, examined CR and AVE to assess the measurement model <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>. For all the constructs, the CR values were above 0.7 the recommended value <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. Finally, the AVEs were used to assess the convergent validity. AVE scores of 0.5 or greater are acceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>. The results confirm for all the constructs AVE scores were above 0.5, thus fulfilling the minimum threshold as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. The loadings of each item should be at least 0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. Therefore, items with a loading of less than 0.5 were deleted, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. We further, examined CR and AVE to assess the measurement model <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>. For all the constructs, the CR values were above 0.7 the recommended value <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. Finally, the AVEs were used to assess the convergent validity. AVE scores of 0.5 or greater are acceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>. The results confirm for all the constructs AVE scores were above 0.5, thus fulfilling the minimum threshold as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.</p><p>Discriminant validity of the measurement model is assessed through heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT), HTMT value less than 0.9 is acceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Henseler et al., 2015)</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, the values of HTMT were all lower than the 0.90. It can be concluded that measurement model's convergent and discriminant validity is confirmed in this study (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>).   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">| Assessment of the structural model</head><p>The direct and indirect effects of all the hypotheses were tested using partial least squares-structural equational modeling (PLS-SEM) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">| RESULTS</head><p>Analysis of the direct effect results confirms that GHRM is significantly positively related to CES(β = 0.650, p &lt; 0.005), therefore, H1 is accepted as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>. The GHRM approach is involved in modifying HRM culture, structure, strategies, and organizational policies toward protecting the environment, thus improving organizational environmental efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Amjad et al., 2021)</ref>. This result confirms the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Amjad et al. (2021)</ref>. CES is significantly positively related to CSS (β= 0.671, p &lt; 0.005); thus, H2 is supported as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>. When the organization is careful regarding environmental issues, it shows that it cares for society. To the best of the researcher's knowledge, this is the first study that tests this relationship. CSS has a significant positive relationship with employer branding (β = 0.807, p &lt; 0.005). Thus, hypothesis H3 is accepted as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>. Caring for society creates good will for an organization and thus serves as a source of organization branding. This relationship was not explored before.  Using the bootstrapping option in PLS-SEM we tested the mediating effect. As suggested by Hayes (2013), a sample of 5000 bootstraps with 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals was selected. The result of the analysis for the mediating effect shows that CES mediates the relationship between GHRM and CSS (β = 0.436, p &lt; 0.005) as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>. Thus, H4 is accepted. This confirms that when an organization adopts GHRM practices it will achieve CES, which is a source of CSS. The relationship between CES and employer branding mediated by CSS (β = 0.542, p &lt; 0.05) is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>. Hence, H5 is accepted. Thus, we conclude that CS is a source of CSS, which is a source of employer branding for an organization. Further CSS and CES mediate the relationship between GHRM and employer branding (β = 0.352, p &lt; 0.05) as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>. Hence, H6 is accepted.</p><p>The current study results analyzed GHRM significance from an employer branding perspective, CES and CSS perspectives and CSS significance from an employer branding perspective. Thus, the study enriches the literature on GHRM and its impacts on CES, CSS, and employer branding. The results confirmed that GHRM has a significant positive impact on CES. Further, GHRM also has a positive influence on CES suggesting that it helps organizations to maintain environmental sustainability. Previous studies regarding GHRM focus on employee's performance. However, GHRM effects on CES were unexplored in organizational behavior research. <ref type="bibr">Ren-wick et al. (2013)</ref> confirmed GHRM influences environmental performance. Further, researchers recommend that GHRM enhances employee environmental knowledge, and this employee knowledge improves environmental performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Longoni et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Vidal-Salazar et al., 2012)</ref>. Organizations concern toward a green environment inclines employees to work in an environmentally friendly way <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Harvey et al., 2013)</ref> making the workplace environmentally sustainable.  Jackson and Seo (2010) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jabbour (2011)</ref> confirmed that HR plays a crucial role in achieving CES. However, the variance explained by CES (R 2 = 42.2%) confirms a weak effect as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref>. The results confirmed that GHRM has a large effect on the CES, that is, f 2 = 0.731 as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">9</ref>. This effect size concludes that organization GHRM plays a vital role in achieving CES.</p><p>CES makes organization's environment clean and builds a safe climate within organizations. Therefore, organizations that focus on CES are more inclined toward a socially sustainable environment. This relationship was not explored in earlier studied. Regarding H2, this study's results confirmed a positive relationship between CES and CSS. This confirms that when an organization is concerned about the environment it also helps organization to create a safe working environment and reduces the chances of any hazards. The variance explained by CSS is R 2 = 45.1% which confirms a weak effect as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref>. Furthermore, the effect size f 2 = 0.820 is large as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">9</ref>.</p><p>CSS is one of the factors of employer branding. Regarding the H3, the results of this study confirmed a positive association between organizational safety climate and employer branding. When potential employees observe that an organization takes care of employees and society this builds, a positive organizational image and people take pride in being a part of that organization. The variance explained by employer branding R 2 = 65.1% confirms a moderate effect as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref>. Meanwhile, the effect size of CSS on employer branding is large f 2 = 1.868 as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">9</ref>. This confirms that CSS has a strong influence on employer branding and is one of the factors that attracts job aspirants.</p><p>Regarding H4, this study confirms the mediating role of CES in the relationship between GHRM and CSS. GHRM focuses on CES which leads to CSS. To achieve CES, organizations need to focus on GHRM <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Jackson &amp; Seo, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Renwick et al., 2013)</ref>. The mediating effect of CES has not been explored before.</p><p>Regarding H5, this study confirms the mediating role of CSS in the relationship between CES and employer branding. Organizations concerned about CSS pay attention to society's welfare and focus on providing a safe working environment and equal opportunities which leads to employer branding. As a result, potential employees search for jobs in organizations that provides a safe working environment and growth opportunities and have good societal reputation. Our results confirm the finding of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Clarke and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ward (2006) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">DeJoy et al. (2004)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding H6, this study confirms the mediating role of CES and CSS in the relationship between GHRM and employer branding. Organizations implementing GHRM practices confirmed that they are concerned about CES, which leads to CSS. CSS in turn leads to employer branding. Such GHRM practices differentiate the organization from others. This unique working practice is a source of branding to attract job aspirants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">| Societal implications</head><p>Organization that focus on providing a green work environment fulfill corporate social responsibilities, and their practices help the importance of a green environment in society. Moreover, these practices also provide a competitive advantage as job aspirants prefer to work in such organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">| Theoretical implications</head><p>This research has several theoretical implications. First, it contributes to the GHRM field by establishing the fact that CSS is an important construct to attract potential employees. This study is different from the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Amjad et al. (2021)</ref> as it emphasizes on CES and CSS and considers them sources of employer branding, whereas Amjad et al. (2021) studied impact of GHRM practices on CES. Second, this study confirms the mediating role of CES as it was not examined in previous studies. Third, this study contributes to the literature on CSS by confirming that CES is one of the factors that create a social sustainability for an organization.</p><p>Fourth, it contributes to the literature on employer branding by confirming that CSS is vital in attracting potential employees. Fifth, it also contributes to the literature on employer branding by studying the impact of GHRM on employer branding. Sixth, this study contributes to the competitive edge theory, by showing that organizations that implement GHRM gain a competitive edge over their competitors and GHRM becomes a source of attraction for the potential employees. Seventh, this study contributes to signaling theory by showing that when an organization implements GHRM and focuses on CES, it makes the working environment green and safe, giving positive signals to the existing employees and potential employees and society. Last, this study contributes to social identity theory by highlighting that organizations concerned about CES will also give special consideration to their employees. Their identity is a source of attraction for potential employees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">| Practical implications</head><p>One important practical implication of this study is that employees need psychologically safe working conditions and a physically safe environment free from hazards and harm to their bodies and health. Employees of textile mills in Pakistan face many problems in this regard. However, one of the major issues earlier studies ignored was a hazard free working environment, which this study covered.</p><p>GHRM helps organizations to build a clean and pollution free environment proving an appealing atmosphere to employees. A green working environment makes the environment inside an organization natural and creates a safe workplace for employees. Every employee desires to work in an organization with less safety risk and an appealing atmosphere. Employees resist, express their discontent and even go on strikes when they feel their health is at risk in the workplace. This can cause serious financial loss. Focusing on GHRM, organizations provide an environment friendly and safe working atmosphere inside the organization increasing employee satisfaction and productivity. Furthermore, the results confirmed that GHRM plays an important role in attracting employees. Therefore, the study recommends that organizations focus on GHRM to attract and retain potential employees.</p><p>Organizational practice and its employees play a vital role in branding. Employees who are satisfied with the organizations' workplace practices, feel that their organization is different from others. When an organization has a positive image in society, employees take pride in being a part of that organization. When employees share positive feedback about their organization, they build a positive image and serve as a source of attraction for job aspirants.</p><p>This study indicates that GHRM builds a sustainable environment. Therefore, organizations need to focus on GHRM to develop CES in the organization. Additionally, considering the importance of a green environment, organization must focus on implementing GHRM. Second, organizations need to emphasize CSS. Third, organizations should design programs for the welfare of their employees and society. Finally, they should create a win-win situation by focusing on both environmental and social dimensions.</p><p>Additionally, organizations need to establish a safety department responsible for organizational safety. Employees of this department should be trained in firefighting, CPRC and other medical training so that losses can be minimized in case of any emergency or hazards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">| CONCLUSION</head><p>This study confirms that CSS is an important construct in organizational behavior by considering a competitive edge and signaling theories. By implementing GHRM, organization can gain a competitive edge which helps them to attract potential employees. Furthermore, GHRM helps in implementing CES. CES helps in building social sustainable environment within the organization which is a source of attraction for job aspirants and provides a competitive edge.</p><p>This study also has some limitations which provide scope for future studies. This research is limited to the textile sector. Future research can extend findings to other sectors for example, the chemical and petroleum industries. In this study, CSS was discussed as a factor of employer branding. Future studies can extend the findings by collecting data from employees at grass root level and can consider adding other variables like environmental leadership or other organizational factors. Further, this research was conducted in a developing country. Thus, its generalizability is limited. It is suggested that future studies to be conducted in developed countries to generalize the findings of this research, as developing economies are different from developed ones in terms of technology, labor force and institutional environment. Future studies may also include a cross-cultural research design or consider the effects of cultural factors in identifying to make our findings more generalizable.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1 The hypothesized model [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]</figDesc><graphic coords="8,70.50,445.50,450.75,64.50" type="bitmap" /></figure>
