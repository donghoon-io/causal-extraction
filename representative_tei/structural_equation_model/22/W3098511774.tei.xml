<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Objective: The study sought to develop and empirically validate an integrative situational privacy calculus model for explaining potential users' privacy concerns and intention to install a contact tracing mobile application (CTMA). Materials and Methods: A survey instrument was developed based on the extant literature in 2 research streams of technology adoption and privacy calculus. Survey participants (N ¼ 853) were recruited from all 50 U.S. states. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to validate and test the model. Results: Individuals' intention to install a CTMA is influenced by their risk beliefs, perceived individual and societal benefits to public health, privacy concerns, privacy protection initiatives (legal and technical protection), and technology features (anonymity and use of less sensitive data). We found only indirect relationships between trust in public health authorities and intention to install CTMA. Sex, education, media exposure, and past invasion of privacy did not have a significant relationship either, but interestingly, older people were slightly more inclined than younger people to install a CTMA. Discussion: Our survey results confirm the initial concerns about the potentially low adoption rates of CTMA. Our model provides public health agencies with a validated list of factors influencing individuals' privacy concerns and beliefs, enabling them to systematically take actions to address these identified issues, and increase CTMA adoption. Conclusions: Developing CTMAs and increasing their adoption is an ongoing challenge for public health systems and policymakers. This research provides an evidence-based and situation-specific model for a better understanding of this theoretically and pragmatically important phenomenon.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The nature and scale of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic make digital tracing necessary for the mitigation of one of the most widespread and deadly pandemics the world has ever seen.</p><p>Between April and June 2020, several countries, including Australia, India, and the United Kingdom, rolled out official contact tracing mobile applications (CTMAs). There are also other countries, most notably Brazil and the USA, as well as several technology vendors, in-cluding Google and Apple in a joint effort, that have expressed their intentions to release COVID-19 contact tracing technologies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> As an example of the critical applications of public health informatics in the system response to COVID-19, 2 the purpose of a CTMA is to automate the laborious process of contact tracing, in which public health authorities (PHAs) seek to control the spread of COVID-19 by identifying people who have been in contact with an infected person and then providing users with information regarding testing and selfquarantine. CTMAs can provide healthcare workers and government officials with data necessary not only to flatten the curve of infections and hospitalizations, but to also understand the spread of the virusan important insight for mitigating future viral outbreaks. Nevertheless, it is not clear how well adopted the CTMAs will be.</p><p>Given the recent privacy-loss events involving mobile apps and geolocation services, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> privacy advocates have elevated their message, including warning citizens about the dangers associated with apps designed to aid in the fight against COVID-19. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> These warnings, combined with the general desire for privacy shared by most mobile users, jeopardize the efficacy of CTMAs-but how, and to what extent? Convincing individuals to participate and install these applications is a hurdle for PHAs and tech providers (eg, Apple, Google). Individuals must install one of these applications to become part of the system. Computer modeling by the University of Oxford showed that a CTMA could be effective in combating the spread of COVID-19, if nearly 60% of the population installed and used it <ref type="bibr">(Wright, 2020 6</ref> ). However, many individuals may not adopt the applications because of privacy concerns -Singapore's contact tracing app was reportedly adopted by only 10%-20% of the population, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> and despite the initial enthusiasm and 40% download target, as of June 2020, the COVID-Safe app had been adopted only by around 25% of Australians. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Low adoption rates will inevitably erode the value of the system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Extensive research has been conducted on the adoption of information technologies (ITs), and various influencing factors have been investigated in this decision process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Researchers have examined individuals' attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, effort and performance expectancies, and social influence related to adoption in various healthcare contexts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> However, despite their importance, especially in the context of public health systems, the role of privacy concerns and perceived benefits (shared societal and individual benefits) have not received enough empirical attention in this research stream. This study aims to extend the existing literature and theoretical frameworks of information privacy in IT adoption by exploring the role of technological, legal, and social factors that affect privacy concerns, and perceptions of risks and benefits in the context of CTMA adoption. More specifically, we ask the following questions:</p><p>• Research Question 1: Do the perceived benefits (individual or societal benefits) that come from using CTMA alleviate individuals' concerns regarding the risk of using these apps? • Research Question 2: Do individuals' information privacy concerns and their trust (or lack thereof) in PHAs influence their intention to install contact tracing apps? This study aims to answer these research questions by leveraging elements of situational privacy calculus theory and incorporating appropriate constructs and measures relevant to an individual's perspective when assessing potential CTMA installation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SITUATIONAL PRIVACY CALCULUS</head><p>This privacy-related decision-making process is referred to as a privacy calculus <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and has been studied extensively across a number of contexts, including mobile applications, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> health care, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and ecommerce. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> The privacy calculus perspective argues that individuals deliberately anticipate and weigh the privacy-related risks and benefits of information disclosure when they are faced with a situation that needs the provision of private information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> Within this literature, the conventional thought is that the privacy calculus is relatively stable, with similar risk-reward circumstances leading to similar privacy-related decision-making outcomes. However, more recently, the consensus among scholars is that privacy is situational and varies significantly from situation to situation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Given the unprecedented circumstances presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that the contemporary, situational privacy calculus perspective is most appropriate for our study.</p><p>Based on this background, we apply and contextualize privacy calculus theory to understand the situational trade-off between privacy-related risks and benefits in the important and unique context of CTMA installation (related to COVID-19) and its potential shared benefits toward public health, thereby strengthening and contributing to our theoretical understanding of the privacy calculus' nomological network. A list of previous studies on privacy calculus centering on privacy concerns is presented in Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESEARCH MODEL AND HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT</head><p>Our research model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) is based on the privacy calculus theory, which suggests that both perceived benefits and potential risks affect  for a review. Moreover, in line with calls for a paradigm shift in this stream, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> we explicitly focus on contextualized theories and digital technology features to explain IT adoption.</p><p>In the CTMA context, measuring behavioral intention, as a proxy for actual behavior, is justified <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> because of the very limited rollout of CTMA in most of the countries. Populations in these countries have not yet faced the decision of whether to install a CTMA; therefore, one cannot yet identify their actual behavior about using a CTMA. In the following subsections, the research hypotheses are constructed around different theoretically and practically important constructs that directly or indirectly affect behavioral intention to install a CTMA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Privacy calculus</head><p>In the privacy calculus theory, perceived privacy risk is the degree to which individuals believe there is a potential for loss associated with the release of personal information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> The other construct, perceived benefit, encompasses a wide range of financial and nonfinancial rewards in return for personal information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Based on this distinction, we modeled perceived benefits as a second-order construct comprising individual benefits (eg, improving one's living and working efficiency and effectiveness) and societal benefits (eg, protecting the public health and lifting the restrictions on economic activities). In the context of CTMA, we expect these 2 types of benefits to be in alignment. The main source of conflict, however, is the trade-off between these benefits and CTMA privacy risks, such as government surveillance and misuse of personal data. This tradeoff is the main determinant of the willingness or intent to provide personal information through a CTMA. Thus, following the wellestablished privacy calculus model, we hypothesize the following: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk determinants</head><p>We define CTMA privacy concerns as individuals' perceptions of the consequences of sharing information through a CTMA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Based on Malhotra et al's 21 model, privacy concerns impact trust and risk, which, in turn, shape the tendency to share personal information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> In the CTMA context, trusting beliefs refer to the degree to which individuals believe that the PHA releasing and controlling a CTMA is reliable in guarding their personal information collected through a CTMA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> Similarly, we define risk beliefs as perceptions that the release of personal information on a CTMA will expose it to potential data loss or misuse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> Drawing on this framework, we model CTMA information privacy concerns as having a positive effect on risk beliefs and a negative effect on trusting beliefs. Additionally, as individuals perceive a PHA controlling a CTMA as being trustworthy with their data, their beliefs about the risk associated with sharing contact tracing data with that PHA will dissipate. Finally, previous studies have shown that trusting beliefs directly affect behavioral intention to adopt technology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> Hence, we expect that the more individuals trust the PHA with their contact tracing data collected through a CTMA, the more likely they will be to adopt the app. Thus, we hypothesize the following: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Privacy protection initiatives</head><p>We have integrated the most pertinent factors shown to influence the perception of trust, and proposed that trusting beliefs of individuals are a function of expected outcomes of privacy protection initiatives, namely legal influences (regulatory expectations), and privacy protections. Trust is an important aspect in any relationship, in which the trustors cannot directly control the actions of the trustees (eg, PHAs), and as a result, there will be potential negative consequences if a party fails to deliver its promises. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> Therefore, it is critical to investigate the determinants of trustors' beliefs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> The regulatory affairs enforce the type of personal information that firms are allowed to collect from individuals, as well as the methods that stored personal information would be protected against misuse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> In a similar vein, privacy protection consists of technical practices and solutions that aim to protect online privacy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> Such privacy protection tools include privacy policy statements and the provision of privacy-enhancing mechanisms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> Trust can only exist if an individual believes that the trustees have the ability and initiatives to fulfill the promised services at the expected quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> In the context of CTMA, if individuals believe that the trustees (PHAs) have appropriate protection privacy practices, as well as compliance with privacy regulations, they are more likely to trust in PHAs, in order to share their personal information. Thus, we hypothesize the following: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technology features</head><p>We focus on 2 technology design choices, anonymity and information sensitivity, with impacts CTMA users' privacy concerns. Anonymity is defined as the ability to conceal an individual's real identity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> Anonymity, typically determined by technology features, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> can lead to less fear of social disapproval, surveillance, and evaluation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> Similarly, in the context of a CTMA, we expect that if individuals believe they can interact with the system anonymously, they will have less concern for privacy.</p><p>The second technology feature in our model is the use of sensitive information in a CTMA. We adopt Dinev et al's <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> definition of information sensitivity as a personal information attribute that informs the level of discomfort an individual perceives when disclosing specific personal information to a specific external agent (ie, a CTMA). In general, sharing more sensitive information with mobile apps causes individuals to be more concerned, because if the shared information is disclosed to third parties, they must deal with potentially harmful consequences (eg, identity theft). <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> For example. when a mobile app requests access to the device's GPS location, individuals pay more attention before granting such permission. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> Given the importance of anonymity and information sensitivity features, in Google and Apple's proposed contact tracing technology, users maintain full anonymity and do not need to register their personal information. Also, most of the proposed CTMAs use less sensitive (Bluetooth) proximity data as opposed to more sensitive (GPS location) data, despite the arguably higher precision and effectiveness of location data for contact tracing. Hence, we hypothesize: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technology adoption</head><p>In addition to privacy-related factors, we included in our model a set of constructs found to be powerful predictors of behavioral in-tention to adopt a technology. Performance expectancy is measured in our proposed situated privacy calculus model using the contextualized perceived benefits construct. Next, in line with Wang and Benbasat, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> effort expectancy is labeled as perceived effort and the latter's measures are adapted. Given the importance of voluntariness of the adoption (vs. an adoption mandated by the government or workplace), we followed Moore &amp; Benbasat's <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> seminal study and included voluntariness as a predictor of behavioral intention to install a CTMA. We also include social influence because, in situations that involve potentially adopting an emerging technology, consumers often rely on mimetic behavior and word of mouth to inform their decisions about whether to do so. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> Finally, based on the context (experimenting with mobile apps), we included personal innovativeness with IT. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> Hence, based on the extant body of literature, we hypothesize: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESEARCH DESIGN</head><p>To the research model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and its hypothesized relationships, we conducted a field survey of the U.S. citizens who may or may not choose to install a CTMA on their smartphones. The respondents were provided with general information on how CTMAs work along with a schematic representation. The survey was distributed via Qualtrics, resulting in 1528 responses, of which 856 responses remained after a few filtering questions ensuring participants had not already installed a CTMA on their smartphones, an attention check, and the removal of incomplete responses.</p><p>We developed the survey using previously validated measurement items that were operationalized with multiitem scales. A 7point Likert scale with anchors ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) was used to measure all of these key constructs. All the constructs of the measurement model were first-order reflective constructs with the exception of privacy concerns and benefits, which were treated as reflective second-order constructs. Measurement items included a few reverse-coded items to address the negative/positive connotation and associated bias. A pretest and pilot study were conducted to examine the appropriateness of the survey scales on a sample of 45 individuals. Participant recruitment was achieved by utilizing the services of a market research company-a professional panel service-that directed respondent panel members to our web-based survey. The data were collected in the U.S. between May 4 and 7, 2020. The resulting measurement items are presented in Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS</head><p>We used partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) through SmartPLS 3.0 software (SmartPLS, Palo Alto, CA) to assess the research model from a predictive perspective and used the latent variable scores in a follow-up analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> PLS-SEM is an appropriate approach for large complex models with many latent vari- For internal consistency, the values of Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability should be between 0.7 and 0.95. The evaluation of these estimates indicated that all of the constructs were within acceptable thresholds. Convergent validity can be assessed through the evaluation of average variance extracted values that should be above 0.5 for each composite. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> a ables. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> This study followed the state-of-the-art guidelines proposed by Hair et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> to assess measurement and structural models. The demographic descriptions of our sample of 853 individuals across 50 U.S. states are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p><p>Given the pragmatic importance of the dependent variable in this study, we report a histogram of the respondent's intention to install a CTMA. As evident in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref>, a large proportion (35%) of our sample expressed extremely low or very low levels of behavioral intention to install a CTMA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement model assessment</head><p>The reliability and validity of the measurement model were tested through the evaluation of loadings, internal consistency, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> According to Hair et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> all the items reported a loading greater than 0.708 except VOLU2 and SOINF1, which were subsequently removed from the measurement model. The assessment of internal consistency and convergent validity is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>.</p><p>Discriminant validity was tested based on the newly introduced criterion for establishing discriminant validity in PLS-SEM known as the heterotrait-monotrait criterion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> Cross-loadings of the items and heterotrait-monotrait 0.85 tables are provided in Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">3, 4</ref> and<ref type="table">5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural model assessment and hypothesis</head><p>Structural model evaluation includes evaluating collinearity among the exogenous constructs, examining the significance and relevance of path coefficients, and checking the model's predictive accuracy and relevance model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> The results of the structural model's evaluation are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>.</p><p>All hypotheses were supported, except for hypothesis 6, on the positive association between individuals' trusting beliefs and their intention to install a CTMA (path coefficient [b] ¼ 0.052, P ¼ .113). In terms of the explained variance provided by the research model, the privacy-related constructs (trust beliefs, risk beliefs, and benefits) and non-privacy-related constructs (personal innovativeness, voluntariness, perceived effort, and social influence) were able to explain 75% of the variance in individuals' intention to install a CTMA. The predictive relevance (Q 2 ) of intention to install a CTMA was obtained using a 2-stage approach with a value of 0.755, confirming the model had predictive relevance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> Overall, our extended model demonstrates strong explanatory power by explaining 75% of the variance in behavioral intention. It compares well with similar studies in other contexts. For example, Lazard et al's <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and Or et al's <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> models explained 41% and 53.9% of the variance in behavioral intention to use patient portals and web-based self-management technologies, respectively.</p><p>Five control variables, namely age, sex, education, media exposure, and past invasion of privacy, were tested. Individuals' age had a positive significant relationship with their intention (b ¼ 0.036, P &lt; .05), indicating that older people are more inclined than younger people to install a CTMA. The remaining control variables had no significant relationships with the intention to install a CTMA. To reduce the potential for common method bias, we followed procedural guidelines established in the literature that are presented in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post hoc analysis</head><p>We conducted multigroup analysis on age and sex to detect any significant differences in path coefficients of hypothesized relationships. The parametric test results indicate that there are significant differences in relationships between privacy concerns, trusting beliefs, and risk beliefs, as well as the relationship between voluntariness and intention among female and male groups. Findings indicate that female respondents are more worried about their privacy. In addition, the findings reveal the significant differences in relationships between anonymity and privacy concerns, as well as risk  beliefs, voluntariness, and intention to install a CTMA among younger and older respondents. The younger respondents are more concerned about their anonymity and voluntariness rights regarding CTMA installation. The results of post hoc analysis are presented in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Toward understanding the situational privacy calculus that individuals associate with the adoption of CTMAs in the fight to control the COVID-19 pandemic, we extended the existing privacy calculus models and found a range of individual, legal, and societal factors that carried weight. To the best of our knowledge, the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> have not investigated the individual, legal, and social factors affecting individuals' intentions in an integrated framework. In terms of how the perceived benefits associated with CTMAs could help in limiting any risk potential adopters may also associate with the apps, we found that they had a significant mitigating impact. Previous researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> have also discussed the situational trade-off of privacy-related risks and benefits and reported the significant role of perceived benefits in individuals' disclosure intention. This is likely the least surprising finding of this study in that it is consistent with the tenants of privacy calculus <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> yet it still tells us a lot about the situational thought process of CTMA adopters amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In this situation, there are clearly privacy risks being associated with the CTMAs, but their benefits are also clear and serve as a distinct motivation for intentions to install the CTMAs.</p><p>Interestingly, trust in PHAs was a significant factor in shaping the intentions of potential CTMA adopters to install the apps, but its influence was limited to the extent to which it was able to reduce the risks associated with the CTMAs. This tells us that PHAs have limits to what they can effectively promote. Constituents of PHAs are perhaps conditioned to expect information concerning their well-being and use it to help gauge their unique risk-benefit perspectives. This finding is in line with the findings of previous studies from various contexts that show that individuals' trusting beliefs play a critical role in shaping their risk beliefs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> However, our findings suggest that PHAs should develop trust among their constituents, not to motivate CTMA adoption, but rather to aid in the reduction of risk that they may associate with the apps. Any intentions for CTMA installation that individuals gain for the apps will be formed as an indirect consequence of such risk reduction. This study's findings also suggest that the information privacy concerns and trusting beliefs potential CTMA adopters have in their PHAs are direct products of the technology features of the CTMAs and the privacy protection initiatives of the authorities, respectively. In terms of trusting beliefs, the strongest influence was from perceptions of privacy protection. Similar to the findings of previous research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> we found that as an individual's feeling that their privacy will be protected increases, so too does their trust in the PHA's ability to handle their sensitive personal data. This likely helps explain why information sensitivity was by far the most important determinant of information privacy concerns. As the sensitivity of the information provided to a CTMA increases, so too does a potential CTMA adopter's concern for its privacy. It has also been widely recognized in the literature that the type of information collected and used by third parties affects the level of individuals' perceived discomfort and privacy concerns. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> Perhaps most interesting is the direct positive influence that regulatory expectations had on trusting beliefs. Prior research has also suggested that the implementation of privacy regulations helps to directly or indirectly increase individuals' trust and reduce their privacy concerns. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE</head><p>This research contributes to our understanding of determinants of privacy in crisis-driven situations, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Opportunities to explore and test models specific to privacy calculi in times of dire circumstances are rare, and this study provides a unique, timely perspective for understanding privacy as a situation-specific phenomenon; a perspective that has not yet been fully embraced within the academic community. Indeed, rather than approaching privacy as a stable, global concern, our findings point to a more specific, situational calculus that encompasses the influence of an individual, legal, and societal nature.</p><p>In times of crisis, we find an IT adoption privacy calculus that is focused on the agencies that seek to provide guidance and support for the public well-being through their recommendations for the adoption of a particular technology; yet, within this calculus, a premium is placed on how well the agencies are able to alleviate the risks associated with their adoption recommendations. The implications of this to researchers are that the technological features of a tool designed for public consumption are as important as ever, but how the public agencies that promote its use are able to gain the trust of their constituents is paramount to its adoption. Scholars should, therefore, extend their focus to include environmental factors, such as social influence, regulatory pressures, and previous experiences with privacy loss that underlie the technology adoption and appropriately weigh their influence.</p><p>The findings of this study also contribute to explaining the range of individuals' decisions in adopting CTMA. These decisions result mainly in shared public health benefits rather than individual benefits. The findings of this study also provide public health agencies with a validated list of factors influencing individuals' privacy concerns and beliefs, enabling them to systematically take action to address these identified issues. For example, our results confirmed the importance of regulatory protection expectations by individuals in shaping their CTMA adoption decision. This finding reaffirms the importance of the recently proposed U.S. bill to regulate CTMA to protect privacy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> A similar law was also passed in Australia, where strict penalties of up to 5 years of jail are established for those who collect, use, disclose, or decrypt CTMA data for any purpose other than contact tracing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS, LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH</head><p>In this study, we contextualized and validated privacy calculus theory in the context of an adoption decision of an emerging technology (CTMA) that presents unique privacy concerns to individuals in a pandemic. Our model provided an empirical analysis of the role of technology features, privacy protection initiatives, privacy concerns, risk beliefs, and individual and shared benefits in bringing about individuals' intention to install a CTMA. The results of this study provide strong support for the influence of risk beliefs and benefits on individuals' intention to install a CTMA but not a strong support for a direct impact of trust beliefs on individuals' intention.</p><p>A limitation of this research is its orientation at a single point in time. Owing to the progressive nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and our interest in conducting this research at the time of the introduction of COVID-19 CTMAs, we were not able to test how the progression of a treatment or vaccine would influence the adoption intentions or if the adoption decisions are market-driven. As the global and local economies start to recover, would people be more or less inclined to adopt CTMAs, and what economic factors would they look to in helping form that decision? These are all time-related insights that this study was unable to pursue but that future researchers should consider. The World Health Organization has referred to contact tracing as "the backbone of the response." <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> The adoption of CTMAs is no silver bullet to defeat COVID-19 but can have consequential importance in a country's public health response along with measures such as testing and isolating. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Hypothesis 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Risk beliefs negatively influence individuals' intention to install CTMA.
