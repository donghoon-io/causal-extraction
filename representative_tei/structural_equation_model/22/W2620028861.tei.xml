<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose: Despite widespread organisational adoption of e-procurement systems, we continue to witness disappointing performance outcomes from their implementation. This can be explained largely by the failure of many organisations to translate the initial adoption decision, made at an organisational level, into individual-level acceptance of e-procurement by an organisation's employees. This study examines the key antecedents of the Technology Acceptance Model for employees expected to use e-procurement systems in their day-to-day activities.</p><p>Design/methodology/approach In this study, we apply and extend the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to examine factors that influence acceptance of e-procurement by individual employees. Our focus is on the potential role of user-perceived e-procurement quality dimensions as antecedents to the TAM's cognitive mechanisms of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Our structural equation model uses survey data collected from 139 e-procurement users at a university in the Netherlands.</p><p>Findings: Our results confirm the core TAM relationships within an e-procurement context.</p><p>Extending the TAM model to explore antecedents, we find that the e-procurement quality dimensions of processing, usability, and professionalism impact the levels of individual employee e-procurement acceptance. Interestingly, the system level dimensions (processing and usability) appear to play a greater role than the support dimensions (professionalism) in these cognitive mechanisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical implications:</head><p>Our findings indicate that the need for e-procurement training and ongoing support may be lessened by initial effective design covering system navigation and system usability and by ensuring that an e-procurement system has expedient information and product flows between the buyer and supplier.</p><p>Originality/value: To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the TAM and, more critically, its antecedents within an e-procurement context. It is also the first to empirically validate this extended model. Finally, by shifting the focus from the more typical 3 organisational-level adoption to an individual employee acceptance unit of analysis, we provide a better understanding of how organisations can gain the most from investments in eprocurement and other similar e-Supply Chain Management (eSCM) technologies.</p></div>

Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Queenan et al (2011)</ref> demonstrate a clear relationship between perceptions and use of computerised physician order entry systems. Likewise, in the parallel business-to-consumer (B2C) context, a number of studies posit individual customer perceptions of e-service provision as a critical antecedent of behavioural intentions, actual behaviours in the form of loyalty, and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Boyer and Hult, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Heim and Field, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Venkatesh et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Within the broader field of information systems research, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is proposed as a cognitive framework that explains how perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness impact on individual usage intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Davis et al., 1989)</ref>. The advantage of an almost law-like model such as the TAM lies in the fact that parts of it can be assumed true, allowing room for deeper study of related constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Venkatesh et al., 2007)</ref>. In this study, we contribute to the discipline by examining the role individual employees' user perceptions of different aspects of e-procurement as antecedents to the TAM's cognitive mechanisms. Focusing on system and support dimensions of e-procurement provision delivered to employees (also termed 'internal customers'), our study examines the extent to which five dimensions of userperceived e-procurement quality -processing, content, usability, training, and professionalism (Brandon-Jones, 2017) -act as antecedents to e-procurement acceptance. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> illustrates the positioning of our research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: Study remit -examining antecedents of e-procurement acceptance</head><p>Our study makes a number of key contributions. For academics, we answer calls to explore antecedents to the TAM in order to gain a fuller understanding of the factors that influence its cognitive mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Karahanna et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Venkatesh et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Venkatesh and Bala, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Autry et al., 2010)</ref>. We contribute to both information systems and eSCM literature by applying a well-established theory, TAM, in a new context and by extending it with key antecedent constructs related to user-perceived e-procurement quality. In eSCM, we particularly bring the discussion from the previous organisational level adoption to individual employee-level acceptance of the technology. For practitioners, our study contributes to managers who are in the process of implementing e-procurement and similar multiuser technologies. Whilst the TAM alone has predictive ability, it does not provide sufficient managerial guidance on how to enhance individual acceptance of technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Autry et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Venkatesh et al. 2007)</ref>. Understanding the antecedents of user acceptance is crucial in supporting the roll-out of e-procurement systems once an initial organisational adoption decision has been made.</p><p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows. First, we develop our conceptual model of the relationships between e-procurement quality dimensions and the TAM, and present related hypotheses. We then detail our research methods before presenting our data analysis. The paper concludes with a discussion of our contributions to theory and practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Conceptual development and hypotheses</head><p>In this section, we develop hypotheses that consider e-procurement as a technology acceptance issue. We then examine the potential role of e-procurement quality dimensions as key antecedents to the TAM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">E-procurement as a technology acceptance issue</head><p>The last forty years has seen significant amounts of research examining the adoption (organisational-level) and acceptance (individual-level) of different technologies. Notable work includes the Theory of Reasoned Action <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975)</ref>, TAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Davis, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Davis et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Venkatesh and Davis, 2000)</ref>, Social Cognitive Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bandura, 1986)</ref>, Theory of Planned Behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>, Innovation Diffusion Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Rogers, 1983)</ref>, Model of PC Utilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Thompson et al., 1991)</ref>, and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. At a broad level, these models illustrate the relationships between attitudes towards technologies and other innovations, behavioural intent, actual organisational adoption and/or individual acceptance, and performance. At the individual level, the dependent variable studied has been constructed as either the behavioural intention or the actual acceptance behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Jeyaraj et al. 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The terms 'adoption' and 'acceptance' are often used almost synonymously in information systems research, without necessarily distinguishing between the two constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Venkatesh et al. 2007</ref>). Here specifically, we focus on the intention to use, and we frame our research based on the TAM, which is based on the Theory of Reasoned Action <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Venkatesh and Davis, 1996)</ref>. It is considered to be the most influential of the individual-level acceptance models and its explanation rates are comparably better than its alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Lee et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Venkatesh and Davis, 2006)</ref>. The TAM connects individuals' cognitive approval (acceptance) of the features of a technology to their behavioral intentions of use and consequently its actual usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Autry et al. 2010)</ref>. The core assumptions in the TAM are that an individual's usage of a technology is mediated by their acceptance of that technology, which in turn is determined by two cognitive factors, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Perceived usefulness (PU) is defined as the extent to which an individual believes that using the technology will help improve his/her job performance. Perceived ease of use (PEOU) is defined as the degree to which an individual believes that using a technology is free of effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Venkatesh and Bala, 2008)</ref>. If a technology is positively evaluated on these factors its usage will ensue <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Autry et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The TAM has been used in a variety of technology contexts and provides accepted and validated explanations to technology usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Marchand and Raymond, 2008)</ref>. However, its application within OM remains very limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(van Raaij and Schepers, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adomavicius et al. (2013)</ref> apply the TAM for evaluating decision aids for an economic mechanism in combinatorial auctions, but while their study is at the individual level, the test subjects are students rather than actual e-procurement users. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aboelmaged (2010)</ref> has used TAM to examine individual level intention to use e-procurement but surveyed purchasing managers, who can be considered as lead-users or even decision makers of the organisational adoption decision and are thus not typical of the total user population. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Autry et al. (2010)</ref> have used TAM in their analysis of supply chain technology but adapted the model from its usual individual level to analyse the firm itself. Thus, we consider it important to extend this theory to e-procurement acceptance at the user/employee level, where previous studies have typically been from a 'barriers and enablers' perspective of organisational-level adoption and have not used a clear theoretical framework. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> illustrates key work that has been undertaken at both organisational and individual employee levels of analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1: eSCM research examining organisational-level adoption and individual employeelevel acceptance of e-procurement</head><p>Step 1: Adoption of an e-procurement technology (managerial decision and investment to purchase technology)</p><p>Step 2: Acceptance of an e-procurement technology (individual employee acceptance and usage decision) In line with extant research, our first five hypotheses are fully consistent with the original TAM and several previous studies (see for example, <ref type="bibr">Moon and Kim, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Robinson et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">van der Heijden, 2003)</ref> and are therefore grouped together. Firstly, we hypothesise that an individual's intention to use an e-procurement technology is influenced by their attitude towards the technology (H1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Davis et al. 1989)</ref>. Furthermore, individuals' intentions to use a technology will be enhanced regardless of their attitude if the technology is expected to increase job performance, and previous research has found that PU directly impacts an individual's behavioural intention to use an online system <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aboelmaged, 2010)</ref>. Thus, we hypothesise that PU positively influences intention to use e-procurement (H2).</p><p>When a person recognizes the usefulness of a system such as e-procurement in improving their job efficiency, it will positively impact their attitude towards e-procurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aboelmaged 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, we hypothesise that PU positively influences an individual's attitude toward an eprocurement technology (H3) and PEOU will positively influence attitude (H4). Finally, and again in line with the original TAM model, we anticipate a direct effect of perceived ease of use on PU (H5) as improvements in ease of use may also be instrumental in enabling an individual to accomplish more work with the same effort. A technology that is easier to use will be seen as more useful <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bienstock et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Davis et al., 1989)</ref>.</p><p>H1: There is a positive relationship between attitude towards e-procurement and intention to use e-procurement H2: There is a positive relationship between perceived usefulness (PU) of eprocurement and intention to use e-procurement H3: There is a positive relationship between perceived usefulness (PU) of eprocurement and attitude towards e-procurement H4: There is a positive relationship between perceived ease of use (PEOU) of eprocurement and attitude towards e-procurement H5: There is a positive relationship between perceived ease of use (PEOU) of eprocurement and perceived usefulness of e-procurement</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">E-procurement quality as an antecedent to the TAM</head><p>Within the TAM, it is assumed that all effects of external variables are mediated by PU and PEOU <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adomavicius et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Karahanna and Straub, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Venkatesh and Bala, 2008;</ref>).</p><p>However, one of the enduring criticisms of the TAM is its failure to explicitly incorporate the various antecedents to the higher order constructs of PU and PEOU <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Autry et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Venkatesh et al., 2007)</ref>. Exploring such system and support antecedents provides the opportunity to gain deeper insights to the operational factors at play in acceptance or non-acceptance by individuals when faced with new technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Karahanna and Straub, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Karahanna et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Robinson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Venkatesh and Bala, 2008)</ref>. Here, we build on the exploratory empirical investigatio of individual user perceptions toward e-procurement system and support provision by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Brandon-Jones (2017)</ref>. In our study, we have examined how five of the six dimensions of user-perceived e-procurement quality -processing, content, usability, training, and professionalism -act as antecedents to the TAM. A sixth dimension, specification, which considers reporting, configurability, and integration with financial management systems, was not included in our model as we expected it to be relevant only to a smaller sub-set of individuals who use e-procurement systems for budgeting, payment and reporting.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the model of hypothesised relationships. The right-hand side of this is consistent with the original TAM whilst the left-hand side incorporates the five e-procurement quality dimensions acting as antecedents to the TAM's two cognitive dimensions of PU and PEOU. We now outline each of these hypothesised relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2: Hypothesised model of e-procurement quality dimensions as antecedents to the TAM</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Antecedents to perceived usefulness</head><p>As noted earlier, perceived usefulness (PU) is defined as the extent to which an individual believes that their job performance will be improved through the use of a given technology. We hypothesise three antecedents to PU -processing, content, and usability. Firstly, the processing dimension of e-procurement quality is concerned with how individuals perceive a new eprocurement technology to impact on order processing speed, ease of authorisation, the time for orders to reach suppliers, overall lead-time, on-time delivery, and order accuracy. As such, it is related to Roger's innovation diffusion model's attribute of relative advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Azadegan and Teich, 2010)</ref>, i.e. the superiority of the technology compared to what it is replacing. Unless individuals can attribute job performance gains to the system they are using, they are unlikely to favour the system, i.e. result demonstrability influences PU <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Venkatesh and Davis, 2000)</ref>. A</p></div>

(2013)</ref>. They argue that a technology will be used if it supports the needs of the task. In the context of e-procurement, this would relate to the efficiency of processing orders. Such efficiency may emerge from the simplification and streamlining of purchasing processes, reduction in cycle times, and improved accuracy of the information that is transferred between buyers and suppliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Gunasekaran and Ngai 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kauppi et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Tatsis et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Toktaş-Palut et al. 2014)</ref>. Speed is particularly critical to individuals placing orders regularly and empirical evidence indicates that a new system's comparative lead-time plays an important role in user acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Venkatesh and Davis, 2000)</ref>. As such, we hypothesise that perceptions of processing will impact positively on PU (H6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H6: There is a positive relationship between processing of an e-procurement system and perceived usefulness (PU) of e-procurement</head><p>Secondly, the content dimension considers the adequacy of suppliers and catalogues loaded into an e-procurement system, and how searchable such content is. Information-related characteristics of a system can impact its PU as they can improve productivity and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Venkatesh and Bala, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cao et al. (2013)</ref> highlight data quality as an important organisational level antecedent of SCM systems' adoption, and we argue it is also likely to impact individual level acceptance of technology. Furthermore, within the field of e-learning, studies (See for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Cho et al., 2009)</ref> emphasize the criticality of good system content in enabling individuals to achieve their learning goals and improve their job performance (i.e. PU).</p><p>In the context of digital libraries, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Thong et al. (2002)</ref> argue that matching system content and user's information needs increases PU. <ref type="bibr">Au et al.'s (2014)</ref> study of (organisational-level) eprocurement adoption in the hotel industry also highlights the role of rich and accurate information for improving performance. Thus, within the e-procurement context, we hypothesise that content will impact positively on PU (H7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H7: There is a positive relationship between content loaded on an e-procurement system and perceived usefulness (PU) of e-procurement</head><p>Thirdly, The usability<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> dimension covers system availability, ease of navigation and screen loading speed. Within eSCM, at an individual level, several studies have pointed to system availability, navigation, and speed all playing a central role in the ability of employees to carry out tasks quickly and efficiently <ref type="bibr">(Lai and Tong, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kull et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wen et al., 2014)</ref>. A technology that provides information quickly and easily will lead to improvements in job performance, which in turn will encourage greater use of a given technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Venkatesh and Bala, 2008)</ref>. User-interface features such as menus and icons are important in the usefulness of a system and allow an individual to perform their tasks more productively <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Cho et al., 2009)</ref>. As such, we hypothesise that usability will positively affect PU (H8a).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H8a:</head><p>There is a positive relationship between usability of an e-procurement system and perceived usefulness (PU) of e-procurement</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Antecedents to perceived ease of use</head><p>As noted earlier, perceived ease of use (PEOU) is defined as the extent to which an individual believes that using a technology is free from effort. We hypothesise three antecedents to PEOUusability, training, and professionalism. Firstly, considering usability, a reliable, flexible and user-friendly system is more likely to create a positive user experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Venkatesh and Bala 2008)</ref>. This is in line with Roger's innovation diffusion work as well as the motivation, opportunity and ability model (MOA), both of which highlight the importance of simplicity in reducing perceived effort associated with the use of new innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Azadegan and Teich, 2010)</ref>. In the context of e-procurement, if a service is slow or down, the system will appear difficult to use for employees and unavailability is likely to limit the proportion of orders placed through the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Croom and Brandon-Jones, 2007)</ref>. Thus we hypothesise that this dimension will also have a positive influence on the PEOU in the TAM (H8b).</p><p>H8b: There is a positive relationship between usability of an e-procurement system and perceived ease of use (PEOU) of e-procurement</p><p>Secondly, the training dimension incorporates the approach to training (e.g. online tutorials, advanced training, refresher courses, group sessions, and one-to-one training), the timing of such training, and the provision of information to support e-procurement system use. Within the eprocurement literature, training is identified as a critical success factor in the initial adoption decision of technology at an organisational level <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Au et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gunasekaran and Ngai, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Toktaş-Palut et al., 2014)</ref> and subsequently in influencing the perceived effort involved in using such technologies by individuals within the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Reunis et al., 2004)</ref>. Training is especially expected to impact acceptance through PEOU (H9) as it both increases the capability to work with the technology and reduces perceptions of its complexity.</p><p>H9: There is a positive relationship between training support and perceived ease of use (PEOU) of e-procurement Finally, professionalism is concerned with the on-going support provided to users who encounter problems, including availability, reliability, responsiveness, knowledge, and attitudes to support personnel.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>In this section, we describe the context of our study and present the overall approach to testing our hypotheses, including survey design, data collection, data pre-testing, and data analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Study context</head><p>Our study adopted a deductive survey approach to test hypotheses that emerged from our literature review. The research was undertaken in a business-to-business context examining perspectives of individual employees within buying organisations. These employees are expected to use e-procurement systems to order materials/services from their suppliers. We obtained access to a sample of employees, i.e. individual e-procurement users, at a university in the Netherlands.</p><p>In line with e-business taxonomies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Boone and Ganeshan, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Karjalainen and van Raaij, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Queenan et al., 2011)</ref> e-procurement technologies include online supplier catalogues, electronic purchase order systems, real-time linkages with suppliers, and electronic data interchange (EDI).</p><p>While the definitions of e-procurement in literature differ slightly, most fundamentally refer to the use of electronic technologies to support the procurement function and the material and services flows into the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aboelmaged 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Chang, et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gunasekaran and Ngai 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Tatsis et al., 2006)</ref>. In our study, the e-procurement system being used by respondents allows individual employees across the organisation to order office supplies, print services, laboratory materials, and computer services online. Seen from an internal service perspective, the purchasing department was the internal service provider and central in driving the initial decision to adopt a new e-procurement system within this organisation. Having done so, the purchasing department was responsible for implementing the new technology and ensuring its acceptance by employees across all departments and functions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Survey design and pilot testing</head><p>For the measurement of the latent variables in the model, we used multiple items based on previously published scales. We adapted the wording of existing items to the specific research setting where appropriate. For PU, we adopted four items from <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Davis et al. (1989)</ref>. For PEOU, we adopted four items from <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Thompson et al. (1991)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Moore and Benbasat (1991)</ref>. For attitude (ATT), we applied the four-item scale used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</ref>. Intention to continue system use (INT) was operationalized with three newly developed items. The five dimensions of e-procurement quality were measured using 19 items from Brandon-Jones (2017). All items were measured on a 1-7 Likert scale from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree', with mid points labelled to improve reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Zhou and Benton Jr., 2007)</ref>. Initially, academic colleagues with experience of questionnaire design were asked for feedback on the survey questions, structure and format <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Lawson et al., 2008)</ref>. Subsequently, a pre-test of the questionnaire was carried out with a small group of e-procurement users not involved in the main survey to gauge readability, refine wording, and assess likely completion times <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Shah and Ward, 2007)</ref>. No major changes where required to the survey beyond minor re-phrasing of a number of questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Data collection and pre-testing</head><p>The population for our survey was defined as all individual employees using the eprocurement system within the study organisation. Given the population was small (n=311), a census was applied. Initially, we sent out an e-mail via the purchasing department to all employees using the e-procurement system, inviting them to participate in our research project.</p><p>We followed this up with a direct e-mail to potential respondents (and two further reminders), providing a link to our online survey. We sought to minimise potential method bias by random ordering of questions in our online survey and social desirability bias through assurance of anonymity. Of the 311 potential respondents, 139 completed usable questionnaires, representing a 44.7% response rate. The absolute sample size exceeds most suggestions found in the literature (n&gt;100 Hatcher 1994; <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Malhotra and Grover, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">n=100-200 Velicer and Fava 1998)</ref> and is similar to other e-business studies over the last ten years, for example, <ref type="bibr">Autry et al (2010, n=195)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Cullen and Taylor (2009, n=153)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Dehning et al (2007, n=123)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Devaraj et al (2007, n=120)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Menor and Roth (2007, n=168)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Rosenzweig (2009, n=50)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Vaidyanathan and Devaraj (2008, n=141)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Wiengarten et al (2013, n=152)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Zhou and Benton Jr. (2007, n=125)</ref>. Our respondents are 73% female and 27% male, have a median age of 41-45 years, and are generally in administrative positions.</p><p>Prior to data analysis, non-response bias was assessed through wave analysis, comparing the responses of the early respondent wave (first quartile) to those of the late respondent wave (fourth quartile) using two tailed t-statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Armstrong and Overton, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Rogelberg and Stanton, 2007)</ref>. No significant differences were found between these two groups in their answers to construct items (p&lt;.05). In checking for outliers, Mahalanobis distance testing highlighted just one respondent with a standardised residual +/-three standard deviations from the predicted residual. However, unless one can prove that the outlier is not representative of any observation in the population, it is not advisable to delete it from analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hair et al., 2009)</ref>, so all data were retained prior to further analysis. Considering missing data, group comparisons of respondents with missing versus valid data showed significant differences between the groups for some items, indicating that simple mean substitution was not the best method for replacing missing data.</p><p>Therefore, the model-based expectation-maximisation (EM) approach was used to replace all remaining missing data points with the most accurate and reasonable estimate <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hair et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>EM estimates were constrained to a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value of 7. Finally, Harman's one-factor test was conducted to test for the presence of common method bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Podsakoff and Organ, 1986)</ref>. All survey items were entered into an exploratory principal components factor analysis (PCA) with no rotation to identify how many factors are required to account for variable variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Froehle and Roth, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Shah and Ward, 2007)</ref>. The presence of substantial common method variance may be shown if a single factor emerges from this analysis or the first factor accounts for the majority of covariance among the variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. PCA revealed the presence of multiple factors rather than a single general factor suggesting the risk of common method bias is low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Data analysis</head><p>We used a Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) approach to evaluate our hypothesised model. In this case, we adopted the partial least squares (PLS) approach, which uses a component-based approach to estimation, instead of a factor-based covariance fitting approach such as LISREAL, EQS, or AMOS. The PLS approach to SEM minimises the demands on measurement scales, sample size and residual distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chin, 1998)</ref> and simultaneously models the structural paths (the theoretical relationships among latent variables) and measurement paths (relationships between a latent variable and its indicators) with the main objective of prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chin et al., 2003)</ref>. Rather than assuming equal weights for all indicators, the PLS algorithm allows each indicator to vary in its weighting towards the latent variable.</p><p>Firstly, a test of the measurement model is executed to examine item reliabilities, composite reliabilities, convergent validity, and discriminant validity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Testing the measurement model</head><p>The first phase of analysis involved testing our measurement model, consisting of all constructs depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> and their measurement items. The test of the measurement model includes the estimation of internal consistency and the convergent and discriminant validity of the constructs. All constructs are modelled using reflective indicators. All outer loadings of the measurement model are greater than .7, with the exception of one usability item (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) and two items of the PEOU construct (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Their loadings are considered high enough to remain within the measurement model. All composite reliabilities are at least .838, well above the recommended minimum of .7, indicating adequate internal consistency. For each construct, the average variance extracted (AVE) is at least 0.568, above the recommended minimum of 0.5 to show convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref>.  The square roots of the AVEs are higher than the correlations across constructs (See table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>), indicating adequate discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref>. Finally, all blocks with more than one predictor are tested for multicollinearity. For all predictors, the variance inflation factors are 2.6 or lower, well below the suggested level of 10.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hair et al., 2009)</ref>. For adequate convergent validity, the square root of the average variance extracted (AVE) for each construct (on the diagonal) should exceed 0.7. For adequate discriminant validity, the square root of the AVE should exceed all correlations with the other latent variables (reported off-diagonal). These conditions are satisfied for all constructs. 20</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Testing the structural model</head><p>The second phase of analysis involved testing the significance of the paths in our structural model using the bootstrap resampling method within SmartPLS (with 200 resamples). In contrast to covariance structure analysis modelling approaches such as LISREL, PLS has no single goodness-of-fit measure, because its primary objective is maximization of variance explained, not minimization of the difference between the observed and the reproduced covariance matrices.</p><p>The quality of a PLS model can be determined by examining the R 2 values of the endogenous constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hulland, 1999)</ref>. A graphical summary of all the paths that are significant at a 95% level is presented in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Four of the five original TAM hypotheses are supported by the data. Both attitude towards the system and perceived usefulness of the system are directly related to intention to continue using the e-procurement technology (Hypothesis 1 and 2 accepted). PU is directly related to attitude towards e-procurement (Hypothesis 3 accepted). Perceived ease-of-use is directly related to PU. (Hypothesis 5 accepted). However, perceived ease-of-use is not directly related to attitude, and consequently hypothesis 4 is not supported. 21 Four of the six hypotheses concerning the antecedents to technology acceptance are also supported by our data. User perceptions of processing of an e-procurement system are positively related to the PU (Hypothesis 6 accepted). However, the perceived quality of content is not significantly related to PU, and hypothesis 7 is therefore not supported. Perceived usability is positively related to both PU (Hypothesis 8a accepted) and perceived ease-of-use (Hypothesis 8b accepted). User perceptions of training are not related to perceived ease-of-use, which means that hypothesis 9 is not supported. Finally, perceived professionalism of the support function is positively related to perceived ease-of-use (Hypothesis 10 accepted). The model explains 56% of variance in usage intentions, 64% of variance in user attitudes, 53% of variance in PU, and 45% of variance in PEOU. This explanatory power compares well with other eSCM studies (See for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kauppi et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Martínez-Caro and Cegarra-Navarro, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Wiengarten et al., 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion and conclusion</head><p>In this study, we have taken an important step in examining e-procurement quality dimensions as antecedents to the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in order to gain a deeper insight into the key factors that influence individual attitudes towards e-procurement and subsequent acceptance (or non-acceptance) behaviours at the employee (user) level, once an organisational investment into the technology has been made. Based on a sample of 139 e-procurement users within an organisation, the core TAM relationships are confirmed in line with previous studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Venkatesh and Davis, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Robinson et al., 2005)</ref> as well as the hypothesised impacts of processing, usability, and professionalism on higher-order cognitive mechanisms within the TAM. The R 2 of these constructs is substantial, 0.53 for PU and 0.45 for PEOU respectively, which signifies the importance of e-procurement quality factors in driving individual eprocurement technology acceptance. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Venkatesh et al. (2007)</ref>, researching antecedents of the TAM is a key indicator of both scientific progress and practical applicability by creating an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon as well as tools for managerial action.</p><p>We now examine the theoretical and managerial implications of our study, before concluding with limitations of the research and opportunities for further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Theoretical implications</head><p>A significant proportion of extant e-procurement literature focuses on decision-making at an organisational level, investigating the factors that drive organisations towards the adoption of such technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Angeles and Nath, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gunasekaran and Ngai, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Mishra et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wu et al. 2007)</ref>. What is missing in our field are individual employee level acceptance studiesin other words, examining the way in which organisational adoption can be successfully translated into individual acceptance in order to unlock the performance potential of eprocurement. By examining user-perceived e-procurement quality factors as antecedents to the TAM, our study provides several important theoretical contributions. We respond to the call for more behavioural research in operations management <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bendoly et al., 2006)</ref> and to the lack of studies on individual acceptance of e-procurement applications using theories from the broader information systems field by applying the TAM on individual employee usage intentions of eprocurement technology. The empirical analysis provides a number of important implications. At a broad level, the TAM is supported in this application domain, with good support for 'classic' TAM hypotheses (H1-H5). Specifically, only the link between perceived ease-of-use and attitude of the TAM model was found to be insignificant in the e-procurement context.</p><p>Turning to the antecedents of the TAM, our data indicate that the proposed antecedent eprocurement quality factors explain a substantial proportion of variance in perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. This substantiates the original premise of our research that the way various system and support facets of e-procurement provision are perceived by users plays an important role in the formation of the TAM's higher order cognitive constructs and through them both attitudes towards and intention to use e-procurement technologies. Interestingly, in our study, system issues play a more pronounced role in affecting the TAM constructs than the support issues. Processing and usability dimensions of user-perceived e-procurement quality appear to be the most important drivers of the TAM constructs, whilst content did not show a significant effect. This emphasises previous calls that IT usage research should pay greater attention to the technology itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cantamessa et al. 2012)</ref>. Furthermore, and perhaps more interestingly, it links e-procurement research of employees as users with recent studies on electronic retailing and online ordering, where the quality factors impacting customer decision making have been studied. For example <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kull et al. (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Olson and Boyer (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wen et al. (2014)</ref> all note that managers need to pay attention to, for example, website complexity, interface, and availability, so as to ensure competitiveness of their online channels. This is similar to a recent finding of <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Holma et al. (2015)</ref> within the context of corporate travel purchasing, where service quality and well-functioning systems were found to be key to employees' travel purchase compliance, linking corporate travel literature with that of consumer travel.</p><p>Our results concerning the way different support facets of e-procurement quality impact the TAM constructs are less conclusive. The training factor was not found to be significant whilst professionalism had a relatively small effect on perceived ease of use. Overall these results are in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adomavicius et al. (2013)</ref> who find that system characteristics have a significant impact on individual's perceptions of system usefulness and ease of use. Yet our results provide somewhat contradictory evidence when compared to many past studies that bring training and support to the forefront in increasing individual e-procurement acceptance within an organisation (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kheng and Al-Hawamdeh 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Vaidya et al., 2006)</ref>. Our results would indicate that the need for training may be lessened by the initial design of proper navigation and system usability as well as ensuring the system functionalities in terms of information and ensuing product flow from suppliers are expedient. This fits well with previous organisational-level studies indicating the immaturity of technology as a barrier to e-procurement success <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Angeles and Nath, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gunasekaran et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Naturally, e-procurement technology acceptance may be influenced by a variety of factors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Venkatesh and Bala (2008)</ref> present four generic antecedents to the TAM: individual differences, system characteristics, social influence, and facilitating conditions. The antecedents explored in this study focus largely on system characteristics ("those salient features of a system that can help individuals develop favourable or unfavourable perceptions regarding the usefulness or ease of use of a system", p276) in the form of our processing, content, and usability dimensions, and to a lesser extent the facilitating conditions in the form of the training and professionalism support dimensions. Our results are in line with a review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Jeyaraj et al. (2006)</ref> who find that in past studies, facilitating conditions have been among the worst predictors of individual usage behaviour, as training is found insignificant in our study as well. Whilst the system and its support dimensions studied here appear critical in influencing the TAM constructs and ultimately technology usage intentions, other, un-examined issues, such as individual differences, influencing tactics used by managers (social influence), and organisational context are also likely to be germane to behavioural influence and offer opportunities for future research. Individuals do not come to their assessment of the system in isolation, but rely on others to guide their behaviour. As in other IT usage situations, expert, peer and management interventions are likely to play a role <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Jasperson et al., 2005)</ref> and, for example, top management support has been found to be critical for successful e-procurement implementation in past research <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Gunasekaran and Ngai, 2008)</ref>. These interventions may act as mediating variables between eprocurement quality factors and the TAM's cognitive mechanisms. The perception of processing, for instance, is likely to be partially determined by the way in which the employee has come to know about the system before or even after their own first experience. More research is needed to examine the role of intervention on the formation of employee attitudes towards, and acceptance of, e-procurement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Managerial implications</head><p>Understanding the antecedents of perceived ease of use and usability is not only important from a theoretical perspective but also from a practical viewpoint as expensive systems can be rejected due to unsuitable user interfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Autry et al., 2010)</ref>. A typical criticism of the TAM is in relation to its lack of practical managerial guidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Venkatesh and Bala, 2008)</ref>. The potential business case in favour of organisational adoption of e-procurement can disappear if it is not subsequently followed by individual acceptance within an organisation. As such, our identification of key variables impacting user attitudes towards, and acceptance of, e-procurement appears germane.</p><p>Of the five e-procurement quality factors used in the study, processing and usability have the largest total effect on employee acceptance. As such, managers rolling out an e-procurement system should be particularly aware of the system selection issues that contribute to these scores.</p><p>Processing and usability are more important than content in this sample. Based on the findings, optimising the order lead-time, performance of the order processes and creating a user interface that is easily understandable, may deserve more attention than the addition of suppliers or catalogues. Processing also includes the results of the order fulfilment process. The timely delivery of goods is attributed to system performance and can thereby be seen as the 'the last mile' that deserves attention when seeking to improve user perceptions of e-procurement and through this improve individual acceptance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Limitations and future research</head><p>Despite making a number of contributions to extant research in the area of eSCM and technology acceptance more broadly, our study has a number of limitations that should be considered when interpreting findings. These limitations also provide directions for future research. The scope of our work is inevitably limited by the variables used in the model. As such, the objective has been to balance comprehensiveness with parsimony. In particular, future work would benefit from exploring potential mediating factors, such as influencing tactics, individual differences, and organisational context discussed earlier.</p><p>A second important limitation of our work is the use of intention as a proxy for compliance.</p><p>According to the Theory of Planned Behaviour (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975)</ref>, behavioural intent is the most critical determinant of actual behaviour, and as such the greater the reported intent the greater the actual behaviour (in this case, e-procurement compliance). However, whilst the use of intention as a proxy for behaviour is very common within extant literature, we acknowledge that future studies would benefit from examining actual compliance data and potentially the effect that different levels of usage have on total e-procurement costs.</p><p>Thirdly, in common with most other Operations Management (OM) studies, our research is limited by the fact that it has not yet been subject to replication. Whilst still rare in OM, we support the view of <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Rosenzweig and Roth (2007)</ref> that replication is ultimately the best way to progress theory. By applying an established model (i.e. TAM) to a new empirical context (individual employee-level e-procurement acceptance) we have in some ways adopted this replication logic. However, we consider that the next step should be to replicate our extended model (i.e. incorporating the antecedents of user-perceived e-procurement quality alongside the TAM) in a related setting. Such studies would allow us to assess the extent to which findings presented here hold true in other sectors, countries, or organisations with different approaches to implementation, for example. Furthermore, Structural Equation Modelling was used to validate our model. We acknowledge that other novel approaches to data analysis may be useful in future work looking to explore the adoption (organisational-level) and acceptance (individual employee level) of e-procurement, as well as other OM phenomena. In a similar vein, a qualitative rather than quantitative follow-up study would be valuable in examining the phenomenon of individuallevel eSCM acceptance behaviour in more depth.</p><p>Finally, whilst we see the individual-level focus of our work as important in developing our understanding of how organisations might overcome the technology paradox, it is clear that our work is limited by not examining antecedents to organisational-level adoption of e-procurement and to other eSCM technologies. Therefore, future research could benefit from a dual unit of analysis, which incorporates data on both organisational adoption (non-adoption) and subsequent individual acceptance (non-acceptance) behaviours.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 3: Outcomes of the model test</figDesc></figure>
