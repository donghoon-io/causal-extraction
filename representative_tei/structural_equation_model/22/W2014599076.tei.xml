<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The objective of our study is twofold. First, we assess the three psychological antecedents of commitment in a financial service setting. Second, we investigate the influence of affective commitment on customer loyalty.</p><p>In the literature on organizational psychology different types of commitment have been identified. Of these, affective and calculative commitment appear most frequently. Affective commitment refers to the emotional attachment to an organization whereas calculative commitment refers to the costs that individuals associate with leaving the organization. "Although previous research has focused largely on the commitment of employees, the constructs' domain can be extended to the relationship between service provider and customer" <ref type="bibr">(Kelley and Davis 1994, p. 54)</ref>. In a services setting, empirical evidence was found that affective commitment is the most important driver of loyalty <ref type="bibr">(Harrison-Walker 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kumar et al. 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wetzels et al. 1998)</ref>. Moreover, affective commitment is most effective for developing and maintaining mutually beneficial relationships between partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kumar et al. 1994)</ref>. Therefore, in this study we focus on the relationship between affective commitment and loyalty. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pritchard et al. (1999)</ref> argue that an analysis of commitment 'should move beyond a general expression of attachment and incorporate an understanding of the psychology inherent in binding a person to that disposition <ref type="bibr">' (p. 334)</ref>. They distinguish information processes, identification processes and volition processes as antecedents of commitment. As we want to grasp the antecedents of affective commitment, we will assess these three antecedent processes.</p><p>The studies mentioned before focus on a single aspect: either the psychological processes behind commitment or the relationship between commitment and loyalty. Despite their contribution to the field, we aim at providing a complete picture by investigating both relationships simultaneously. Therefore in this study we investigate the relationships between the three antecedents of commitment as well as the relationship between affective commitment and customer loyalty in terms of word-ofmouth, purchase intentions, price insensitivity and complaining in a financial service setting. design, the results of the empirical study and the assessment of a rival model. Finally, we come up with conclusions, managerial implications, limitations and directions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical background</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the conceptual model underlying this study. In this section, we will first elaborate upon affective commitment. Second, we will focus on its antecedent constructs. And finally, we address the four types of customer loyalty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Affective commitment</head><p>Commitment is generally referred to as an enduring desire to maintain a relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Morgan and Hunt 1994)</ref>. The concept of commitment is similar to the concept of a long-term orientation that comprises the desire and utility of a buyer to have a long-term relationship with a seller <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gruen 1995)</ref>. In line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Day (1969)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dick and Basu (1994)</ref> stated that the stronger commitment, the more likely the buyer is to overcome potential obstacles in the buyer-seller relationship, resulting in customer loyalty. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Beatty et al. (1988)</ref> state that commitment and loyalty are related, yet by definition distinct constructs, with commitment leading to loyalty.</p><p>In line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allen and Meyer (1990)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Geyskens (1998, p. 50)</ref> states that 'the use of global commitment measureswhich measure intention to continue a relationship without consideration of the underlying motivationcould confound or mask different, and possibly even opposite effects'. In this research we therefore focus on one particular type of commitment: affective commitment. Since it has been shown that affective commitment has the most pronounced effect on loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Harison-Walker 2001)</ref>. Affective commitment can be defined as "a party's desire to continue a relationship because of the enjoyment of the relationship for its own sake, apart from the instrumental worth and because they experience a sense of loyalty and belongingness" <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allen and Meyer, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Geyskens et al. 1996)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Psychological antecedents of affective commitment</head><p>Since commitment is a desirable outcome it is valuable to gain insights into its antecedent processes. Position  involvement, volitional choice and informational complexity represent the three psychological formative processes distinguished by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pritchard et al. (1999)</ref>: identification processes, volitional processes and informational processes.</p><p>In our context, the identification process refers to the question whether customers identify themselves with the values and images embodied by a particular financial service provider. It is expected that the more strongly customers identify themselves with the financial service provider, the stronger their commitment towards the financial service provider. The volitional process refers to customers' perceptions that their preferences are free and not dictated by any constraints. When customers sense that their choice for the financial service provider is unhindered, the resulting commitment is likely to be stronger and more deeply held <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Pritchard et al. 1999)</ref>. Finally, the informational process distinguished by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pritchard et al. (1999)</ref> deals with cognitive structures and how customers manage information about their preferred financial service provider. It is assumed, that the need to maintain a consistent informational structure, about for instance reasons for revisiting the financial service provider, has a positive impact on commitment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Position involvement</head><p>Position involvement is considered to be an important construct representing the identification process. Position involvement is defined as "a situation in which important values or self-images are identified with a particular service provider choice" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Freedman, 1964)</ref>. Customers' position involvement is determined by the extent to which the customer's public association with the service in question is in line with certain values and self-images of that customer. Some researchers even indicate that the highest form of commitment is driven by the need for social representation and self-identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Buchanan 1985)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Volitional choice</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pritchard et al. (1999)</ref> volitional choice, being a construct representing the volitional process, can be defined as "a process that involves both a freedom from constraints and a freedom to choose". In our setting, freedom from refers to the notion that a financial service provider choice is elicited freely and not constrained by external considerations that might limit a customer's sense of personal responsibility in that decision. The freedom to component of volitional choice refers to the potential for a choice to reflect meaningful action or effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bagozzi, 1993)</ref>. Research suggests that when people sense they are acting freely in choosing an object, they attribute meaning toward that object <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bem, 1967)</ref>. For instance, when customers choose 'First American Bank' or another bank from a wide range of banks, they usually infer greater meaning in that selection (e.g. "It's my favorite or the best alternative").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Informational complexity</head><p>Informational complexity is deemed to be an important construct representing the informational process. Informational complexity can be defined as "the extent to which information processing is required to form cognitive structures". <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pritchard et al. (1999)</ref> claim that when complex informational schema underlie customers' commitment, changing their mind becomes more difficult as accommodating disparate cognitions require even greater change <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Millar and Tessar, 1986)</ref>. Moreover, deviation from an attitude that is supported by a complex cognitive structure involves higher psychological costs than deviation from an attitude that is supported by a simple cognitive structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Salancik, 1977)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pritchard et al. (1999)</ref> found empirical support for the positive relationships between position involvement, volitional choice, informational complexity and a global measure of commitment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Customer loyalty</head><p>In line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jacoby and Chestnut (1978)</ref> we define customer loyalty as the "biased (i.e. non random) behavioral response, expressed over time, by some decision making unit, with respect to one financial service provider out of a set of financial service providers, which is a function of psychological (decision making and evaluative) processes resulting from commitment".</p><p>The conceptualization and measurement of loyalty has often remained limited, ignoring the full range of conceivable loyalty (re)-actions that may follow the evaluation of a service <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Zeithaml et al. 1996)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cronin and Taylor (1992)</ref> for instance focused solely on repurchase intentions, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bolding et al. (1993)</ref> measure repurchase intentions and willingness to recommend. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zeithaml et al. (1996)</ref> argue, dimensions of loyalty, such as, willingness to pay more, and loyalty under increased pricing have often been left out in previous research. Similarly, customer evaluations following a negative service experience have received only limited attention in scales designed to measure customer loyalty intentions and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Singh 1991)</ref>. With regard to behavioral intentions in a service setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zeithaml et al. (1996)</ref> proposed a comprehensive, multi-dimensional framework of customer behavior intentions in services. This framework was conceptually comprised of the following four main dimensions: (1) word-of-mouth communications, (2) purchase intentions, (3) price sensitivity, and (4) complaint behavior. In this paper, we therefore also distinguish these four biased behavioral responses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Crosby and Taylor (1983)</ref> suggested that the congruence between a customer's personal values and self-images (position involvement) and the values and norms embodied by a product or service, strengthens commitment. This implies that a customer who considers a particular financial service provider to represent important personal values will show a stronger commitment towards this financial service provider. <ref type="bibr">Cialdini et al. (1978)</ref> argued that once volitional processes were engaged, customers sense that they are acting freely in choosing, and develop a sense of commitment in which they were prepared to continue with an initial decision, even though certain sales incentives were withdrawn. In line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Festinger (1957)</ref> we argue that much of a customer's commitment is driven by the psychological cost (informational complexity) involved in the cognitive reordering and rethinking of what was known about the financial service provider. In line with the empirical support for the positive relationships between position involvement, volitional choice, informational complexity and a global measure of commitment found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pritchard et al. (1999)</ref>, we extend the positive relationship between the antecedents and global commitment to affective commitment and hypothesize:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The Interrelationships Between the Concepts</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1 There is a positive relationship between position involvement and affective commitment H2 There is a positive relationship between volitional choice and affective commitment H3 There is a positive relationship between informational complexity and affective commitment</head><p>A desire to continue a relationship and a willingness to make efforts to maintain it, imply higher chances of customer loyalty. Therefore, we assume there exists a positive relationship between commitment and customer loyalty. Several authors support the notion that commitment motivates buyers to act <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gruen 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hennig-Thurau and Klee 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mathieu and Zajac 1990)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Liljander and Strandvik (1993)</ref> concluded that commitment and behavioral intentions are related concepts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Morgan and Hunt (1994)</ref> found significant relationships between the level of a buyer's commitment and his acquiescence, propensity to leave, and cooperation, all of which can be regarded as behavioral intentions. Several organizational commitment studies focused on the intent to leave and turnover as primary behavioral intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Rylander et al. 1997)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Moorman et al. (1992)</ref> suggested that buyers who are committed to a relationship might have a greater propensity to act because of their need to remain consistent with their commitment. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dick and Basu (1994)</ref> stated that the stronger commitment, the more likely the buyer is to overcome potential obstacles in the buyer-seller relationship, resulting in repeat patronage. However, all commitment measures used in these studies were global measures. Nonetheless, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wetzels et al. (1998)</ref> clearly showed that the effect of affective commitment is more pronounced than the effect of calculative commitment on intention to stay. Furthermore, Harison-Walker ( <ref type="formula">2001</ref>) finds evidence for the stronger effect of affective commitment on word of mouth communications as compared to calculative commitment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Therefore, we formulate the following hypotheses:</head><p>H4 There is a positive relationship between affective commitment and word-of-mouth H5 There is a positive relationship between affective commitment and purchase intention H6 There is a positive relationship between affective commitment and price insensitivity H7 There is a positive relationship between affective commitment and complaining</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Research Design</head><p>Data were collected from a sample of customers of three bank branches of one Belgian bank, in three mid-sized towns in the Flemish part of Belgium. In April 2001 customers were randomly asked to fill out the questionnaire. Four hundred and thirty nine correctly filled out questionnaires were collected. The sample was found to be representative for the customers of the focal bank in terms of gender, age, education and occupation.</p><p>The design of the questionnaire was based on multipleitem measurement scales that have been validated and found to be reliable in previous research. All constructs were measured on seven-point Likert scales ranging 1. I prefer to bank with Bank X because their image comes closest to reflecting my lifestyle 2. When I bank with Bank X it reflects the kind of person I am 3. I prefer to bank with Bank X because their service makes me feel important 1. My decision to bank with Bank X was freely chosen from several alternatives 2. I did not control the decision on whether to bank with Bank X (reversed) 3. I am fully responsible for the decision to bank with Bank X 1. I don't really know that much about Bank X (reversed) 2. I consider myself to be an educated consumer regarding Bank X 3. I am knowledgeable about Bank X* 1. I do feel a strong sense of belonging to Bank X 2. I stay with Bank X because I am very happy to be their customer 3. I stay with Bank X because of the comfortable relationship I have with Bank X 4. Bank X has a great deal of personal meaning for me* 5. I do feel like "part of the family" at Bank X* 6. I do feel "emotionally attached" to Bank X 1. I say positive things about Bank X to other people 2. I recommend Bank X to someone who seeks advice 3. I encourage friends to go to Bank X 1. I consider Bank X as my first choice* 2. I go more often to Bank X in the next few weeks 3. I go less often to Bank X in the next few weeks (reversed) 1. When the services I usually buy at Bank X are charged less at another Bank I go to that bank (reversed) 2. I am willing to go to another bank that offers more attractive prices (reversed) 3. I am willing to pay a higher price than other banks charge for the benefits I currently receive from Bank X*  <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>In order to test our conceptual model, structural equation modeling (SEM) with observed variables was conducted using maximum likelihood estimation in LISREL 8.3. A variance-covariance matrix was calculated using LISREL's companion program PRELIS and was used as input for the path analyses. We subsequently analyzed the overall model, the measurement model and the structural model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Overall Model Evaluation</head><p>In the overall model, the chi-square value is significant (428.98 with 179 degrees of freedom), a finding not unusual with large sample sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Doney and Cannon 1997)</ref>. The ratio of chi-square to degrees of freedom is 2.39, which can be considered as adequate. The values of GFI (0.91) and AGFI (0.88) are somewhat lower than those of CFI (0.94), IFI (0.94) and NNFI (0.93). This result is mainly due to the former measures being more easily affected by sample size and model complexity. In general, the indicated fits are good, including RMSEA, which is 0.060, and SRMR, being 0.056. Given the objectives of our study, the adequacy of these indices, given the fact that the model was developed on theoretical bases, and given the relative complexity of the model, no model re-specifications were made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Measurement Model Evaluation</head><p>We assessed the quality of the measurement model (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) on unidimensionality, convergent validity, reliability, and discriminant validity. Evidence for the unidimensionality of each construct was based upon a principal components analysis revealing that the appropriate items loaded at least 0.60 (except for one item of informational complexity) on their respective hypothesized component, with a loading no larger than 0.30 on other components. Convergent validity was supported by a good overall model fit, all loadings being Australasian Marketing Journal 11 (3), 2003 significant (p &lt; 0.01), and most SMC's exceeded 0.50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hildebrandt 1987)</ref>. Reliability was indicated by composite reliability measures all exceeding 0.70 except for informational complexity and complaint behavior. Discriminant validity was tested in a series of nested confirmatory factor model comparisons in which correlations between latent constructs were constrained to 1, and indeed chi-square differences were significant for all model comparisons (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, the average percentage of variance extracted for nearly all constructs was greater than 0.50, except for informational complexity and complaint behavior. In sum, the measurement model (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) is clean, with evidence for unidimensionality, convergent validity, reliability, and discriminant validity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Structural Model Evaluation</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> contain the detailed results related to the structural model. All but one proposed relationship between the concepts could be supported. We were not able to find a significant relationship between information complexity and affective commitment.</p><p>Affective commitment is clearly positively influenced by position involvement and in a lesser extent by volitional choice. Moreover, affective commitment plays a pivotal role in explaining customer loyalty. These results support the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Geyskens (1998)</ref> stating that the use of a global commitment construct would have masked the effect of specific types of commitment, stressing the importance of our focus on affective commitment. In addition, we explained more than 70% of the variance in affective commitment, which seems to be the result of the strong impact of position involvement even to the neglect of important antecedents such as for example satisfaction, trust and value <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Sirdeshmukh et al. 2002)</ref>. This means that position involvement is a type of involvement that should be taken into consideration in future research. Moreover, the focus on a particualr type of commitment as well as the refinement of the antecedents seems to be promising as our empirical results showed clear differences in terms of the directions and magnitudes of the relationships between the constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Rival Model</head><p>It is generally agreed upon that researchers should compare rival models and not just test the performance of a proposed model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bagozzi and Yi 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bollen and Long 1992)</ref>. In discussing the construct of affective commitment earlier, we provided a theoretical basis for</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Antecedents and Consequences of Affective Commitment</head><p>Australasian <ref type="bibr">Marketing Journal 11 (3), 2003</ref> 39 Because our parsimonious hypothesized model allows no direct paths from any of the three antecedent processes to customer loyalty, it implies a central nomological status for affective commitment. A non-parsimonious rival model would be one hypothesizing only direct paths from each of the antecedent processes to affective commitment and the four dimensions of customer loyalty. This model makes affective commitment nomological similar to the four dimensions of customer loyalty. The tested rival model (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>), therefore, permits no indirect effects, implying that affective commitment is not allowed to mediate any of the relationships.</p><p>Based upon <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Morgan and Hunt (1994)</ref>, we compared our hypothesized model to the rival model on the following criteria: overall fit, parsimony, percentage of either model's parameters that were statistically significant, and R2's for the endogenous constructs. With respect to overall fit, the CFI of the rival model was slightly lower than that of the hypothesized model (.93 vs. .94) and the rival model's ratio of chi-square to degrees of freedom was higher than that of the hypothesized model (2.58 vs. 2.39). Moreover, eight additional paths needed to be estimated in the rival model, reducing the rival model's parsimony. In addition, only 53% of the paths in the rival model were significant as opposed to 86% in the hypothesized model, suggesting the additional paths were not meaningful theoretically or empirically. Finally, the average explained variance of the four dimensions of customer loyalty in the rival model is similar to the average explained variance in the hypothesized model. This implies that the direct effect of affective commitment plus the indirect effect of the antecedent processes in the hypothesized model are equally strong to the three direct effects of the antecedent processes in the rival model in explaining the dimensions of customer loyalty.</p><p>Based upon these findings, we believe that the exercise of fitting a rival model has strengthened the support we found for the meaningfulness and robustness of our hypothesized model. In addition to the conceptual support found for positioning affective commitment as a mediating variable in the hypothesized model, the rival model empirically demonstrates its added value. Neglecting the mediating role of this construct reduces its parsimony and results in a lower percentage of significant path coefficients.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions and Managerial Implications</head><p>The results of this study clearly show that affective commitment is an important determinant of word of mouth, purchase intentions, price insensitivity and to a lesser extent of complaining behavior. Affective commitment deals with having a sense of belongingness, being happy of being a customer, feeling emotionally attached and feeling part of the family of the financial service provider. Moreover, it deals with having a comfortable and reliable relationship with the financial service provider. Improving these aspects of affective commitment exceeds a positive influence on loyalty. A financial service provider therefore, should make sure that a customer is treated as a true individual in which the organization is really interested and cares for. This can be achieved by, among others, actually personalizing the communication efforts and by showing attachment and by being of personal meaning to each and every individual customer.</p><p>In line with our study, especially the effect of position involvement in stimulating affective commitment might not be overlooked. Position involvement can be created by making sure that the image of the financial service provider comes close to the lifestyle of the customer and that the financial service provider reflects the personality of the customers in terms of their values and norms. Careful analyses of which norms and values customers in the target market expect to be reflected in their financial service provider is important here and based upon this the concise selection of a well defined segment.</p><p>Moreover, our study indicates that the financial service provider should target those customers who are intrinsically inclined to engage in relationship with financial service providers. It is important to realize that not every customer is willing to engage in long-term relationships and therefore the financial service provider should not waste resources on targeting these unwilling customers. Relationship prone customers tend to reveal high position involvement which impacts affective commitment and finally loyalty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Limitations and Directions for Future Research</head><p>Our research should be seen as a preliminary attempt to address an issue that has important implications for marketing theory and practice. Any preliminary attempt will involve a number of limitations. However, acknowledgement of these limitations also suggests new directions for future studies.</p><p>A first potential shortcoming in the study is common method bias. As we used one single questionnaire to measure all constructs included, the relationships between these constructs may be somewhat inflated. No database information could be used as input for measuring actual behavior. This study could be improved with access to more substantial data on customer purchase histories that are not subject to potential recall loss. It would then be possible to look at longer strings of purchases and to perhaps incorporate contextual information. In addition to affective commitment, calculative-and normative commitment can also be taken into account as consequences of informational complexity, volitional choice and position involvement and as antecedents of word of mouth, purchase intention, price insensitivity and complaining.</p><p>With respect to the measurement items, we have to conclude that the scales used to measure informational complexity and complaining could be improved. In a follow-up study we have to develop a more appropriate scale. Moreover, it must be recognized that our sample of Belgian customers of a financial service provider cannot necessarily be generalized. This limits the findings as relevant only to these types of customers and service providers. Future studies need to assess the generalizability of our findings to other contexts. Furthermore, future research should concentrate on issues that could help management to identify, to attract and to retain customers with strong position involvement, high affective commitment since these customers show a high propensity to be loyal to the financial service provider.</p><p>In conclusion, it is hoped that these research results will serve as a stimulus for additional empirical research involving ongoing relationships in a services setting.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1: Conceptual Model</figDesc></figure>
