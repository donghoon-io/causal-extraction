<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Using a short-term longitudinal design, the authors investigated implications of 2 facets of motivational selectivity-restricting (to few goals) and focusing (on central and similar goals)-for goal-pursuit investment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>"Don't put all your eggs in one basket," or "Those who follow every path never reach any destination"-folk wisdom offers contradictory advice. Is it better to diversify and have many goals or to focus one's resources on a limited number of options? Or is it not an "either-or" question, and selectivity is advisable in some situations but not others? We propose that a person's age can be seen as a proxy variable for a group of factors determining selectivity. In this article, we present an empirical study on the development and function of two forms of motivational selectivity, restricting (to few goals) and focusing (on central and similar goals). This study tested whether people react to age-associated decreases in goal-relevant resources by becoming increasingly selective in their future-oriented motivations and whether this increase in selectivity contributes to the maintenance of high behavioral involvement in goal pursuit in a reality of increasingly limited resources.</p><p>A key feature of human evolution is the emergence of a behavioral repertoire that is both vast and flexible and thus opens a multitude of potential developmental pathways in a person's life (D. H. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ford &amp; Lerner, 1992)</ref>. The breadth of developmental options is delimited by biological and social factors but is nevertheless immense. This is of great adaptive advantage because it allows flexible adjustments to different environmental conditions and demands. However, it also poses a challenge to developmental regulation. Pursuing a developmental path takes resources, such as time or energy, that are available only in limited amounts. Following a large range of different developmental paths leads to diffusion of resources that might be needed to attain or maintain high levels of functioning in a given domain. On the one hand, people therefore need to focus their resources. On the other hand, diversity is an important means for adapting to changing environmental or social demands. The challenge for developmental regulation, therefore, is to find the right balance between limiting one's potential and overextending oneself.</p><p>Regulatory processes that address this challenge occur on both the societal and the personal level <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Freund, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Heckhausen, 1999)</ref>. Societies "canalize" individual development through age norms and age-graded opportunity structures. Opportunity structures refer to the amount of resources, support, and reinforcement society provides for the pursuit of particular developmental options at a given age (e.g., starting out a new career in younger vs. middle or older adulthood; <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Neugarten, Moore, &amp; Lowe, 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Settersten &amp; Hagestad, 1996a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, 1996b)</ref>. Even within this sociostructural scaffolding, however, the number of potential developmental options typically exceeds the resources available to the individual, who therefore needs to use additional regulatory processes. These processes can be subsumed under the notion of selectivity. Various recent theories have emphasized the fundamental role of selectivity for human development (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Carstensen, Isaacowitz, &amp; Charles, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Freund &amp; Baltes, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Heckhausen, 1999)</ref>. One example is the theory of selection, optimization, and compensation (SOC; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baltes &amp; Baltes, 1990)</ref>. This theory posits that a focused investment of limited resources into a subset of developmental options is a universal process of developmental regulation that provides directionality to development and operates on different levels of analysis, in different domains of functioning, and across different phases of the life span.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivational Selectivity</head><p>Our aim in this research was to address the phenomenon of selectivity as it is evident in developmental-regulatory processes on the part of the individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bandura, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">D. H. Ford, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> M. E. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ford &amp; Ford, 1987)</ref>. Personal goals (mental representations of states that an individual wants to attain, maintain, or avoid in the future; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Emmons, 1996)</ref> and goal-directed action play an important role in this respect, particularly in adulthood (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Freund &amp; Baltes, 2000)</ref>. We therefore focused on selectivity as it is evident in people's goals. We refer to this form of selectivity as motivational selectivity and define it as delimiting, either proactively or reactively, the range of one's personal goals. Proactive selectivity is intentionally initiated by the individual. Reactive selectivity is brought about by the individual's life circumstances. It may not require the individual's awareness or intentional initiative.</p><p>Previous research on aspects of motivational selectivity-as indexed, for example, by the concepts of elective selection (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Freund &amp; Baltes, 2000)</ref> or life investment selectivity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Staudinger, Freund, Linden, &amp; Maas, 1999)</ref>-has shown that selectivity fosters an individual's subjective well-being, particularly when resources are scarce (e.g., in the case of poor health; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chou &amp; Chi, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Staudinger &amp; Freund, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Staudinger et al., 1999)</ref>. In these studies, researchers have investigated selectivity in terms of restricting oneself to few personal goals. In the present study, we extended the notion of motivational selectivity to include, in addition to the facet of restricting (the number of goals), a second facet, namely, focusing (the content of goals). Restricting relates to the quantity of selected goals. It is characterized by selecting few (vs. many) goals. The second facet, focusing, relates to the content of selected goals. It is characterized by focusing on subjectively central (vs. marginal) and on similar (vs. diverse) goals. Central goals address life domains the person regards as highly important for his or her life satisfaction. Similar goals are comparable in the life domains they address; they focus on the same, rather than on divergent, areas of life.</p><p>Moreover, different from the aforementioned studies that have addressed the association between selectivity and psychological well-being, we targeted a more proximal outcome of selectivity in the present study, namely, goal-directed behavioral investment. Choosing goals is only a first step in eventually achieving desired outcomes. Shaping one's life course in aspired directions also requires goal-directed action. Selecting a goal, however, does not necessarily imply that the individual will also engage in behaviors directed at goal realization. Many goals remain just that: goals. We posit that the two facets of motivational selectivity-restricting (the number of goals) and focusing (the content of goals)-foster, on a behavioral level, a high involvement in goal pursuit. This should be the case because selecting few goals that address subjectively central life domains and are similar to each other might result in a high degree of mutual facilitation among the selected goals as indexed by instrumental goal relations and overlapping goal-attainment strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Riediger &amp; Freund, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wilensky, 1983)</ref>. Previous research has shown that high intergoal facilitation is associated with an enhanced involvement in goal pursuit (Riediger, in press; <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Riediger &amp; Freund, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Riediger, Freund, &amp; Baltes, 2005)</ref>. However, little is known to date about characteristics that foster facilitation among goals. In the present research, we predicted that motivational selectivity (restricting and focusing) contributes to intergoal facilitation, which, in turn, leads to high involvement in goal-pursuit behaviors (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age-Related Changes in Motivational Selectivity</head><p>Taking a life span developmental perspective, we further predicted that motivational selectivity increases from early to late adulthood. This increase might accelerate beginning with the transition from middle to later adulthood. Goal-relevant resourcesthat is, means to realize aspired outcomes-are limited in all phases of life. These resource limitations become increasingly pronounced throughout life <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baltes, 1997)</ref>, and particularly so in later adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baltes &amp; Smith, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Freund &amp; Riediger, 2003)</ref>. Although resource gains are possible in later adulthood (e.g., in social status, material belongings, or practical knowledge), the currently prevailing view is that, overall, these resource gains are outweighed by age-associated resource losses (e.g., decreases in physical fitness or health, illness or death of close social partners). In addition, remaining years of life, a central resource for the realization of all future-orientated aspirations, are increasingly perceived as limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Carstensen et al., 1999)</ref>. In older adulthood, then, the necessity of regulatory processes that guide the focused investment of resources becomes increasingly magnified. This increased necessity coincides with a decrease in the regulatory scaffolding provided by society. In older adulthood, social expectations are less clear and roles less explicitly defined <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Maddox, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Riley, Kahn, &amp; Fohner, 1994)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Heckhausen and Schulz (1999)</ref> concluded that individuals themselves have to take on the regulation of aging-related resource losses (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Wrosch &amp; Freund, 2001)</ref>. We therefore expected that the increase in resource limitations, coupled with the decrease in social-structural scaffolding and a potential increase in life experience and life-management competence, should render it both increasingly necessary and increasingly possible in older adulthood to be selective about one's future-oriented aspirations. We therefore expected that older as compared with younger and middle-aged adults are more likely to focus on a restricted number of goals that are similar to each other and that address those life domains that the person regards as highly central for his or her life satisfaction.</p><p>There is some evidence that the first facet of motivational selectivity-restricting the number of goals-increases throughout adulthood. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cross and Markus (1991)</ref> observed in a cross-sectional sample that adults reported fewer hoped-for and feared possible selves the older they were. A similar finding was reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Freund and Baltes (2002)</ref>, who found in a crosssectional sample that adults' self-reported tendency to engage in elective selection increases throughout adulthood.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intergoal Facilitation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goal</head><p>There is also some empirical evidence that is consistent with the view that motivational selectivity in terms of focusing on subjectively important life domains might increase in older adulthood. For example, in the domain of social relations, research emanating from socioemotional selectivity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Carstensen, 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carstensen, , 1998) )</ref> has shown that the decrease in social network size in later adulthood largely results from a selective pruning process that older adults intentionally initiate in accordance with their priorities in social interactions. Older adults have been found to deliberately discard emotionally less important relationships but to maintain intensive relations to emotionally close interaction partners (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Fung, Carstensen, &amp; Lang, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lang, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the implications of older adults' increased selectivity for their goal-directed behavioral investment. We predicted that motivational selectivity might serve an important behavioral function in older adulthood, namely, the maintenance of high levels of active involvement in goal pursuit, despite age-associated declines in available resources, and that a high extent of intergoal facilitation plays a mediating role in this association.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of the Present Study</head><p>To investigate our predictions, which are summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we conducted a short-term longitudinal study with an age-heterogeneous sample covering the adult life span from earlier to later adulthood (20 to 69 years of age). The study comprised two sessions about 3 months apart. Motivational selectivity and intergoal facilitation were assessed at the first session, and involvement in goal pursuit at the second. Although age-related differences could only be tested cross-sectionally, this design allowed testing the propositions of our working model on the function of selectivity for goal pursuit in a prospective manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>At the first measurement session, the sample comprised 177 participants ranging in age from 20.10 to 69.43 years (M ϭ 44.69, SD ϭ 14.55). About equal numbers of participants belonged to each of five age groups (20 -29 years, 30 -39 years, 40 -49 years, 50 -59 years, 60 -69 years; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Within each age group, the sample was approximately stratified by gender (total sample: 47.5% men and 52.5% women) and education (total sample, male participants: 48.8% less than 12 years of education, 51.2% 12 or more years of education; total sample, female participants: 47.3% less than 12 years of education, 52.7% 12 or more years of education).</p><p>A survey company contacted Berlin residents by means of a random dialing procedure and asked for their willingness to participate in this study. Participants were recruited on a first-come basis until prescribed cell sizes of the sample composition were reached. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> gives an overview of the five investigated age groups on sociodemographic characteristics at the first measurement session.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The study procedure comprised two assessment sessions with an average interval of about 3 months (M ϭ 88.2 days, SD ϭ 10.5). At each of these measurement sessions, participants completed a set of questionnaires in small groups. At Time 1 (T1), participants reported their current personal goals and we obtained information on their motivational selectivity and on the extent of mutual facilitation among their goals. At Time 2 (T2), we assessed how intensively participants had engaged in goal-pursuit behaviors during the study interval. Respective instruments are described in the Instruments section. At both measurement sessions, participants completed a number of additional instruments that are not relevant here. Participants received a 15-Euro (approximately $20) reimbursement for each measurement session. Of the 177 participants at T1, 160 (90.4%) also participated at T2 (20 -29 years: n ϭ 29, 82.9%; 30 -39 years: n ϭ 29, 82.9%; 40 -49 years: n ϭ 32, 94.1%; 50 -59 years: n ϭ 38, 97.4%; 60 -69 years: n ϭ 32, 94.1%). Participants who only participated at T1 did not differ from those who took part in both measurement occasions in any of the variables that are relevant here and were assessed at T1 (i.e., three facets of motivational selectivity and intergoal facilitation; discussed later). 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments Personal Goals (T1)</head><p>At T1, participants were asked to describe their current goals in an open response format. They were instructed to report goals that they had for the near future (i.e., coming weeks, months, or years), currently judged to be important, and that they expected would still be important in the coming weeks or months. The instructions included a brief explanation of the concept of goals as well as sample life domains and sample goals. 2 The number of goals to be reported was not specified. Following this free self-report, participants were asked to select the three goals they considered to be most important out of their list of reported goals. These three goals were then rated on a number of dimensions (as described later in this article). The decision to focus on the participants' three most important goals was based on our expectation from previous research observations that a high percentage of participants would report at least three goals when the number of to-be-reported goals is not specified, whereas a considerably lower percentage would report four or more goals. This expectation was confirmed in the present study: 173 participants (97.7%) reported at least three goals. More than three goals were reported by 130 participants (73.4%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivational Selectivity (T1)</head><p>At T1, we assessed two facets of motivational selectivity. One facet pertained to the quantity of reported goals (i.e., restricting to few vs. many goals). The other facet pertained to the quality (or content) of the reported goals (i.e., focusing on similar vs. diverse goals and on central vs. marginal goals).</p><p>Selectivity in terms of restricting. We used the number of current goals reported at T1 as an indicator of the quantity aspect of motivational selectivity. One univariate within-age-group outlier was identified in the oldest subsample (z score ϭ 3.39, raw score ϭ 10) and adjusted to the closest raw value in the within-age-group distribution (raw score ϭ 9; total sample: M ϭ 5.15, SD ϭ 2.08). 3  Selectivity in terms of focusing. We assessed two content-related aspects of motivational selectivity, namely, the similarity (vs. variability) and the centrality (vs. marginality) of personal goals reported at T1. Respective indicators were derived with respect to 14 content (life) domains. Previous research has shown that life domains addressed in people's goals vary substantially according to age. On the basis of these findings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Heckhausen, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Nurmi, 1992)</ref>, we aimed at compiling a selection of life domains that includes in equal parts domains with high relevance for different adult age groups. Assembling such an "age-fair" selection of life domains was a prerequisite for investigating potential age-associated differences in the two content-related selectivity indicators (see later). Our selection included the following domains: (a) friends-acquaintances, (b) family circle-children, (c) profession-work, (d) health-physical wellbeing, (e) education, (f) recreational activities, (g) financial situation, (h) material belongings, (i) partnership, (j) personal characteristics, (k) mental health, (l) physical capability, (m) enjoyment of life, and (n) appearance.</p><p>Three different approaches empirically supported the assumption that the prerequisite of age-fairness in the selection of life domains was met. First, we asked participants to indicate how important they considered each of the 14 life domains to be for their life satisfaction. Response options ranged from 1 (not at all important) to 7 (very important). As expected, participants in the five age groups differed in the subjective importance they ascribed to single life domains. When averaged across all domains, however, the five age groups did not differ significantly with respect to (a) the mean importance they ascribed to the 14 life domains (M ϭ 5.49, SD ϭ .64) and (b) the within-person standard deviation of these 14 importance ratings (M ϭ 1.31, SD ϭ .40). There also were no age-group differences in (c) the number of life domains participants rated as highly important (i.e., a rating of 6 or 7; M ϭ 8.17, SD ϭ 2.82), as moderately important (i.e., a rating of 3, 4, or 5; M ϭ 5.27, SD ϭ 2.73), or as unimportant for their life satisfaction (i.e., a rating of 1 or 2; M ϭ .67, SD ϭ 1.09; all ps Ͼ .65). Second, we asked participants to evaluate how relevant each of the 14 life domains was for each of their three most important goals. Response options ranged from 1 (not at all relevant) to 5 (very relevant). The five age groups did not differ with respect to (a) the mean goal relevance they ascribed to these 14 life domains across all three goals (averaged across all life domains and goals; M ϭ 3.43, SD ϭ .50), (b) the overall number of life domains participants rated as highly relevant (i.e., a rating of 4 or 5) for at least one of their goals (M ϭ 11.27, SD ϭ 1.91), and (c) the average number of life domains they rated as highly relevant for each of their three most important goals (averaged across all three goals; M ϭ 7.36, SD ϭ 2.05; all ps Ͼ .25). Third, using a dichotomous (yes-no) item, we asked participants to indicate, for each of their three most important goals, whether there are life domains other than the 14 included in the list that are relevant for this goal. Again, the five age groups did not differ in the number of participants who affirmed this item for one or more of the three goals (M ϭ 6.80, SD ϭ 1,48), 2 (4, N ϭ 175) ϭ 1.03, p ϭ .91.</p><p>In short, the empirical basis is strong for assuming that the prerequisite of age fairness in the compilation of life domains was met. This warrants the derivation of the two selectivity indicators described next and the interpretation of respective age-group differences.</p><p>First, as an indicator of the extent to which participants were selective in terms of selecting similar (vs. diverse) goals, we determined the variability of the life-domain relevance of the participants' three most important goals (following a rationale used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sheldon &amp; Emmons, 1995)</ref>. As described earlier, participants rated, for each of their three most important personal goals, how relevant this goal was for each of 14 life domains. We first 1 According to Wilks's Lambda, the multivariate main effect of group membership (participation at T1 only vs. participation at T1 and T2) was not significant, F(4, 154) ϭ 0.41, p ϭ .80 (partial 2 ϭ .01), as was the case for all respective univariate effects ( ps Ͼ .26). There also was no significant multivariate Group Membership ϫ Age Group interaction, F(16, 471.115) ϭ 1.13, p ϭ .32 (partial 2 ϭ .03). Respective univariate interaction effects were also not significant ( ps Ͼ .11).</p><p>2 Examples of goals reported by a 64-year-old female participant are (a) "to continue living a quiet life," (b) "to broaden my knowledge," (c) "to engage in social-welfare activities, that is, to look for an opportunity to work with foreign children," (d) "to become more courageous, take sides when injustice occurs."</p><p>3 To avoid distortions of statistical analyses, we tested all variables for univariate within-age-group outliers, which we defined-in accordance with <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tabachnick and Fidell (1996)</ref>-as cases with z scores in excess of 3.29 (i.e., with z scores at p Յ .001). Only one univariate outlier was identified and is described in the Method section. To reduce its impact on statistical analyses, we assigned the outlying case a raw score corresponding to the closest nonoutlying value in the within-age-group distribution. This approach is appropriate because there was no indication that the identified case did not belong to the target population. It did not have extreme values on any of the other investigated variables and did not represent a multivariate outlier in the combination of investigated variables (according to Mahalanobis distance at p Ͻ .001; there were no multivariate within-age-group outliers at all). We also tested for univariate and multivariate outliers in the total sample. There were none. determined, separately for each of the 14 life domains, the within-person standard deviation of these ratings across the three goals. This information indicates how distinctively (vs. similarly) participants evaluated the relevance of this particular life domain for their three most important goals. Averaging this information across all 14 life domains yielded an indicator of the overall dissimilarity of the participants' three most important goals in terms of their life-domain relevance (M ϭ 1.00, SD ϭ 0.31). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">4</ref>Second, as an indicator of the degree to which participants were selective in terms of selecting central (vs. marginal) goals, we determined the extent to which they addressed with their goals those life domains they regarded as central to their life satisfaction. As described earlier, participants rated on 7-point rating scales how important they considered each of 14 life domains to be to their life satisfaction. Ratings of 6 or 7, the two highest points on the rating scale, indicated that a person regarded this particular life domain as central to his or her life satisfaction. Participants also indicated, on 5-point rating scales, how relevant each of these 14 life domains was for each of their three most important personal goals. Again, ratings of the two highest points on the rating scale, 4 or 5, indicated that a particular life domain was highly relevant for a given goal. From these ratings, we determined, separately for each of the three reported goals, which percentage of those life domains that the participant considered highly important for his or her life satisfaction (i.e., importance ratings 6 or 7) were addressed by this goal (i.e., goal relevance rating 5 or 6). Averaging this index across the three most important goals yielded an indicator of the average percentage to which a participant's goals addressed those life domains he or she considered to be central to his or her life satisfaction (M ϭ 64.07%, SD ϭ 18.03).<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> Consider the following illustrating example: A person rated 8 of the 14 life domains as highly important for her life satisfaction. Of these 8 life domains, she rated 6 domains (75%) as highly relevant for her first goal, 4 domains (50%) as highly relevant for her second goal, and 5 domains (62.5%) as highly relevant for her third goal. This person would receive a centrality score of 62.5%, which is the average percentage to which this person's goals addressed those life domains she considered to be central to her life satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intergoal Facilitation (T1)</head><p>To assess the extent of mutual facilitation among the participants' three most important personal goals reported at T1, participants responded, for each of the 6 pairwise combinations of these goals, to the facilitation scale of the Intergoal Relations Questionnaire (IRQ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Riediger &amp; Freund, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Riediger et al., 2005)</ref>. This scale includes, for each pair of goals, two items that assess intergoal facilitation in terms of (a) instrumental goal relations ("The pursuit of goal A sets the stage for the realization of goal B"; response options: 1 ϭ not at all true, 5 ϭ very true) and (b) overlapping goal-attainment strategies ("How often can it happen that you do something in pursuit of goal A that is simultaneously beneficial for goal B?"; response options: 1 ϭ never/very rarely, 5 ϭ very often). In all, participants responded to 12 items. Averaging these items yielded the facilitation composite (M ϭ 3.06, SD ϭ 0.83, Cronbach's ␣ ϭ .83). 6</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goal Pursuit (T2)</head><p>At T2, participants responded, for each of the three most important goals they had reported at T1, to the following items: "In the past three months since you first participated in this study, on average . . . (a) How much have you done for this goal? (b) How much energy have you invested in this goal? (c) How regularly have you worked on this goal? (d) How much time have you invested in this goal? (e) How often have you thought about this goal? (f) How much has this goal determined your everyday life?"</p><p>All items used a 7-point response scale. Averaging across all 18 items (all three goals) yielded an indicator of the participants' average intensity of goal pursuit in the study interval (M ϭ 4.85, SD ϭ 0.74, Cronbach's ␣ ϭ .86).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The description of results is organized as follows. We first present results regarding age-group mean differences in the various measures of motivational selectivity, intergoal facilitation, and intensity of goal pursuit. Then, we present results of structural equation models testing our predictions regarding associations between the study variables in the investigated sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age-Group Mean Differences in Study Variables</head><p>A multivariate analysis of variance on the three indicators of motivational selectivity (assessed at T1), the indicator of intergoal facilitation (assessed at T1), and the indicator of goal-pursuit intensity (assessed at T2) yielded a significant multivariate agegroup effect according to Wilks's Lambda, F(20, 471.911) ϭ 2.33, p ϭ .001 (partial 2 ϭ .08). Means and standard deviations of each of these constructs in the five investigated age groups as well as results of univariate follow-up analyses are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The five age groups did not differ in the self-reported intensity of investment in goal pursuit during the study interval. Consistent with our predictions, however, there were significant univariate age effects on the intergoal facilitation composite and on each of the three motivational selectivity indicators-that is, number of goals, selection of central goals, selection of (dis-)similar goals (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates that univariate age effects in all four of these variables were not linear but were driven by a distinctive pattern of results in the oldest age group (60 -69 years of age). (Note that for illustration purposes, number and dissimilarity of goals were recoded prior to depiction in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> so that higher scores indicate higher selectivity.) Consistent with previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Riediger et al., 2005)</ref>, participants in the oldest group reported significantly higher levels of intergoal facilitation than did the other age groups. Also consistent with our hypotheses, participants in the oldest age group were significantly more selective in all three measures of motivational selectivity: (a) Participants in the oldest group listed significantly fewer personal goals in free self-report than younger and middle-aged adults. (b) Goals reported by participants in the oldest age group were more similar in content than goals reported by younger and middle-aged adults. That is, older adults' evaluations of how much each of their three most important goals had to do with 14 life domains evinced significantly less variance than the respective life-domain relevance ratings of younger and middleaged participants. (c) Participants in the oldest age group reported more subjectively central goals than did younger and middle-aged adults. That is, their three most important goals were more highly related to those life domains they regarded as highly important for their life satisfaction. 7 The remaining four age groups of young and middle-aged adults (covering the age range from 20 to 59 years old) were largely comparable in the extent of intergoal facilitation and in the three facets of motivational selectivity (for pairwise tests of mean differences between age groups, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>As a first step toward exploring factors underlying the observed pattern of age-group differences, we examined whether these age effects are due to the fact that, in contrast to all other age groups, most of the participants above age 60 were no longer involved in work or study (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). To investigate this, we derived an indicator of the participants' occupational status using the catego-ries (a) retired-homemaker, (b) working-studying (i.e., being employed, student, or trainee), (c) unemployed, and (d) other. We then conducted four hierarchical regression analyses with intergoal facilitation and the three motivational selectivity indicators as dependent variables. In a first step, occupational status was entered using dummy-variable coding and the occupational status category "retired/homemaker" as reference group. Unstandardized regression coefficients reflect mean differences in the dependent variable between participants who are retired or homemakers and participants of the other occupational status groups. In second and third steps, age (grand-mean centered) and the respective squared age term were added. (Note that we used age as a continuous, rather than categorical, variable in these and all following analyses.) Results are depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.</p><p>In two of the four analyses, occupational status explained significant amounts of variance in the dependent variable: Nonworking persons (i.e., retirees and homemakers) reported significantly fewer goals than both participants who were employed or in training and participants with unspecified occupational status of "other" (7% of variance explained). In addition, nonworking participants showed significantly less dissimilarity among their goals than all other occupational status categories (10% of variance 7 Please note that there were no age-related differences in the overall percentage of subjectively central life domains participants addressed with at least one of their goals (M ϭ 91.92, SD ϭ 12.70, p ϭ .73). What this result indicates is that participants in the oldest age group addressed with each single of their three most important goals, on average, a higher percentage of subjectively central life domains than did younger and middle-aged adults.  explained). Occupational status did not contribute to the prediction of centrality of goals and of intergoal facilitation. Of interest, after statistical control of participants' occupational status, the age terms still contributed significantly to the prediction of the two indicators of focusing-that is, (dis-) similarity and centrality of goals-and to the prediction of intergoal facilitation. The age terms did not, however, contribute significantly to the prediction of restricting after controlling for participants' occupational status. That is, age-group differences in occupational status did not account for the observed age-group differences in intergoal facilitation and the two indicators of focusing but might explain why older participants reported fewer goals than all other age groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Associations Between Study Variables</head><p>Bivariate correlations between study variables are depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. (Note that number and dissimilarity of goals were recoded so that higher scores indicate higher selectivity.) We tested all of these bivariate associations for interactions with participants' age. None of the age interactions were significant ( p Ͼ .21). We also investigated whether it is the simultaneous maximization of several facets of motivational selectivity that is associated with adaptive outcomes. This, however, was not the case. Specifically, we tested whether any of the following interactions significantly contributed to the predictions of intergoal facilitation and of goalpursuit intensity: (a) Restricting ϫ Similarity, (b) Restricting ϫ Centrality, (c) Similarity ϫ Centrality, and (d) Restricting ϫ Similarity ϫ Centrality. None of these interactions was statistically significant ( p Ͼ .09). In addition, we tested (e) the Restricting ϫ Similarity ϫ Centrality ϫ Facilitation interaction in the prediction of goal-pursuit intensity, which was also not significant ( p ϭ .94). All interactions were tested following multiple regression recommendations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aiken and West (1991)</ref>.</p><p>Using structural equation modeling and Amos 5.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arbuckle, 2003)</ref>, we conducted a series of analyses to simultaneously investigate our assumptions regarding associations between study variables. Because of few instances of missing data in the present data set (see the Method section), we used the full information maximum-likelihood (FIML) algorithm for the estimation of model parameters (for simulation studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the FIML algorithm in incomplete data sets, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Enders &amp; Bandalos, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Wothke, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>In Model 1 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), we tested the assumptions of our initial working model. According to this model, the two facets of motivational selectivity-restricting (the number of goals) and focusing (the content of goals)-quadratically increase from early to later adulthood and contribute to high intergoal facilitation, which in turn contributes to high behavioral engagement in goal pursuit. Again, we used the number of goals reported at T1 as an (inverse) indicator of restricting, and (dis-)similarity and centrality of goals as indicators of focusing. Number and dissimilarity of goals were recoded so that higher scores indicated higher selectivity. Indicators of intergoal facilitation were the two IRQ subscales: (a) Instrumental Relations Among Goals and (b) Overlapping Goal Attainment Strategies. Indicators of behavioral involvement in goal-pursuit activities, finally, were three 2-item parcels of the goal-pursuit scale participants responded to at T2. These parcels reflected how much (a) energy and (b) time participants had invested, since T1, into their three most important initially reported goals, and (c) how much these goals had determined their daily life in the study interval. To model the aforementioned finding of nonlinearity in the associations between age and the two facets of motivational selectivity (i.e., the steep increase in motivational selectivity in older adulthood), we included two age indicators: participants' raw age (in years) and the squared term of participants' age. To avoid specifications problems due to linear dependencies among variables, we followed recommendations by T. J. B. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kline and Dunn (2000)</ref> and derived the squared term from the grand-mean-centered age distribution. Means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations between all variables in the model are reported in the Appendix.</p><p>The overall fit of this model was satisfactory, 2 (29, N ϭ 175) ϭ 48.01, p ϭ .015; comparative fit index ϭ .97; nonnormed fit index ϭ .94; incremental fit index (Delta2) ϭ .97; root-meansquare error of approximation ϭ .06 (90% confidence interval ϭ .03 to .09). The model explained between 16% and 50% of the variance of the latent constructs (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). With one exception, all parameter estimates were significant ( ps Ͻ .05), and in the hypothesized direction (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>). The exception involved the path from restricting (the number of goals) to intergoal facilitation. To determine whether the size of this association was in fact negligible, we followed recommendations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gonzalez and Griffin (2001)</ref> and reestimated the model with the path from restricting to facilitation restricted to zero. Imposing this constraint did not significantly impair the overall model fit, ⌬ 2 (1, N ϭ 177) ϭ 2.92, p ϭ .09, which confirmed that the path from restricting to facilitation was not significantly different from zero.</p><p>With the aim of specifically addressing the mediational assumptions of our working model, we also tested a model that was identical with Model 1 but in addition allowed direct effects of the two age indicators on intergoal facilitation, and of the two motivational selectivity facets on goal-pursuit intensity. Consistent with our mediational assumptions, the overall fit of this model was not significantly better than that of Model 1: ⌬ 2 (4, N ϭ 177) ϭ 6.18, p ϭ .19, and none of the additionally included paths (direct effects) reached statistical significance ( p Ͼ .05).</p><p>We further investigated the hypothesized mediational role of intergoal facilitation by an analysis of the indirect effects of restricting and focusing on goal-pursuit intensity in Model 1: According to the modified Sobel test <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</ref>; see also R. B. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kline, 1998)</ref>, and consistent with our assumptions, the indirect effect of focusing (via intergoal facilitation) on goal pursuit intensity at T2 was significant (standardized indirect effect ϭ .22, p Ͻ .001). As there was no significant association between restricting and facilitation, however, the indirect effect of restricting (via intergoal facilitation) on goal pursuit intensity was not significantly different from zero (standardized indirect effect ϭ .14, p ϭ .09).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Results</head><p>As expected, older participants (60 -69 years of age) showed higher motivational selectivity in terms of restricting and focusing than did participants in all other age groups (20 -59 years of age). That is, compared with younger and middle-aged adults, older participants reported fewer goals, their goals were more similar to   each other in the life domains they addressed, and these life domains comprised to a larger extent those that the person regarded as highly central for his or her life satisfaction. Consistent with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Riediger et al., 2005)</ref>, we found that older participants also reported more intergoal facilitation (as indexed by instrumental relations among goals and overlapping goal attainment strategies) than did younger and middle-aged adults. These age effects, with one exception, could not be accounted for by age-group differences in occupational status. The exception involved motivational selectivity in terms of restricting to few goals. Three months after the assessment of motivational selectivity and intergoal facilitation, the five investigated age groups did not differ from each other in the extent of retrospectively reported behavioral involvement in the pursuit of their initially reported goals, even though the availability of goal-relevant resources is more limited in older than in younger phases of adulthood.</p><p>Structural equation modeling demonstrated that relations between study variables were largely consistent with our predictions. With one notable exception, the theoretical model fit the data well. Results confirmed that both facets of motivational selectivityrestricting and focusing-quadratically increased with age. Only motivational selectivity in terms of focusing, however, significantly contributed to high levels of intergoal facilitation, whereas motivational selectivity in terms of restricting did not. In fact, the analyses showed that the higher extent of intergoal facilitation in the oldest age group was completely accounted for by the older adults' higher motivational selectivity in terms of focusing. The analyses further confirmed that high intergoal facilitation contributes, on the behavioral side, to a high involvement in goal pursuit, and that selectivity in terms of focusing was associated with goal-pursuit involvement only via mediation of intergoal facilitation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Is it better to diversify and have many goals or to focus one's resources on a limited number of options? Under which conditions do people focus with similar goals on central domains of life rather than develop a divergent range of less central alternatives? Results of the present study support the hypothesis that motivational selectivity is an important process of adult developmental regulation. Beginning in the transition from middle to later adulthood, a phase in life when the availability of resources starts to decline and more and more losses are encountered, adults select fewer goals that are more highly related to central life domains and that are more similar in their relevance for life domains. Moreover, focusing (in terms of selecting central and similar goals), but not restricting (the number of goals), contributes to higher facilitation among goals, which, in turn, leads to stronger engagement in goal pursuit. People are more likely to pursue their goals when they focus on central and similar goals. Accordingly, motivational selectivity in terms of focusing appears to be an important process of adapting to changing resources in adulthood.</p><p>It is a distinctively human ability to flexibly adjust one's behavior to a vast variety of environmental conditions and demands. From an ontogenetic perspective, this opens a multitude of developmental options, even within the boundaries provided by biological and sociostructural constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Heckhausen, 1999)</ref>. Pursuing developmental options, however, takes resources, such as time, which are only available in restricted quantities <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baltes, 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baltes, , 1998;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Carstensen et al., 1999)</ref>. Current life span developmental theories, such as the SOC model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baltes &amp; Baltes, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Freund &amp; Baltes, 2000)</ref>, therefore emphasize the importance of focused investment of limited resources into a subset of developmental options.</p><p>In the present research, we investigated the expression, adult development, and behavioral function of selectivity as it is evident in people's goals. We distinguished two facets of motivational selectivity, namely, restricting to few goals and focusing on central and similar goals. Our prediction that more selective persons are more involved in the actual pursuit of their goals than are less selective persons was strongly confirmed with respect to motivational selectivity in terms of focusing (the content of goals). That is, the more similar a person's goals are, and the more they pertain to life domains the person regards as highly important for his or her life satisfaction, the more this person will actually engage in behaviors directed at the realization of the selected goals. This association holds independent of a person's age. Motivational selectivity in terms of restricting (the number of goals), however, was unrelated to the intensity of goal pursuit, which was again independent of the individual's age.</p><p>This leads to the question of why selectivity in terms of focusing is related to goal-pursuit behavior. Confirming our assumptions, we found that the beneficial effect of focusing on goal-pursuit behavior is mediated through a high extent of mutual facilitation among the participants' goals (as indexed by instrumental relations among these goals and by overlaps in respective goal attainment strategies). In other words, focusing on subjectively central and similar goals results in the tendency for these goals to be mutually facilitative, which, in turn, contributes to a high involvement in goal pursuit. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">8</ref> This finding is consistent with previous studies showing that intergoal facilitation is positively associated with the intensity of goal pursuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Riediger &amp; Freund, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Riediger et al., 2005)</ref>. A possible explanation is that mutual facilitation among goals enhances goal-directed activities by allowing an efficient utilization of one's (limited) resources in the interest of one's goals. Facilitative goals can be pursued simultaneously with little or no additional effort (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Riediger &amp; Freund, 2004)</ref>. The present study extends such previous research in an important way. So far, it was unclear which processes and characteristics contribute to mutually facilitative goals systems. Our findings indicate that motivational selectivity in terms of focusing plays a decisive role in this respect.</p><p>The present study further demonstrates that the transition from middle to later adulthood-a phase in life when resource limitations start to become increasingly pronounced-is characterized by a substantial increase in motivational selectivity, both in terms of restricting (the number of goals) and in terms of focusing (the content of goals), and by a sizable increase in the extent of mutual facilitation among goals. There were no systematic age-associated differences in the various facets of motivational selectivity and in intergoal facilitation among the age groups covering the age range from earlier to middle adulthood (i.e., 20 to 59 years of age).</p><p>An investigation of the respective role of age-group differences in occupational status indicated, with one exception, that these age-group differences are not attributable to retirement. After controlling for occupational status, age still contributed to the prediction of focusing (on central and similar goals) and of intergoal facilitation. Age did not, however, contribute to the prediction of restricting after controlling for occupational status. That is, whereas changing life circumstances due to retirement might explain why older adults reported fewer goals than did younger and middle-aged adults, they did not account for the fact that older adults select more similar and central goals and report higher intergoal facilitation. Our interpretation is that the reduction in the number of goals in the oldest age group might be a relatively unintentional consequence of the transition to retirement, which implies that work life, hitherto an important goal domain for most people, is no longer relevant for future-oriented aspirations. In contrast, it might be possible that the age effects in focusing and intergoal facilitation reflect older adults' intentional efforts to regulate aging-associated resource losses. These interpretations, however, remain speculative; we could not test them in the present study. We propose that future research would benefit from differentiating intentional (or self-initiated) from unintentional (or opportunistic) forms of motivational selectivity. Both forms of motivational selectivity might have differential functions for adaptive outcomes. On the basis of our findings, for example, we would derive the tentative prediction that it might be particularly selfinitiated (rather than opportunistic) selectivity that contributes to maintenance of high behavioral involvement in goal pursuit. Investigation of the intentionality or automaticity of the observed phenomena thus remains an intriguing quest for future investigations.</p><p>The results of the present study are consistent with previous research showing that older adults report higher levels of intergoal facilitation than do younger adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Riediger et al., 2005)</ref>. The present study extends the previous research in two respects. First, it does not just compare younger and older adults, as previous studies did, but is the first that investigated an age-heterogeneous sample covering the adult life span from 20 to 69 years of age. Results show that intergoal facilitation does not linearly increase from younger to older adult age groups, but that the increase in intergoal facilitation is specific to the transition from middle to later adulthood. Second, the present research demonstrates that this increase in intergoal facilitation is due to an increase in motivational selectivity in terms of focusing on subjectively central and similar goals, but not to an increase in motivational selectivity in terms of restricting the number of goals. As summarized earlier, mutual facilitation, in turn, contributed to a high involvement in goal-directed action. Accordingly, higher motivational selectivity in terms of focusing appears to have an important behavioral function in a life phase that is characterized by an accelerated increase in aging-associated resource losses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baltes, 1987)</ref>. It allows older adults, despite increasingly pronounced resource limitations, to stay involved in the pursuit of their goals and thus to actively influence the direction of their own development. In fact, the oldest age group was as involved in the pursuit of their goals as were all other age groups. Previous research has even shown that older adults tend to be more involved in goal pursuit than are younger adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Riediger et al., 2005)</ref>; this difference, however, did not reach statistical significance in the present sample.</p><p>The findings of the present study are based on a short-term longitudinal design. Motivational selectivity in terms of focusing and intergoal facilitation, assessed at T1, was predictive of the intensity of goal pursuit assessed 3 months later. This supports our interpretation that motivational selectivity in older adulthood ensures the maintenance of high levels of goal pursuit in a reality of increasingly limited resources (e.g., time to live). However, the available information is correlational and therefore does not allow definite conclusions about causality. Another limitation of the present research is that it neither provides information on intraindividual change as people age nor permits modeling of cohort-and age-associated selection effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lindenberger, Singer, &amp; Baltes, 2002)</ref>. Furthermore, the present sample only covers the age span from 20 to 69 years old. Empirically, it remains open to future research whether the observed findings also apply to very old adults (i.e., the fourth age, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baltes, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baltes &amp; Smith, 2003)</ref>. In addition, the present study relied on self-report in the assessment of goal-pursuit intensity. It remains an interesting task for future studies to investigate whether convergent evidence can be obtained with different methodological approaches (e.g., objective behavioral observations). Finally, although we introduced an expanded heuristic of assessing motivational selectivity, other facets of motivational selectivity might be possible and worthy of empirical investigation from a developmental perspective. Selectivity in terms of focusing, for example, might take other forms than the two content-related aspects of selecting similar and central goals that we investigated in the present study. An example could be selectivity in terms of focusing on those goals for which one has the appropriate resources (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Diener &amp; Fujita, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>In summary, we propose in this article that selectivity, as reflected in a person's goals, is a multifaceted phenomenon. Previous research has investigated motivational selectivity primarily in terms of restricting to few goals. We posit that another important facet of motivational selectivity is focusing on subjectively central and similar goals. In fact, the present study demonstrates that it is this facet of focusing (rather than that of restricting) that has important behavioral consequences. Focusing is associated with an enhanced involvement in goal-pursuit activities. This association is mediated by the degree of mutual facilitation among the individual's goals. The study further showed that the transition from middle to older adulthood is characterized by a pronounced increase in motivational selectivity (both in terms of restricting and focusing). Older adults select fewer and more similar goals that address subjectively central life domains to a greater extent compared with younger and middle-aged adults. The age-related increase in focusing (selection of similar and central goals), in turn, is reflected in an increase in mutual facilitation among goals, which, as mentioned before, is positively associated with goalpursuit intensity. We conclude that the behavioral function of older adults' pronounced motivational selectivity in terms of focusing is the maintenance of a high level of involvement in goal-pursuit activities, even despite age-associated increases in resource limitations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
