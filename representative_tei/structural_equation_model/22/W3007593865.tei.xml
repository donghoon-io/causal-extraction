<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Culinary tourism offers tourists to learn new cultures through their experiences with local food of the visited destinations. Although the concept of experience quality and tourist satisfaction in the context of culinary tourism have been discussed in many previous studies, these variables have not been linked to destination experience satisfaction.The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of culinary experience quality on behavioural intentions in Indonesia, with culinary experience satisfaction and destination experience satisfaction as mediating variables.</p><p>In total, 396 international tourists who travelled to one of the four gastronomy destinations of Denpasar, Solo, Bandung and Yogyakarta participated in the survey.

Local food is one of the most essential elements of a total destination experience of tourists. Meanwhile, when tourists taste local cuisine, they learn about the destination's culture. The encounter of tasting the local cuisine can be very memorable for them so that it may motivate them to revisit the place in the future <ref type="bibr">(Stone, Soulard, Migacz, &amp; Wolf, 2018</ref>). An empirical study analyzed the relationship between culinary experience quality and behavioural intentions (loyalty) with culinary experience satisfaction as the mediator <ref type="bibr">(Agyeiwaah, Otoo, Suntikul, Huang, 2018)</ref>. When tourists get good quality of culinary experience, they will be satisfied with the culinary experience which then they will intent to revisit the tourist destination in the future.</p><p>Studies by <ref type="bibr">Kivela and Crotts (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Björk and Kauppinen-Räisänen (2016)</ref> emphasized the importance of understanding the relationship between food and tourism; there is a relationship between culinary experience and satisfaction of tourists, the culinary experience satisfaction and the destination experience satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Peštek and Činjarević, 2014)</ref>. A tourist's experience of local culinary of the visited destinations influences the overall travel experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Babolian Hendijani, 2016</ref>). An impressive and unforgettable culinary experience can also trigger the branding of the destination and most importantly, contribute to the overall satisfaction of tourists. There is also a positive significant relationship between food image and intention to visit a destination (Ab <ref type="bibr">Karim and Chi, 2010)</ref>. The destination experience satisfaction affects the behavioral intention of tourists. The satisfied tourists tend to visit the same destination and give positive word-of-mouth <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Roozbeh, Ng, &amp; Boo, 2013)</ref>. However, there was no previous studies to analyze the relationship between culinary experience quality and behavioural intentions with culinary experience satisfaction as well as destination experience satisfaction as the mediating variables. Tourism is one of the fastest growing sectors in Indonesia and has become one of the main contributors of Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP). It accounts for approximately four percent of the total economy. The government of Indonesia wants to have doubled the contribution to eight percent of GDP by 2019 <ref type="bibr">(Indonesia Investment Newsletter, 2018)</ref>. In 2018, there were roughly 15.81 million international tourists visiting Indonesia. This figure showed a growth rate of 12.58% above the figure for 2017 <ref type="bibr">(Kemenpar, 2018)</ref>. Interestingly, based on the distribution of international tourists expenditure, the expenditure for food and beverage becomes the second biggest expenditure around 20.40% <ref type="bibr">(Badan Pusat Statistik, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Culinary tourism has been prioritized for development as one of the seven types of special interest tourism in Indonesia. Culinary tourism is expected to be the main factor attaching other tourism activities, considering the fact that tourism is a multi-attribute and prospective sector functioning not only as a gate, but also as the image of Indonesian tourism. The Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy of Indonesia designated five cities as Indonesia's gastronomy destinations, namely: Bandung, Solo, Yogyakarta, Denpasar and Semarang. The designated of five cities based on six criterias, such as product and main attraction; product and event packaging; service quality; environmental factors; business feasibility; and the role of the government in developing culinary tourism <ref type="bibr">(Kemenpar, 2015)</ref>. In this case, the study was focused on the four gastronomy destinations, Denpasar, Yogyakarta, Bandung and Solo.</p><p>To date, not much research has been done in terms of the relationship between the culinary experience quality, the culinary experience satisfaction, the destination experience satisfaction, and the behavioral intention specfically in Denpasar, Yogyakarta, Bandung and Solo, as the four most prominent tourist destinations of Indonesia. Therefore, the authors are addressed to analyze more deeply about how the culinary experience quality of international tourists in Denpasar, Yogyakarta, Bandung and Solo could affect the behavioral intention. This will be very much beneficial for the local government to develop local culinary in Denpasar, Yogyakarta, Bandung and Solo that will give culinary experience for the international tourists.</p><p>On this basis, the objectives of this study are to:</p><p>1. Examine the effect of culinary experience quality on culinary experience satisfaction 2. Investigate the effect of culinary experience satisfaction on destination experience satisfaction.</p><p>3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Culinary Experience Quality</head><p>Food is a basic sustenance for every tourist during their travel. Each tourist needs food when traveling since it is a basic sustenance that must be fulfilled. Regardless of whether culinary activity becomes the main goal or just as a satisfying need during the trip, a person's culinary experience would shape the image of the culinary enjoyed. One's culinary experience could affect the overall experience of the visited destinations <ref type="bibr">(Ignatov and Smith, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Wijaya, King, Nguyen, &amp; Morrison (2013)</ref> propose a conceptual framework of international visitor dining experiences with local food, by examining the experiences in the course of the pre-, during, and post-dining stages. The pre-dining stage refers to how international visitors foresee their engagement with the various aspects that may concern dining with local food, as well as the prospect of associated experiential outcomes. The during-dining stage relates to actual encounters with local food within the destination, as reflected in visitor perceptions of the dining experience. Lastly, the post-dining stage refers to visitor satisfaction and behavioral intentions that emerge after the dining experience has been concluded. It is important to note that culinary experience is subjective, meaning the culinary experience is influenced by the individual's own experience <ref type="bibr">(Sfandla and Björk, 2013)</ref>. Similar to <ref type="bibr">Wijaya et al.'s (2013)</ref> framework, <ref type="bibr">Björk and Kauppinen-Räisänen (2014)</ref> depict that culinary experience refers to the process in which each experience occurs in various stages, i.e. before experience (e.g. searching for a restaurant or food), during experience (e.g. meal experience) and after the experience of eating (e.g. purchasing local food as souvenirs. It should also be noted that the culinary experience is something subjective, meaning that the culinary experience is influenced by the individual's own experience. Destination management organizations (DMOs) could use culinary as a representative of cultural experience, status, cultural identity, as well as how to communicate the tourist destinations <ref type="bibr">(Horng, Liu, Chou, and Tsai, 2012)</ref>. Further, <ref type="bibr">Silkes, Cai, &amp; Lehto (2013)</ref> noted that food could show a unique and most memorable experience for the whole trip. <ref type="bibr">Andersson and Mossberg (2004)</ref> state that culinary experience is multi-dimensional, that is, the measurement of the quality of the culinary experience can not be seen only from one dimension of the food, but there are other dimensions especially in the context of a tourist experience with a culinary region that is never consumed previous. Review of the literature has shown that there are three major dimensions to measure the quality of culinary experience with local food at a destination. These dimensions are: 1) food dimension that relates to attributes of taste, food authenticity and food uniqueness; 2) social dimension that includes the extent of which tourists could interact with the locals and experience the hospitality and distinct culture of the host; and 3) place and time dimension that refers to the physical place where the eating experience with local food take place, as well as when the eating experience occurs <ref type="bibr">(Hendijani, Ng, &amp; Boo, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Peštek and Činjarević, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wijaya, King, Morrison, &amp; Nguyen, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Culinary is an important component of tourism products, and plays an important role in creating an impressive tourist experience <ref type="bibr">(Peštek and Činjarević, 2014)</ref>. It is viewed as a form of special interest tourism offering "real" travel. Recognized as part of cultural tourism, it provides real learning opportunities by introducing visitors to the new and exciting smells, tastes, and flavors of local cultures <ref type="bibr">(Ignatov &amp; Smith, 2006)</ref>. Babolian <ref type="bibr">Hendijani (2016)</ref> suggested that by consuming local foods, tourist can conceive the identities and ethnicities of people of a given destination. In terms of cultural point of view, food experience portrays the images of cultural experience, status and cultural identity. Such cultural aspect is usually developed from the unique aspects of food experiences that can only be attained in that particular destination.</p><p>Therefore, food is something that is deeply rooted in the culture and traditions of a region.</p><p>Experiencing local foods on vacation is a type of pleasurable sensory experience <ref type="bibr">(Kivela and Crotts, 2006)</ref>. Foods also provide sensory experiences that enhance the pleasure of a vacation and attract tourists to a destination.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that there is an increase in the search for new experiences for consumers <ref type="bibr">(Wang, 2016)</ref>. While on vacation, tourist will tend to look after new experiences which are never been achieved before, including enjoying traditional, authentic, unique and new food <ref type="bibr">(Björk and Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2013)</ref>. A variety of food-related characteristics such as preparation, cooking style, presentation, dining customs, food culture, and food consumption can be included to construct experiences that tourist has with food at the destination. Culinary experience is not only influenced by traditional food, but also can be influenced by social aspect, external environment, and services provide in a particular destination <ref type="bibr">(Björk and Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2013)</ref>. Thus, each of these aspects can make a memorable trip for tourists. The sensory aspects of food enable tourists to experience the culture of a particular country on a deeper level <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Babolian Hendijani, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Culinary Experience Satisfaction</head><p>Many researchers have identified that food experience at a destination can represent an important source of satisfaction for tourists <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Babolian Hendijani, 2016)</ref>. Babolian Hendijani (2016) also found that food has a significant result on tourists' overall satisfaction with the trip. Thus, suggested that a new food experience brings excitement to people's lives, and this experience is considered a means of improving oneself when expectation and satisfaction are combined. <ref type="bibr">Kivela and Crotts (2006)</ref> mentioned that food can increase value to the tourist experience and is associated with tourism quality for tourists in search of new experiences that yield a high level of satisfaction. In general, it seems that food significantly contributes to tourists' overall satisfaction.</p><p>Satisfaction is commonly viewed as an indicator of experience quality <ref type="bibr">(Ryan, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Satisfaction is not just about the joy of travel experience but also an evaluation that makes the experience as good as it should be. In line with the culinary experience dimensions as described earlier, <ref type="bibr">Björk and Kauppinen-Räisänen (2016)</ref> in their study explain that tourist satisfaction towards culinary experience could be measured based on three aspects of: 1) what food or local cuisine being served; where the food is served; and how the food is served.</p><p>Extensive research has been devoted to investigating the linkage between culinary experience and tourist behavior constructs such as satisfaction, behavioral intention, and loyalty. A study in Portugal has been accomplished to identify the determinants of international visitor satisfaction with Portugal's gastronomy tourism. It revealed three significant factors: local gastronomy; atmosphere; and food quality and price as the most important determinants of visitors' satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Correia, Moital, Da Costa &amp; Peres, 2008)</ref>. Another empirical study was also conducted in Malaysia confirming that food plays an important and interesting role in enhancing destination experience. A positive culinary experience quality perceived by tourists specifically the first-time travellers indicating culinary satisfaction, which in turn, it can be used to trigger revisit intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Babolian Hendijani, Sambasivan, Ng, &amp; Boo, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Destination Experience Satisfaction</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Murphy, Pritchard, and Smith (2000)</ref>, destinations can be viewed as a set of complementary tourism products and services to form travel experience in an area visited by tourists. Tourist perception on the quality of destination experience is determined by service infrastructure and destination environment. Service infrastructure consists of a set of products and services that offer a direct experience for travellers when they are in a destination, which includes travel agency services, food service businesses, accommodation and transport services.</p><p>Destination environment is a component supporting the provision of experience for tourists encompassing: the natural environment, political conditions, availability of technology, economic conditions, and socio-cultural factors of a destination.</p><p>Satisfaction in the context of tourism industry is described as tourists' assessment based on experiences they have been through <ref type="bibr">(Sukiman, Omar, Muhibudin, Yussof, &amp; Mohamed, 2013)</ref>. The provision and quality of elements such as attractions, public and private facilities, accessibility, human resources, image and character, also price can impact on shaping the experience, satisfaction, and also the decision of tourists to travel <ref type="bibr">(World Tourism Organization, 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Sukiman et al. (2013)</ref> also said that tourist satisfaction can be influenced by the quality of the products (presentation, taste, smell) and the quality of service (place, easy access, friendly staff), which then need tourist emotional reaction as an assessment. The satisfaction of a group of tourist and service facilities in a location is the benchmark for the satisfaction of tourist destinations <ref type="bibr">(Wang, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In relation to eating experience, Ab <ref type="bibr">Karim and Chi (2010)</ref> contend that tourist's experience with local culinary would affect their perception of the overall experience with the visited destination. Moreover, the perception of tourists towards the experience of destination will have a positive effect on satisfaction, which in turn, could give a positive impact on the intention to revisit the destination and the intention give referrals to others <ref type="bibr">(Barnes, Mattsson &amp; Sorensen, 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral Intentions</head><p>Behavioral intentions often stem from a structured decision-making which go through the processes of selecting, delivering, and using products, services, experiences, or ideas in satisfying needs and desires <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Babolian Hendijani, et al., 2013)</ref>. Individuals behavioral intentions sometimes can be viewed by the willingness to use again something that has been used before, to go back to a place where has been visited before, to feel again services that have been enjoyed before, or willingness to share positive informations about a place or a thing to families or acquaintances. This is the result of overall tourist satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Amoah, Radder, and van Eyk, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Altintzoglou et al., (2016)</ref> said that a satisfied tourist will tend to have the urge to tell their acquaintances or relatives about the experience they have just enjoyed in demand for their acquaintances and relatives wanting to have the exact same experience. Sometimes, a positive emotion from tourist leaves a positive memory toward a particular destination which then lead the tourist to revisit the place to have the same feeling once again.</p><p>Tourist behavioral intentions would lead to his loyalty toward particular destination or tourism-related activity. There are two widely common indicators used to measure behavioral intentions <ref type="bibr">(Prayag, Hosany, &amp; Odeh, 2013)</ref>. First is the intention to give referral or recommendations to other people that occurs when tourists are eager to talk about their tourism experiences (word of mouth) to their relatives or friends. Second is revisit intention, meaning that tourists whose tourism experiences are positive would have the tendency travel again to enjoy the destination or to do the same tourism activities as previously he had <ref type="bibr">(Björk, &amp; Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Many studies have examined the relationship between variables that affect consumer behavior intentions. Tourist behavior has now focused on tourist satisfaction, as tourist satisfaction influences the decision of tourists to return <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Rajaratnam, Nair, Pahlevan Sharif, &amp; Munikrishnan, 2015)</ref>. One of the triggers of consumer behavior (in this case tourists) is the satisfaction of tourists to destinations and culinary <ref type="bibr">(Peštek and Činjarević, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Rajaratnam et al. (2015)</ref> add that culinary experience demand such emotional response from tourist which will affect towards tourist behavior intentions in the future ahead. <ref type="bibr">Prayag et al. (2013)</ref>, then suggested that there is a significant relation between tourist satisfaction and behavior intentions.</p><p>The Relationships Among Culinary Experience Quality, Culinary Experience Satisfaction,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Destination Experience Satisfaction, and Behavioural Intentions</head><p>Culinary is one component of tourism products which plays an important role in creating an impressive tourist experience <ref type="bibr">(Peštek and Činjarević, 2014)</ref> consume traditional foods, will also looking for impressive new culinary experiences (Bjӧrk dan Kauppinen-Rӓisӓnen, 2014). In addition, <ref type="bibr">Peštek and Činjarević (2014)</ref> explained that the culinary experience is a combination of tourist's opinions, the attributes of food, and the response of tourists that involves their feelings. The response is an evaluation of the whole culinary experience, that will assess whether it is good or not. Based on the above explanation, the culinary experience is considered as a phenomenon that not only involves food as a whole but also includes emotions from tourists. The following hypothesis was deducted from the earlier study.</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Culinary experience quality (CEQ) has a positive and significant impact on culinary experience satisfaction (CES).</p><p>Food experiences are important to destinations. Positive engagement that tourists have with food and drink would lead to memorable dining experience. Such experiences have been associated with an increase in travel satisfaction and positive word of mouth <ref type="bibr">(Stone, et. al., 2018)</ref>. Culinary has a role as a national identity. Whereas, culinary will help to present the identity and culture of a destination, and also create perception and opinion about the building views, and destination images (Ab <ref type="bibr">Karim and Chi, 2010)</ref>. Therefore, Bjӧrk dan Kauppinen-Rӓisӓnen (2014) explained that food plays important role in creating the satisfaction of tourists to a destination. Hence the hypothesis appears as follows:</p><p>Hypothesis 2: Culinary experience satisfaction (CES) has a positive and significant impact on the destination experience satisfaction (DES). Ab <ref type="bibr">Karim and Chi (2010)</ref> stated that food and destinations are inseparable and food can influence the tourist's destination decision. Food is also regarded as a cultural identifier of a destination <ref type="bibr">(Peštek and Činjarević, 2014)</ref>. In addition, research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Babolian Hendijani, et al. (2013)</ref> also confirmed that in Malaysia, food plays an important and interesting role in enhancing destination experience. A positive culinary experience quality perceived by tourists specifically the first-time travelers indicates culinary satisfaction, which in turn, can be used to trigger revisit intention. World Tourism Organization (2007) stated that the culinary experience is one of the attraction factors, which is able to encourage the satisfaction of tourists to a destination. Based on the above discussion, the following hypothesis was proposed as:</p><p>Hypothesis 3: Culinary experience quality (CEQ) has a positive and significant impact on the destination experience satisfaction (DES) <ref type="bibr">Kim, Ritchie &amp; McCormick (2012)</ref> urge that destination managers and tourism businesses should know how to develop a memorable experience is important. A destination that is memorable will have a competitive advantage since it could offer more outstanding and exceptional experiences. Local cuisines of a destination is therefore could be utilised by Destination Management Organizations (DMOs) as a means to represent cultural experience, status, cultural identity, as well as how to communicate the tourist destinations <ref type="bibr">(Horng et al., 2012)</ref>. Further, <ref type="bibr">Silkes et al. (2013)</ref> noted that food could show a unique and most memorable experience of the whole trip. Therefore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Babolian Hendijani, et al. (2013)</ref> showed that food could give additional attraction to the destination. Moreover, destination satisfaction does not only trigger the repeated selection of a tourist destination but also affect the tourist's behavior intentions as a whole <ref type="bibr">(Rajaratnam, et. al, 2015)</ref>. travelers apply the memory of the tourist experience in determining travel intentions (for example, the option to revisit a tourist attraction or re-repeat an experience). Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Babolian Hendijani, et al. (2013)</ref> also explain that local food can be used to drive tourism products and trigger repeated travel intentions in a tourist destination. On this basis, the following hypotheses were formulated:</p><p>Hypothesis 4: Culinary experience satisfaction (CES) and destination experience satisfaction (DES) has a positive and significant impact on tourist's behavioral intention (BI).</p><p>Hypothesis 4a: Culinary experience satisfaction (CES) has a positive and significant impact on tourist's behavioral intention (BI).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 4b: Destination experience satisfaction (DES) has a positive and significant impact on tourist's behavioral intention (BI).</head><p>The reseach model of the study describing the relationships among the latent variables is presented in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">1</ref>.</p><p>Insert Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">1</ref> here</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODOLOGY</head><p>The samples were representative of the indefinite population of international tourists in four cities (Denpasar, Jogjakarta, Solo and Bandung). The sampling process used was purposive sampling meaning that the respondents should be at least 21 years old, and have enjoyed local food during their visit.</p><p>The questionnaire was divided into five sections. Section 1 sought information about participant demographics such as gender, age, occupation, the purpose of visit and the length of stay. Section 2 contained questions related to the culinary experience quality of domestic tourists in four selected gastronomy cities. In section 3, the participants were requested to state opinions regarding culinary experience satisfaction in the city whereby they visited.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS</head><p>The findings of this study is significant in a way that it contributes to the understanding of the variables influencing the behavioral intentions of the international tourists visiting Indonesia specifically in Denpasar, Solo, Bandung and Yogyakarta. Based on the hypothesis testing, it was confirmed that culinary experience quality (CEQ) positively and significantly influenced both the culinary experience satisfaction (CES) and destination experience satisfaction (DES). It shows that the higher the culinary experience quality, the higher the satisfaction both the culinary and destination experiences. When tourists visit the tourist destinations in Indonesia and they find that the culinary experience is favourable, they will be more likely to be contended with both the culinary experience as well as the destination experience. This is relevant with the previous studies which discover that culinary has a significant role in creating the high-quality traveling experience and making the high satisfaction of the tourists with the tourist destination <ref type="bibr">(Kivela &amp; Crotts, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tsai, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Widjaja., et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, culinary experience satisfaction (CES) had a positive and significant influence on destination experience satisfaction (DES). It means that the improvement of culinary experience satisfaction will cause the destination experience satisfaction to improve as well. In addition, destination experience experience (DES) itself gave positive and significant influence on behavioral intentions (BI). That is, the higher the satisfaction of the tourists on the destination experience, the higher the intentions of the tourists to revisit the place or to recommend it to others. Furthermore, culinary experience satisfaction also gave a significant effect on behavioral intentions. It means that the improvement of culinary experience satisfaction will result on international tourist intentions to revisit or to recommend the place to others. When tourists enjoy the culinary experience, they will be more likely to be satisfied with the tourist destination and the possibility for them to return to the place is higher as well as the intention to recommend the destination to others. This is relevant with the previous study findings that when tourists enjoy local cuisines, they will have unforgettable tourism experiences which will create strong attachment to the tourist destination and they will be more likely to return to the destination or recommend it to others <ref type="bibr">(Kivela &amp; Crotts, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tsai, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kristanti, et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the total effect calculation, the indirect effect that gave the most effect on behavioral intentions was the one which was mediated by culinary experience satisfaction and destination experience satisfaction. It implies that the international tourists are more likely to revisit the place or recommend the place to others if they find that the culinary experience quality is good and they will be satisfied with the culinary experience. As a result, they will also be satisfied with the destination experience which finally will lead to their intention to revisit the place in the future. There are three factors composing the culinary experience quality (CEQ), namely: food factor (uniqueness of the food presentation), social factor (different way of service) and dining place (dining ambience reflecting the local culture). Among the three factors, food factor is the most influential factor reflecting the customer experience quality. In this case, the finding supports the previous studies emphasizing the three major dimensions to assess culinary experience quality, they are: food dimension (food authenticity), social dimension (local people's hospitality), and place and time dimension (dining environment). It was found in the study that culinary experience quality was constructed mainly by unique food presentation in food dimension, different style of service in social dimension and ambience of the dining place in dining place dimension <ref type="bibr">(Tsai &amp; Lu, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Widjaja, et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, the result of this current study is in contrast with the previous study. The previous study findings revealed food quality was the main satisfier indicator of culinary experience satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Peštek and Činjarević, 2014)</ref>. While this study found that the quality of the dining place appeared to be the main satisfier indicator of culinary experience satisfaction (CES). In terms of destination experience satisfaction, there were three main satisfier indicators constructing the satisfaction, namely: good value for money (DES8), accomodation facility (DES4) and infrastructure (DES3). It indicates that participants who were the international tourists found that they were satisfied with the good value for money, accomodation facility and the infrastructure when visiting Denpasar, Solo, Bandung and Yogyakarta.</p><p>Finally, in terms of behavioral intentions, the main indicator was future intention to revisit the place (BI3). It means that the participants are more likely to revisit the place if they find that the culinary experience quality is good, they are satisfied with the culinary experience which then they are also satisfied with the destination experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH</head><p>This study revealed how culinary experience quality contributes to the foreign tourists' behavior intention through culinary experience satisfaction and destination experience satisfaction. It means that the higher the culinary experience quality, the higher the satisfaction both the culinary and destination experiences. The higher the satisfaction of the tourists on the destination experience and culinary experience, the higher the intentions of the tourists to revisit the place or to recommend it to others. The result also highlights the significant role of local food unique presentation on improving tourists' culinary experience quality. In line with the previous studies, these findings confirmed that travelers' positive experience of local food will lead to their satisfaction of the local culinary and the destination, furthermore will increase their intention to recommend and revisit the destination.</p><p>Understanding this model will aid government to identify the way to preserve local food and develop it in facing globalization era.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:</head><p>Reviewer: 1 Comments to the Author This paper examines behavioral intentions of gastronomy experiences in Indonesia where a lacuna of studies exist and as a result the authors have to be commended. However, to merit publication, the paper requires significant improvement. The major shortcomings of the paper are lack of theoretical foundation and operational definitions of the constructs under study. Hence, there are the use of compound constructs without clear operationalization of what they imply and specific studies that used the exact terms. For instance, terms like "culinary experience satisfaction", "destination experience satisfaction" etc are common in the paper. The construct culinary experience is not the same as culinary satisfaction. And this is evident in the literature review where the study previous studies use constructs that are clearer and simpler than what the authors are proposing. The authors cite studies such as <ref type="bibr">Agyeiwaah et al. (2019)</ref> which develops a model that tests relation among culinary experience, satisfaction, etc. and that of <ref type="bibr">Andersson and Mossberg (2004)</ref> study on dining experience. Experience and experience quality do not mean the same thing. This problem of forcing some constructs to fit the study is disturbing which are all due to the fact that the paper was not informed thoroughly by theory and existing literature as authors create their own compound terms. I recommend the authors to follow a good example by Chen and Chen (2010) Experience quality, perceived value, satisfaction and behavioral intentions for heritage tourists. Due to this lack of theory, the hypothesis support is not specific to the study constructs. <ref type="bibr">Prayag et al. (2013)</ref> study tested tourist satisfaction while this current manuscript is destination experience satisfaction and behavioral intention. Hence, how do you convince readers these constructs are the same and could be compared? Again, the objectives on page 4 need re-work. On objective 3, how did the authors observe the effects of the named constructs? Investigate/examine/explore sounds better than observe. On the method section, repetition is found on page 14, para 2 &amp;3 "…culinary experience satisfaction were translated to overall satisfaction.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comments to the Author Comments to the Author</head><p>The topic is interesting and relevant to investigate the effects of culinary experience qualities, tourists' satisfaction and behavioural intentions in a context of culinary tourism. However, it is difficult to address the specific research gap in literature, and thereby the relevance for the field and the theoretical contribution to the research dialogue. Therefore, the paper is not yet of publishable standard. I would make some comments that may be helpful for the author to integrate in the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>In the introduction, the author mention literature regarding the behavioural intentions 'revisit the place' and 'positive word-ofmouth'. Why are these variables not divided into 1) 'revisit the destination' and 2) 'recommend the destination' in this study instead of treating them like one behavioural intention? 'However, there was no previous studies to analyse the relationship between culinary experience quality and behavioural intentions with culinary experience satisfaction as well as destination experience satisfaction as the mediating variables' (p.2).</p><p>The author must specify the research gap from previous research and literature. The statement must be rooted in previous research with relevant references from the literature review. The author must convince the reader about this, for example by referring to previous research showing that this is important knowledge. Do the study use culinary experience satisfaction as well as destination experience satisfaction as the mediating variables? If this is the case, CEQ may appear to affect BI in one of three ways: directly, indirectly as mediated by CES or DES, or both. The author has only measured the indirect way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature review and methodology:</head><p>There is no clear link between the literature in the literature review and the methodology for the chosen sub-variables. For example, why are not <ref type="bibr">Kivela and Crotts (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Wang (2016) (p. 14)</ref> mentioned in the Literature review regarding CES and DES (p.8)?</p><p>Please show the specific scale items in the questionnaire e.g. Food factor, Social factor and Dining Place factor, in other words: please enclose the questionnaire for the study.</p><p>Please include a table with 'Profile of Tourist Travelers' including nationality, age etc. and the frequency in numbers (N) and %.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and implications:</head><p>Please divide the implications in theoretical and practical implications in the manuscript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and future research:</head><p>The main theoretical contribution to the research dialogue in the conclusion, is missing in the manuscript, and also the limitations. this study aimed to investigate tourist experience quality of culinary tourism in Indonesia by examining the relationships between the quality of culinary experience, the satisfaction of culinary experience, the satisfaction of destination experience, and behavioural intentions using a structural equation modelling approach. In total, 395 international tourists who travelled to Indonesian gastronomy destinations participated in the survey. The result showed the direct effects of the culinary experience quality on culinary experience satisfaction and destination experience satisfaction. However, it is the indirect and not direct effects of the quality of culinary experience quality that impact on behavioural intentions when mediated by culinary experience satisfaction and destination experience satisfaction.</p></div>

The government has aimed to double the tourism contribution to reach at 5.5 percent of total GDP by 2019 (Kemenpar, 2018).</p><p>In 2018, there were 15.81 million international tourists visiting Indonesia. This figure showed a growth rate of 12.58% compared to the statistics in 2017 <ref type="bibr">(Kemenpar, 2018)</ref>. Food and beverage is the second biggest expenditure (around 20.40%) of the total international tourist expenditures (Badan Pusat Statistik, 2017). Recognising its potential contribution to the national tourism industry, culinary tourism has been prioritized to be strategically promoted as one of the seven types of special interest tourism in Indonesia targeting the international market. Culinary tourism is expected to be the main factor attaching other tourism activities, considering the fact that tourism is a multi-attribute and prospective sector functioning not only as a gate, but also as the image of Indonesian tourism. The Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy of Indonesia has designated five cities as Indonesia's gastronomy destinations, namely: Bandung, Solo, Yogyakarta, Denpasar and Semarang. The designation of five cities based on six following criteria: product and main attractions; product and event packaging; service quality; environmental factors; business feasibility; and the role of the government in developing culinary tourism <ref type="bibr">(Kemenpar, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The extant literature has shown that most of the culinary tourism studies were undertaken in developed tourist destination geographical context <ref type="bibr">(Agyeiwaah et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Henderson, 2009)</ref>. Indonesia, as an emerging tourism destination in Asia have well known for its natural and cultural richness whose culinary uniqueness is worth to be explored. Current research examining Indonesian local culinary diversity in the international market is still limited. Having said this, it is timely to conduct an empirical investigation in Indonesia, to analyse more deeply about how the culinary experience quality of international tourists in the major gastronomy cities could affect the behavioural intention. This will be very much beneficial for the local governments to set up the strategies for promoting culinary tourism to the international market and offering more memorable culinary tourism experiences for the international tourists. Specifically, the objectives of the present study were: 1) to examine the effect of culinary experience quality on culinary experience satisfaction; 2) to investigate the effect of culinary experience satisfaction on destination experience satisfaction; 3) to investigate the effect of culinary experience quality on the destination experience satisfaction; 5) to examine the effect of culinary experience satisfaction and the destination experience satisfaction on the behavioural intentions; and 6) to examine the indirect relationships between culinary experience quality, culinary experience satisfaction, destination experience satisfaction, and behavioural intentions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Culinary Experience Quality</head><p>Culinary experience quality is an adapted concept from experience quality that is applied in culinary tourism context. According to Chen and Chen (2010), experience quality is the psychological outcome as a result of customer participation in tourism-related activities, including the engagement with local food of the visited destination. Food is a basic sustenance for every tourist during their travel. Each tourist needs food when travelling since it is a basic sustenance that must be fulfilled. Regardless of whether culinary activity becomes the main goal or just as a satisfying need during the trip, a person's culinary experience would shape the image of the culinary enjoyed. Culinary experience is subjective, meaning the culinary experience is influenced by the individual's own experience <ref type="bibr">(Sfandla &amp; Björk, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Wijaya, King, Nguyen, and Morrison (2013)</ref> depict the tourist's local food experience as three consecutive stages of: pre-, during, and post-dining. The pre-dining stage refers to how international visitors foresee their engagement with the various aspects that may concern dining with local food, as well as the prospect of associated experiential outcomes. The during-dining stage relates to actual encounters with local food within the destination, as reflected in visitor perceptions of the dining experience. Lastly, the post-dining stage refers to visitor satisfaction and behavioral intentions that emerge after the dining experience has been concluded.</p><p>While <ref type="bibr">Wijaya et al. (2013)</ref> have looked culinary experience as sequential stages, <ref type="bibr">Andersson and Mossberg (2004)</ref> discuss it as multi-dimensional construct. That is, the measurement of the quality of the culinary experience can not be seen only from one dimension of the food, but there are other dimensions, especially in the context of a tourist experience with a culinary region that is never consumed previous. Review of the literature has shown that there are three major dimensions to measure the quality of culinary experience with local food at a destination. These dimensions are: 1) food dimension that relates to attributes of taste, food authenticity and food uniqueness; 2) social dimension that includes the extent of which tourists could interact with the locals and experience the hospitality and distinct culture of the host; and</p><p>3) place and time dimension that refers to the physical place where the eating experience with local food take place, as well as when the eating experience occurs <ref type="bibr">(Hendijani et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Peštek &amp; Činjarević, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wijaya et al., 2017)</ref>. Culinary tourism is viewed as a form of special interest tourism offering 'real' travel.</p><p>Recognized as part of cultural tourism, it provides real learning opportunities by introducing visitors to the new and exciting smells, tastes, and flavours of local cultures <ref type="bibr">(Ignatov &amp; Smith, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Hendijani (2016)</ref> suggest that by consuming local foods, tourist can conceive the identities and ethnicities of people of a given destination. From the cultural viewpoint, food experience portrays the images of cultural experience, status and cultural identity. Such cultural aspect is usually developed from the unique aspects of food experiences that can only be attained in that particular destination. Therefore, food is something that is deeply rooted in the culture and traditions of a region. Experiencing local foods on vacation is a type of pleasurable sensory experience <ref type="bibr">(Kivela &amp; Crotts, 2006)</ref>. Foods also provide sensory experiences that enhance the pleasure of a vacation and attract tourists to a destination.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that there is an increase in the search for new experiences for consumers <ref type="bibr">(Wang, 2016)</ref>. While on vacation, tourists will tend to look after new experiences which are never been achieved before, including enjoying traditional, authentic, unique and new food <ref type="bibr">(Björk &amp; Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2013)</ref>. A variety of food-related characteristics such as preparation, cooking style, presentation, dining customs, food culture, and food consumption can be included to construct experiences that tourists has with food at the destination. Culinary experience is not only influenced by traditional food, but also can be influenced by social aspect, external environment, and services provided in a particular destination <ref type="bibr">(Björk &amp; Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2013)</ref>. Thus, each of these aspects can make a memorable trip for tourists. The sensory aspects of food enable tourists to experience the culture of a particular country on a deeper level <ref type="bibr">(Hendijani, 2016)</ref>. </p></div>

In the context of tourism industry, satisfaction is defined as tourists' assessment based on experiences they have been through <ref type="bibr">(Sukiman, Omar, Muhibudin, Yussof, &amp; Mohamed, 2013)</ref>. Literature has shown that culinary experience quality at a destination can represent an important source of satisfaction for tourists <ref type="bibr">(Agyeiwaah et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hendijani, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, Kivela &amp; Crotts, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Kivela and Crotts (2006)</ref> state that food can increase value to the tourist experience and is associated with the tourism experience quality for tourists in search of new experiences that yield a high level of satisfaction.</p><p>Past studies have suggested various yet similar dimensions to measure culinary experience satisfaction. In line with the culinary experience quality dimensions as discussed earlier, <ref type="bibr">Björk and Kauppinen-Räisänen (2016)</ref> in their study explain that tourist satisfaction towards culinary experience could be measured based on three aspects of: 1) what food or local cuisine being served; 2) where the food is served; and 3) how the food is served. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Correia, Moital, Da Costa and Peres' (2008)</ref> study in Portugal reveal that there are three significant determinants of international visitor satisfaction towards Portugal's gastronomy tourism. They are: 1) local gastronomy; 2) atmosphere; and 3) food quality and price.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Destination Experience Satisfaction</head><p>Destination experience satisfaction is the overall impression of a tourist regarding the overall experience after visiting a destination <ref type="bibr">(Prayag, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang, 2016)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Murphy, Pritchard, and Smith (2000)</ref>, destination can be viewed as a set of complementary Hence, tourist perception on the quality of destination experience is determined by service infrastructure and destination environment. Service infrastructure consists of a set of products and services that offer a direct experience for travellers when they are in a destination, which includes travel agency services, food service businesses, accommodation and transport services.</p><p>Meanwhile, destination environment consists of supporting components for the provision of experience for tourists encompassing: the natural environment, political conditions, availability of technology, economic conditions, and socio-cultural factors of a destination. The provision and the quality of attractions, public and private facilities, accessibility, human resources, image and character, also price can therefore impact on shaping the experience, satisfaction, and also the decision of tourists to travel to a destination <ref type="bibr">(Sukiman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">World Tourism Organization, 2007)</ref>. The overall destination experience satisfaction can be derived from numerous encounters with the taxi drivers, hoteliers, waiters, local people as well as the local attractions such as beaches, shopping malls, museums, theme parks and many others <ref type="bibr">(Prayag, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zouni &amp; Kouremenos, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>With regards to the culinary experience, Ab <ref type="bibr">Karim and Chi (2010)</ref> contend that tourist experience with local culinary would affect their perception of the overall experience with the visited destination. Moreover, the perception of tourists towards the experience of destination will have a positive effect on satisfaction, which in turn, could give a positive impact on the intention to revisit the destination and the intention give referrals to others <ref type="bibr">(Barnes, Mattsson &amp; Sorensen, 2014)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioural Intentions</head><p>Behavioural intentions can be viewed as the antecedent of individual's decision which go through the processes of selecting, delivering, and using products, services, experiences, or ideas in satisfying needs and desires <ref type="bibr">(Hendijani et al., 2013)</ref>. The central idea of the behavioural intention concept is about the evaluative responses towards a subject such as a product, service or situation and that contribution to the creation of a positive or negative feeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Leong, Ab Karim, Awang, and Abu Bakar (2017)</ref>. In the tourism context, the concept has been extensively Response represents the final outcomes and decisions of consumers <ref type="bibr">(Mehrabian &amp; Russell, 1974)</ref>. Response can be either approach behaviour (i.e. positive actions) or avoidance behaviour (i.e. negative actions). The intervening processes and structures contain perceptual, psychological, feeling, and thinking activities <ref type="bibr">(Mehrabian &amp; Russell, 1974)</ref>. As seen in the proposed research model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">1</ref>, culinary experience quality that is shaped by three aspects of food, social, and dining place, is conceived as the stimulus, while culinary experience satisfaction and destination experience satisfaction are regarded as the two organisms, and behavioural intentions is the response. According to the proposed research model, the quality of culinary experience as perceived by the international visitors is expected to influence the satisfaction of both culinary and destination experiences, which in turn are expected to influence tourist behavioural intentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relationships Between Culinary Experience Quality, Culinary Experience Satisfaction, and Destination Experience Satisfaction</head><p>Food is an important component to tourism experience provision <ref type="bibr">(Peštek &amp; Činjarević, 2014)</ref> since food and destinations are inseparable where food can influence tourist travel decision (Ab <ref type="bibr">Karim &amp; Chi, 2010)</ref>. Tourist who has a strong desire to consume traditional foods will look for novel culinary experiences (Bjӧrk &amp; Kauppinen-Rӓisӓnen, 2014). Positive engagement in which the tourists have with local food in the destination is therefore crucial since through this, tourists would assess the quality of experience they have with the food. Such experiences have been associated with an increase in travel satisfaction and positive word of mouth <ref type="bibr">(Stone, et. al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Peštek &amp; Činjarević (2014)</ref> explain that the culinary experience satisfaction is a combination of tourist opinions about the food experience attributes and their emotional response or feeling towards those attributes. This response is an evaluation of the whole culinary experience whether it is good or not. Based on the above explanation, the culinary experience is considered as a phenomenon that not only involves food dimensions but also includes the emotional evaluations from tourists. Literature has consistently shown that tourist experience with local food that is unique and memorable could affect the overall destinations experience satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Ignatov &amp; Smith, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Silkes, Cai, &amp; Lehto, 2013)</ref>. A positive culinary experience quality that is perceived by tourists would lead to culinary experience satisfaction, which in turn, it can enhance the overall destination experience Based on the past studies above, the direct positive relationships are hypothesised as follows:</p><p>H 1 : Culinary experience quality (CEQ) has a positive and significant effect on culinary experience satisfaction (CES). portraying that travellers apply their memories regarding the travel experience they had to determine their future travel intentions (for examples, the option to revisit a tourist attraction or re-repeat an experience). Satisfied tourists will return and tell others about their experiences with a tourist destination <ref type="bibr">(Prayag, 2009)</ref>. Past empirical research has shown that when tourists have a memorable experience with a particular tourist destination, they are more likely to return than otherwise <ref type="bibr">(Kim &amp; Brown, 2012)</ref>. Satisfaction with a tourist destination helps generate loyalty to the destination (Anton, Camarero &amp; Laguna-Garcia, 2014). Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Hendijani et al. (2013)</ref> contend that local food can be used to drive tourism products and trigger repeated travel intentions in a tourist destination. Based on the preceding review of literature, the following hypotheses are formulated as follows:</p><p>H 4 : Culinary experience satisfaction (CES) has a positive and significant effect on tourist behavioural intention (BI).

The sampling process used was purposive sampling, meaning that the respondents should be at least 21 years old, and have enjoyed local food during their visit. The survey was done in tourist attractions (such as, museums, beaches, and traditional food service establishments) by approaching several international tourists who were willing to participate in the survey.</p><p>The questionnaire was divided into five sections. Section 1 sought information about participant demographics such as gender, age, occupation, the purpose of visit and the length of stay. Section 2 contained questions related to the culinary experience quality of domestic tourists in four selected gastronomy cities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Insert Table 1 here</head><p>A questionnaire-based survey incorporating a total of 400 international tourists was completed. A hundred questionnaires were distributed in each city directly to the international tourists in the tourism places, culinary area, and cultural places. Since there were several missing data and outliers, the questionnaires that could be analysed were only 395 in total. The level of agreement with given statements was assessed by using a seven-point Likert-type scale, with anchors "strongly disagree" as 1 to "strongly agree" as 7. The study applied descriptive statistics to describe the participants' profiles meanwhile Partial Least Square (PLS) path modelling was applied to test the proposed research hypotheses. Based on skewness and kurtosis, it showed that some of the responses had excess kurtosis with cases exceeding the threshold of +/-3 found in items BI1 (4.355), BI2 (4.153), BI3 (4.104), BI4 (5.572). However, this deviation is not considered severe. In addition to the consensus among PLS-based authors/researchers, the use of PLS in multivariate data analysis generally adopt a softer assumption regarding data distribution (i.e.: the data are not required to be normally distributed). As for multicollinearity test, the authors did the assessment prior to evaluating the structural PLS model.</p></div>

In terms of country of origin, most participants were from Australia (17%) and France (10%). Moreover, the majority of respondents (72%) travelled to Indonesia for holiday purpose. Most participants visited Indonesia with friends (48%) and they were first time visitors (54%). Detail information about respondent profile is illustrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">2</ref>.

While social factor (CEQ-S: 0.830) is another factor reflecting the culinary experience quality where the different way of service as the main reflector. Then dining place factor (CEQ-D: 0.784) is the third factor reflecting the culinary experience quality where the dining ambience reflecting the local culture as the main reflector.

Also the relationship between customer experience quality (CEQ) and destination experience satisfaction (DES) was positive and significant (4.950 &gt; 1.96). Moreover, the relationship between customer experience satisfaction (CES) and destination experience satisfaction (DES) was positive and significant (9.338 &gt; 1.96). The relationship between destination experience satisfaction (DES) and behavioural intentions (BI)</p><p>was also positive and significant (15.104 &gt; 1.96). Similarly, the relationship between customer experience satisfaction (CES) and behavioural intentions (BI) was positive and significant (2.227 &gt; 1.96). However, the relationship between culinary experience quality (CEQ) and behavioural intentions (BI) was positive but insignificant. (0.287 &lt; 1.96). Therefore, all the research hypotheses were supported except for H 6 was not supported.</p><p>The relationship between CEQ and BI was not significant because the relationship was mediated by CES and DES as mediators (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_25">5</ref>). In this case, the mediating effect is most effective through the joint mediation of CES and DES or through DES as a sole mediator. It can be seen from the original sample of CEQ&gt;DES&gt;BI is 0.191; while for CEQ&gt;CES&gt;DES&gt;BI is 0.190. For international tourists to want to revisit the tourist destination, they need to have a good culinary experience quality which will drive the satisfaction with the culinary experience as well as the destination experience. Besides, the tourists will be more likely to revisit the destination when they are satisfied with the destination experience which is caused by good culinary experience quality.</p><p>Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_25">5</ref> here</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The findings of this study is significant in a way that it contributes to the understanding of the variables influencing the behavioural intentions of the international tourists visiting Indonesia specifically in Denpasar, Solo, Bandung and Yogyakarta. Based on the hypothesis testing, it was confirmed that culinary experience quality (CEQ) positively and significantly influenced both the culinary experience satisfaction (CES) and destination experience satisfaction (DES). It</p><p>shows that the higher the culinary experience quality, the higher the satisfaction both the culinary and destination experiences. When tourists visit the tourist destinations in Indonesia and they find that the culinary experience is favourable, they will be more likely to be contended with both the culinary experience as well as the destination experience. This is relevant with the previous studies which discover that culinary has a significant role in creating the high-quality travelling experience and making the high satisfaction of the tourists with the tourist destination <ref type="bibr">(Kivela &amp; Crotts, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tsai, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Widjaja, Wijaya, Jokom &amp; Kristanti, 2018)</ref>. Furthermore, culinary experience satisfaction (CES) had a positive and significant influence on destination experience satisfaction (DES). It means that the improvement of culinary experience satisfaction will cause the destination experience satisfaction to improve as well. In addition, destination experience satisfaction (DES) itself gave positive and significant influence on behavioural intentions (BI). That is, the higher the satisfaction of the tourists on the destination experience, the higher the intentions of the tourists to revisit the place or to recommend it to others. Furthermore, culinary experience satisfaction also gave a significant effect on behavioural intentions. It means that the improvement of culinary experience satisfaction will result on international tourist intentions to revisit or to recommend the place to others. When tourists enjoy the culinary experience, they will be more likely to be satisfied with the tourist destination and the possibility for them to return to the place is higher as well as the intention to recommend the destination to others. This is relevant with the previous study findings that when tourists enjoy local cuisines, they will have unforgettable tourism experiences which will create strong attachment to the tourist destination and they will be more likely to return to the destination or recommend it to others <ref type="bibr">(Kivela &amp; Crotts, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tsai, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kristanti, Jokom, Widjaja, &amp; Wijaya, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the total effect calculation, the indirect effect that gave the most effect on behavioural intentions was the one which was mediated by culinary experience satisfaction and destination experience satisfaction. It implies that the international tourists are more likely to revisit the place or recommend the place to others if they find that the culinary experience quality is good and they will be satisfied with the culinary experience. As a result, they will also be satisfied with the destination experience which finally will lead to their intention to revisit the place in the future. There are three factors composing the culinary experience quality (CEQ), and dining place (dining ambience reflecting the local culture). Among the three factors, food factor is the most influential factor reflecting the customer experience quality. In this case, the finding supports the previous studies emphasizing the three major dimensions to assess culinary experience quality, they are: food dimension (food authenticity), social dimension (local people's hospitality), and place and time dimension (dining environment). It was found in the study that culinary experience quality was constructed mainly by unique food presentation in food dimension, different style of service in social dimension and ambience of the dining place in dining place dimension <ref type="bibr">(Tsai &amp; Lu, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Widjaja, et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, the result of this current study is in contrast with the previous study. The previous study findings revealed food quality was the main satisfier indicator of culinary experience satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Peštek &amp; Činjarević, 2014)</ref>. While this study found that the quality of the dining place appeared to be the main satisfier indicator of culinary experience satisfaction (CES). In terms of destination experience satisfaction, there were three main satisfier indicators constructing the satisfaction, namely: good value for money (DES8), accommodation facility (DES4) and infrastructure (DES3). It indicates that participants who were international tourists found that they were satisfied with the good value for money, accommodation facility and the infrastructure when visiting Denpasar, Solo, Bandung and Yogyakarta.</p><p>Finally, in terms of behavioural intentions, the main indicator was future intention to revisit the place (BI3). It means that the participants are more likely to revisit the place if they find that the culinary experience quality is good, they are satisfied with the culinary experience which then they are also satisfied with the destination experience. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MANAGERIAL IMPLICATION</head><p>The literature has consistently show that tourists culinary experience is the main aspect to be considered in gastronomy destination that will lead to the positive behaviour. Uniqueness of the food presentation is critical element in creating experience quality towards the food. In Summary, this study also provides valuable information for the government and Food and beverage business in terms of enhancing tourist culinary experience in gastronomy destinations.</p><p>The whole aspects of culinary experience, namely food, social, and dining are the critical factors in making tourists satisfied. Meaning, in spite of the quality of local food itself, interaction with the locals and the quality of dining places also become essential in developing gastronomy tourism marketing strategy. Understanding this model will aid government to identify the way to preserve local food and develop it in facing globalization era. In addition, the model will help the government to increase the satisfaction of foreign tourist toward local culinary and the destination, in order to attract them to revisit Indonesia. Moreover, the government should enhance the promotion of local food unique presentation particularly to the foreign tourists. this model also can be tested in other countries or cities in order to understand tourist behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THEORETICAL IMPLICATION</head><p>Despite the agreement between previous studies regarding the influence of food towards tourist behavioural intention (e.g. Ab <ref type="bibr">Karim &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chi, 2010, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Rajaratnam et al., 2015)</ref>, only limited researches have analysed the experiential perspective on the food and tourism (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Björk &amp; Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">, Kivela &amp; Crotts, 2006)</ref>. The present study enriched the literature on the use of tourist experience of the local food by assessing the dimensions of culinary experience on the local food (food, social and dining) from the international tourist perspective Results from this study also confirm findings from previous studies suggesting that tourist experience within a culinary is a salient factor in shaping tourist satisfaction and behaviour intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH</head><p>This study revealed how culinary experience quality contributes to the foreign tourists' behavioural intention through culinary experience satisfaction and destination experience satisfaction. It means that the higher the culinary experience quality, the higher the satisfaction both the culinary and destination experiences. The higher the satisfaction of the tourists on the destination experience and culinary experience, the higher the intentions of the tourists to revisit the place or to recommend it to others. Moreover, this study also emphasized on the importance of the mediating effect of tourist satisfaction towards the culinary and destination in shaping international tourist behaviour intention. The result also highlights the significant role of local food unique presentation on improving tourists' culinary experience quality towards the food. In line with the previous studies <ref type="bibr">(Björk &amp; Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">, Kivela &amp; Crotts, 2006)</ref>, these findings confirmed that travellers' positive experience of local food will lead to their satisfaction of the local culinary and the destination, furthermore will increase their intention to recommend and revisit the destination.</p><p>This study has some shortcomings that need to be highlighted. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Culinary experience has been a prominent concept in the field of tourism industry recently. It is an inseparable aspect of the tourism industry. Tourists visit a place of attraction not only for the attraction itself but also for the local food that a place is offering. While enjoying the place, tourists enjoy the food at the same time. As such, local food is increasingly becoming one of the most essential elements that form overall destination experiences <ref type="bibr">(Hendijani, 2016)</ref>. While tourists engage with local cuisines in the place they visit, they would learn about the destination's culture <ref type="bibr">(Björk &amp; Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wijaya, King, Morrison, &amp; Nguyen, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies have been undertaken to examine the relationship between culinary tourism and various consumer behaviour constructs <ref type="bibr">(Agyeiwaah, Otoo, Suntikul, &amp; Huang, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kivela &amp; Crotts, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stone, Soulard, Migacz, &amp; Wolf, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wijaya et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Agyeiwaah et al. (2019)</ref>, in their study, analysed the relationship between culinary experience quality and tourist loyalty with culinary experience satisfaction as the mediating variable. The study revealed that when tourists got a good quality of culinary experience, they would be satisfied with the culinary experience which in turn, would be more likely to have intentions to revisit the destination in the future. Similar to <ref type="bibr">Agyeiwaah et al. (2019)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Stone et al. (2018)</ref> contend that memorable local food encounters could motivate tourists to revisit the place in the future <ref type="bibr">(Stone et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Peštek and Činjarević (2014)</ref> found the relationship between culinary experience satisfaction and the destination experience satisfaction.</p><p>Once tourists had a memorable culinary experience, such an experience would contribute to their overall satisfaction. Further, study of <ref type="bibr">Hendijani, Ng, and Boo (2013a)</ref> showed that satisfied tourists tend to visit the same destination and give positive word-of-mouth, two major indicators of behavioural intentions. Despite many research on culinary tourism and tourist behaviour as discussed above, very few empirical examination of the relationship between culinary experience quality, culinary experience satisfaction, destination experience satisfaction, and behavioural intentions have been undertaken.</p><p>Tourism is one of the fastest growing fields in Indonesia and has become one of the main contributors of Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP). The government has aimed to double the tourism contribution to reach at 5.5% of total GDP by 2019 <ref type="bibr">(Kemenpar, 2018b)</ref>. In 2018, there were 15.81 million international tourists visiting Indonesia. This figure showed a growth rate of 12.58% compared to the statistics in 2017 <ref type="bibr">(Kemenpar, 2018a)</ref>. Food and beverage are the second biggest expenditure (around 20.40%) of the total international tourist expenditures (Badan Pusat Statistik, 2017). Recognizing its potential contribution to the national tourism industry, culinary tourism has been prioritized to be strategically promoted as one of the seven types of special interest tourism in Indonesia targeting the international market.</p><p>Culinary tourism is expected to be the main factor attaching other tourism activities, considering the fact that tourism is a multi-attribute and prospective industry functioning not only as a gate but also as the image of Indonesian tourism. The Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy of Indonesia has designated five cities as Indonesia's gastronomy destinations, namely: Bandung, Solo, Yogyakarta, Denpasar and Semarang. The designation of five cities based on six following criteria: product and main attractions; product and event packaging; service quality; environmental factors; business feasibility; and the role of the government in developing culinary tourism <ref type="bibr">(Kemenpar, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The extant literature has shown that most of the culinary tourism studies were undertaken in developed tourist destination geographical context <ref type="bibr">(Agyeiwaah et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Henderson, 2009)</ref>. Indonesia, as an emerging tourism destination in Asia, have well known for its natural and cultural richness whose culinary uniqueness is worth to be explored. Current research examining Indonesian local culinary diversity in the international market is still limited. Having said this, it is timely to conduct an empirical investigation in Indonesia, to analyse more deeply about how the culinary experience quality of international tourists in the major gastronomy cities could affect the behavioural intention. This will be very much beneficial for the local governments to set up the strategies for promoting culinary tourism to the international market and offering more memorable culinary tourism experiences for the international tourists.</p><p>Specifically, the objectives of the present study were: 1) to examine the effect of culinary experience quality on culinary experience satisfaction; 2) to investigate the effect of culinary experience satisfaction on destination experience satisfaction; 3) to investigate the effect of culinary experience quality on the destination experience satisfaction; 5) to examine the effect of culinary experience satisfaction and the destination experience satisfaction on the behavioural intentions; and 6) to examine the indirect relationships between culinary experience quality, culinary experience satisfaction, destination experience satisfaction, and behavioural intentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature review</head><p>Culinary experience quality is an adapted concept from experience quality that is applied in culinary tourism context. According to Chen and Chen (2010), experience quality is the psychological outcome as a result of customer participation in tourism-related activities, including the engagement with local food of the visited destination. Food is a basic sustenance for every tourist during their travel. Each tourist needs food when travelling since it is a basic sustenance that must be fulfilled. Regardless of whether culinary activity becomes the main goal or just as a satisfying need during the trip, a person's culinary experience would shape the image of the culinary enjoyed. Culinary experience is subjective, meaning the culinary experience is influenced by the individual's own experience <ref type="bibr">(Sfandla &amp; Björk, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Wijaya, King, Nguyen, and Morrison (2013)</ref> depict the tourist's local food experience as three consecutive stages of pre-, during, and post-dining. The pre-dining stage refers to how international visitors foresee their engagement with the various aspects that may concern dining with local food, as well as the prospect of associated experiential outcomes. The during-dining stage relates to actual encounters with local food within the destination, as reflected in visitor perceptions of the dining experience. Lastly, the post-dining stage refers to visitor satisfaction and behavioural intentions that emerge after the dining experience has been concluded.</p><p>While <ref type="bibr">Wijaya et al. (2013)</ref> have looked culinary experience as sequential stages, <ref type="bibr">Andersson and Mossberg (2004)</ref> discuss it as multi-dimensional construct. That is, the measurement of the quality of the culinary experience can not be seen only from one dimension of the food, but there are other dimensions, especially in the context of a tourist experience with a culinary region that is never consumed previously. Review of the literature has shown that there are three major dimensions to measure the quality of culinary experience with local food at a destination. These dimensions are: 1) food dimension that relates to attributes of taste, food authenticity and food uniqueness; 2) social dimension that includes the extent of which tourists could interact with the locals and experience the hospitality and distinct culture of the host; and 3) place and time dimension that refers to the physical place where the eating experience with local food take place, as well as when the eating experience occurs <ref type="bibr">(Hendijani et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Peštek &amp; Činjarević, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wijaya et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Culinary tourism is viewed as a form of special interest tourism offering "real" travel. Recognized as part of cultural tourism, it provides real learning opportunities by introducing visitors to the new and exciting smells, tastes, and flavours of local cultures <ref type="bibr">(Ignatov &amp; Smith, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Hendijani (2016)</ref> suggests that by consuming local foods, tourist can conceive the identities and ethnicities of people of a given destination. From the cultural viewpoint, food experience portrays the images of cultural experience, status and cultural identity. Such cultural aspect is usually developed from the unique aspects of food experiences that can only be attained in that particular destination. Therefore, food is something that is deeply rooted in the culture and traditions of a region. Experiencing local foods on vacation is a type of pleasurable sensory experience <ref type="bibr">(Kivela &amp; Crotts, 2006)</ref>. Foods also provide sensory experiences that enhance the pleasure of a vacation and attract tourists to a destination.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that there is an increase in the search for new experiences for consumers <ref type="bibr">(Wang, 2016)</ref>. While on vacation, tourists will tend to look after new experiences which are never been achieved before, including enjoying traditional, authentic, unique and new food <ref type="bibr">(Björk &amp; Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2014)</ref>. A variety of food-related characteristics such as preparation, cooking style, presentation, dining customs, food culture, and food consumption can be included to construct experiences that tourists have with food at the destination. Culinary experience is not only influenced by traditional food but also can be influenced by social aspect, external environment, and services provided in a particular destination <ref type="bibr">(Björk &amp; Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2014)</ref>. Thus, each of these aspects can make a memorable trip for tourists. The sensory aspects of food enable tourists to experience the culture of a particular country on a deeper level <ref type="bibr">(Hendijani, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Culinary experience satisfaction</head><p>Satisfaction is commonly viewed as a result of lived experience quality <ref type="bibr">(Ryan, 2002)</ref>. Satisfaction is not just about the joy of travel experience but also an evaluation that makes the experience as good as it should be. In the context of tourism industry, satisfaction is defined as tourists' assessment based on experiences they have been through <ref type="bibr">(Sukiman, Omar, Muhibudin, Yussof, &amp; Mohamed, 2013)</ref>. Literature has shown that culinary experience quality at a destination can represent an important source of satisfaction for tourists <ref type="bibr">(Agyeiwaah et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hendijani, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kivela &amp; Crotts, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Kivela and Crotts (2006)</ref> state that food can increase value to the tourist experience and is associated with the tourism experience quality for tourists in search of new experiences that yield a high level of satisfaction.</p><p>Past studies have suggested various yet similar dimensions to measure culinary experience satisfaction. In line with the culinary experience quality dimensions as discussed earlier, <ref type="bibr">Björk and Kauppinen-Räisänen (2016)</ref> in their study explain that tourist satisfaction towards culinary experience could be measured based on three aspects of 1) what food or local cuisine being served; 2) where the food is served; and 3) how the food is served. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Correia, Moital, Da Costa and Peres' (2008)</ref> study in Portugal reveals that there are three significant determinants of international visitor satisfaction towards Portugal's gastronomy tourism.

According to <ref type="bibr">Murphy, Pritchard, and Smith (2000)</ref>, destination can be viewed as a set of complementary tourism products and services to form the overall travel experience in an area visited by tourists. Hence, tourist perception on the quality of destination experience is determined by service infrastructure and destination environment. Service infrastructure consists of a set of products and services that offer a direct experience for travellers when they are in a destination, which includes travel agency services, food service businesses, accommodation and transport services. Meanwhile, destination environment consists of supporting components for the provision of experience for tourists encompassing: the natural environment, political conditions, availability of technology, economic conditions, and socio-cultural factors of a destination. The provision and the quality of attractions, public and private facilities, accessibility, human resources, image and character, also price can therefore impact on shaping the experience, satisfaction, and also the decision of tourists to travel to a destination <ref type="bibr">(Sukiman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">World Tourism Organization, 2007)</ref>. The overall destination experience satisfaction can be derived from numerous encounters with the taxi drivers, hoteliers, waiters, local people as well as the local attractions such as beaches, shopping malls, museums, theme parks and many others <ref type="bibr">(Prayag, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zouni &amp; Kouremenos, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>With regards to the culinary experience, Ab <ref type="bibr">Karim and Chi (2010)</ref> contend that tourist experience with local culinary would affect their perception of the overall experience with the visited destination. Moreover, the perception of tourists towards the experience of destination will have a positive effect on satisfaction, which in turn, could give a positive impact on the intention to revisit the destination and the intention give referrals to others <ref type="bibr">(Barnes, Mattsson, &amp; Sørensen, 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioural intentions</head><p>Behavioural intentions can be viewed as the antecedent of individual's decision which go through the processes of selecting, delivering, and using products, services, experiences, or ideas in satisfying needs and desires <ref type="bibr">(Hendijani et al., 2013b)</ref>. The central idea of the behavioural intention concept is about the evaluative responses towards a subject such as a product, service or situation and that contribution to the creation of a positive or negative feeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Leong, Ab Karim, Awang, and Abu Bakar, 2017)</ref>. In the tourism context, the concept has been extensively used to examine tourist behaviour after experiencing tourism products or services in a destination. Tourist behavioural intentions would lead to the loyalty towards particular destination or tourism-related activity.</p><p>Literature has shown that there are two widely common indicators used to measure behavioural intentions in the tourism studies (Ab <ref type="bibr">Karim &amp; Chi, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Prayag, Hosany, &amp; Odeh, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rajaratnam, Nair, Pahlevan, &amp; Munikrishnan, 2015)</ref>. First is the intention to give referrals or recommendations to other people that occurs when tourists are eager to talk about their tourism experiences (word of mouth) to their relatives or friends. Second is revisit intention, meaning that tourists whose tourism experiences are positive would have the tendency to travel again to enjoy the destination or to do the same tourism activities as previously they had. Similarly, according to <ref type="bibr">Amoah, Radder, and Van Eyk (2016)</ref>, behavioural intention is a result of overall tourist satisfaction. It can be viewed by the willingness to use again something that has been used before, to go back to a place where has been visited before, to feel again services that have been enjoyed before, or willingness to share positive information about a place or a thing to families or acquaintances. This is confirmed by <ref type="bibr">Altintzoglou, Heide, and Borch (2016)</ref> who argue that a satisfied tourist will tend to have the eagerness to tell their acquaintances or relatives about the experience they have just enjoyed.</p><p>In relation to culinary tourism, past studies have developed two indicators for measuring behavioural intentions, namely tourist willingness to consume the local food <ref type="bibr">(Phillips, Asperin, &amp; Wolfe, 2013)</ref>, and willingness to recommend the local food to others <ref type="bibr">(Adongo, Anuga, &amp; Dayour, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>This study aimed to investigate the relationships of experience quality, experience satisfaction, destination satisfaction, and behavioural intentions in the context of culinary tourism in Indonesia. The relationships between the examined constructs were developed based on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) theory of <ref type="bibr">Mehrabian and Russell (1974)</ref>. Stimulus is described as external factors consisting of both marketing mix variables and other environmental inputs that influence individual's internal state and can be conceptualized as an effect that stimulates the individual. Organism refers to internal processes and structures intervening between external stimuli and the final actions, reactions, or responses demonstrated. Meanwhile, Response represents the final outcomes and decisions of consumers <ref type="bibr">(Mehrabian &amp; Russell, 1974)</ref>. Response can be either approach behaviour (i.e. positive actions) or avoidance behaviour (i.e. negative actions). The intervening processes and structures contain perceptual, psychological, feeling, and thinking activities <ref type="bibr">(Mehrabian &amp; Russell, 1974)</ref>.</p><p>As seen in the proposed research model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">1</ref>, culinary experience quality that is shaped by three aspects of food, social, and dining place, is conceived as the stimulus, while culinary experience satisfaction and destination experience satisfaction are regarded as the two organisms, and behavioural intentions is the response. According to the proposed research model, the quality of culinary experience as perceived by the international visitors is expected to influence the satisfaction of both culinary and destination experiences, which in turn are expected to influence tourist behavioural intentions.</p><p>Food is an important component to tourism experience provision <ref type="bibr">(Peštek &amp; Činjarević, 2014</ref>) since food and destinations are inseparable where food can influence tourist travel decision (Ab <ref type="bibr">Karim &amp; Chi, 2010)</ref>. Tourist who has a strong desire to consume traditional foods will look for novel culinary experiences <ref type="bibr">(Björk &amp; Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2014)</ref>. Positive engagement in which the tourists have with local food in the destination is therefore crucial since through this, tourists would assess the quality of experience they have with the food. Such experiences have been associated with an increase in travel satisfaction and positive word of mouth <ref type="bibr">(Stone et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Peštek and Činjarević (2014)</ref> explain that the culinary experience satisfaction is a combination of tourist opinions about the food experience attributes and their emotional response or feeling towards those attributes. This response is an evaluation of the whole culinary experience whether it is good or not.</p><p>Based on the above explanation, the culinary experience is considered as a phenomenon that not only involves food dimensions but also includes the emotional evaluations from tourists. Literature has consistently shown that tourist experience with local food that is unique and memorable could affect the overall destinations experience satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Ignatov &amp; Smith, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Silkes, Cai, &amp; Lehto, 2013)</ref>. A positive culinary experience quality that is perceived by tourists would lead to culinary experience satisfaction, which in turn, it can enhance the overall destination experience satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Björk &amp; Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hendijani, Sambasivan, Ng, &amp; Boo, 2013b)</ref>. Based on the past studies above, the direct positive relationships are hypothesized as follows:</p><p>H 1 : Culinary experience quality (CEQ) has a positive and significant effect on culinary experience satisfaction (CES).</p><p>H 2 : Culinary experience satisfaction (CEQ) has a positive and significant effect on destination experience satisfaction (DES).</p><p>H 3 : Culinary experience quality (CES) has a positive and significant effect on destination experience satisfaction (DES). <ref type="bibr">Kim, Ritchie, and McCormick (2012)</ref> urge that destination managers and tourism businesses providers should know how to develop a memorable experience. This can be accomplished when the quality of tourism experience is seriously taken into account. A destination that could provide a memorable tourism experience will have a sustainable competitive advantage. Local cuisines of a destination therefore could be utilized by Destination Management Organizations (DMOs) as a means to offer such experiences since food is a symbol of cultural identity <ref type="bibr">(Horng, Liu, Chou, &amp; Tsai, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Silkes et al. (2013)</ref> note that food could show a unique and most memorable experience of the whole trip. <ref type="bibr">Hendijani et al.'s (2013b)</ref> study reveals that food could give additional attraction to the destination.</p><p>Moreover, destination satisfaction does not only trigger the repeated selection of a tourist destination but also affect the tourist behavioural intentions as a whole <ref type="bibr">(Rajaratnam et al., 2015)</ref>. This statement is supported by research from <ref type="bibr">Huang and Hsu (2009)</ref> as quoted from <ref type="bibr">Björk and Kauppinen-Räisänen (2014)</ref> portraying that travellers apply their memories regarding the travel experience they had to determine their future travel intentions (for examples, the option to revisit a tourist attraction or re-repeat an experience). Satisfied tourists will return and tell others about their experiences with a tourist destination <ref type="bibr">(Prayag, 2009)</ref>. Past empirical research has shown that when tourists have a memorable experience with a particular tourist destination, they are more likely to return than otherwise <ref type="bibr">(Kim &amp; Brown, 2012)</ref>. Satisfaction with a tourist destination helps generate loyalty to the destination <ref type="bibr">(Antón, Camarero, &amp; Laguna-García, 2017)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Hendijani et al. (2013b)</ref> contend that local food can be used to drive tourism products and trigger repeated travel intentions in a tourist destination. Based on the preceding review of literature, the following hypotheses are formulated as follows: H 4 : Culinary experience satisfaction (CES) has a positive and significant effect on tourist behavioural intention (BI).  The proposed research model of the study describing the relationships between the examined variables is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>The samples were representative of the indefinite population of international tourists who travelled in four gastronomy cities in Indonesia, namely Bandung, Denpasar, Solo, and Yogyakarta. The sampling process used was purposive sampling, meaning that the respondents should be at least 21 years old, and have enjoyed local food during their visit. The survey was done in tourist attractions (such as, museums, beaches, and traditional foodservice establishments) by approaching several international tourists who were willing to participate in the survey.</p><p>The questionnaire was divided into five sections. Section 1 sought information about participant demographics such as gender, age, occupation, the purpose of visit and the length of stay. Section 2 contained questions related to the culinary experience quality of domestic tourists in four selected gastronomy cities. In section 3, the participants were requested to state opinions regarding culinary experience satisfaction in the city whereby they visited. Section 4 sought participants' opinions regarding their visited destination experience satisfaction, while the last section, section 5 contained questions related to behavioural intention of international tourists.</p><p>All items or empirical indicators for each examined construct were developed based on the literature review (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">1</ref>). The culinary experience quality variable is operationally defined as the total image of the eating activity as perceived by the tourists. The culinary experience quality was measured by three sub-variables, namely food, social and place. These three sub-variables and their indicator items were adapted from Björk and Kauppinen-Räisänen (2014), <ref type="bibr">Hendijani et al. (2013a)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Peštek and</ref><ref type="bibr">Činjarević (2014), and</ref><ref type="bibr">Wijaya et al. (2017)</ref>. Food was measured by five indicators, social was measured by four indicators, and place was measured by three indicators. The culinary experience satisfaction variable is operationally defined as the overall tourist satisfaction towards food, social interaction, and the quality of place aspects. In the questionnaire, it was measured by three indicators that were adapted from <ref type="bibr">Kivela and</ref><ref type="bibr">Crotts (2006), and</ref><ref type="bibr">Hendijani (2016)</ref>.</p><p>The destination experience satisfaction variable is operationally defined as the overall satisfaction of tourists based on several destination aspects after engaging with local food at the visited gastronomy destination. It was measured by four sub-variables, namely attraction, public and private facilities, human resources, and price, which were adapted from <ref type="bibr">Wang (2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Zouni and Kouremenos (2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Prayag (2009)</ref>, and the published document of World Tourism Organization (2007). Attraction was measured by two indicators, public and private facilities were measured by three indicators, human resources was measured by two indicators, and price was measured by one indicator. Behavioural intention variable is operationally defined as the tourist intentions as a response after visiting and evaluating the culinary experience in a visited gastronomy destination.</p><p>Behavioural intention was measured by two sub-variables, namely revisit intention and recommendation intention, of which were adapted from measurement scales of Ab <ref type="bibr">Karim and Chi (2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Rajaratnam et al.

(2015)</ref>. Revisit intention was measured by two indicators and referral intention was measured by two indicators.</p><p>A questionnaire-based survey incorporating a total of 400 international tourists was completed. A hundred questionnaires were distributed in each city directly to the international tourists in the tourism places, culinary area, and cultural places. Since there were several missing data and outliers, the questionnaires that could be analysed were only 395 in total. The level of agreement with given statements was assessed by using a 7-point Likert-type scale, with anchors "strongly disagree" as 1 to "strongly agree" as 7. The study applied descriptive statistics to describe the participants' profiles meanwhile Partial Least Square (PLS) path modelling was applied to test the proposed research hypotheses. Based on skewness and kurtosis, it showed that some of the responses had excess kurtosis with cases exceeding the threshold of ± 3 found in items BI1 (4.355), BI2 (4.153), BI3 (4.104), BI4 <ref type="bibr">(5.572</ref>). However, this deviation is not considered severe. In addition to the consensus among PLS-based authors/researchers, the use of PLS in multivariate data analysis generally adopt a softer assumption regarding data distribution (i.e.: the data are not required to be normally distributed). As for multicollinearity test, the authors did the assessment prior to evaluating the structural PLS model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The participants of the study were 53% male and 47% female with majority aged between 21 and 30 years old (35%). Three groups of university students (27%), housewife (19%) and employees (19%) were dominating the total participants. In terms of country of origin, most participants were from Australia (17%) and France (10%). Moreover, the majority of respondents (72%) travelled to Indonesia for holiday purpose. Most participants visited Indonesia with friends (48%) and they were first-time visitors (54%). Detail information about respondent profile is illustrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">2</ref>.</p><p>The result of the construct validity testing indicated that all the indicators were valid since all the indicators were above 0.50. The result of the path analysis is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">2</ref>.</p><p>The values of the composite reliability and the Cronbach's Alpha value were above the cut-off value of 0.70 which means reliable.</p><p>The goodness of fit as calculated from the Q 2 value. The Q 2 value is calculated from the R 2 values in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">4</ref>. The value of Q 2 : 1-[(1-0.791 2 ) x (1-0.690 2 ) x (1-0.615 2 ) x (1-0.409 2 ) x (1-0.475 2 )] = 0.921 = 92.1%. It shows that 92.1% of the change variation of destination experience satisfaction as the independent variable can be explained by culinary experience quality and culinary experience satisfaction as the dependent variables while 7.9% can be explained by other variables which are not analysed in this research.</p><p>Moreover, based on the second-order analysis on the factors forming the culinary experience quality, it can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">2</ref> that food (CEQ-F: 0.889) is the most dominant factor reflecting the culinary experience quality where the uniqueness of the food presentation as the main reflector. While social factor (CEQ-S: 0.830) is another factor reflecting the culinary experience quality where the different way of service as the main reflector. Then, dining place factor (CEQ-D: 0.784) is the third factor reflecting the culinary experience quality where the dining ambience reflecting the local culture as the main reflector. Furthermore, the main reflector of culinary experience satisfaction is the quality of the dining place (CES3: 0.816). Whereas the main reflector of destination experience satisfaction is the good value for money (DES8: 0.759). The main reflector of behavioural intention is revisiting the place in the future (BI3: 0.885).</p><p>Based on the path coefficients, it showed that the relationships between variables were positive (original sample). From the result of the t-statistic, it indicated that the relationship between customer experience quality (CEQ) and customer experience satisfaction (CES) was positive and experience satisfaction (DES) and behavioural intentions (BI) was also positive and significant (15.104 &gt; 1.96). Similarly, the relationship between customer experience satisfaction (CES) and behavioural intentions (BI) was positive and significant (2.227 &gt; 1.96). However, the relationship between culinary experience quality (CEQ) and behavioural intentions (BI) was positive but insignificant. (0.287 &lt; 1.96). Therefore, all the research hypotheses were supported except for H 6 was not supported.</p><p>The relationship between CEQ and BI was not significant because the relationship was mediated by CES and DES as mediators (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_25">5</ref>). In this case, the mediating effect is most effective through the joint mediation of CES and DES or through DES as a sole mediator. It can be seen from the original sample of CEQ &gt; DES &gt; BI is 0.191; while for CEQ &gt; CES &gt; DES &gt; BI is 0.190. For international tourists to want to revisit the tourist destination, they need to have a good culinary experience quality which will drive the satisfaction with the culinary experience as well as the destination experience. Besides, the tourists will be more likely to revisit the destination when they are satisfied with the destination experience which is caused by good culinary experience quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The findings of this study are significant in a way that it contributes to the understanding of the variables influencing the behavioural intentions of the international tourists visiting Indonesia specifically in Denpasar, Solo, Bandung and Yogyakarta. Based on the hypothesis testing, it was confirmed that culinary experience quality (CEQ) positively and significantly influenced both the culinary experience satisfaction (CES) and destination experience satisfaction (DES). It shows that the higher the culinary experience quality, the higher the satisfaction both the culinary and destination experiences. When tourists visit the tourist destinations in Indonesia and they find that the culinary experience is favourable, they will be more likely to be contended with both the culinary experience as well as the destination experience. This is relevant with the previous studies which discover that culinary has a significant role in creating the high-quality travelling experience and making the high satisfaction of the tourists with the tourist destination <ref type="bibr">(Kivela &amp; Crotts, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tsai, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Widjaja, Wijaya, Jokom, &amp; Kristanti, 2018)</ref>. Furthermore, culinary experience satisfaction (CES) had a positive and significant influence on destination experience satisfaction (DES). It means that the improvement of culinary experience satisfaction will cause the destination experience satisfaction to improve as well. In addition, destination experience satisfaction (DES) itself gave positive and significant influence on behavioural intentions (BI). That is, the higher the satisfaction of the tourists on the destination experience, the higher the intentions of the tourists to revisit the place or to recommend it to others. Furthermore, culinary experience satisfaction also gave a significant effect on behavioural intentions. It means that the improvement of culinary experience satisfaction will result on international tourist intentions to revisit or to recommend the place to others. When tourists enjoy the culinary experience, they will be more likely to be satisfied with the tourist destination and the possibility for them to return to the place is higher as well as the intention to recommend the destination to others. This is relevant with the previous study findings that when tourists enjoy local cuisines, they will have unforgettable tourism experiences which will create strong attachment to the tourist destination and they will be more likely to return to the destination or recommend it to others <ref type="bibr">(Kivela &amp; Crotts, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kristanti, Jokom, Wijaya, &amp; Widjaja, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tsai, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the total effect calculation, the indirect effect that gave the most effect on behavioural intentions was the one which was mediated by culinary experience satisfaction and destination experience satisfaction. It implies that the international tourists are more likely to revisit the place or recommend the place to others if they find that the culinary experience quality is good and they will be satisfied with the culinary experience. As a result, they will also be satisfied with the destination experience which finally will lead to their intention to revisit the place in the future. There are three factors composing the culinary experience quality (CEQ), namely: food factor (uniqueness of the food presentation), social factor (different way of service) and dining place (dining ambience reflecting the local culture). Among the three factors, food factor is the most influential factor reflecting the customer experience quality. In this case, the finding supports the previous studies emphasizing the three major dimensions to assess culinary experience quality, they are food dimension (food authenticity), social dimension (local people's hospitality), and place and time dimension (dining environment). It was found in the study that culinary experience quality was constructed mainly by unique food presentation in food dimension, different style of service in social dimension and ambience of the dining place in dining place dimension <ref type="bibr">(Tsai &amp; Lu, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Widjaja et al., 2018)</ref>. Furthermore, the result of this current study is in contrast with the previous study. The previous study findings revealed food quality was the main satisfier indicator of culinary experience satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Peštek &amp; Činjarević, 2014)</ref>. While this study found that the quality of the dining place appeared to be the main satisfier indicator of culinary experience satisfaction (CES). In terms of destination experience satisfaction, there were three main satisfier indicators constructing the satisfaction, namely: good value for money (DES8), accommodation facility (DES4) and infrastructure (DES3). It indicates that participants who were international tourists found that they were satisfied with the good value for money, accommodation facility and the infrastructure when visiting Denpasar, Solo, Bandung and Yogyakarta.</p><p>Finally, in terms of behavioural intentions, the main indicator was future intention to revisit the place (BI3). It means that the participants are more likely to revisit the place if they find that the culinary experience quality is good, they are satisfied with the culinary experience which then they are also satisfied with the destination experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and implications</head><p>This study revealed how culinary experience quality contributes to the foreign tourists' behavioural intention through culinary experience satisfaction and destination experience satisfaction. It means that the higher the culinary experience quality, the higher the satisfaction both the culinary and destination experiences. The higher the satisfaction of the tourists on the destination experience and culinary experience, the higher the intentions of the tourists to revisit the place or to recommend it to others. Moreover, this study also emphasized on the importance of the mediating effect of tourist satisfaction towards the culinary and destination in shaping international tourist behaviour intention. The result also highlights the significant role of local food unique presentation on improving tourists' culinary experience quality towards the food. In line with the previous studies <ref type="bibr">(Björk &amp; Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kivela &amp; Crotts, 2006)</ref>, these findings confirmed that travellers' positive experience of local food will lead to their satisfaction of the local culinary and the destination, furthermore will increase their intention to recommend and revisit the destination.</p><p>Despite the agreement between previous studies regarding the influence of food towards tourist behavioural intention (e.g. Ab <ref type="bibr">Karim &amp; Chi, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rajaratnam et al., 2015)</ref>, only limited research has analysed the experiential perspective on the food and tourism (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Björk &amp; Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kivela &amp; Crotts, 2006)</ref>. The present study enriched the literature on the use of tourist experience of the local food by assessing the dimensions of culinary experience on the local food (food, social and dining) from the international tourist perspective in the context of gastronomy destination in Indonesia, in relation to their satisfaction and behaviour intention. By examining those three dimensions give comprehensive measurement towards tourist culinary experience quality.</p><p>Moreover, this research divided the tourist satisfaction into two variables (towards the culinary and the destination), whereas could make a significant conceptual contribution towards the framework of a tourist culinary experience and their behavioural intention. The result showed that tourist culinary experience quality plays a major contributing role in creating high culinary satisfaction and destination satisfaction, which it will trigger to their high intention to revisit, consume the local food again in the next travel, and recommend the local food and the destination. Thus, this study filled a gap in the literature regarding the limited research on the culinary experience, culinary satisfaction, destination satisfaction and behavioural intention model and its implication to the gastronomic destinations.</p><p>Results from this study also confirm findings from previous studies suggesting that tourist experience within a culinary is a salient factor in shaping tourist satisfaction and behaviour intention.</p><p>The literature has consistently shown that tourists culinary experience is the main aspect to be considered in gastronomy destination that will lead to the positive behaviour. Uniqueness of the food presentation is critical element in creating experience quality towards the food. In Summary, this study also provides valuable information for the government and Food and beverage business in terms of enhancing tourist culinary experience in gastronomy destinations. The whole aspects of culinary experience, namely food, social, and dining are the critical factors in making tourists satisfied. Meaning, in spite of the quality of local food itself, interaction with the locals and the quality of dining places also become essential in developing gastronomy tourism marketing strategy. Understanding this model will aid government to identify the way to preserve local food and develop it in facing globalization era. In addition, the model will help the government to increase the satisfaction of foreign tourist towards local culinary and the destination, in order to attract them to revisit Indonesia. Moreover, the government should enhance the promotion of local food unique presentation particularly to the foreign tourists. This model also can be tested in other countries or cities in order to understand tourist behaviour.</p><p>This study has some shortcomings that need to be highlighted. First, with reference to research model, the contribution of food, social, and place, the dimensions of culinary experience quality, to culinary experience satisfaction and destination experience satisfaction, could not be known; It can only be seen the contribution of food, social, and place to culinary experience quality. Second, this study only focusses to the four cities that designated as Indonesia's gastronomy destinations. It would be very useful to replicate this research in other regions and cities across the country as known that Indonesia has lots of regions that have own food uniqueness. The replicate study would provide a more comprehensive picture of tourist behavioural intention towards Indonesia's culinary destinations.</p><p>Finally, there are several suggestions for future research. First, it is suggested to do research with different research model that could measure the contribution of culinary experience quality's dimensions (food, social, place) to culinary and destination experience satisfaction. Second, to expand the geographic area of research which is not only four cities in Indonesia. Last, in order to get more valuable insight of tourist behavioural intention towards Indonesia's culinary, it is suggested to conduct a study adopting a qualitative research approach.</p></div>

Tourist behavioural intentions would lead to the loyalty toward particular destination or tourism-related activity.Literature has shown that there are two widely common indicators used to measure behavioural intentions in the tourism studies (AbKarim &amp; Chi, 2010; Prayag, Hosany &amp; Odeh,   2013; Rajaratnam, Nair, Pahlevan, &amp; Munikrishnan, 2015). First is the intention to give referrals or recommendations to other people that occurs when tourists are eager to talk about their tourism experiences (word of mouth) to their relatives or friends. Second is revisit intention, meaning that tourists whose tourism experiences are positive would have the tendency to travel again to enjoy the destination or to do the same tourism activities as previously they had.Similarly, according toAmoah, Radder, and Van Eyk (2016), behavioural intention is a result of overall tourist satisfaction. It can be viewed by the willingness to use again something that has been used before, to go back to a place where has been visited before, to feel again services that have been enjoyed before, or willingness to share positive information about a place or a thing to families or acquaintances. This is confirmed byAltintzoglou, Heide and Borch (2016)  who argue tourist will tend to have the eagerness to tell their acquaintances or relatives about the experience they have just enjoyed.In relation to culinary tourism, past studies have developed two indicators for measuring behavioural intentions, namely tourist willingness to consume the local food(Phillips, Asperin,   &amp; Wolfe, 2013), and willingness to recommend the local food to others(Adongo, Anuga &amp;   Dayour, 2015).This study aimed to investigate the relationships of experience quality, experience satisfaction, destination satisfaction, and behavioral intentions in the context of culinary tourism in Indonesia. The relationships between the examined constructs were developed based on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) theory ofMehrabian and Russell (1974). Stimulus is described as external factors consisting of both marketing mix variables and other environmental inputs that influence individual's internal state and can be conceptualized as an effect that stimulates the individual. Organism refers to internal processes and structures intervening between external stimuli and the final actions, reactions, or responses demonstrated. Meanwhile,</figDesc></figure>

This can be accomplished when the quality of tourism experience is seriously taken into account. A destination that could provide a memorable tourism experience will have a sustainable competitive advantage. Local cuisines of a destination therefore could be utilised by Destination Management Organizations (DMOs) as a means to offer such experiences since food is a symbol of cultural identity(Horng et al., 2012).Silkes et al. (2013)  note that food could show a unique and most memorable experience of the whole trip.Hendijani et al.'s (2013)  study reveal that food could give additional attraction to the destination. Moreover, destination satisfaction does not only trigger the repeated selection of a tourist destination but also affect the tourist behavioural intentions as a whole(Rajaratnam et al., 2015). This statement is supported by research fromHuang and Hsu (2009)  as quoted from Bjӧrk andKauppinen-Rӓisӓnen (2014)   </figDesc></figure>

The culinary experience satisfaction variable is operationally defined as the toward food, social interaction, and the quality of place aspects. In the questionnaire, it was measured by three indicators that were adapted fromKivela and Crotts   (2006), and Hendijani (2016). The destination experience satisfaction variable is operationally defined as the overall satisfaction of tourists based on several destination aspects after engaging with local food at the visited gastronomy destination. It was measured by four sub-variables, namely attraction, public and private facilities, human resources, and price, which were adapted fromWang (2016),Zouni and Kouremenos (2008),Prayag (2009), and the published document of World Tourism Organization (2007). Attraction was measured by two indicators, public and private facilities were measured by three indicators, human resources was measured by two indicators, and price was measured by one indicator. Behavioural intention variable is operationally defined as the tourist intentions as a response after visiting and evaluating the culinary experience in a visited gastronomy destination. Behavioural intention was measured by two sub-variables, namely: revisit intention and recommendation intention, of which were adapted from measurement scales of Ab Karim and Chi (2010), Rajaratnam et al. (2015), Prayag et al. (2013), Bjork and Kauppinen-Raisanen (2014), Phillips et al. (2013); and Adongo et al. (2015).

By examining those three dimensions give comprehensive measurement towards tourist culinary experience quality. Moreover, this research divided the tourist satisfaction into two variable (towards the culinary and the destination), whereas could make a significant conceptual contribution towards the framework of a tourist culinary experience and their behaviour intention. The result showed that tourist culinary experience quality plays a major contributing role in creating high culinary satisfaction and destination satisfaction, which it will trigger to their high intention to revisit, consume the local food again in the next travel, and recommend the local food and the destination. Thus, this study filled a gap in the literature regarding the limited research on the culinary experience, culinary satisfaction, destination satisfaction and behavioural intention model and its implication to the gastronomic destinations.</figDesc></figure>

It is an inseparable aspect of the tourism industry. Tourists visit a place of attraction not only for the attraction itself but also for the local food that a place is offering. While enjoying the place, tourists enjoy the food at the same time. As such, local food is increasingly becoming one of the most essential elements that form overall destination experiences(Hendijani, 2016).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ABSTRACT</head><p>Drawing upon the extant literature, this study aimed to investigate tourist experience quality of culinary tourism in Indonesia by examining the relationships between the quality of culinary experience, the satisfaction of culinary experience, the satisfaction of destination experience, and behavioural intentions using a structural equation modelling approach. In total, 395 international tourists who travelled to Indonesian gastronomy destinations participated in the survey. The result showed the direct effects of the culinary experience quality on culinary experience satisfaction and destination experience satisfaction. However, it is the indirect and not direct effects of the quality of culinary experience quality that impact on behavioural intentions when mediated by culinary experience satisfaction and destination experience satisfaction.
