<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Moreover, model selection criteria, such as the Akaike's Information Criterion or Bayesian Information Criterion, cannot be used to distinguish between statistical models with inequality constraints between the parameters of interest. These criteria use the likelihood evaluated in its maximum as a measure of model fit, and the number of parameters of the model as a measure of complexity. The problem is that model selection criteria cannot distinguish between hypotheses when these hypotheses do not differ in model fit, but only in the number of constraints imposed on the parameters of interest.</p><p>For example, consider the hypothesis f™ 1 ™ 2 g &lt; ™ 3 &gt; 0 where ™ 1 : : : ™ 3 denote, for example, mean scores on some variable. Furthermore, suppose we want to compare this informative hypothesis to an unconstrained hypothesis where the parameters are allowed to have any value. Suppose the unconstraint parameter estimates fit the constraints, so that the estimated parameters agree with f™ 1 ™ 2 g &lt; ™ 3 &gt; 0. In this case, both the constraint and unconstraint hypotheses do not differ in model fit; that is, the maximum of the likelihood is the same for both models. The problem is how to account for model complexity. Because the parameters are restricted, the number of parameters used to determine model complexity is clearly not equal to 3. So far, quantifying the number of parameters for constraint hypotheses received hardly any attention in the literature.</p><p>In conclusion, evaluating informative hypothesis in SEM models is not possible with the LRT or with traditional model selection criteria. Constraint parameter estimation and informative hypothesis testing has extensively been studied, but literature for SEM models is sparse. Also, as we show in this article, calibration of the alpha level is essential when testing inequality constraint hypotheses. This received hardly any attention in the literature described before. We show how informative hypotheses can be tested in SEM models using Mplus, but we first introduce an example in which the hypotheses of interest are informative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ILLUSTRATION: ETHNICITY AND ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR</head><p>The problem of testing inequality constrained hypotheses in SEM and its solution is illustrated using the following example. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Deković, Wissink, and Meijer (2004)</ref> investigated whether the leading theories about antisocial behavior in the dominant culture of adolescents can be generalized to members of different ethnic groups. For this example the dominant culture is the Dutch culture, which is compared to the Moroccan, Turkish, and Surinamese cultures in the Netherlands. Three aspects of the parent-adolescent relationship were assessed: positive quality of the relationship (affection and intimacy), negative quality of the relationship (antagonism and conflict), and disclosure (how much adolescents tell the parents). The sample consists of 603 adolescents (M age D 14.4, range D 14-16 years); 68% of the adolescents are Dutch (n D 407), 11% are Moroccan (n D 68), 13% are Turkish (n D 79), and 8% are Surinamese (n D 49). Adolescents were classified into these ethnic categories according to their responses on a single item in the questionnaire: "What ethnical group best describes you?" Using these data we present three examples where the hypothesis under investigation is informative.</p><p>The structural equation model used here is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y g i D B g y g i C g x g i C - g i with x i N. g x ; ˆg/ (1)</formula><p>where, if q is the number of dependent variables, r is the number of independent variables, g D 1; : : : ; G denotes group membership, and i D 1; : : : ; I denote persons, then y g i is a q 1 vector of dependent variables for person i within group g, B g is a q q matrix of regression coefficients between ys where the diagonal must consist of zeros, x i is a r 1 vector of independent variables, g x is a r 1 vector of means for each independent variable with covariance matrix ˆg, g is q r matrix of regression coefficients between ys and xs, and g i is q 1 vector with error terms that is assumed to have a multivariate-normal distribution, -g i N.0; ‰ g /, which is independent of y and x.

More specific examples will be given in the sequel.</p><p>Example 1: Simple Regression</p><p>The first example is a simple regression model where levels of antisocial behavior are regressed on either a negative or positive relation with the parent and adolescent disclosure (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), where B D 0 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">D " 1 " 2 " 3 ; (9) ‰ D § 1 ; (10) ˆD 2 4 ¥ 11 ¥ 12 ¥ 22 ¥ 13 ¥ 23 ¥ 33 3 5 : (11)</formula><p>Note that this model is based on the total sample, therefore the superscript g is not needed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Deković et al. (2004)</ref> stated that adolescent disclosure is the strongest predictor of antisocial behavior, followed by either a negative or positive relation with the parent (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dishion &amp; McMahon, 1998)</ref>. We therefore hypothesize that the regression coefficients " 1 and " 2 are smaller than " 3 . Using the hypotheses tested for this example with m D 2, are for Type A</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">A D Ä 1 0 1 0 1 1 ; (12) ™ 1 D 2 4 " 1 " 2 " 3 3 5 ; (13) c D Ä 0 0 ;<label>(14)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">H 0 W versus H 1 W Ä " 3 " 1 D 0 " 3 " 2 D 0 Ä " 3 " 1 &gt; 0 " 3 " 2 &gt; 0 ;<label>(15)</label></formula><p>and for Type B</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">H 0 W versus H 1 W Ä " 3 " 1 &gt; 0 " 3 " 2 &gt; 0 Ä " 3 ; " 1 " 3 ; " 2 :<label>(16)</label></formula><p>Note that H 1 in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">16</ref>can also be written as f" 1 ; " 2 g &lt; " 3 . This type of notation will be used in the remainder of this article. We used Mplus version 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2007)</ref> to estimate the unconstrained and constrained regression coefficients (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). As can be seen in this table, the unconstrained estimate of " 2 is not smaller than " 3 . Consequently, the constrained estimates of " 2 and " 3 are set equal by the introduction of a "slack" parameter (see the lower panel of Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 2: Multigroup Analysis</head><p>Research about the nature and impact of antisocial behavior is dominated by studies conducted with White, Western, middle-class adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Deković et al., 2004)</ref>. It could be questioned whether the model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is the same for different ethnic groups living in The Netherlands: Dutch (indicated by g D 1), Turkish (g D 2), Moroccan (g D 3), and Surinamese adolescents (g D 4), where B D 0 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">1 D OE " 1 1 " 1 2 " 1 3 : : : 4 D OE " 4 1 " 4 2 "<label>4</label></formula><p>3 ;</p><p>(17)</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">‰ 1 D OE § 1 1 : : : ‰ 4 D OE § 4 1 ;</formula><p>(18)</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">ˆ1 D : : : ˆ4 D 2 4 ¥ 1 11 ¥ 1 12 ¥ 1 22 ¥ 1 13 ¥ 1 23 ¥ 1 33 3 5 2 4 ¥ 4 11 ¥ 4 12 ¥ 4 22 ¥ 4 13 ¥ 4 23 ¥ 4 33 3 5 : (19)</formula><p>The null hypothesis is that the regression coefficients for the predictors of antisocial behavior are the same for all ethnic groups (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Greenberger &amp; Chen, 1996</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">H 0 W 2 4 " 1 1 D " 2 1 D " 3 1 D " 4 1 " 1 2 D " 2 2 D " 3 2 D " 4 2 " 1 3 D " 2 3 D " 3 3 D " 4 3 3 5 (20)</formula><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Deković et al. (2004)</ref> there are also indications in the literature that the same risk factors have different effects in different ethnic groups, a so-called process times context interaction phenomenon. The authors expected that cross-ethnic variations result in weaker relations between parent-child relations and adolescent behavior compared to Dutch families. This was mainly expected because of differences in family expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Phalet &amp; Schönpflung, 2001)</ref> and differences in intergenerational conflicts due to migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Deković, Noom, &amp; Meeus, 1997)</ref>. The informative hypothesis H 1 is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">H 1 W 2 4 " 1 1 &gt; f" 2 1 ; " 3 1 ; " 4 1 g " 1 2 &gt; f" 2 2 ; " 3 2 ; " 4 2 g " 1 3 &gt; f" 2 3 ; " 3 3 ; " 4 3 g 3 5 :<label>(21)</label></formula><p>The hypotheses that are tested for this example are for Type A: Equation 20 versus Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">21</ref>; and for Type B: Equation 21 versus the unconstrained model. In Example 3: Path Model</p><p>The third example includes the variable hanging around with deviant peers. The hypothesis states that problem behavior is not only directly predicted by disclosure and a negative or positive relation with the parent, but is also indirectly predicted via hanging around with deviant peers (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), where </p><formula xml:id="formula_17">B D Ä 0 0 " 21 0 ;<label>(22)</label></formula><p>Note that this model is based on the total sample, therefore superscript g is not needed. As argued by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Deković et al. (2004)</ref>, children spend, especially in adolescence, more and more time with their peers without adult supervision (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mounts &amp; Steinberg, 1995)</ref>. During this period peers become the most important reference group for adolescents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Deković et al. (2004)</ref> stated that especially in this period the association with deviant peers has emerged as the most prominent predictor of problem behavior. The hypotheses tested for Example 3 are hypothesis Type A: </p><formula xml:id="formula_19">H 0 W " 21 D " 21 D " 22 D " 23 versus H 1 W " 21 &gt; f</formula><p>The unconstrained and constrained regression coefficients are shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. As can be seen in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, the constrained coefficients do not differ from their unconstrained counterparts.</p><p>Hence, the constraints imposed by the informative hypothesis are not contradicted by the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PARAMETRIC BOOTSTRAP</head><p>To evaluate informative hypotheses like those presented in the previous section we make use of the parametric bootstrap. Bootstrapping is an approach for statistical inference falling within a broader class of resampling methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Efron &amp; Tibshirani, 1993)</ref>. Various authors have suggested using the parametric bootstrap when the parameter space is restricted <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Galindo-Garre &amp; Vermunt, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ritov &amp; Gilula, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Stoel et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tsonaka &amp; Moustaki, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bootstrap Method</head><p>The method we advocate starts with the observed data z D fy; xg and the likelihood in Equation <ref type="formula">5</ref>(see Start in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</p><p>Step 1 is a parametric bootstrap from a population in which the null hypothesis is true. First, ™ is estimated under H 0 using the data z resulting in</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">f .zj O ™ H0jz / :<label>(28)</label></formula><p>Using Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">28</ref>, T bootstrap samples of size n are generated, resulting in data sets z r ep t , for t D 1; : : : ; T (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Then, ™ is estimated for each replicated data set under H 0 , rendering</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">f .z r ep 1 j O ™ H0jz rep 1 / : : : f .z r ep T j O ™ H0jz rep T / : (29) Further, ™ is estimated under H 1 , rendering f .z r ep 1 j O ™ H1jz rep 1 / : : : f .z r ep T j O ™ H1jz rep T / :<label>(30)</label></formula><p>The second step, denoted by Step 2 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, is to repeat these computations conditional on the observed data set and to compute f .zj O ™ H0jz / and f .zj O ™ H1jz /. The final step (see the lower part of the top panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) is to choose a test statistic, denoted by ƒ, to investigate the compatibility of the null hypothesis with the observed data. Like many previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barlow et al., 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Robertson et al., 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Silvapulle &amp; Sen, 2004)</ref>, we also use the LRT for evaluating the hypotheses at hand, but, as illustrated before, we do not use a p value based on a chi-square distribution.</p><p>Because f .zj™/ is proportional to the likelihood, an LRT is performed for each replicated data set rendering</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">ƒ t D 2log ( f .z r ep t j O ™ H0jz rep t / f .z r ep t j O ™ H1jz rep t / )<label>(31)</label></formula><p>and for the observed data set it renders</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">ƒ D 2log ( f .zj O ™ H0jz / f .zj O ™ H1jz / ) :<label>(32)</label></formula><p>Now, a p value can be computed using p D P.ƒ t &gt; ƒ jH 0 ; z/ : (33) It can be approximated by the proportion of LRT values from the simulated data sets that are equal or larger than the LRT value of the observed data set, resulting in the definition of the plug-in p value p</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">P T tD1 I t T ; (<label>34</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_26">)</formula><p>where I t is an indicator function taking the value 1 if the inequality holds and 0 otherwise:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">I t D 1 if ƒ t &gt; ƒ 0 otherwise :<label>(35)</label></formula><p>A hypothetical distribution is illustrated in the graph in the lower part of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. To determine whether the ƒ value from the observed data set stems from a population where the null hypothesis is true, it has to be smaller than a chosen alpha value. Traditionally an alpha value of .05 is used and as such the observed ƒ value has to lie on the left side of the dotted line in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. However, as we will show in the next section, in many situations the alpha value needs to be calibrated. The procedure previously described can be conducted for Type A and B hypothesis testing. The parameter estimates and likelihood values can be obtained using Mplus and we developed R code that automatically computes the LRT values and the plug-in p value from the output files of Mplus. Input files for all examples and R code can be downloaded from <ref type="url" target="http://www">http://www</ref>. fss.uu.nl/ms/schoot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FREQUENCY PROPERTIES OF THE ASYMPTOTIC p VALUES</head><p>In the previous section we showed how to obtain plug-in p values for the evaluation of informative hypotheses. An appealing property for any p value, and consequently for our plug-in p value, is, considered as a random variable, to be asymptotically uniform [0,1] under the null hypothesis: P.p &lt; 'jH 0 / D '. However, in some situations exact uniformity of p values cannot be attained <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andrews, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bayarri &amp; Berger, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Galindo-Garre &amp; Vermunt, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Stoel et al., 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andrews (2000)</ref>, for example, showed that the results of the bootstrap procedure are not coherent when inequality constraints are imposed on the model parameters. Furthermore, Galindo-Garre and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Vermunt (2004)</ref> showed in a simulation study that the parametric bootstrap can produce p values that are higher than expected.</p><p>The bootstrap procedure described in the previous section can also lead to p values that are biased. To determine whether the actual alpha level differs from its nominal level a double bootstrap procedure is used <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Efron &amp; Tibshirani, 1993)</ref>. This procedure renders a calibrated alpha level: P.p &lt; ' jH 0 / D ', where ' denotes the calibrated alpha level.</p><p>As can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, in the double bootstrap procedure there are two stages of bootstrapping. In Stage 1, data sets are generated using f .zj O ™ H0jz /. Note that we make an important assumption here. We implicitly assume that in our procedure O ™ H0jz is a good approximation of the true population values ™ H0 , which are unknown. We assume that with n sufficiently large, the true population values will be close to the estimated values f .zj O ™ H0jz /.</p><p>The result of Stage 1, are S data sets (for s D 1; : : : ; S ) and the double bootstrap algorithm amounts to treating each bootstrap sample z r ep s like an original data set in the second stage of the double bootstrap procedure (see Stage 2 in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). For each first-stage data set, z r ep s , a plug-in p value can be computed based on the procedure described in the previous section.</p><p>In total, S plug-in p values are computed and a hypothetical distribution of these values is shown in the lower part of Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. As can be seen, it does not have a uniform distribution, but is skewed. In Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, the 5th percentile of generated plug-in p values has a plug-in p value of .02. That is, 5% of the p values are smaller than .02, and for example 11% of the p values are smaller than .05. In such a case, the alpha level for evaluation of the p value computed for the observed data set needs to be calibrated. That is, the p value should be compared to ' D :02 instead of ' D :05, because P.p &lt; :02jH 0 / D :05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS FOR EXAMPLES Example 1</head><p>To evaluate the performance of the plug-in p value for Example 1, in total four double bootstraps are performed with S D 1,000 and T D 1,000: As can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref> and 5c the distribution for hypothesis test Type A is almost uniform for both n D 50 and n D 640 with P.p &lt; :048jH 0 / D :05 and P.p &lt; :046jH 0 / D :05, respectively. As was shown by <ref type="bibr">Silvapulle &amp; Sen (2004, pp. 32-33)</ref>, the p values of this statistical model and for hypothesis test Type A are uniformly distributed. Our results for small and large sample sizes are pretty close to being uniform and the small deviations are sampling errors. Hence, the traditional alpha level of ' D :05 is used to evaluate the results for the observed data set.</p><p>For hypothesis test Type B, however, the distribution is clearly not uniform, see the distributions in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>. High values of the plug-in p value do not exist and low values appear too often. For small n, P.p &lt; :02jH 0 / D :05 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>) and the alpha level for the analysis with the observed data set needs to be calibrated, ' D :02. Accidentally, for large n, P.p &lt; :048jH 0 / D :05 and ' does not need to be calibrated much, ' D :048. However, as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref> the distribution is clearly not uniform, for example, P.p &lt; :30jH 0 / D :50 and P.p &lt; :38jH 0 / D :70, indicating that calibration is necessary for different alpha levels.</p><p>To evaluate the hypotheses in Equations 15 and 16 for the observed data set, a parametric bootstrap is performed where 1,000 data sets were generated. Each of these samples was fitted under H 0 for hypothesis test Type A and B. Based on the results shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>, it can be concluded that for hypothesis test Type A, H 0 can be rejected (p &lt; :001; ' D :05). This implies that the hypothesis H 0 W " 1 D " 2 D " 3 is rejected in favor of the informative hypothesis, H 1 W f" 1 ; " 2 g &lt; " 3 . Moreover, the result of hypothesis test Type B indicates that the informative hypothesis is rejected (p &lt; :001; ' D :048) in favor of the unconstrained  model H 1 W " 1 ; " 2 ; " 3 . Inspection of Table 1 reveals that " 2 &gt; " 3 and as such the unconstrained parameter estimates do not fit either H 0 W " 1 D " 2 D " 3 or H 1 W f" 1 ; " 2 g &lt; " 3 .</p><p>In conclusion, levels of antisocial behavior are not evenly predicted by how much adolescents tell the parents and by either a positive or a negative quality of the relationship with the parents (rejection of H 0 ). However, the expectation that disclosure is the best predictor does not hold (rejection of H 1 ).  <ref type="formula">20</ref>, cannot be rejected in favor of hypothesis H 1 (p D :49; ' D :04), shown in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_16">21</ref>. For hypothesis test Type B the informative hypothesis cannot be rejected in favor of the unconstrained hypothesis (p D :46; ' D :056). So, after testing the informative hypothesis it appears that the observed differences shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> are too small to reject H 0 shown in Equation <ref type="formula">20</ref>. This makes sense because confidence intervals, if computed row-wise using 1.96 times SE, overlap and as such provide a lot of support for H 0 in Equation <ref type="formula">20</ref>.</p><p>In conclusion, compared to Dutch adolescents, adolescents from different ethnic groups are satisfied to a similar degree with their relationships with parents. Besides, Dutch adolescents disclose as much information as adolescents from different ethnic groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 3</head><p>For Example 3, a double bootstrap was performed with S D 1,000, T D 1,000 and n D 640 for hypothesis test Type A and B. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> and the distribution of p values for hypothesis test Type A is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>. For this hypothesis test, the null hypotheses is rejected in favor of the informative hypothesis (p &lt; :001; ' D :04).</p><p>For hypothesis test Type B, it appears that for all S bootstraps p D 1. This result implies that in none of the S bootstraps did the constraint parameter estimates violate the inequality constraints imposed on the regression coefficients. Also, for the observed data set, p D 1. We wanted ' to have the property P.p &lt; :05jH 0 / D :05, but for this example we observed P.p &lt; :05jH 0 / D 0. This simulation study shows that that we cannot make an incorrect conclusion with respect to hypothesis test Type B.</p><p>Thus, the association with deviant peers is the most prominent predictor of problem behavior. A visual inspection of Table <ref type="table">3</ref> confirms this conclusion because the unconstraint estimate " 21 is larger than the unconstraint estimates of " 21 ; " 22 , and " 23 .  So, although inequality constraints can be tested using the approach proposed, further research should focus on decreasing computation time. We therefore recommend implementing our procedure in Mplus. If this can be achieved, the method will be attractive for researchers like <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Deković et al. (2004)</ref>, because they will be able to evaluate informative hypotheses easily and quickly.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1 Path model among relationship characteristics, disclosure, and prevalence of antisocial behavior.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Traditional hypotheses tests and model selection criteria are not equipped to deal with informative hypotheses formulated in terms of inequality constraints among the parameters of a structural equation model. In this article we presented a solution for this problem using Mplus. Some issues that need further elaboration are now discussed.</p><p>First, p values are often used in SEM and are evaluated using the traditional alpha level of .05. Using the double bootstrap procedure we evaluated the frequency properties of the plug-in p values resulting from our method. These results show clearly that the distribution of the p values is not always uniform and calibration is needed. This is especially the case when evaluating hypotheses of Type B.</p><p>Second, we used rather simple SEM models. However, there are no technical limitations to using inequality constraints for more complicated models in Mplus, for example, including latent effects, second-order effects, or categorical variables. Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> shows a hypothetical SEM model with one latent variable and seven observed variables. For this model constraints could be imposed on, for example, " 1 : : : " 3 . In this article we only discussed informative hypotheses with inequality constraints of the type " 1 &gt; " 2 &gt; " 3 . There are, however, no technical limitations to evaluate an informative hypothesis consisting of combinations of equality and inequality constraints of the form " 1 &gt; " 2 D " 3 , f" 1 " 2 g &gt; 2, or f" 1 " 2 g &lt; " 3 &gt; 1.</p><p>A limitation of the procedure is that computational time can be substantial. To compute the examples in this article we used Pentium computers (3.20 MHz) containing two dual processors (Mplus can deal with multiple processors) with 1 GB memory. The models for Example 1 and 3 took approximately 2 days to compute, but Example 2 took more than 2 weeks.</p></div>			</div>
