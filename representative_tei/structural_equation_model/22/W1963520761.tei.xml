<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This research tests and develops the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), introduced by Davis (1986), which attempts to explain end users' attitudes to computing technologies. It introduces several new variables, including compatibility, user characteristics, system rating and the enduser computing satisfaction (EUCS) construct, a surrogate measure for IT success and acceptance. A questionnaire with over seventy items was completed by a large number of users and LISREL, a technique for modelling a system of structural equations, was used to analyse the responses. The output shows the model as a whole ® ts the data very well and indicates signi® cant relationships between variables in the model. These results con® rm that TAM is a valuable tool for predicting attitudes, satisfaction, and usage from beliefs and external variables. They also show that relative advantage of the system contributed most to attitudes and satisfaction. Compatibility (of the system to the task performed) contributed most to usage and was the most important antecedent of the belief variables, including relative advantage.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The acceptance of information technology (IT) has become a fundamental part of the MIS research plan for most organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Igbaria 1993)</ref>. Acceptance of IT by managerial, professional, and operating level personnel as users is deemed a necessary condition for its success; however, resistance to computer systems by managers and professionals is a widespread problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Attewell and Rule 1984</ref><ref type="bibr">, Davis et al. 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Igbaria and Chakrabarti 1990)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Davis (1993)</ref> argues that lack of user acceptance has long been an impediment to the success of information systems which, if avoided, would improve performance on the job which is the goal of most organizationall y based information systems. This paper takes spreadsheets, as an important enduser system in the end-user computing (EUC) domain, as its IT product particular focus and examines user acceptance of such computing technology. User acceptance of IT was looked at from three angles: user attitudes, usage and satisfaction as major indicators of user acceptance. Throughout this paper `user acceptance' will be taken to refer to any of these or all three constructs put together.</p><p>User acceptance is often the focus of MIS implementation research in determining the success or failure of an IT product <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Swanson 1988</ref><ref type="bibr">, Davis et al. 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Thompson et al. 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Davis 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Igbaria 1993)</ref>, and the importance of understanding the antecedents of attitudes toward computers, satisfaction, and usage is underscored by many MIS researchers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Robey 1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Swanson 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Lee 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Igbaria and Chakrabarti 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Igbaria 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Thompson et al. 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, DeLone and McLean 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, Torkzadeh and Dwyer 1994</ref><ref type="bibr">, Etzadi-Amoli and Farhoomand 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Szajna 1996)</ref>. Thus, the important question addressed in this paper is:</p><p>What are the factors that contribute to user attitudes, satisfaction, and usage of computing technologies in organizational settings? <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Melone (1990)</ref> suggests the structure of attitudes has an impact on user cognition and behaviour. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fishbein and Ajzen (1975)</ref> proposed that individuals' attitudes toward an object play an important role in in¯uencing their subsequent behaviour toward it and there is evidence that user attitudes are positively related to computer usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Igbaria and Chakrabarti 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Igbaria 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Lucas 1978</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, Robey 1979</ref>). Hence, this paper is an attempt to investigate such structure and plausible network of relationships of attitude with selected antecedent variables: demographic, computer experience, user training and organizational support; and key outcome variables: system usage and user satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Research framework</head><p>The theory of reasoned action (TRA) is a widely studied model from social psychology which is concerned with the determinants of consciously intended behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ajzen and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Fishbein 1980, Fishbein and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ajzen 1975)</ref>. The foundation of the TRA conceptual framework is provided by the distinction between beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behaviours . According to TRA, a person' s performance of a speci® ed behaviour is determined by his or her behavioural intention (BI) to perform the behaviour, and BI is jointly determined by the person's attitude (A) and subjective norms (SN) concerning the behaviour in question.</p><p>The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), ® rst introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Davis (1986)</ref>, is an adaptation of TRA speci® cally tailored for modelling user acceptance of information technology. `The goal of TAM is to provide an explanation of the determinants of computer acceptance that is general, capable of explaining user behaviour across a broad range of end-user computing technologies and user populations' <ref type="bibr">(Davis et al. 1989, p. 985)</ref>.</p><p>A key purpose of TAM, therefore, is to provide a basis for tracing the impact of external factors on internal beliefs, attitudes, and intentions. TAM was formulated in an attempt to achieve these goals by identifying a small number of fundamental variables suggested by previous research dealing with cognitive and aOE ective determinants of computer acceptance.</p><p>TAM postulates that two particular beliefs, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, are of primary relevance for computer acceptance behaviours <ref type="bibr">(Davis et al. 1989)</ref>, as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Similar to TRA, TAM postulates that computer usage is determined by BI, but diOE ers in that BI is viewed as being jointly determined by the person's attitude toward using the system (A) and perceived usefulness. According to TAM, attitude toward using the system (A) is jointly determined by usefulness and ease of use. However, TAM does not include the TRA's subjective norms construct as it was found non-signi® cant <ref type="bibr">(Davis et al. 1989)</ref>.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Thompson et al. (1991)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Davis (1993)</ref>, it was deemed necessary to drop BI and link attitude to actual behaviour directly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Thompson et al. (1991)</ref> argue that BI should be excluded because we are interested in actual behaviour (system usage). Such behaviour has already taken place in the past, while BI is `the person' s subjective probability that he will perform the behavior in question' <ref type="bibr">(Fishbein and Ajzen 1975, p. 12)</ref> and is thus dealing with future behaviour. Since this research is concerned with acceptance which has already taken place, it was considered appropriate to follow Thompson et al.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Research model</head><p>The research model was built based on TAM while introducing several modi® cations which were not in TAM. User satisfaction is conceptualized as the aOE ective reactions of individuals toward the use of computer applications in general. This suggests that the satisfaction construct is to be placed parallel to the attitudes construct in the research model. As explained in the measurement section, the satisfaction construct is measured by the end-user computer satisfaction instrument, EUCS, and this abbreviation is used in the model from now on.</p><p>Enjoyment was introduced and placed parallel to the main belief constructs of TAM (usefulness or relative advantag e and ease of use) as a cognitive response. Although enjoyment was not among beliefs incorporated in TAM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Davis et al. (1992)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Igbaria et al. (1994)</ref> used enjoyment and fun respectively as a belief variable in their research model which was built based on TAM. Several external variables were incorporated in the model since <ref type="bibr">Davis et al. (1989)</ref> recommended some external factors to be tested in future research such as system features, user characteristics, situational constraints and managerially controllable interventions. The research general model is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The external variables are divided into three groups: demographic variables (in this case just course of study); enduser background variables (training, computer experience, computing support); system variables, which include system rating, compatibility and image (as de® ned in the hypotheses section).</p><p>Belief variables are the three user perceptions about the system' s characteristics: relative advantage; ease of use; enjoyment. These beliefs aOE ect attitude toward using the system and end-user computing satisfaction (EUCS). <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Igbaria et al. (1996)</ref> propose a model in which relative advantage and enjoyment directly aOE ect usage. However, their model excludes attitude towards the system and the basis of the TAM model being further explored in this work is that belief variables in¯uence usage primarily through their eOE ect on attitude. Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Davis et al. (1992)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Igbaria et al. (1996)</ref> stress the importance of relative advantage , the possibility of a direct eOE ect on usage is explored in this study. The research variables and causal relationships hypothesized between these variables are depicted in the research model in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Hypotheses</head><p>Based on several studies mentioned earlier, it is expected that attitudes will in¯uence system usage, but TAM also postulates that beliefs about the system in¯uence attitudes toward the system. Thus the following hypothesis is proposed.</p><p>• Hypothesis 1: Attitude towards system usage will mediate the relationships between beliefs about the system and system usage.</p><p>User satisfaction was de® ned as an attitudinal construct. This suggested placing it in parallel with the attitude construct in the research model and as an antecedent to usage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baroudi et al. (1986)</ref> provide some evidence that `the user's satisfaction with the system may lead to system usage' . Hence, similar to Hypothesis 1, the following is proposed.</p><p>• Hypothesis 2: EUCS will mediate the relationship between beliefs about the system and system usage.</p><p>TAM postulates that beliefs about the system will in¯uence attitudes toward using the system. Since user satisfaction is parallel to Attitude the following two hypotheses are straightforwardl y derived from TAM.</p><p>• Hypothesis 3: Each of ease of use, enjoyment, and relative advantage will have a signi® cant direct eOE ect on attitude towards using the system.</p><p>• Hypothesis 4: Each of ease of use, enjoyment, and relative advantage will have a signi® cant direct eOE ect on satisfaction (EUCS). <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Davis et al. (1992)</ref> hypothesized that ease of use impacts on enjoyment. This is replicated in the ® rst part of the following hypothesis. However, TAM postulates that ease of use is an antecedent to relative advantage . Thus by introducing enjoyment as a belief variable, it is hypothesized that it will mediate the relationship between ease of use and relative advantage.</p><p>• Hypothesis 5: Ease of use will have a signi® cant direct eOE ect on enjoyment and enjoyment will mediate the relationship between ease of use and relative advantage . <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Igbaria (1990)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Igbaria (1993)</ref> studied the eOE ect of training and support on belief variables. This paper hypothesizes that training and support will have signi® cant eOE ects on enjoyment, relative advantage , and ease of use. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Moore and Benbasat (1991)</ref> developed the compatibility construct to measure the perceptions of adopting an IT innovation. Compatibility refers to the degree to which a system is perceived as being consistent with the existing values, needs, and past experiences of potential adopters. For the ® rst time this research hypothesizes that compatibility will have signi® cant eOE ects on the three belief variables. Thus the following hypothesis is proposed.</p><p>• Hypothesis 6: Training, support, and compatibility variables will have signi® cant direct eOE ects on enjoyment, relative advantage , and ease of use. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Szajna (1996)</ref> recommended introducing an experience factor when studying TAM, thus EUC experience is introduced and expected to play a strong role in the acceptance model. Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed.</p><p>• Hypothesis 7: EUC experience will have a signi® - cant direct eOE ect on the three beliefs (enjoyment, relative advantage and ease of use) and also a signi® cant direct eOE ect on attitudes towards usage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Nelson and Cheney (1987)</ref> present and empirically evaluate a conceptual model of how training can impact on the acceptance of IS within the organization. In addition, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Davis et al. (1992)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Igbaria et al. (1996)</ref> it is postulated that relative advantage has a direct impact on usage. This paper hypothesizes that compatibility would have a direct impact on usage. The following hypothesis is proposed.</p><p>• Hypothesis 8: Training, compatibility, and relative advantage will have signi® cant direct eOE ects on system usage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Moore and Benbasat (1991)</ref> developed the image construct to measure the perceptions of adopting an IT innovation. Image refers to the degree to which use of a system is perceived to enhance one' s image or status in one's social system. For the ® rst time this research hypothesizes that image will have a signi® cant eOE ect on some belief variables. Thus the following hypothesis is proposed.</p><p>• Hypothesis 9: Image will have a signi® cant direct eOE ect on enjoyment.</p><p>Overall system characteristics (named here system rating) was explored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lucas (1978)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Swanson (1982)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Rivard and HuOE(1988)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Igbaria and Chakrabarti (1990)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amoroso and Cheney (1992)</ref> as system quality. Most previous research investigated its relationship with actual system use. This relationship will be tested in addition to the relationship between this construct and ease of use as well as with user satisfaction.</p><p>• Hypothesis 10: System rating will have signi® cant direct eOE ects on ease of use, EUCS, and system usage.</p><p>Two demographic variables, gender and course were ® rst identi® ed as a subset of the external variables for this study. In a preliminary study it was found that gender did not contribute to any belief, attitude or behavioural variables identi® ed for this study. Thus it was decided to remove gender and have course as the single demographic variable. The following hypothesis is proposed.</p><p>• Hypothesis 11: Course, as a demographic variable, will have signi® cant direct eOE ects on relative advantage and ease of use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Sample and procedure</head><p>The data for this study were gathered from 329 respondents by means of a questionnaire survey (see Appendix). Final year university students who had just spent one year working in industry as part of a sandwich degree programme were approached in normal class room lectures for data collection. These students are not traditional students as they have spent one year in the work environment. They consider the year out as a prerequisite for employment which oOE ers them more motivation to behave and think as company employees. Also, in many modern organizations the students during their year in industry are given the same training as full time employees since they are required to apply the same skills on the same type of work. In many ways these students have been treated as normal employees during their year in the work environment. Since the study concerned their behaviour during that year and was administered very soon after their return to the academic environment, these students could be considered as representatives of a junior management group of employees and thus suitable respondents to handle the issues being researched.</p><p>The issue of using student respondents has been debated in recent research, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Barrier and Davis (1993)</ref> considered the question `Are graduate students appropriate research surrogates for managers in evaluating new IS technology?' and concluded that `the answer to the research question... is a quali® ed yes'. However, it has to be acknowledged that there are limitations in using students. It must be emphasized that the students used in this study had only had one year of experience in employment and therefore can only be considered representative of the most junior management group in most organizations. As such their views and perceptions will be narrower and more restricted than those of more experienced managers.</p><p>The respondents had been employed in a variety of manufacturing, services, merchandising, and ® nancial organizations in a wide range of functional areas throughout UK. Of the participants, 68% were males and 32% females, 59% were studying some type of business programme, 34% an engineering programme and 7% a chemistry programme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Measures</head><p>The constructs described earlier where measured using the following indicators (shown in detail in a condensed version of the questionnaire presented in the appendix).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.2.1.</head><p>Course. A single item question was used for the respondent's degree programme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">EUC experience. EUC experience was assessed by</head><p>® ve items asking respondents to indicate their years of experience in using computers, writing computer programs and using similar packages; and their current skill level with this and other packaged application software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Organizationa l support.</head><p>The measure of organizational support incorporated two broad categories of support experience during their industrial placement: First, application development support, which is quite speci® c and includes availability of development assistance and specialized instruction and guidance in developing and using applications. Second, general support, developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Igbaria (1990)</ref>, which includes top management encouragement and allocation of resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4.">Training.</head><p>Training was assessed using nine items.</p><p>Respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which each of nine diOE erent sources contributed to the increase of their knowledge and expertise during their industrial placement. These sources include: another trainee, member of staOE , software expert, course on package features, course on model building, course on advanced features, self training. The response options ranged from (1) none to (5) extensive.</p><p>2.2.5. Compatibility. Compatibility was measured by the three item scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Moore and Benbasat (1991)</ref>.</p><p>2.2.6. Image. Image was measured by the three item scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Moore and Benbasat (1991)</ref>.</p><p>2.2.7. Ease of Use. This refers to the degree to which an individual believes that using a particular system would be free from physical and mental eOE ort <ref type="bibr">(Davis 1989</ref>). Ease of use was measured by the six-item scale developed by <ref type="bibr">Davis (1989)</ref> with two more items added to the scale later by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Moore and Benbasat (1991)</ref>.</p><p>2.2.8. Relative advantage. This refers to the degree to which an individual believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance <ref type="bibr">(Davis 1989)</ref>. Relative advantag e was measured by the six-item scale developed by <ref type="bibr">Davis (1989)</ref> with two more items added to the scale later by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Moore and Benbasat (1991)</ref>.</p><p>2.2.9. Enjoyment. This refers to the extent to which the activity of using the system is perceived to be enjoyable in it' s own right, apart from any performance consequences that may be anticipated <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Davis et al. 1992)</ref>. Enjoyment was measured by the three-item scale used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Davis et al. (1992)</ref>.</p><p>2.2.10. Attitudes toward using the system. There are many de® nitions of the attitude construct. What concerns IS researchers is a de® nition that is considered sound by psychologists and compatible with the interests of IS researchers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">McGuire (1969)</ref> de® ned attitude as: an evaluative response to an antecedent stimulus or attitude object. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ajzen (1988)</ref> developed McGuire's de® nition by describing attitude as a pre-disposition to respond favourably or unfavourabl y to an object, person, event, institution, or another discriminable aspect of the individual's world. Ajzen' s de® nition of attitude emphasizes the notion of evaluation. Based on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ajzen and Fishbein (1980)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Davis (1993)</ref> developed an attitudes scale. The instrument asked individuals to rate ® ve items according to how they feel about using the technology on a ® ve-point semantic diOE erential scale.</p><p>2.2.11. End-user computing satisfaction (EUCS). <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bailey and Pearson (1983)</ref> de® ned user information satisfaction (UIS) as a multidimensional attitude of the user toward diOE erent aspects of an information system, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ives et al. (1983)</ref> de® ned UIS as the extent to which users believe the information system available to them meets their information requirements. Although the UIS instrument has gone through re® nements, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Doll and Torkzadeh (1988)</ref> note it has not been validated for assessing speci® c end-user applications and it also ignores important ease of use aspects of man-machine interface. They argue that the nature of the UIS instrument items assume a more traditional computing environment and, like user knowledge, involvement and information product items are not application speci® c. Instead they developed the 12-item instrument of enduser computing satisfaction (EUCS). <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Torkzadeh and Doll (1991)</ref> published a test-retest reliability for the EUCS instrument, which examines the stability of individual items and subscales as well as the 12-item instrument. The results suggest that the instrument is internally consistent and stable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zmud and Boynton (1991)</ref> used a set of `® ltering rules' for identifying well-developed MIS survey instruments and, from the 119 scales investigated, the EUCS instrument developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Doll and Torkzadeh (1988)</ref> was one of only three scales to pass these rules.</p><p>In a repeated test-retest reliability of the EUCS instrument at two points in time, separated by a two year interval, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hendrickson et al. (1994)</ref> add further support for the reliability of the EUCS measure. A con® rmatory factor analysis for EUCS was carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Doll et al. (1994)</ref> which completes one exploratory-con® rmatory research cycle by more rigorously validating the EUCS instrument. The results enhance the utility of the EUCS by providing con® rmation that it explains and measures the user satisfaction construct and suggest that it can now be used as a standardized measure of user satisfaction with a speci® c application.</p><p>The EUCS instrument developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Doll and Torkzadeh (1988)</ref> is a second-order factor model that consists of ® ve ® rst-order factors measured by 12 items:</p><p>• content (4 items); • accuracy (2 items); • format (2 items); • ease of Use (2 items); • timeliness (2 items).</p><p>The research reported here employs this instrument, but only 10 items are used as the two items of timeliness (response time and information updating) were not relevant to the stand alone IT product used in this study, as they are more related to network systems.</p><p>2.2.12. System rating (S_Rating). A single item question was used to measure respondents' perceptions about the overall characteristics of the speci® c technology they were using.</p><p>Usage. System usage has been studied by a number of researchers in the past two decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lucas 1975</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, Robey and Zeller 1978</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, Ein-Dor and Segev 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Ives and Olson 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, Srinivasan 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">, Trice and Treacy 1988</ref><ref type="bibr">, Davis et al. 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Igbaria 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Amoroso and Cheney 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, Torkzadeh and Dwyer 1994)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ives et al. (1983)</ref> argued that system usage can be a surrogate indicator of system success under certain conditions. System usage is often operationalized using self-reported measures of actual usage. Five indicators were found in several studies on MIS usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Srinivasan 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Lee 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Igbaria et al. 1989</ref><ref type="bibr">, Davis et al. 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Thompson et al. 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Davis 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Igbaria 1993</ref>). These ® ve indicators were adapted for this study and became: (1) perceived daily use; (2) perceived frequency of use; (3) the number of applications used; (4) perceived usage level; (5) sophistication level of applications used. Respondents are asked to indicate their perceptions of usage level on a ® ve-point scale ranging from (1) none to (5) extremely extensive in the ® rst three indicators. The last two indicators were incorporated in this study as they were believed to re¯ect good measures of system usage. In a spreadsheeting environment a good indication of overall acceptance of the technology can be provided by measuring the sophistication level (i.e. using macros, menus, data validation, etc.) of the applications used. Sophistication level was measured by asking respondents to indicate the sophistication level of their spreadsheet applications on a ® ve-point scale ranging from (1) low to (5) high.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data analysis</head><p>The data collected was analysed using LISREL which is a `second generation' multivariate modelling technique. LISREL aims to explain the structure or pattern among a set of latent (unobserved or theoretical) variables, each measured by one or more manifest (observed or empirical) and typically fallible indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Joreskog and Sorbom 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Hayduk 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Diamantopoulos 1994</ref>).</p><p>The LISREL model assumes a causal structure among a set of latent variables. These latent variables appear as underlying causes of the observed variables. The model consists of two sets of equations: ® rstly, the measurement model equations which specify how the latent variables (or hypothetical constructs) are measured in terms of the observed variables, and how these are used to describe the measurement properties (validities and reliabilities) of the observed variables.</p><p>And secondly, the structural equation model which speci® es the causal relationships among the latent variables and is used to describe the causal eOE ects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The measurement model</head><p>The measurement model is concerned with reliability and construct validity; also it determines the extent to which the operationalizatio n of a construct actually measures what it purports to measure. It speci® es the relationships between unobserved (latent) variables and observed (manifest) indicator variables. Two separate equations describe this model. The ® rst relates the endongenou s variables to the relevant indicators and the second links the exogenous to their indicators. The variables and the number of indicators in the two equations for this present study are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>To simplify the measurement model, some variables measured with multiple items (indicators) were reduced to only one indicator. For those latent variables which do not have typical (formal) instruments or scales, the singleitem global scale strategy used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Torkzadeh and Dwyer (1994)</ref> was implemented. An aggregate or a composite item was used to represent the multiple items that measure each of them. Training and EUC experience were each assigned a single indicator valued with the mean of the multiple items used to measure that variable, and the 13 items of the Support construct variable were reduced to two indicator variables S_SPPRT and GEN_SPPRT.</p><p>A con® rmatory factor analysis (CFA) for the eight remaining constructs which have formal multiple item instruments or scales was carried out, to examine the psychometric properties for these eight constructs and the overall results are shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>The v 2 /DF ratio of the model is 1.68 (p &lt; 0.001) which, compared to 5, the most accepted ratio (Bollen and Long 1993), indicated a very good ® t. The GFI was 0.829 and the AGFI 0.801 , which being close to 1 are very good as well. The RMSR is 0.041 , which being so small also indicates a very good ® t.</p><p>Despite the good ® t it is necessary to consider deleting the weakest items. Items with a factor loading below 0.4 were considered. Only three items were found to have such low loadings, two items of the ease of use scale and one item of the usage scale. These three items were deleted and the measurement model was reestimated, yielding the results shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.</p><p>The v 2 /DF ratio of the revised measurement model is now 1.70 (p &lt; 0.001) which is still a very good ® t, being only a marginal change of (0.02) from the initial measurement model. The GFI (0.840) and AGFI (0.812) improved and can be considered very good as well. The RMSR improved slightly to 0.038 which still indicates a very good ® t.</p><p>With the earlier single item strategy of the informal multiple items constructs, the revised LISREL measurement model is now as shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Evaluation of Structural Model</head><p>A diagrammati c representation of the initial structural model is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. This model was tested using the LISREL 7 structural equations computer programme and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">5</ref>  It is important to assess the `reasonableness' of the model, so the output was scrutinized for the occurrence of any of the four conditions suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Joreskog and Sorbom (1986)</ref>. These concern the standard errors of the parameter estimates, the variances and the correlations. First, none of the standard errors should be very large; second, the parameter estimates should not be highly correlated; third, all variances and related matrices should be positive de® nite; and fourth, all absolute correlations should be less than one. None of the possible problem situations mentioned in these conditions occurred in this model and so it was safe to proceed to the next stage.</p><p>The next step is to assess the goodness of ® t of the model. Chi-square divided by the number of degrees of freedom was used as the goodness of ® t indicator, as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Joreskog and Sorbom (1986)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hayduk (1987)</ref>. A value of the ratio of a chi-square to the number of degrees of freedom (v 2 /DF) which is less than 5 can be considered adequate for large models <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bollen and Long 1993)</ref>. Using this test criteria, the value of 1.964 (p &lt; 0.001) for this model indicates a very good ® t.</p><p>Other criterion are the goodness of ® t index (GFI) and the adjusted goodness of ® t index (AGFI), which approach unity the better the model ® ts the data. The values of 0.798 and 0.769 respectively indicate a good model ® t. A third criterion is the root mean square residual (RMSR). This is a measure of the average of the residual variances and covariances and values close to zero indicate a good model ® t. The value obtained in this model was 0.047 is indicating a very good ® t.</p><p>For an overall evaluation, the goodness of ® t of the model can be said to be very good, given the large number of parameters to be estimated.</p><p>The next step in the evaluation process is to improve the ® t of the model by inspecting the structural portion of the model. The path coe cients (b s and c s) were examined to see if they were signi® cantly diOE erent from 0. Parameters whose t-values are greater than or equal to 6 2 are considered to be signi® cantly diOE erent from 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Joreskog and Sorbom 1986)</ref>. For the initial structural model 18 parameters fell in this group but the remaining 14 parameters did not. In fact ® ve of these 14 parameters were found to be on the border of the 0.05 signi® cant level. These ® ve were given another chance while the other nine were ® xed at zero and the revised model was re-estimated. After the ® rst and second passes through the parameters and re-estimating the model in each pass, the results of the ® nal revised model are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">6</ref>.</p><p>There was an increase of chi-square of 20 with an extra 14 degrees of freedom so that the ratio of v 2 /DF for the revised model was 1.957 (p &lt; 0.001) indicating a minor change of 0.007 in this ® t criterion. The RMSR was almost unchanged (an increase of 0.002). A comparison of the path coe cients, squared multiple correlations and coe cients of determination for the initial and revised models indicated that the values were only marginally diOE erent. Finally, one needs to check the modi® cation indices which are measures associated with the ® xed and constrained parameters of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Joreskog and Sorbom 1989)</ref>. A modi® cation index (MI) is a measure of predicted decrease in v 2 if any single constraint is added or removed and the model is re-estimated. It is accompanied by a prediction of the estimated change of that parameter. When the MIs were checked it was noticed that no parameter stood in need of being ® xed or relaxed which is a strong support for the overall stability of the model. The overall assessment of the ® t criteria indicates that the data ® t the revised model very well.</p><p>The variance explained (R 2 ) for each of the endogenous variables was as follows: ease of use (0.362); enjoyment (0.474); relative advantage (0.419); attitude (0.586); satisfaction (0.180); and usage (0.501).</p><p>Many researchers recommend calculating the overall impact of each variable in the causal model <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Ross 1975</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Pedhazur 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Hellevik 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Li 1986)</ref>. The direct eOE ect can be identi® ed as the magnitude of the path coe cient (b or c ) along the path connecting the cause and the eOE ect variables. An indirect eOE ect represents those eOE ects interpreted by the intervening variables; it is the product of the path coe cients along  an indirect route from the cause to the eOE ect via tracing arrows in the headed direction only. When more than one indirect path exists, the total indirect eOE ect is their sum <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Ross 1975</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Li 1986</ref>). Total eOE ect is calculated as the sum of direct eOE ect and indirect eOE ect(s) of an independent variable on its related dependent variable.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">c 1 1 c 3 1 c 1 2 c 2 2 c 3 2 c 4 2 c 1 3 c 2 3 c 3 3 c 6 3 c 1 4 c 2 4 c 3 4 c 1 5 c 2 5 c 3 5 c 6 5 c 2</formula><p>The signi® cant paths (direct eOE ects) that emerged in the revised model are depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Hypotheses testing</head><p>The results also enabled each of the proposed hypotheses to be tested.</p><p>Hypothesis 1 stated that attitudes toward system usage will mediate the relationships between ease of use, enjoyment, and relative advantage and usage. In the revised model, the attitude to usage link was found to be signi® cant (b = 0.306, p &lt; 0.01), so this hypothesis is supported.</p><p>Hypothesis 2 claimed that end-user computing satisfaction (EUCS) mediates the relationships between beliefs and usage. However, in the revised model EUCS Attitudes, satisfaction and usage in the acceptance of IT 287  is not among the predictors of usage, so the results do not support this hypothesis. Further discussion of EUCS is presented later. Hypothesis 3 stated that ease of use, enjoyment, and relative advantage will have signi® cant eOE ects on attitudes. Ease of use and relative advantage were found to have signi® cant eOE ects on attitudes (b = 0.345, p &lt; 0.01) and (b = 0.545, p &lt; 0.01) respectively, but enjoyment did not have a signi® cant link. Hence, this hypothesis is partially supported.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">c 1 1 c 3 1 c 1 2 c 2 2 c 3 2 c 4 2 c 1 3 c 2 3 c 3 3 c 6 3 c 1 4 c 2 4 c 3 4 c 1 5 c 2 5 c 3 5 c 6 5 c 2</formula><p>Hypothesis 4 proposed that ease of use, enjoyment, and relative advantage will be among the predictors of EUCS. However, only relative advantage proved to be so (b = 0.307) at (p &lt; 0.01). Thus this hypothesis is only partially supported and the role of EUCS is discussed later.</p><p>Hypothesis 5 stated that ease of use will have a signi® cant eOE ect on enjoyment and enjoyment will have a signi® cant eOE ect on relative advantage. By looking at the revised model it was found that both paths were signi® cant at (p &lt; 0.01) level. EOU® ENJ was signi® cant with (b = 0.205) and ENJ® REL_ADV was signi® cant with (b = 0.238). So this hypothesis is fully supported.</p><p>Hypothesis 6 proposed that each of training, support and compatibility have a signi® cant eOE ect on user' s beliefs. In the revised model, it was found that support has a signi® cant eOE ect on relative advantag e (c = 0.110) at (p &lt; 0.05) and compatibility has a signi® cant eOE ect on all three beliefs (c = 0.431 for COMPATBL® EOU) (c = 0.509 for COMPATBL® ENJ) (c = 0.429 for COM-PATBL® REL_ADV) all at (p &lt; 0.01). Thus it is fair to conclude that this hypothesis is partially supported.</p><p>Hypothesis 7 stated that EUC experience has a signi® cant eOE ect on the three beliefs and attitudes toward system acceptance. This is partially supported since the revised model shows that only the EUC experience to Attitude link is signi® cant (c = 0.143) at (p &lt; 0.01).</p><p>Hypothesis 8 proposed that training, compatibility, and relative advantage will have signi® cant eOE ects on system usage. In the revised model, training has a signi® cant impact on usage (c = 0.177) at (p &lt; 0.01), but compatibility was found to have a stronger signi® cant eOE ect on usage (c = 0.334) at (p &lt; 0.01), and , although the relative advantag e to usage link was found to be signi® cant in the initial model it was not found to be so in the revised model. Thus hypothesis 8 is only partially supported.</p><p>Hypothesis 9 stated that Image has a signi® cant eOE ect on enjoyment, and it was found that the image to enjoyment link was signi® cant (c = 0.122) at (p &lt; 0.05), which supports the hypothesis. Hypothesis 10 is fully supported since overall system characteristics perceived by users were found to aOE ect their perception of ease of use (c = 0.251), satisfaction (c = 0.230) and usage (c = 0.192) all at (p &lt; 0.01).</p><p>Hypothesis 11 concerned the impact of course on user' s beliefs. The results show that students studying engineering and sciences ® nd spreadsheets less easy than their counterparts on business programmes. This might be related to the applications used by engineers and scientists being more complex. However, users, whatever their course backgrounds, found spreadsheets relatively advantageou s in performing their jobs so the link Course to Rel_Adv was not signi® cant. Thus the hypothesis is only partially supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>The study results con® rm the importance of individual, organizational and IT characteristics in in¯uencing user perceptions, attitudes, satisfaction, and usage. The results also con® rm the general structure of the TAM model, showing that the eOE ects of user perceptions are channelled through attitudes which impact on usage, rather than the perceptions having a direct eOE ect on usage.</p><p>The eOE ects found for the three belief variables, ease of use, enjoyment and relative advantage are important in indicating the role of attitudes. Although the direct eOE ect of relative advantage on usage was tested, it was not found to be signi® cant. However, relative advantage does have an overall eOE ect on usage due to its signi® cant eOE ect on attitude and the signi® cant eOE ect of attitude on usage. This total eOE ect can be seen in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>. In a somewhat similar fashion, the direct eOE ect of enjoyment on attitude was not found to be signi® cant, but an overall eOE ect of enjoyment on attitude and hence in turn on usage arises from the direct eOE ect of enjoyment on relative advantage . These total eOE ects are also shown in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>. Ease of use is more complex in that the total eOE ect on attitude (and thence on usage) is the combination of a signi® cant direct eOE ect and an indirect eOE ect through its direct eOE ect on enjoyment and so on through relative advantage, which is why it has a larger total eOE ect on usage as shown in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>.</p><p>The eOE ects of the three belief variables on EUCS are rather similar to their eOE ects on attitude, except that the only direct eOE ect is from relative advantage and ease of use impacts on EUCS through in¯uence on enjoyment which in turn in¯uences relative advantage.</p><p>The link between Usage and EUCS , including the possibility of causality in either direction has been studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Srinivasan 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Baroudi et al. 1986</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kenny 1979</ref>, p 1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baroudi et al. (1986)</ref> suggest three models for the relationship between satisfaction and usage:</p><p>1. the dominant or `traditional model' : satisfaction and usage are not related; 2. usage in¯uences satisfaction: as system usage increases it leads to increased user satisfaction. This model is based on the belief that system use leads users to be more familiar with the system and to discover new uses for it which will, in turn, lead to enhanced user satisfaction with the system; 3. satisfaction in¯uences usage: the more satis® ed the user is with the system the more he or she will be inclined to use it. This model assumes that as use demonstrates that a system meets a user's needs, satisfaction with the system should increase, which should further lead to greater use of that system.</p><p>Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Delone and McLean (1992)</ref> argue that system use and user satisfaction aOE ect each other at the same time and that the type of relationship between them is `reciprocal' . <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Torkzadeh and Dwyer (1994)</ref> report that this issue is still debated among MIS researchers and practitioners, and further study is required to investigate the causality direction between the two constructs.</p><p>The present study succeeded in supporting the fundamental similarity between satisfaction and the social and cognitive psychologists' notion of an attitude suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Melone (1990)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Doll and Torkzadeh (1991)</ref> . <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Melone (1990)</ref> showed that the concept of `user satisfaction' poses problems when used to evaluate a computer system. It is not clearly de® ned, nor is there a theoretical base for its development. She suggests that `user attitude' might be a better substitute, as it already has a strong theoretical foundation in many other disciplines.</p><p>This present study investigated both concepts and found that user attitude is an antecedent to and a major determinant of system usage whereas user satisfaction is not. End-user computing satisfaction (EUCS) was expected to impact on system usage and be in¯uenced by beliefs (relative advantage , EOU, and enjoyment). Hypothesis 9 con® rms the second part of this expectation, but, the LISREL analysis did not support the hypothesis that EUCS mediates the relationship between these beliefs and usage.</p><p>Thus, in summary, this study hypothesized the third model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baroudi et al. (1986)</ref> and found no support for this type of relationship. However, further analysis was carried out to investigate if any of the other models were signi® cant in the data, including the reciprocal relation-ship, but it was found that the traditional model was the only one supported by this present data.</p><p>Another primary objective of this paper was to determine how much each determinant of attitudes toward acceptance, satisfaction, and usage contributes to each of these as a target variable. To ® nd this contribution, use of the total eOE ect coe cients is recommended <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Ross 1975</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">, Pedhazur 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Li 1986)</ref>.</p><p>Using the data in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>, the exogenous variables contributing most to each of attitudes, satisfaction, and usage, can be arranged in descending order (i.e. starting with the greater total eOE ect). Similarly the endogenous variables contributing most to each of them can be arranged in descending order. These factors are shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">8</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_7">9</ref>.</p><p>These tables show that the relative advantag e of the system perceived by the user was the most contributing factor to attitudes and satisfaction whilst compatibility of the system to the task performed was the most contributing factor to usage, as well as to relative advantage . Relative advantage is also a signi® cant contributing factor to usage, but is not as important as those factors which contribute directly, since it only contributes through attitudes. Similarly enjoyment has a small total contribution to usage as it is only contributing indirectly through relative advantage .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>The results from this research provide a model for predicting three major variables (attitudes, satisfaction, and usage) used by MIS researchers as criterion measures of IS success related to several antecedent variables in a network of relationships. This model was found to have a very good ® t to the data. The results also provide the contributing factors to each of the three outcome variables and the amount that each factor contributes to its target variable.</p><p>The most striking aspect of these results is the importance of compatibility. This construct refers to the extent to which a system is being perceived as consistent with the users needs, values and experiences.</p><p>For the ® rst time, this research linked compatibility to the three belief variables. The results show the strong and dominant eOE ect of compatibility on these beliefs variables, which feeds through relative advantage to a very signi® cant impact on attitudes. There is also a strong direct and a weaker indirect impact on usage, making compatibility the most important antecedent of all endogenous variables, except EUCS. Thus compatibility should be a major concern of management when trying to increase the acceptance of such systems. This research also suggests that the usage-satisfactio n relationship is ambiguous and equivocal. The study found a strong positive correlation between satisfaction and usage but it failed to establish any direction of causality between them. Further research could aim to determine how these concepts are related and what the implications for management are as a consequence of such a relationship.</p><p>Comparing attitude with user satisfaction, this study supports the direction suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Melone (1990)</ref>. She suggested that user attitude might be a better substitute, as it already has a strong theoretical foundation in many other disciplines. This study points to attitude being an antecedent to and a predictor of usage whereas satisfaction does not prove to be so. Hence, this study suggests that attitude is `more than' a substitute for satisfaction and that satisfaction should be used as a complement to usage when evaluating end-users' acceptance of computer technologies. Being employed together, both subjective and objective measures should compensate for the shortcomings of each other and lend more insight in the situations of captive use and the less accurate self-report measures applied these days in the MIS research.</p><p>The amount of variance explained by the predicting factors for each of the three outcome variables suggests the need to investigate a more comprehensive acceptance model. In particular, it indicates there may be value in examining the normative beliefs and subjective norms not considered in TAM which constitute major components of the TRA base model. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
