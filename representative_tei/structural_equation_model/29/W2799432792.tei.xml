<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The supply chain relationship caused by cultural differences is now a challenge for supply chain management. Crosscultural interaction is inevitable between supply chain partners to deal with the disputes, and ways to handle and understand different beliefs and expectations. The innovation performance implications in export and importer relationship are gaining scholarly attention in international business research. Relational governance may significantly impact on innovation performance improvements <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Awan, 2018)</ref>. As an increasing number of firms are dealing with buyers and suppliers abroad, cultural differences create misunderstanding within the inter-organisational relationship that can result in a false reading of partner's behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Ribbink &amp; Grimm, 2014)</ref>. The current discussion on governance of inter-firm relationships calls for research on "how" governance influences outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Cao &amp; Lumineau, 2015)</ref>. This study responds to the increase in recent calls to understand the impact of culture on firm performance outcomes through governance mechanism <ref type="bibr">(Handley &amp; Angst, 2015)</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Awan, Kraslawski &amp; Huiskonen, 2018a)</ref> found that the supplier-buyer engagement in a supply chain is essential for the adoption and diffusion of new sustainability practices and Cultural intelligence is at the heart of the socially sustainable development processes. The present study investigates the question, whether the use of cultural capabilities by export manufacturing firm's are effective in bringing the improvement of the firm performance. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Bstieler &amp; Hemmert, 2015)</ref> proposed a conceptual framework how manufacturing firm in Asia can achieve coordination with their foreign partner. According to (López-Duarte, González-Loureiro, Vidal-Suárez &amp; González-Diaz, 2016) cultural differences among the distant partners tend to hamper collaboration, the establishment of process and procedure that encourage information flow. Despite the crucial role governance mechanism plays in firm performance improvements, the extant research mostly focuses on the operational and relationship performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Paulraj, Jayaraman &amp; Blome, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Relational governance emphasises the role of repeated interactions which lead to mutual understanding, social identification, and trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Das &amp; Teng, 1998)</ref>. Prior research in operations management literature has examined organisational culture at individual partnership context in a single industry evaluated its effect on firm manufacturing practices and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Naor, Linderman &amp; Schroeder, 2010)</ref>. Whereas, more recent studies emphasise on improving innovation performance through environmental practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Macchion, Moretto, Caniato, Caridi, Danese, Spina et al., 2017)</ref>. In the era of globalisation, supply chains play a fundamental role in the development of an organisation and its goal of profit maximization <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Tavana, Amin, Di &amp; Rahpeyma, 2016)</ref>. Given the importance of being successful in coordination in an international context, many scholars have argued that it is vital to possess cultural knowledge and skills in cross-culture interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Charoensukmongkol, 2016)</ref>. Further, <ref type="bibr">(Awan, Kraslawsk &amp; Huiskonen, 2018b)</ref> suggest that cultural intelligence capability is a tool that enables individual effectively interact with and learn from their buyers can overcome dualities of decision-making and help to foster sustainability commitment. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Gonçalves, Reis, Sousa, Santos, Orgambídez-Ramos and Scott (2016)</ref> emphasize the importance of cultural intelligence promotes a more effective conflict management style and therefore contributing to organisational success.</p><p>A prior study <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Molinsky, 2007)</ref> has observed that employees with a better cultural understanding of other partners can benefit to enhance knowledge exchange. While some scholars have started examining the implications of culture on governance mechanism <ref type="bibr">(Handley &amp; Angst, 2015)</ref>, there is still little research that explores the various aspects of culture and how firm deal with it. Specifically, exporting firms from emerging countries tend to have limited resource <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adu-Gyamfi &amp; Korneliussen, 2013)</ref>. It thus becomes possible for firms to learn to form each other and benefit from mutual learning in a way that creates new value <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Tan, Wong &amp; Chung, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The ample research on governing inter-firm supply chain relationship and innovation performance improvement has yet to yield a uniform conclusion in the light of diverse perspective and cultural differences on the nature of cooperation and its performance contributions. In today's culturally diverse customers and successful international business transactions, effective work interaction with multi-cultural customers requires an understanding of differences in behaviours, perspectives, and motivation and communication styles. For successful international business transactions, one has to go beyond the ethnocentric worldview and develop a global mindset' <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Christiansen, 2015)</ref>. Pakistan has a higher power distance culture, where decision-making and communication style is informal. This study has responded to research call <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Molinsky, 2007)</ref>, by exploring the role of supplier firm cultural intelligence to enhance more coordination for social performance improvement and innovation performance improvements. While the research on cultural intelligence is developing, so far few study has explicitly investigated culture's influence on governance mechanism. The role of cultural intelligence (CQ) has not been examined at the level of governance mechanism an important gap exists and offer a useful venue within the operations management literature. Moreover, little is known about how social performance improvement mediates between the relational governance and innovation performance improvements. Empirical research provides us with little understanding of how different integration efforts and approaches influence on firm performance.</p><p>The present study strives to expand research by answering the research questions, (1) What is the relationship between relational governance and firm social performance and innovation performance improvements? (2) Do cognitive and meta-cognitive cultural intelligence capabilities mediates the relationship between relational governance social performance improvement and innovation performance improvements? Our conceptual framework (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) is grounded in the resource-based view (RBV). We draw our conceptual framework on theories that have used in previous research studies in Buyer-supplier relationships. According to the RBV theory resources are heterogeneous and immobile <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Hunt &amp; Morgan, 1995)</ref>. As a result, organizations establish relationships to access resources and enhance their competitive advantage. Such relational capabilities can be rare, inimitable and substitutable at a company level <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Matanda &amp; Freeman, 2009)</ref>. The present study makes two important contributions to both theory and practice. First, we contribute to the literature by highlighting the role of cultural adaptation as a prerequisite for the operations managers in export manufacturing firms. Second, our findings lend support to the important role of cultural intelligence two factors, cognitive and meta-cognitive factors influencing social performance improvements and innovation performance improvements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Theoretical View</head><p>The resource-based view (RBV) of the firm is one of the most widely accepted theoretical frameworks, proposing that organisational capabilities can be important in shaping firm success in the market <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Barney &amp; Felin, 2013)</ref>. Recent RBV research has called for a better understanding of how resources and capabilities are deployed to capture performance benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Sirmon, Hitt &amp; Ireland, 2007)</ref>. Previous studies focused on the different factor of organisational capabilities, such as learning, emotional, technological to improve the performance. Few studies have demonstrated the cultural aspects of firm-specific capabilities and the impact on performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Moon, 2010)</ref>. The development of learning capabilities requires integration of resources. However, CQ capability is another organisational capability that over time make distinctive, embedded a source of competitive. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Moon, 2010)</ref>, it demonstrates organisation's capability to reconfigure and adapt its competency to rapidly changing the intercultural environment.</p><p>Social performance aspects in the supply chain of manufacturing firms are less emphasised <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Brandenburg, Govindan, Sarkis &amp; Seuring, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Husgafvel, Pajunen, Virtanen, Paavola, Päällysaho, Inkinen et al., 2015)</ref>.

There is growing trend towards developing a more sustainable way of managing social performance among the manufacturing firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Husgafvel et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Cultural intelligence defined as "A person's capability for successful adaptation to new cultural settings; that is, for unfamiliar settings attributable to cultural context" <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Earley &amp; Ang, 2003)</ref>. Similarly <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Peterson, 2011)</ref> found CQ as "the aptitude to use skills and abilities appropriately in cross-culture environment". In line with this <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Eisenberg, Lee, Brück, Brenner, Claes, Mironski et al., 2013)</ref>, whose definition we followed in our present study, stating that cultural intelligence (CQ), reflects capabilities to manage oneself effectively and to interact and harmonise with others in cross-cultural landscapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Eisenberg et al., 2013)</ref>. Metacognitive and cognitive facets of cultural intelligence (CQ) deal with information processing aspects of intelligence, which closely linked to mental capability of processing to acquire, cultural knowledge and reflects the specific knowledge of content in the culturally diverse situation. This process is concerned with structure and procedures facilitating coordination and integration in a cross-cultural context <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Moon, 2010)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Moon, 2010)</ref>, organisational CQ capability framework consists of cross-cultural coordination, cross-cultural learning, and cross-cultural reconfiguration. The literature suggests that firm develop process and reconfiguration capability is embedded in coordination and sharing and processing of knowledge and information <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Teece &amp; Pisano 2004)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Hypothesis Development</head><p>Much research has attempted to explain the effects of relational governance structure on performance, but few studies have incorporated strategic consideration the role of culture in managing interfirm relationship <ref type="bibr">(Handley &amp; Angst, 2015)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Poppo &amp; Zenger, 2002)</ref>, relational governance enforces of promise, obligations, expectations through social process that promotes norms of flexibility, solidarity and adaptations. In this present study, relational governance is based on the joint problem solving and collaboration. However, in many buyersupplier relationships, a natural way of doing business is work jointly through relational governance <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Zhou, Zhang, Sheng, Xie &amp; Bao, 2014)</ref>. This supports the notion that firm deploys relational governance is useful in knowledge acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Zhou et al., 2014)</ref>. Collaboration and assessment with social performance, measure social performance of buying firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Golini, Longoni &amp; Cagliano, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Gualandris, Golini &amp; Kalchschmidt, 2014)</ref>. Relational governance refers to the extent to which relationship between the parties are governed by shared norms and social mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Liu, Luo &amp; Liu, 2009)</ref>. Relational governance is a necessary component of firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Schepker, Oh, Martynov &amp; Poppo, 2014)</ref>. Governance mechanisms are essentially important for the stability of the supplier relationship, and it refers to a structural mechanism through which both parties behave with the aim of achieving the joint objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Cao &amp; Lumineau, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Liu et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Awan &amp; Kraslawski, 2017)</ref>, examines the way in which supplier firm perceived support from the partner for the improvement of the worker's conditions. They suggest that exchange of information can exist regarding the nature of the perceived change in firm performance. The results have shown that the social exchange perspective that views relational contracts in the form of norms or personal relation itself a driver for inter-firm trust, cooperation and information exchange, is an effective means of governance. Cooperation and information exchange behaviour of supplier firm towards their buyer is motivated by rewarding trustworthy reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Awan &amp; Kraslawski, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Social performance defined as "ethical code of conduct for growth and human survival that should be achieved in an inclusive, connected equitable and prudent manner" <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Sharma &amp; Ruud, 2003)</ref>. The same may be true and give rise to the relational governance rather than the contractual governance Some scholars also suggest that formal contracts have a direct effect on the economic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Arranz &amp; de Arroyabe, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Liu et al., 2009)</ref>. Social performance defines as the "incorporate the health and safety issues, improvement of environmental issues and child labours <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Hutchins &amp; Sutherland, 2008)</ref>. Accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Luzzini, Brandon-Jones, Brandon-Jones and Spina (2015)</ref> argue that cooperative arrangements with an external partner are beneficial when focusing heavily on improving social sustainability initiatives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Awan, Kraslawski and Huiskonen (2018b)</ref> define social sustainability a system of coordinated social interaction practices for the management of the social impact on people and society with the key internal and external stakeholders. This all happens for creating, developing and delivering the best social and ethical code of conduct. The aim is to have value for the survival of current business system (customers, partners and society) and its growth for the future generation equitably and prudently.</p><p>The empirical evidence suggests that relational governance is positively associated with the social performance improvements <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Awan &amp; Kraslawski, 2017)</ref>. Furthermore, the ability to implement process successfully and continuously is crucial, resides mainly with the firm employees, who constitute learning capability, acquire resources and knowledge. Thus, joint problem solving could also result in improved supplier's performance. Finally, collaborative communication enhances supplier's performance by allowing both buyer and supplier to complete tasks more effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Cai, Yang &amp; Hu, 2009)</ref>. The export manufacturing firms in Pakistan require the compliance to these collaborative ties. This requirement compels the managers to engage themselves with external cooperative behaviours to buyers boost the firm capacity to comply with the requirements and improve internal environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Awan, Kraslawski &amp; Huiskonen, 2018b)</ref>. Resource-based view emphasizes how the firm may achieve performance outcomes by developing intangible and tangible resources. From a resource-based perspective, firm interaction with different buyers helps firms with the development of new learning capabilities they can leverage to enhance their competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Barney &amp; Felin, 2013)</ref>. Firm social performance improvement can be explained by a set of core different learning capabilities linked to the firm relational governance. Learning from their buyers in exchange of information can help firms to offer new opportunities in the development of process development. For these firms, development of learning capabilities for development of new process as a key internal resource in order to improve social performance.</p><p>Thus, we hypothesise that:</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Relational governance in export markets is positively associated with social performance improvements.</p><p>Innovation is a term that connotes the development of new products, processes and ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Burrus, Graham &amp; Jones, 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Joshi, Das &amp; Mouri (2015)</ref> define innovativeness as "an organisation's proclivity to engage in and support new ideas, creativity, novelty, and experimentation that may lead to new products, services, and processes". A firm must acquire required information from every possible source to develop leading-edge innovative products to fulfil the market's needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Makri, Theodosiou &amp; Katsikea, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Weerawardena, Mort, Liesch &amp; Knight, 2007)</ref>. Improving aspects of innovation performance such as product and process design and manufacturing flexibility mean that more tacit, and organisation-specific information has to be shared between buyers and suppliers, which requires trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Blomqvist, Hurmelinna &amp; Seppänen, 2005)</ref>. More information exchange in a relational relationship, may enhance trust and reduce the concern associated with this information sharing, encouraging buyer and suppliers to act ambitious <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Carey, Lawson &amp; Krause, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Recent empirical evidence emphasizes the important role of information acquisition about customers and competitors in increasing firm performance through the advancement of innovativeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Ozkaya, Droge, Hult, Calantone &amp; Ozkaya, 2015)</ref>. Organizational culture has a mediating effect on performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Gorondutse &amp; Hilman, 2016)</ref>. Firms engaged in intense information exchange naturally enhance their process of information gathering and analysing, which greatly contributes to their capability to support novelty, creativity and research and development <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Makri et al., 2017)</ref>. Export manufacturers can enhance its innovation performance improvements by increasing focus on relational governance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Awan, 2018)</ref>. These sustainability practices could create a competitive advantage and are the part of the firm's resources and capabilities which integrated into the Resource Base View (RBV) attempt to build variability performance across the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Barney, 1991)</ref>. We argue that repeated interactions lead to developing mutual understanding, sharing of information and resources, may help to find new ways to develop process and products. Thus, Hypothesis 2: Relational governance in export markets is positively associated with innovation performance improvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Mediation Effect of Meta-Cognitive CQ and Cognitive</head><p>The dramatic change in the global business environment and frequent interaction between the stakeholders in the conduct of business is required cultural intelligence skills in the management <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Tuan, 2016)</ref>. According to (Van Dyne, <ref type="bibr">Ang &amp; Koh, 2008: page 17)</ref>, metacognitive is an individual ability to acquire and understand other cultural knowledge during interactions with those from the different cultural background. It essentially reflects the ability to form strategies before an intercultural interaction, check about key assumptions and cultural bonding thinking and adjust mental maps, when the experience is different from expectations. When people adopting a metacognitive approach to differences and dispute resolution are likely to focus on arguments that reflect own cultural position as legitimate while adopting the other cultural claim and demands as valid and supported standards that govern the mutual relationships. This cooperative frame entails norms, practices and belief regarding social practices and leads to behaviours aimed at gaining mutually agreed performance outcomes. Thus, a cooperative frame will lead to an interest-based approach for dispute resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Lumineau &amp; Malhotra, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Cognitive CQ, which refers to an individual's use of its cultural practices, norms and conventions in different cultural settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Van Dyne et al., 2008)</ref>, can be used to understand both differences and similarities among cultures. Cognitive CQ directly reflects mental maps about own and other culture mainly knowledge about social, legal and economic systems in a specific context <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Earley &amp; Gardner, 2005)</ref>. Metacognitive and cognitive are not mutually exclusive. However, that approaches can have consequences for whether and how the differences and dispute are resolved. It is possible that both of these two frames will be activated within the same dispute <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991)</ref>. The presence, under a systemic perspective, of homogeneous cultural values and practices in which collaboration actors can be identified may strengthen the group membership or establish a social network that facilitates interactions among its members <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Vilana &amp; Monroy, 2010)</ref>. The use of these approaches is especially likely when the difference and conflict are complex. For example, when there are areas of disagreement as well as agreement on how many women will be employed for a particular task, to have gender equality. Differences may arise due to the locally culturally practices and another partner culture-specific context. In other words, metacognitive and cognitive CQ may be sufficient to be effective in interaction with different cultural backgrounds if the situation is required to adopt another perspective in certain situations even they know what they should do and have the necessary own cultural knowledge. We argue that complexity of intercultural behaviour, metacognitive and cognitive capable individual developmental maps and then adjust the maps that help them to reach accurate expectations to form strategies of interacting with different cultural background individuals.</p><p>The effectiveness of learning CQ capability to adapt or acquire behaviours appropriate for culture adjustments. According to the RBV, individuals interact and learn new skills to adapt or acquire behaviours appropriate for culture adjustments <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Earley, 2002)</ref>. Organizational culture is rare as it is different from other organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Barney, 2001)</ref> and it aligned organizational strategic goals and led to cultivating competitive advantage. Thus, the firm requires dynamic capability in a cross-cultural context, "as it is defined as firm's capability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competencies with response to rapidly changing environments". <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Teece &amp; Pisano, 2004)</ref>. Thus, these differences in coordination routines provide a great impact on developing rare and intangible assets, help to deploy effectively to gain performance. A firm with this capabilities tends to generate capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Moon, 2010)</ref>. Crosscultural coordination integration reflects the organisation's capability for effectively and efficiently integrating external and internal resources and competencies. Cultural intelligence is consists of knowledge, thinking, motivation and behaviours and is an adaptive cultural capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Awan &amp; Kraslawski, 2017)</ref>. Here, applying RBV, we argue that: Hypothesis 3: Meta-cognitive cultural intelligence significantly mediates the relationship between relational governance and social performance improvement.</p><p>Hypothesis 4: Cognitive, cultural intelligence significantly mediates the relationship between relational governance and firm social performance.</p></div>

Organizations are required to make continuous changing into their internal operations to compete competitively in ever changing the environment in the global place <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Schoenherr, 2009)</ref>. We argue that social performance improvement brings excellent insights into process-based practices, which makes firms more efficient by reducing the accidents at workplace, improving the work conditions and compliance with the procedures. Such activities may stimulate not only process and product innovation but also in the administration process, which can contribute towards significant operational efficiency and knowledge integration. Here applying RBV, we suggest that innovation performance improvement is importantly influenced by a firm that continuously improves the process and improves production environment. All of these resources exert a significant positive effect on the innovation performance. We argue that such improvement in process and production environment is critical mechanisms for knowledge combination, which could help the firm to introduce new products. Thus, Hypothesis 5: Social Performance improvement is positively and significantly mediates the relationship between relational governance and innovation performance improvement.</p><p>In summary, we propose a conceptual model as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Data Collection</head><p>We test our research model and hypotheses using survey questionnaire data on export manufacturing firms in Pakistan. This study uses Pakistan manufacturer exporters as an empirical setting to test the hypothesis. Currently, Pakistan is also emerging economy and globalization sustainability challenges result in both pressure and drivers for Pakistanies exporter firms to engage with their buyers and understand partner cultural knowledge by engaging with more inter-firm relationship activities in global supply chain networks to improve their social performance. Pakistanies culture has a strong tradition for inter-organizational and inter-personal in supply chain relationships. Pakistan is an emerging economy based on the collaboration with partners and relationship, which is an important factor influencing social performance improvement in many firms. Thus, Pakistan provides a right context to test the interplay among the variables, such as cultural intelligence, social performance improvement and innovation performance improvement. Pakistan is a global production base of textile, sports goods and surgical instruments, exporting a wide variety of goods to Europe and Western countries. Pakistan recent rise importer and exporter inter-frim problems have emerged due to weak regulations and institutional system that have caused international concerns related to its transaction arrangements not only on the social issues but also on health issues in surroundings of the firm facility.</p><p>The questionnaire reviewed by supply chain management academic experts and then pretested among 12 manufacturing firms (excluded in the final analysis) to gain clarity of content and improve readability. We made minor modifications in two items; two items were deleted due to low factor loadings each from contractual governance and social performance. We randomly drew a sample of Pakistan manufacturer exporters from the database of Federal Chamber of Commerce Industry of two major cities. A random sampling technique was used for choosing the appropriate firms and identified 650 firms matching our sampling criteria. After having eliminated those firm did not meet the at least five years exporting experience as well as those who did not have complete contact details.</p><p>A sample of 650 manufacturing firms contacted by telephone for their participation and request the designation of key informants, 316 firms responded to participate in the survey. The key respondents in this study were senior supply chain managers. All key respondent firms were told that survey mainly contained questions related to their governance of supply chain relationships. Out of 316 firms, 257 firms completed the questionnaire. In total, we obtained 186 questionnaires in the first three weeks. We then followed by telephone calls and through sending them an email, and 71 responses were received after the three weeks. As a result of this approach, 257 responses were received, of which 18 response were unusable due to missing values, and firm respondents lack knowledge, resulting in 239 useable responses. The key informants came from executive's level positions managed and involved in decision makings, such as Managing director, General manager, Director supply chain and logistics and Director import and exports.</p><p>Our sample covered a wide range of industries, including textile, sports, surgical. We make appointments with the key informants and solicit their cooperation to participate in the survey. The key informants assured that all provided information would be used only for the academic purpose. To assess the non-response bias, we divide the sample into early and late respondents <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Armstrong &amp; Overton, 1977)</ref>. This study used independent sample t-test to compare early and late respondents. The result of Leven's test of equality of variance of each variable were p &gt; 0.05.

The findings are consistent with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Awan, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Awan &amp; Kraslawski, 2017)</ref>. The findings indicate that relational governance enhances trust that enables individuals to come up with new ideas during interactions; this is likely to be the key driver to transform ideas into practicability to improve the social quality of life for their workers and society. This might indicate that when an export manufacturer implements relational governance, it reinforces the possibility of being involved with the importer, exchange of information and joint planning significant impact on social performance improvement. Whereas relational governance is also positive and significantly associated with the innovation performance improvement. (β = 0.16, t = 3.434, p &lt; 0.05), providing support for H2.

The results of mediation analysis shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> respectively for MCQ and COQ. Our results reveal that exporting firms need to adapt, reconfigure cultural knowledge and integrate resources into the operations so that they can proactively improve social performance and achieve superior innovation performance. We suggest that cultural intelligence capabilities with relational governance in exporting manufacturing firms in emerging market can promote social cohesion between partners. Social cohesion can be used to attempt to establish a link to a lost moment of social harmony <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Pahl, 1991)</ref>. Social cohesion is emerging through cultural intelligence, which serves to bring suppliers and buyers together to work jointly and improve collaboration.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussions</head><p>The present research provides new insight into the literature in following ways. First, recent research has begun to emphasise the importance of sustainability on innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Macchion et al., 2017)</ref>, no empirical research has examined the nature of the relationship between social performance and innovation performance outcomes in exporting context. Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV) and empirically tests a conceptual model investigating a set of relational governance, cultural intelligence, and social performance effect on innovation performance improvement. Our results reveal the importance of meta-cognitive CQ effect on social performance improvements. These results consistent of the findings of past studies on relational governance and cultural intelligence. Strategic orientation towards cultural intelligence should be integrated into the company's governance mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Awan et al., 2018a)</ref>. The export firms in Pakistan require the adaptation to the cultural norms and values of partner culture in cross-border supply chain relationships. This requirement compels firms to engage themselves with crosscultural training, is key to successful collaboration.</p><p>Our results reveal that exporting firms in Pakistan likely to adapt to the partner cultural preferences, resolve differences, resulting in the more significant exchange of information and increase collaboration has an impact on the social performance improvement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Chua, Morris and Mor (2012)</ref> reported positive effects of meta-cognitive CQ on collaboration. The results showed that repeated interaction and exchange of information might allow the firm to articulate one's knowledge and improve the understanding of the partner culture. This could because of that, Pakistan cultural norms favour cooperative norms, which smoothly articulate and questioning ones the mental model is important for effective learning. It allows an individual to transcend existing knowledge and engage in double-loop learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Sun &amp; Anderson, 2010)</ref>. Second, our findings highlight the urgency of adopting a more integrated approach to study the effect of social performance on innovation performance. We especially contended with a growing stream of research, supporting that performance benefits of innovation do not merely result from relational governance. We extend the literature on innovation by showing that, relational governance enable the organisation to increase collaboration, enables the improvement of social performance, which in turn results in the firm's increase success in innovation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>This study contributes to a growing field of research in manufacturing and supply chain relationship by demonstrating how relational governance shapes the relationship between social performance improvement and innovation performance improvement. In this paper, we investigate how relational governance influences on firm's cultural intelligence capability and social performance improvements. By applying, resource-based view, we provide evidence that relational governance effects firm cultural intelligence development from adoptability to adaptability for social performance improvements. The conceptual model we develop reinforce this implication that there is a positive mediation effect of cultural intelligence between relational governance and social performance improvements. We provide conceptual evidence to demonstrate that cultural understanding and adaptability in a buyer-supplier relationship can develop learning capabilities for social sustainability. Our results highlight the importance of cultural intelligence a guiding principle for the development of buyer-supplier relationships and deployment of learning resources. The export manufacturer that are likely to see social performance improvement in the coming decades that are not only doing business internationally through relational governance but that are developing the strategic cultural intelligence capability to successfully doing business internationally.</p><p>The results show a positive association between firm-level meta-cognitive cultural intelligence capabilities and social performance improvement. Similarly, results show an indirect association social performance improvement between relational governance and innovation performance improvement. Improvements. Our results suggest that innovation performance improvements positively depend on the capacity of the firm to activate participate in relational governance but also on social performance improvements. These findings imply that firms with a superior supporting work environment (social support, physical factors, and internal satisfaction) positively associated with the design of new process and development of products. We conclude that firm internal capability effects on the buyer-supplier relationship and firm performance improvements. These findings underline the importance of fit between the export-manufacturing firm's cultural intelligence and the resources need to be associated with relational governance. The cultural capability is at the centre of today's sustainable development advantage in the buyersupplier relationship.</p><p>Our study contributes to the sustainability literature on supply chain relationship. First, focusing on the role of social performance improvement by export firms in innovation performance. This study shows that innovation performance depends on a firm's continuously sustainability learning practice. Our study moves beyond the direct link between relational governance and innovation performance by identifying social performance improvements a contextual variable in the relationship between relational governance and innovation performance. Second, this study makes theoretical contributions. Our study uses resource-based view (RBV), applying it to the cultural intelligence. The finding that cultural intelligence is influencing the development of other unique knowledge capabilities. Through the use of cultural intelligence, firm increase its ability to sense cultural differences, seize and adapt globally scattered cultural practices on social issues and allows for the development of unique knowledge resources and capabilities, impact on firm social performance and innovation performance improvements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Managerial Implications</head><p>This study offers implications for the practitioners and policymakers. Managers should pay close attention to the cultural differences of the evolving needs of their foreign customers on social issues. This cultural understanding can strongly affect their collaboration development and inter-firm exchange relationship. The unprecedented pace of globalisation and sustainable development, the firm capability to capture and understand social cohesion constitute one important element in the process of development more collaborative ties. Supplier's managers need to understand the extent of the buyer's level of cultural practices on social sustainability issues to implement best sustainability practices. Cross-cultural training of the manager dealing with cross-border partners could simply improve the international collaboration in international business.</p><p>Moreover, our study findings indicate that cultural intelligence dimensions affect performance improvements. In this respect, top management in exporting firms should delegate decision making to managers and power sharing. Remarkably, it is found that higher level of cognitive CQ is associated with the coordination and it is crucial for the manufacturers' exporters to learn quickly and to make sense of cultural knowledge in foreign markets. Importantly managers are advised to establish more informal information exchange channels within their company to accelerate the performance outcomes. For managers from developed countries, when purchasing from developing countries suppliers, must consider the higher management have considerable experience and qualified international managers in dealing with the different cultural customers to seek social performance. Our study results suggest that cultural intelligence exists in export manufacturing firms, where suppliers feel part of the buyers, and personal relationship are strong; differences among buyers are respected; and where the partners support supplier managers. The result from this study emphasized cultural intelligence to be treated, as part of social cohesion that deeply rooted in cultural intelligence capabilities of an organisation, is the key to success towards social performance. Furthermore, the supply chain relationship is likely to benefit from cultural intelligence capability when there are differences and disputes on the implementation of different social sustainability practices among buyers and suppliers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Limitations and Future Research</head><p>This study has the limitation that needs to be addressed. The major limitation is that it is a cross-sectional study with few industries and does not present the whole population. Further research could examine how firms implement governance mechanism by paying particular to draw a comparison between their govern mechanism practices and so social performer in other developing countries (China and India). We restrict our analysis only to Pakistan export manufacturers. Further, it would also be useful to improve our understanding of the relationship between internal governance and institutional differences in implementation sustainable practices. Examination of the mediating role of knowledge acquisition, knowledge sharing and moderating role of sustainable investment on firm performance improvement is an important research area for future researchers. Future research studies could include examining whether the manufacturer re-orientation on ecological is influenced by the customers when they have a contractual relationship with each other.

However, regarding our conceptual model does not include all dimensions of social performance, there is need to identify the what are the good self-governance mechanism in the different industry upon which social performance measures can be binding in contracts to achieve desired targets. Future research may seek to investigate how and what type of social cohesion is needed in order to improve the buyer-supplier relationships in a sustainable way?</figDesc><table /></figure>
