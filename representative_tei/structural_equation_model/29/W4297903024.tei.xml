<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Business organizations may be able to improve their Sustainability Performance (SP) by adopting Total Quality Management (TQM) concepts combined with Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies. This research has developed a model to investigate the influence of TQM and I4.0 on SP. It also analyzes the mediating role of TQM in the relationship between I4.0 and SP. A survey was conducted among 240 respondents employed in ready-made garment (RMG) industries in Bangladesh. A Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique was used to analyze the collected data. Research findings show that both TQM and I4.0 technologies have a significant impact on the sustainable growth of the Bangladeshi RMG sector. Moreover, it is observed that TQM mediates the relationship between I4.0 and SP. The findings show that TQM helps to explain the relationship between I4.0 and sustainable performance. This study will provide a guideline for industrial executives on securing sustainability through the adoption of TQM concepts and I4.0 technologies. We are not aware of any additional studies that look at the possible link between TQM, I4.0, and SP, as well as the mediating role of TQM between I4.0 and SP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Globally, we are confronting key sustainability challenges in social, economic, and environmental arenas <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Sarker et al., 2021)</ref>. For example, over one billion people are living in extreme poverty <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Raj et al., 2020)</ref>, and The World Bank (2021) stresses that economic disparity and social inequality continue to prevail. Economic and environmental sustainability problems are compounded further as the linear economy module, with a 'take-make-waste' approach to manufacturing and consumption, does not complement environmentally responsible agendas, ultimately threatening life on Earth <ref type="bibr">(Industrial Development Report, 2018)</ref>. A rising global population coupled with a linear economy model creates greater ecological damage. Under the current approaches, there is still too high a reliance upon the use of non-renewable raw materials and a consumer approach of waste through non-sustainable consumption, along with excessive manufacturing emissions and pollution via improper disposal of products <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Dubey et al., 2014)</ref>. It is clear businesses play a crucial role in the pursuit of a sustainable planet, as such, there needs to be a global commitment from all industries to engage in significant sustainable business improvements <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Dubey &amp; Bag, 2013)</ref>. By establishing sustainable practices in all businesses, the negative impact of production, services, and logistics on the ecosystem will be reversed <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Jabbour et al., 2018)</ref>. Numerous scholars have highlighted TQM and I4.0 as important techniques to increase the sustainability performance of an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abbas, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">AlShehail et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Machado et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Nara et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Tasleem et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>While there are clear benefits to society from businesses adopting sustainable practices, there can be challenges for the organizations themselves. Business sustainability refers to the triple bottom-line (TBL) of profit, planet, and people <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Slaper &amp; Hall, 2011)</ref>. By its very definition, therefore, becoming sustainable encompasses transitioning to a whole new business approach and culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Hermelingmeier &amp; Wirth, 2021)</ref>. In addition, businesses often experience challenges in knowing what aspect(s) to target first, which involves a process of 'strategic reframing' to help guide the company through the change into sustainable development <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Haubensak, 2020)</ref>. Once organizations do have a plan in place, <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Slaper and Hall (2011)</ref> stresses that ''there is no universal standard method for calculating the TBL'', as such organizations have difficulty in measuring their individual impact on the planet. As such, while the adoption of sustainable business practices is hailed as the solution to our global sustainability challenges, helping businesses transform is a significant undertaking.</p><p>Total quality management (TQM), however, can be a strategy to help businesses obtain long-term sustainability by developing an organization's competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Siddiqui et al., 2009</ref>). TQM's fundamental principle and goal are to enhance operational activities over time to increase production and sales while also increasing customer and stakeholder satisfaction. The scope of TQM has lately been expanded to include wider aspects, such as social obligation and environmental policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Tasleem et al., 2019)</ref>. Furthermore, successful TQM implementation substantially impacts green innovation in businesses, which is a crucial component for successful sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Li et al., 2018)</ref>. Concurrently, Industry 4.0 technology (the industrial Internet of things) is considered another important dimension through which long-term business sustainability can be achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Lucianetti et al., 2018)</ref>. Although under 30% of manufacturers worldwide have fully adopted I4.0 so far <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Wopata, 2020)</ref>, there are reported benefits for those who have. For example, the employment of I4.0 technologies in manufacturing can result in more effective work scheduling and execution, leading to resource and cost reductions <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Yao et al., 2019)</ref>. The technology company, Siemens, was an early adopter of I4.0 in digitizing its production, which has improved its manufacturing productively while also increasing its product quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Greenfield, 2016)</ref>. Essentially, adopting TQM alongside I4.0 results in the organization adopting digital quality control process within which resources are used more effectively, ultimately leading to enhanced sustainability performance. Another real-world illustration of I4.0 implementation is the ''Technology Initiative Smart Factory KL,'' which is an R&amp;D project financed by prominent commercial vendors to construct a factory model that is completely smart and backed by advanced technologies. The factory was developed in a flexible style, with each function autonomous and ensuring minimization in production cost and increased resource availability <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Sader et al., 2019)</ref>. Furthermore, I4.0 approaches like interoperability, dematerialization, and service orientation might contribute to extending the life of machines, thus reducing industrial waste, resulting in better utilization of local resources and available assets and expanding recycling opportunities, along with enabling a quick response to changes in energy supply <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bag &amp; Pretorius, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Carvalho et al., 2018)</ref>. TQM and Industry 4.0 combined can also enhance the sustainability quotient of organizations.</p><p>Even though TQM and I4.0 implementation can enhance business sustainability, industries nevertheless face challenges when adopting these approaches in their organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aamer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Lucianetti et al., 2018)</ref>. This is the situation for Bangladesh's ready-made garment (RMG) sector, which has grown rapidly in the past 10 years, with Bangladeshi RMG exports standing at $33.1 billion in 2019 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Barua, 2021)</ref>. The challenge in implementing TQM principles and I4.0 technologies in Bangladesh's RMG sector derives from many major factors. Firstly, top management in the RMG industry can be hesitant to empower employees because of the fear of breaking the chain of command. However, past research indicates that empowering employees aids them in executing their tasks more effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aamer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Cho &amp; Linderman, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Xu et al., 2020)</ref>. Secondly, around 85% of Bangladesh's RMG sector workers are poorly educated and lack technical skills (BGMEA, 2020). Superiors show very little willingness to improve the practical abilities of the workers due to the hefty expense of teaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Honarpour et al., 2017)</ref>. Thirdly, top authorities of the RMG sector are cautious about implementing the I4.0 technologies due to the high initial investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Belhadi et al., 2021)</ref>. As such, the implementation of TQM principles and I4.0 technologies in Bangladesh's RMG sector remains a significant challenge.</p><p>Bangladesh has indeed risen to the top of global apparel manufacturing and is now ''one of the world's largest garment exporters, with the RMG sector accounting for 84% of Bangladesh's exports'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Barua, 2021)</ref>. But the textile industry of Bangladesh requires much improvement in sustainability performance. The Financial Express (2021) stated that in 2021, Bangladesh generated approximately 1000 tons of cloth waste, possibly valued at a billion dollars if recycled. Besides the lack of recycling opportunities, lack of application of statistical process tools, lack of quality consciousness among sub-suppliers etc., are also hindering the process of improving sustainability performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Akter et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Chiarini, 2020)</ref>. However, I4.0 technologies can be useful for adopting the digital quality control process, and recycling technologies and TQM principles can be beneficial for quality performance improvement by reducing defects across the supply chain, which ultimately will lead to the enhancement of sustainability performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ammar et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Broady, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Souza et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Tambare et al., 2022)</ref>. The above discussion points us toward a research gap in the literature that the integrated adoption of TQM and I4.0 to enhance organizational sustainability performance is still to explore. Though researchers have separately provided theoretical frameworks for the impact of TQM and I4.0 technologies on sustainability performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abbas, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">AlShehail et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bag &amp; Pretorius, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Belhadi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Tasleem et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Tseng et al., 2018)</ref>, no known single study has empirically investigated the combined effects of TQM and I4.0 on SP. So to fill this research gap, the current study will attempt to address the below research questions:</p><p>RQ1: To what extent do TQM and I4.0 have distinct impacts of TQM and I4.0 on sustainability performance? RQ2: Does TQM act as a mediator between I4.0 and sustainability performance? RQ3: What is the impact of I4.0 technologies in TQM implementation?</p><p>This study developed a theoretical framework to answer these research questions. For this purpose, this research formulates research hypotheses which are then tested with survey data collected from garment industries located in Bangladesh, using the partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique.</p><p>The remainder of this work is structured in the following way. A brief review of the theoretical background is presented in the very next section. After that, the establishment of the theoretical model is outlined. Then, the following two sections present research procedures and data evaluation, respectively. After that, the findings of this empirical research are presented. Finally, theoretical and practical implications of this study, limitations, and future scopes are presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Review</head><p>This section reviews the (TQM) concepts and research in Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and how these technologies can facilitate organizational sustainability performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Total Quality Management</head><p>In the mid-1950s, the TQM philosophy began in Japan. The term ''TQM'' has arisen from the idea of Total Quality Control (TQC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Maganga &amp; Taifa, 2022)</ref>. Perhaps the fundamental explanation for the conception of TQM is the argument that quality is more than simply a subject of control; it must also be managed <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Elibal &amp; O ¨zceylan, 2022)</ref>. As businesses and industries began to emphasize quality, the authority of the US recognized its importance to the country's economic strength. Then the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) was founded in 1987 as a nationwide declaration of purpose to deliver quality excellence <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Sharma &amp; Modgil, 2020)</ref>. From the beginning, many scholars have defined TQM from various perspectives.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Yue et al. (2011)</ref>, TQM is an integrated technique that aims to synergize all operational activities to create a dynamic outcome with the primary aim of increasing product and service quality and customer satisfaction. TQM can be defined by the implementation of quantitative approaches and personnel to improve all internal systems and fulfill the present and future demands of the consumer <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Apornak &amp; Hezaveh, 2019)</ref>. As per ISO 9000, the concept of TQM was created to encourage quality standards or build demand for quality throughout the supply process <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Chaturvedi, 2020)</ref>. A complete management strategy, TQM is increasingly being utilized to improve business capabilities and management systems while concentrating on consumer requirements, employee participation, collaboration, process redesign, operations, environment of the firm and supplier relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(AlShehail et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Baidoun et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Oliveira et al., 2019)</ref>. In their research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Sharma and Modgil (2020)</ref> stress that when TQM practices are combined with SCM practices, these together produce maximum operational performance. As such, the potential for TQM to enhance business performance is magnified when employed with other complementary business systems.</p><p>While the benefits are clear, the adoption of TQM requires a culture shift including top-level commitment, administrative changes, customer focus, and comprehensive training courses <ref type="bibr">(Dubey &amp; Gunasekaran, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Gomes et al., 2019)</ref>. To make optimal use of TQM systems in each organization, senior management commitment, employee participation, workforce cooperation, and feedback loops build foundations for personnel to effectively apply TQM techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Go ´mez et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Iqbal &amp; Asrar-ul-Haq, 2018)</ref>. Without such a foundation, the workforce and other resources cannot be effectively used. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Oliveira et al. (2019)</ref> stated that unfamiliarity of top-level management with the TQM of an organization, results in a lack of innovative techniques, which in turn hinders continual sustainability improvement.</p><p>In the globalized environment, businesses are paying very close attention to TQM methodologies, tools, and approaches. As there is no definite consensus on the elements that comprise TQM <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Tasleem et al., 2019)</ref>, various sets of TQM criteria have been proposed and used in various research because of the wide variety of definitions and scope of TQM. Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Kaynak (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Talapatra et al. (2020)</ref> used seven factors of TQM practices in their studies which focus on the leadership abilities of top management, relations between employees, supplier and customer relationship, product and process design. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Abbas (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Khan et al. (2020)</ref> used seven slightly different TQM factors for their research purpose. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Tasleem et al. (2019)</ref>, recently, scholars have started to cite the MBNQA criteria as one of the most acceptable TQM standards. This study selects factors for TQM measurement based on the above literature.</p><p>A key principle that assures high quality within a business, TQM can be applied through technology since it allows for strong leadership, continual development, and employee participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(De et al., 2020)</ref>. As such, the connection between TQM and Industry 4.0 is discussed next.</p><p>Industry 4.0 A significant progression from earlier innovations, such as the creation of electricity and then wide-spread automation, Industry 4.0 encompasses the next generation of innovations that businesses need to address. Such innovations in technology include Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Maganga &amp; Taifa, 2022)</ref>. As such, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) now refers to more than 630 Internet of Things (IoT) platforms that are currently used globally for connecting industries and transforming business operating systems, including Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), visual computing, and digital manufacturing (Horva ´th &amp; Szabo</p><p>´, 2019; Mickeleit, 2022). I4.0 initially conceived in 2011 and known as forming a portion of the modern manufacturing policy of Germany, includes increasing interconnection among people, machinery, as well as systems via real-time data sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Dalenogare et al., 2018)</ref>. Under this innovative way of operating, I4.0 opens a whole new world of possibilities for the fields of operations management and supply chain management <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bag &amp; Pretorius, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Contador et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Kumar et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>For successful I4.0 adoption, it is critical for the top management to be involved in appropriate planning, collaboration with external stakeholders, data processing, information protection, and a flexible organizational structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Hofmann &amp; Ru ¨sch, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Souza et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>The I4.0 transformation requires the digitalization of the whole value chain and enables businesses to provide clients with innovative digital offerings, such as internet-based services incorporated in goods <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Souza et al., 2022)</ref>. I4.0 will help businesses to increase consumer satisfaction by enhancing the quality of provided offerings because of intense standard quality assurance activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Gunasekaran et al., 2019)</ref>. Additionally, I4.0 technologies can facilitate leadership approaches by improving collaborative relationships among multiple managerial levels, thereby improving the company's capacity to produce distinguishing quality results <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bai et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Liu et al., 2022)</ref>. I4.0 also can serve as a foundation for the continual development of processes and operational and organizational performance. A fully interconnected manufacturing process will increase quality performance and overall process responsiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Ghobakhloo, 2020)</ref>. Furthermore, I4.0 will help to optimize processes, enhance performance, reduce the effort required for quality concerns by employing sensors at each level of production, and give methods to assist quality operations, resulting in less rework and scrapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Elibal &amp; O ¨zceylan, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Liu et al., 2022)</ref>. I4.0 also enables organizations to apply digital quality control tools to production processes, resulting in minimizing the quality cost and early detection of defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bag &amp; Pretorius, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>However, while the adoption I4.0 technologies in businesses are advantageous, there are challenges with such a transformation. I4.0 alter conventional methods, procedures, and strategic objectives <ref type="bibr">(Ola ´h et al., 2020)</ref>, so a whole organizational culture shift is required. The implementation of I4.0 necessitates detailed knowledge, economic ability, skill upgrades, and the creation of an interactive, flexible culture inside the firm. Top management must also be involved in appropriate planning, collaboration with external stakeholders, data processing, information protection, and a flexible organizational structure for I4.0 adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Hofmann &amp; Ru ¨sch, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Souza et al., 2022)</ref>. Finally, there remains inconsistent data in previous studies on the association between I4.0 technologies and organization performance improvements, stimulating more research into the issues. In this regard, I4.0 offers numerous potential for businesses but poses several challenges because of the continuing automating, digitization, interconnection and measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Chiarini, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>However, if these challenges can be addressed, I4.0 promotes a decentralized and simpler framework for business operations, focusing on simple, easily interconnected components with lower degrees of sophistication.</p><p>Additionally, there are specific concerns within developing countries' organizations and their ability to adopt I4.0 technology, largely because of a shortage of intellectual, administrative, and connection abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Barua, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Brixner et al., 2020)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Durana et al. (2019)</ref>, data analysis, integrating emerging technologies with current types of machinery and workers, and computing restrictions are the greatest obstacles with I4.0 technologies. Overcoming these obstacles will open doors to more efficiency, adaptability, profitability, and reliability for businesses in developing nations. Regarding economic and technological problems, increasing consumer demands for customization and agility have altered company models, resulting in more unpredictable and diverse marketplaces. These factors have bolstered the formation of strategic partnerships and collaborations across value chains, increasing managerial complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Kiel et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, the amount of up-front capital investment needed to incorporate I4.0 is relatively high, making it less appealing to emerging-market firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Apornak &amp; Hezaveh, 2019)</ref>. To address political and regulatory challenges, authorities must establish constitutional limits for the use of big data, particularly those connected to information privacy. Another cause of concern is the increased flexibility of working, which necessitates the reform of work rules regarding working hours and corporate responsibility. For these, I4.0 technologies adaptation is a more significant challenge for companies in underdeveloping countries given the application <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bag &amp; Pretorius, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Tortorella et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>An essential aspect of the I4.0 study is the examination of present modern technologies to provide the basis for an insight into their operating in a data-driven framework. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Kamble et al. (2020)</ref> used six popular I4.0 technologies in their research to examine the influence of I4.0 approaches on sustainability. Besides, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bibby and Dehe (2018)</ref> measured the level of I4.0 technologies implementation in the defense sector, where they used eight I4.0 technologies for their research purpose. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Braccini and Margherita (2019)</ref> identified nine different I4.0 pillars of technologies to identify the challenges to implementing I4.0 techniques.

The World Commission for Environment and Development initially presented the idea of sustainability in 1987. The committee defined sustainability that same year as a socioeconomic growth model that enables people to ''satisfy the demands of the current population without jeopardizing future generations' potential to fulfill their respective demands'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(WCED, 1987)</ref>. Furthermore, United Nations (UN) members settled on a worldwide vision for sustainability advancement in 2015, which included the 17 objectives for sustainable growth across the UN, known as the sustainable development goals (SDGs). This program brings together both the public and corporate sectors along with community groups and individuals to work toward these common goals, which include everything from setting objectives to implementing and attaining them <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Garcia-Torres et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">UN General Assembly, 2015)</ref>. Sustainability management, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Kuei and Lu (2013)</ref>, is ''advancing the adaptation of effective management concepts, methods, and practices across the operating system, and allowing the environment to achieve sustainability performance.'' Although, challenges to sustainable initiatives in value chain flexibility are acknowledged <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Dwivedi et al., 2021)</ref>.

(2021)</ref> explored three ways to integrate the three elements (economic, social, and environmental) of sustainability into a unified model termed the Sustainability Balanced Scorecard. Edgeman (2013) created a Sustainable Enterprise Excellence model relying on business excellence frameworks and sustainability performance factors. Sustainability performance is generally seen as a crucial aim for companies because it influences long-term competitiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Banihashemi et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Lee &amp; Lam, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Hubbard (2009)</ref> mentioned that over 75% of major global firms should be required to think seriously about their sustainability and develop performance measurements not based on the usual financial or economic gains. From a Tripple Bottom Line (TBL) perspective, sustainability is defined as a combination of environmental, financial, and cultural objectives that creates equilibrium across these dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Carter &amp; Rogers, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Gunasekaran &amp; Spalanzani, 2012)</ref>. As such, businesses are encouraged to factor in more environmental and cultural performance measures alongside the more long-standing financial metrics.</p><p>The TBL's environmental aspect is focused on the viability of natural resource usage and renewal trends. In terms of organizations, this dimension manifests itself in a culture of using only natural resources reproducible from nature and generating only discharge which could be digested organically by the current ecological system. This can be achieved by resource recycling and regeneration, redesigning manufacturing processes to reduce resource use, replacing all non-renewable resources with renewable ones, and the application of a circular economy approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Braccini &amp; Margherita, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Kamble et al., 2018)</ref>.

(2013)</ref> classified economic policies that positively or negatively impact economic success. The authors characterized advantages gained by sustainable manufacturing techniques as positive economic contributions, like purchasing cost minimization, waste disposal, as well as a reduction in accidents associated with the environment. On the other hand, they characterized expenses associated with sustainable manufacturing techniques as negative economic consequences, such as the cost of acquiring eco-friendly products and operating and retraining costs.</p><p>To generate value, the social dimension focuses on an organization's approach toward developing social responsibilities, including human rights, child labor, quality management, and health and safety issues within the communities in which it functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Banihashemi et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Wood, 1991)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Sarkis et al.

For example, adhering to environmental sustainability agendas may harm the economic plan, given the additional expenditures required for cleaner manufacturing processes. However, to pursue all of the three pillars, companies must operate holistically, meaning that treating the whole, not just a part of something. Each dimension indicates a required but insufficient prerequisite for attaining sustainability: organizations must support all three dimensions to act suitably <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Braccini &amp; Margherita, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Evans et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Sassanelli &amp; Terzi, 2022)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Industry 4.0 in TQM Implementation</head><p>The introduction of TQM along with I4.0 has resulted in improvements in business that are happening at an accelerated speed. Most of the changes in business organizations at that introductory phase have been generated by the technologies that are being introduced to this situation. As a result, the way quality is managed within the organization must also adjust and adapt to the changes required to optimize the quality and to keep the TQM approach aligned with I4.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Souza et al., 2022)</ref>. The characteristics of I4.0 offer a solid foundation for supporting business success; interconnectivity boosts the capacity of businesses to function more effectively by employing network technology. The complete value chain of manufacturing has become networked, and devices are interconnected. Production processes may try to adjust to the best production situation even when an immediate breakdown happens, proactive maintenance warnings are quicker to forecast storing, and assets are distributed efficiently and effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Chiarini, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Sader et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding Quality Assurance (QA), I4.0 will lift personnel roles from routine tasks to a greater degree of authority and inspection for the production process, depending on context-sensitive situational objectives. Furthermore, I4.0 will enable real-time process tracking to verify that quality requirements are fulfilled during the manufacturing process. That real-time control technique helps improve quality control actions and offers an early warning of product quality changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Tortorella et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Zonnenshain &amp; Kenett, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>I4.0 can affect the best practices for applying Total Quality Management (TQM) concepts. Asif (2020) suggested that to have a successful TQM principles implementation, a business organization should focus on developing the integration of working personnel with I4.0 and using real-time control techniques. Ille ´s et al. <ref type="bibr">(2017)</ref> emphasized how, thanks to I4.0 applications, data acquisition has now become crucial for quality throughout an organization. According to the authors, the difficulty is determining where, how, and what to gather and how to evaluate the resulting large amount of data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Durana et al.

It also reflects the capacity of the model to retrieve variance better.</p><p>Causality assessment was used as another way to verify the model's correctness. Three parameters were used in this research to check the model's correctness, which is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Chin (2010)</ref>. These are Simpson's paradox ratio (SPR), R-squared contribution ratio (RSCR), and statistical suppression ratio (SSR). Table <ref type="table">3</ref> illustrates the readings of these parameters, and it is shown that all values fall within the allowable range.</p><p>Moreover, for validating the reliability and consistency of the measurement scale, Cronbach's alpha (a) values were applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Nunnally, 1978)</ref>. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> illustrates the Cronbach's alpha values for each latent variable, and as can be observed, all alpha (a) values considerably exceed the critical limit of 0.6, proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Molina et al. (2007)</ref>. The result shows that the variables have high internal consistency for the specified dimension. This research applied factor loadings to test the construct validity, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Gupta et al. (2019)</ref> suggested. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">9</ref> shows the loadings and cross-loadings of each variable. All factors show the minimum required value of 0.4, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Nunnally (1978)</ref> suggested. This confirms the proposed model's content validity.</p><p>Then, to confirm the integrity of the assessment model, convergent and discriminant validity tests were performed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abbas, 2020)</ref>. This research conducted the convergent validity test to inspect whether the observed variables were heavily loaded in their latent parent constructs. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Talapatra et al. (2020)</ref>, to obtain convergent validity, the average variance extracted (AVE) and scale composite reliability (SCR) coefficient values for each variable should not be less than 0.5 and 0.7, respectively. All the AVE and SCR readings are shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, and it shows that all the values are in an allowable range.</p><p>Again, the discriminant validity analysis was used in this study to verify if the latent constructs are distinctive and unrelated to one another. The discriminant validity test matrix is illustrated in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. From this table, it is shown that no values in any column of the matrix beneath the diagonal element are higher than the diagonal value, and it demonstrates the discriminant validity of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model Assessment</head><p>The variance-based SEM approach was applied to test the structural model and proposed hypotheses because of its ability to describe the maximum variance of latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Gupta et al., 2019)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">6</ref> illustrates the outcomes of the SEM path analysis. The results indicate that all four hypotheses are accepted statistically. The bootstrapping approach, also known as resampling, was employed to examine the mediation role of TQM since it has been demonstrated to be more capable of reducing type-1 error at the time of evaluating direct and indirect correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Kamble et al., 2020)</ref>. The bootstrapping method generates many observations, ensuring that the chosen examples are equal across all random samples. The bootstrapping approach is thought to be more efficient than other types of classical mediation analysis that need a lot of assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Cheung &amp; Lau, 2008)</ref>. This study applied an SEM technique with bootstrapping (1500 resamples) and a 0.95 confidence interval to investigate the mediating role. The findings of direct and indirect impacts to analyze the mediating role are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">7</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and Concluding Summary</head><p>This research investigated the influence of TQM and I4.0 on sustainability performance along with the mediating effect of TQM in I4.0 and sustainability performance in the garment industry in Bangladesh. As reported in the results section, at a 0.01 significance level, it is shown that the very first hypothesis is statistically significant, having a b coefficient of 0.576 (p \ 0.01). The result implies that TQM implementation substantially contributes to enhancing an organization's sustainability performance. TQM principles help an organization increase customer satisfaction, reduce errors and improve operational performance, which directly contributes to organizational sustainability. This finding confirms earlier research <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abbas, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">AlShehail et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Tasleem et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In terms of the second hypothesis, it is found that the hypothesis is statistically significant, having a b coefficient of 0.329 (p \ 0.01), suggesting that I4.0 technologies implementation can positively impact organizational sustainability performance. This result also implies that the practice of I4.0 encourages any organization to advance the operational processes, reduce energy consumption, and reduce waste and pollution. Besides, the application of I4.0 technologies promotes reducing safety incidents and increasing employee morale, which all are directly related to the organization's sustainable performance. This result also is confirmed by earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Haseeb et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Kamble et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Machado et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ola ´h et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The result shows that the third hypothesis is also proved as statistically significant, having a b coefficient of 0.393 (p \ 0.01). This hypothesis recommends that I4.0 techniques adaptation positively impacts TQM implementation. Under an interconnected I4.0-TQM regimen, customer requirements and marketplace analysis would be directly transmitted to the manufacturing systems, and the quality of the product would be monitored and ensured utilizing advanced sensors and failure investigations analysis. Besides, I4.0 might act as a base for the constant growth of a firm at both the technological and operational stages, which all are directly related to a successful TQM implementation. This study's outcome is also compatible with earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Durana et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Sader et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Souza et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Tortorella et al., 2018)</ref>. The diagonal numbers represent, HAVE, whereas the remaining values represent the interrelation among the two different constructs</p><p>Regarding the fourth hypothesis, the role of TQM as a mediator between I4.0 and sustainability performance is analyzed according to the findings of the PLS algorithm. The analysis revealed positive and significant results that conclude that I4.0 directly and indirectly (through TQM) impacts sustainability performance. The direct effect and indirect effect are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">7</ref>. Thus, this study found the fourth hypothesis supported at the significance level of 0.01.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>This work, like others, contains numerous theoretical insights which might be considered. This work contributes to organizations by exploring the influence of I4.0 technologies on TQM implementation that has not yet received adequate observation from scholars. This impact has been validated, and this study may call for future research in the respective field. Furthermore, this work explores the gap in the analysis of the mediator role of TQM in previous literature, which also makes a theoretical contribution to this research field. To put it another way, this work aimed to explore the combined effects of TQM and I4.0 on organizational sustainability performance. The results indicate that I4.0 technology adoption might significantly enhance sustainability in the RMG sector in the presence of TQM principles. As a result, in addition to directly contributing to sustainability performance, TQM practices also serve as a beneficial mediator between I4.0 and sustainability. This result demonstrates the inherent resilience of I4.0 since its advantages can only be realized if its technologies are actively adapted to the context of the industry and seek to complement the existing management strategies and routines, like TQM. Thus, as another significant theoretical addition, this research also adds to the current knowledge of how I4.0 impacts sustainability performance and explains how I4.0 may stimulate TQM implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>The outcomes indicate that the adoption of TQM practices and I4.0 applications can greatly impact organizational sustainability in Bangladesh's RMG industry. Practically, a better knowledge of the combined impacts of TQM and I4.0 technologies on sustainability performance can assist practitioners, administrators, and policymakers, particularly in developing countries, like Bangladesh, in establishing appropriate expectations during the implementation process. Simply said, TQM practices and I4.0 technologies can assist the business organization in obtaining a competitive advantage that distinguishes them from their competitors and improves their market presence. Besides, RMG firms would be benefited from increased investment in social and environmental practices in respect of every TPL dimension. This might be accomplished by putting their sustainability practices into action. For instance, connecting social and environmental practices with the regional neighborhood might help to boost performance. Furthermore, the recognition of the synergistic linkage with mediating effects assists executives in anticipating organizational sustainability improvement difficulties, avoiding wasted decisions and ineffective expenditures. More importantly, the findings suggest that executives who promote TQM approaches throughout the improvement process may obtain a greater degree of organizational sustainability while using I4.0 technology than those who ignore the relevance of TQM. This research also reveals that the positive impacts of TQM and I4.0 are not restricted to developed countries-based organizations; if organizations in developing countries effectively use their methods, similar outcomes may be obtained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Scope</head><p>This study contains certain shortcomings. Firstly, the sample for this research was confined to 240 participants from the RMG sector in Bangladesh. Even though the sample size was enough for assessment, a higher sample size might be beneficial to confirm the generalizability of this study. Secondly, all the respondents in the data sample were from Bangladeshi RMG sectors, which limits the generalizability of this research to other countries. Adding respondents from different sectors or countries to the data collection would enrich the sample both quantitatively and qualitatively. Thirdly, the responses were gathered from various departments, which may have vastly different perspectives on the questionnaires. Furthermore, the responses were collected from only small and mediumsized organizations, which can be extended for future research. Finally, the degree of dimensions of the constructed variables used here could be added to the current measurement model for future study. In addition, researchers may methodologically examine; (a) RMG industries of Bangladesh need to determine in which area their employees need the training to adopt I4.0 and TQM successfully and (b) RMG industries of Bangladesh need to assess their capabilities (financial and technical) for digitization.</p></div>
