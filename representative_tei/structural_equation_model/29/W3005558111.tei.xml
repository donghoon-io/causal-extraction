<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Most studies on the nexus among performance, board structure and ownership structure are based on developed economies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baysinger and Butler (1985)</ref> find that there is a positive relationship between the number of independent directors and performance in major US business corporations. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Khorana et al. (2007)</ref> also confirm this relationship in the US mutual fund industry. They distinguish three components of board composition: the executive component, the monitoring component, and the instrumental component. The executive component provides information and expertise necessary for corporate strategy and business policy. The monitoring component fulfils a policing function over management's performance and represents shareholders' interests. The instrumental component provides general knowledge, networking, and productive links between organizations. They conclude that inside directors provide the executive component; independent directors fulfil the monitoring component. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cochran et al. (1985)</ref> provide evidence to support this complementarity between the inside and outside/independent directors. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Rosenstein and Wyatt (1990)</ref> document positive abnormal returns when an outside director is appointed with more positive abnormal returns for impartial and financial outsiders compared to the appointment of corporate outsiders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Brickley et al.

Additionally, other empirical work finds no significant relationship at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Hermalin &amp; Weisbach, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mehran, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ferris &amp; Yan 2007)</ref>. Due to the lack of experi-ence of most of the independent directors, <ref type="bibr">Adams et al. (2009)</ref> find that firms that suffer from essential financial problems during the 2008-2009 crisis, had more independent directors than others.</p><p>The empirical findings on the effect of board size on firm performance are also mixed. <ref type="bibr">Agrawal and Knoeber (1998)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Yermack (1996)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Eisenberg et al. (1998)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cheng (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Guest (2009)</ref> all find a negative relationship, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Belkhir (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ding and Wermers (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Wintoki et al., 2012</ref> find a positive relationship. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barnhart and Rosenstein (1998)</ref> show that the board composition, managerial ownership, and performance are endogenous. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Brickley and James (1987)</ref> argue that there is a negative correlation between managerial consumption of perquisites and both proportion of independent directors and concentration of ownership. Similar conclusions are obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Mak and Li (2001)</ref>. Recent evidence from <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Kryzanowski and Mohebshahedin (2016)</ref> also shows a positive relationship between directors' ownership and CEF returns of US closed-end funds (CEFs) during <ref type="bibr">1994-2013,</ref> where the generalized method of moments estimator is used to solve the endogeniety problem.</p><p>It has been gradually recognised that endogeneity exists widely in many corporate finance models <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agrawal &amp; Knoeber, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cremers &amp; Romano, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Youssef et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sakr et al., 2017)</ref>. The endogenous relationship between board structure and performance has received a special attention in the empirical literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Durlauf &amp; Quah, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Asada et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Wintoki et al., 2012)</ref>. Evidence from developed countries with mature financial institutions shows that firms with stronger shareholder rights had higher firm value, higher profits, higher sales growth, lower capital expenditures, and made fewer corporate acquisitions, because the quality of fund governance is positively correlated to fund performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Gompers et al., 2003)</ref>. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cremers and Romano (2011)</ref> use difference-in-differences technique to examine the impact of the mutual fund voting disclosure regulation announced by the SEC in 2003. The endogeneity issue is handled by taking differences to purify the effect of the regime shift. In an earlier paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agrawal and Knoeber (1996)</ref>, the potential endogeneity problem be-tween internal governance measures and performance is addressed by spelling out the agency problem between managers and shareholders. They find that the effect of insider shareholding disappears when the when a simultaneous systems framework is used.</p><p>Structural models have gradually gained its popularity in the corporate governance literature. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Dalton et al. (1999)</ref> builds a structural model to explain board composition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lin (2005)</ref> studies the influences of the board of directors and large external shareholders on CEO compensation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Tam and Tan (2007)</ref> examine the relationship between ownership types and firm performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Zhang (2010)</ref> employs a similar tool to examine how corporate boards can create a sustainable competitive advantage. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cremers and Romano (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agrawal and Knoeber (1996)</ref>, the current paper examines the role of corporate governance in mutual fund performance allowing for endogenous board structure and ownership structure. This structural equation model (SEM) approach explicitly spells out the endogeneity among the three key variables, corporate governance, and ownership structure and fund performance. The advantage of the SEM approach over the so-called limited information approach (e.g. 2SLS, GMM, difference-in-differences) is that it is more statistically efficient in data use and it paints a more complete picture of how endogenous variables interact with each other in a sys-tem. More importantly, we provide a better identification strategy by a clearly defined structural model, compared to the reduced-form models which underlie the limited information approach.</p><p>In this paper, we attempt to answer four questions by a systematic and structural approach in the context of an emerging market, Egypt:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>What are the determinants for the performance of mutual funds?</p><p>• What are the determinants for the board structure of mutual funds?</p><p>• What are the determinants for the ownership structure?</p><p>• Are these three questions inter-correlated?</p><p>The aim of this research is to improve a model to enhance the performance of mutual fund board of directors in the Egyptian Stock Market. To achieve the aim of this research, three research objectives are established. Objective one: to present a comprehensive literature review on mutual fund governance, and how it has become a very important issue for both developed and emerging countries. Objective two: to examine the ability of mutual funds mangers to fulfil excess returns, and build system-based model (SEM) to analyse the mutual causality among endogenous variables. Objective three: to provide a set of recommendations to improve the performance of mutual funds in the Egyptian Stock Market.</p><p>The rest of this paper is structured as follows: section 2 reviews the previous literature; section 3 discusses the research gaps section 4 discusses the empirical hypothesis on the relationship between mutual fund board structure and performance; section 5 discusses the research design including the econometric approach and data description ; section 6 lays out the structural equation modelling analysis. Finally, section 7 concludes, and it presents research contributions and suggestions for future studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>In corporate governance research, there has been a slow but constant increase in the use of SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Dalton et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Tam &amp; Tan, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">and Zhang, 2010)</ref>.

Furthermore, he first Egyptian Code of Corporate Governance (ECCG) was issued in 2005 but lacks complete implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research Gaps</head><p>A large body of empirical research on corporate finance suggests that governance structures improve performance, but this research has serious issues with endogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Wintoki et al., 2012)</ref>. However, the implications for the empirical work will be usefulness if it does not deal with endogeneity problem, because the results will be biased and cannot be dependable <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Roberts &amp; Whited, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, when this research investigates the role of corporate governance mechanisms on performance, endogeneity come from the powerful association between past values of the regressand (performance), and current values of the regressors (corporate governance structure) <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Wintoki et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agrawal &amp; Knoeber, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rediker &amp; Seth, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chandio, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Klein &amp; Zur, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Westland, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Rundle-Thiele et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Cornett et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hair et al., 2006)</ref>. There are many methods of overcoming this; including Maximum likelihood (ML) and Ggeneralized Method of Moments (GMM).</p><p>The first method (2SLS/3SLS) requires finding an Instrumental Variable (IV). The solution to such problem is to change the way we estimate β to make it identifiable. For this, we should have an "instrument", a variable which we can refer to as z. There are two conditions that should be satisfied about z to consider it a valid instrument:</p><p>1) z must be uncorrelated with ε: E(ε z) = 0.</p><p>2) z must be correlated to x, and preferably, this correlation will be as high as possible: E(z x) ≠ 0.</p><p>We can use lagged variable as (IV). Thus, X1t is a current (present-time) exogenous variable, while X1(t-1) is a lagged exogenous variable, with a lag of one time period. Additionally, (3SLS) method requires three steps: firststage regressions to get predicted values for the endogenous regressors; a (2SLS) step to get residuals to estimate the cross-equation correlation matrix; and the final 3SLS estimation step. (2SLS/3SLS) is a Limited Information Maximum Likelihood (LIML) which estimates a single structural equation at a time.</p><p>Although, GMM and ML is a general framework for deriving estimators, there is a difference between the assumptions of the two methods. ML estimators use assumptions about the specific families of distributions for the random variables to derive an objective function. '； 8It selects the parameters that are probably have generated the observed data, which can be proceeded by maximizing an objective function. GMM estimators use assumptions about the moments of the random variables to derive an objective function. The assumed moments of the random variables present population moment conditions, which can be achieved by minimizing an objective function.</p><p>Accordingly, ML can be more efficient than GMM, because ML uses the entire distribution instead of uses specified moments only <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Breitung &amp; Lechner, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>The second method is (SEM) which is a multivariate technique that allows us to estimate a system of equations. Structural Equation Models are often drawn as Path Diagrams. Different likelihood values can be obtained when fitting the same model with SEM and GSEM because the normality of observed exogenous variables is never assumed with GSEM. SEM is a Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) which estimates all the equations and all the unknown parameters jointly.</p><p>A variety of corporate governance mechanisms has been previously investigated by using various analytical techniques except SEM (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Boo &amp; Sharma, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Coles et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fernández &amp; Arrondo, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">and Ward et al., 2009)</ref>. Therefore, the existence of endogeneity is the enormous restriction of these studies <ref type="bibr">(Schultz et al., 2010)</ref>. Therefore, to achieve the research objectives empirically, this paper depends on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) which is a stringent statistical technique to solve the endogeneity problem <ref type="bibr">(Hox &amp; Bechger, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Azim, 2012)</ref>. Furthermore, SEM is a Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) that estimates all the equations and all the unknown parameters jointly and obtains robust findings compared with (2SLS/3SLS) which is a Limited Information Maximum Likelihood (LIML) that estimates a single structural equation at a time.</p><p>Therefore, this paper utilizes SEM which is a multivariate technique that allows us to estimate a system of equations. Structural Equation Models are often drawn as Path Diagrams. SEM is a Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML), which estimates all the equations and all the unknown parameters jointly and obtains robust findings, compared with GMM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Research Hypotheses</head><p>This paper expands the existing fund governance literature by exploring the impact of the board of directors on mutual fund performance. The objective aim of this study is to improve a model to enhance the performance of mutual fund board of directors in the Egyptian Stock Market. In particular, to examine the ability of mutual funds mangers to fulfil excess returns using system-based model (SEM).</p><p>Board size: <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lipton and Lorsch (1992)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Jensen (1993)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cheng (2008), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Yermack (1996)</ref> find that there is negative correlation between board size and performance, because larger board of directors needs more settlements to avoid conflicts, which might lead to harm firm value. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Conyon and Peck (1998)</ref> argue that board size has negative impact on firm performance in a number of European firms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Eisenberg et al. (1998)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Guest (2009)</ref> suggest that there is a significant inverse relationship between board size and profitability, because poor communication might lead to difficulty in decision-making process which restricts the influence of large board of directors. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Belkhir (2009)</ref> finds that there is a positive association between board size and performance in banking sector; this might be due to that board of directors has the ability to get rid of the poor performing managers. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Dalton et al. (1999)</ref> finds a positive correlation between board size and performance.</p><p>H1: There is a positive relationship between board size and fund performance (𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓 𝑖𝑡 ).</p><p>Proportion of independent directors and inside directors: the two ways inside outside director classification is used to measure the proportion of inside directors on the board, and the proportion of outside directors on the board. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ding and Wermers (2012)</ref> demonstrate that independent directors have a significant influence on pre-expense performance. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ferris and Yan (2007)</ref> utilize a large sample of mutual fund families for 2002. They argue that there is no relationship between proportion of independent directors and fund performance H2: There is a positive relationship between the proportion of independent directors on the board and fund performance (𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓 𝑖𝑡 ).</p><p>Fama (1980), <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chau and Leung (2006)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Weir and Laing (2003)</ref> suggest that boards with a higher proportion of independent directors will increase the quality of monitoring over management because "they are not affiliated with the company as officers or employees, and thus are independent representatives of the shareholders' interests" <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Pincus et al., 1989)</ref>. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Eng and Mak (2003)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barako et al. (2006)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Gul and Leung (2004)</ref> report a significant negative association between the level of voluntary disclosure and board independence.

Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chan et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1). Panel A: Fund and Governance Descriptive Statistics</head><p>Panel A provides fund and corporate governance statistics for the overall sample. Perf1, Perf2, and Perf3for the overall sample, have mean values of, 0.16%, -49%, and -15%, respectively. Their mean values, however, vary somewhat more with perf2 having lower mean value than Perf1 (about 49.16%), and perf3 having lower mean value than Perf1 (about 15.16%). These differences in the mean values are driven by the divergence between Treynor ratio (Perf3), Sharpe ratio (Perf2), and the Absolute performance (Perf1) in ranking investment portfolios.</p><p>Although both the Treynor ratio and Sharpe ratio are used as risk-adjusted measure to rank investment portfolios, Treynor's compensates for the systematic risk only, while the Sharpe ratio compen-sates for the total risk, comprising both systematic and unsystematic risk.</p><p>For the overall sample, on average, the board structure is comprised of eight directors, and about 80% of them are independent directors. The board composition, on average, consists of 27% of directors on the audit committee, and 18% of directors on the in-vestment committee. The board of directors, on average, includes 34% financial direc-tors, and 41% professional directors. The average tenure of directors is 19 years. In terms of director ownership, about 84% of directors hold zero shares. Furthermore, the corporate governance index, on average, is 58%. The number of funds overseen by the fund management company, on average, is nine mutual funds. Furthermore, the major funds in the sample belong to open end equity fund.</p><p>2). Panel B: Pearson Correlations (Model A)</p><p>Panel B provides the correlations between all variables included in model (A). Inter-estingly, the correlations for BSize, and IndDir is positive for DirOwn suggesting that vigilant boards are associated with a high fraction of directors holding zero shares. Furthermore, the correlations for Perf1, BSize, AudComm, DirOwn, DirFn, FinDir, and ProfDir are positive for CGQ suggesting that vigilant boards are associated with a higher corporate governance index. Additionally, the correlations for AudComm, InvComm, and CGQ are positive for Perf1 suggesting that vigilant boards are associ-ated with a higher performance.</p><p>3). Panel C: Pearson Correlations (Model B)</p><p>Panel C provides the correlations between all variables included in model (B). As in-dicated before in model (A), the correlations for BSize and IndDir are positive for DirOwn. Furthermore, the correlations for BSize, AudComm, DirOwn, DirFn, FinDir, and ProfDir are positive for CGQ. Additionally, the correlations for AudCommm and DirTn are positive for Perf2 suggesting that vigilant boards are associated with a high-er performance.</p></div>

Furthermore, the correlations for BSize, AudComm, DirOwn, DirFn, FinDir, and ProfDir are positive for CGQ. Additionally, the correlation for IndDir is positive for Perf3 suggesting that vigilant boards are associated with a high-er performance. Overall, the results are consistent with agency theory literatures sug-gest that firm good governance characteristics, including an independent and vigilant board, will enhance firm performance <ref type="bibr">(Essen et al., 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Empirical Evidence</head><p>To test the effect of board composition on mutual fund performance, this paper utilizes SEM technique to deal with the endogeniety problem through the following three stages model specification, model estimation, and goodness of fit indices <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Hair et al., 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Structural Model Specification</head><p>To establish the model for fund performance, we base our specification on <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Erkens et al. (2012)</ref> who argue that powerful mutual fund governance is positively correlated to mutual fund performance and on <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Short and Keasey (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mehran (1995)</ref> who argue that that there is a positive correlation between the proportion of equity held by managers and firm performance. These two hypotheses are derived from literature on the developed economies, so we expect to see some different patterns in the context of an emerging market like Egypt. The first equation of the SEM can be modelled by the following specification: Lastly, the determination of ownership structure is also endogenized using the following specification following the literature on ownership structure: Since there are three different measures of performances (Perf1, Perf2 and Perf3), we end up with three estimates.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑓 𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼 𝑖𝑡 +</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝐷𝑖𝑟 𝑂𝑤𝑛 = 𝛾 𝑖𝑡 +</formula><p>The model using Perf1 (absolute performance), Perf2 (Sharpe ratio) and Perf3 (Treynor ratio) are respectively named as Model 1, Model 2 and Model 3. The detailed estimation results of the three models are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>, and we illustrate the path diagram of the three endogenous variables in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>The differences in the significance levels between the three models are driven by thedivergence between Treynor ratio (Perf3), Sharpe ratio (Perf2), and the absolute per-formance (Perf1) -which are presented before risk adjusted performance analysis ratios such as Treynor and Sharpe's that are carried out -in ranking investment portfolios.</p><p>Furthermore, the major limitation of the Treynor Index is that it can be utilized to the schemes with positive betas which indicate a positive correlation with the market movement. The results will mislead if applied to the schemes with negative betas which indicate an inverse relationship with the market movement. In model (C), there are about 173 observations with negative betas, and due to the previous limitation of Treynor Ratio, results are misleading when applied to the schemes with negative betas. Therefore, in model (C) -Perf3 measured by Treynor Ratio -and unlike the previous two models, there is only one estimated coefficient for the path Fund Obj5→ Perf3 which is statistically significant and all other estimated coefficients are insignificant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">The Estimation Results</head><p>The results about the estimation of the structural model (A), (B), and (C) are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>.</p><p>According to the previous, in testing the hypotheses, results reveal that there are eleven hypotheses in this study, and ten hypotheses i.e. H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 are statistically significant. Thus, these hypotheses are supported. While, one hypothesis i.e. H7 is found statistically not significant. Hence, this hypothesis is not supported.</p><p>Although the hypothesis is not supported, the result is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ebaid (2011)</ref> argument that the internal audit function in Egypt suffers from many weaknesses that affect negatively its effective role in corporate governance. First, internal audit in Egyptian firms does not enjoy a considerable level of organizational independence or management support, and it does not have the adequate level of qualification necessary to fulfill their new responsibilities.</p><p>Second, the internal audit function in the Egyptian firms still focuses on the tradition-al role pertaining to traditional financial audit and has not shifted to the new expand-ed role, whereas internal audit added value to the organization through providing as-surance and consulting activities pertaining to monitoring, evaluating, and improving risk management, control, and governance process. Finally, there is a weak level of interaction between internal and external audit in Egyptian firm.</p><p>Furthermore, the result is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Fawzy (2003)</ref> argument that however corpo-rate governance standards in Egypt have improved significantly, as reflected in the overall assessment of all five OECD principles, the degree of progress is still far from properly implementing corporate governance principles.</p></div>

Finally, ProfDir, BSize, DirFn, FinDir, and IndDir have a significant total direct influence on DirOwn. The Structural Equation Model indicates the evaluation of total effects on the determination of DirOwn arising from the direct effects of the variables in the model only because there are no indirect effects of the variables in this model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">The Goodness of Fit</head><p>The fit indices shown in Table <ref type="table">6</ref> indicate that the hypothesized structural model provides a good fit to the data. The fit indices indicate that the hypothesized structural model provides a good fit to the data. Firstly, the Likelihood Ratio Chi-squared Test (model vs. saturated) is insignificant for the three models showing that there is no significant difference between the model and saturated model -assuming that all varia-bles are correlated -and therefore, indicating a good fit of the model. The Likelihood Ratio Chi-squared Test (baseline vs. saturated) is significant for the three models showing that there is a strong significant difference between saturated model and baseline model -assuming that no variables are correlated except for exogenous varia-bles when endogenous variables are present -and therefore indicating a good fit of the model.</p><p>Secondly, Population error measure, i.e. RMSEA is 0.010, 0.021, 0.021 for the three models respectively, indicates a good fit of model because RMSEA &lt; 0.05. Thirdly, Information criteria measure, i.e. AIC and BIC, indicate that model (A) with the low-est AIC and BIC absolute value 1904.801, 1658.097 respectively fits the data better than the other two models with the larger AIC and BIC value. Fourthly, Baseline comparison measure, i.e. CFI is 1.000, 1.000, and 1.000 for the three models respec-tively, and TLI is 0.999, 0.995, and 0.994 for the three models respectively, indicates a good fit of model because CFI &gt; 0.95, and TLI &gt; 0.95. Finally, Size of residuals measure, i.e. SRMR is 0.002, 0.002, and 0.002 for the three models respectively, and CD is 0.979, 0.988, and 0.975 for the three models respectively, indicates a good fit of model because SRMR &lt; 0.08, and CD values closer to 1.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table">7</ref> the (R-squared) value of Perf3 (measured by Treynor ratio) is 0.01 and is considered low. This might be due to the major limitation of the Treynor ratio that the results will mislead if applied to the schemes with negative betas, and in model (C), there are 173 observations with negative betas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>Achieving the aim of this study contributes to the finance literature at three levels, theoretical, methodological and empirical levels. At the theoretical level, firstly, this study bridges the gap between different disciplines including financial performance, mutual fund industry, and corporate governance. Unlike previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Morck et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Klein, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Eisenberg et al., 1998)</ref>, the theoretical model provides insights into the interrelations between board structure, and ownership structure as fundamental determinants of mutual fund performance rather than investigating the effect of each of these mechanisms separately. Secondly, by studying the relationship between board structure and investor welfare, this study indirectly examines the effect of the regulatory requirement.</p><p>At the methodological level, unlike previous studies that have addressed that the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance may be spurious because they are endogenously determined and use OLS, 2SLS, 3SLS to overcoming this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Erkens et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Hermalin &amp; Weisbach, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Coles et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bhagat &amp; Black, 2002)</ref>, this study has achieved the broad objective of developing sophisticated statistical technique of multivariate data analysis (SEM) using STATA <ref type="bibr">(MP v.13)</ref>. The sample size is large enough to distinguish between different fund performance measures and provide possible differences in the results due to using different measures.</p><p>At the empirical level, this study is undertaken in Egypt, and provides evidence from the emerging markets which differ significantly from the developing markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Farooque et al., 2007)</ref>. Finally, the study provides evidence against the argument that corporate governance has a significant impact on performance in Egypt, at the level of the mutual funds. However, the study provides evidence of a positive association between independent directors and performance, and a positive association between equity ownership by directors and performance. The findings suggest that governance rules are included in the Egypt Code of Corporate Governance: Guidelines and Standards are not mandatory and lack legislative force <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Sharma et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>For future research, the model in this study could be expanded to include more factors such as director compensation, because there is no data available for complex-level director compensation in the Egyptian mutual funds. Thus, this paper suggests that the Egyptian Stock Market should require funds to disclose the total director compensation by the complex rather than per fund. The availability of time series data on director compensation by the complex leads to higher quality compensation data for research on the relationship between compensation and performance.</p><p>with Perf2 and CGQ, IndDir is positively associated with Perf2 and negatively associated with CGQ, ProfDir is positively associated with Perf2 and negatively associated with DirOwn, AudComm is positively associated with CGQ, DirOwn is negatively associated with Perf2, DirFn is negatively associated with Perf2, and DirTn is negatively associated with CGQ). One is not supported (e.g., CGQ is not associated with Perf1, Perf2, and Perf3).</p><p>Additionally, this paper is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kryzanowski &amp; Mohebshahedin, 2016)</ref> argument that that there is a positive relationship between ownership by directors and CEF returns (closed-end funds).</p><p>The main conclusion of this paper is to provide evidence through robust statistical analysis around the usefulness of governance attributes Egyptian mutual funds" performance. The paper finds no evidence on a significant relation between the corporate governance index of the fund management company and fund performancemeasured by Absolute performance, Sharpe ratio, and Treynor ratio.</p><p>Therefore, this paper is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kirkpatrick (2009)</ref> argument that the contribution of effective board oversight and robust risk management including reference to accepted standards is not limited to financial institutions. It is also an important, but often neglected, governance aspect in nonfinancial companies. Potential weaknesses in board composition have been obvious for some time and widely debated.
