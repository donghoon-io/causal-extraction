<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Rapid advancements in today's technology have brought along many conveniences and innovations. Consumers frequently use internet services when shopping, traveling, and reading newspapers or books. Although consumers who meet a considerable portion of their needs in the internet environment are able to easily find what they look for, they sometimes may have difficulties in product selection due to abundance of options.</p><p>Recommender systems are applications which examine past behaviors of users and recommend suitable offerings for them. In the internet environment, these may be products on an e-commerce site as well as pages of a website. Recommender systems are often used to improve the structure of the website or to improve its performance. There are numerous methods in the literature to develop recommender systems including collaborative filtering, association rules, Markov models, bundling methods, and examination of consecutive orders.</p><p>Collaborative filtering is one of the first and therefore most common methods used to develop recommender systems. In general, traditional web recommender systems make use of the collaborative filtering method to guess a specific user's preference about a product. The assumption of "similar users like similar products" is the basic notion underlying the collaborative filtering method. The collaborative filtering method is divided into two main categories: memory-based collaborative filtering and model-based collaborative filtering.</p><p>Recommender systems are quite useful for both users and online retailers. While these systems help customers find the most appropriate option among countless products and services, they also help online retailers increase their sales. Being online increases the market share for sellers while reducing costs and creating a preferable environment for vendors. In addition to helping customers to find the product which looking for, it also provides a competitive environment for sellers <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Demirkıran, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The emergence of smart phones has actually started a whole new era. Computers and the internet used to be indispensable components of our lives and we would spend countless hours in front of the computer; however, this has changed over the time with the introduction of smartphones. Computer and internet technologies are now within our palms at any time of our lives. Many applications containing recommender systems have been adopted to mobile devices with the introduction of Apple IOS and Google Android operating systems and this has made recommender systems easily available at any time.</p><p>Recommender systems are widely used by consumers in nowadays. The primary feature of recommender systems is that they provide personalized recommendations. Also, these systems allow consumers to see recommendations for users with similar tastes, which provides genuine advice. By doing so, recommender systems allow for communicating with other users as well. One of the reasons why consumers use mobile recommender systems is the indecision about which product would satisfy their needs the best. Using a recommender system may be one of the best solutions for consumers in this case.</p><p>A literature review shows that findings of studies on benefits of mobile recommender systems and attitudes and behaviors of users towards mobile recommender systems vary depending on beliefs and cultural values <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Xu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Choi et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Herlocker et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">and Choeh and Lee, 2008)</ref>. Also, studies in the literature have yielded different results related to attitudes and behaviors towards recommender systems in different countries and different cultures. The purpose of this study is to investigate attitudes and behaviors of students studying at Osmangazi University, Eskisehir towards mobile recommender systems using the proposed research model. Such a study with university students will be useful in terms of revealing the relationship between factors affecting mobile recommender system use behaviors of university students in Turkey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Literature Review</head><p>In the following paragraphs there are studies on recommend systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Choi et al. (2014)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Tam and Ho (2005)</ref> revealed that users of mobile recommender systems found ecommerce sites providing personalized recommendations to be more useful than those that do not provide personalized recommendations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kumar and Benbasat (2006)</ref> identified user attitudes towards web-based recommender systems and found that the perceived usefulness was the most affective factor on user attitudes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The Purpose of the Study</head><p>The study was designed with the aim of revealing the relationship between factors affecting attitudes and behaviors of students towards mobile recommender systems. To this end, the main purpose of the study was to propose a structural model to describe relationships between factors affecting attitudes and behaviors of students towards mobile recommender systems and test the proposed model based on various fitness criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">The Research Model and Hypotheses</head><p>As shown in the research model given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, expected recommendation quality of mobile recommender systems was defined as the exogenous latent variable, while perceived recommendation quality, enjoyment, collectivism, and attitude were defined as the mediating endogenous latent variables, and behavior was defined as the endogenous latent variable. In the literature, it was reported that there was a relationship ERQ and PRQ, as well as PRQ and ENJ <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lee et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Choi et al., 2014)</ref> .The primary assumption of the model was that the expected recommendation quality would affect the perceived recommendation quality and enjoyment from mobile recommender system (MRS). Therefore: H1: The expected recommendation quality affects the perceived recommendation quality.</p><p>H2: The expected recommendation quality affects the enjoyment from MRS.</p><p>The perceived recommendation quality of mobile recommender systems indicates their usefulness and is considered to be a significant factor affecting attitudes towards information services <ref type="bibr">(Xia and Benbasat 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Turel et al., 2006)</ref>. Considering that recommendations provided to a mobile user are based on ambiguous data, recommendation services usually have poorer accuracy compared to other information services such as e-mail, web search, and news sources. When consumers believe that the results provided by the recommendation systems reflect their tastes, they help improve the recommendation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Natour et al., 2008)</ref>. Once users receive high quality recommendations from a mobile recommender system, they develop positive attitudes towards mobile recommender systems and tend to share these systems with their acquaintances <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Venkatesh, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hong and Tam, 2006)</ref>. For this reason, recommendation quality becomes even more important since recommendations are expected to promote positive attitudes towards the service.</p><p>Hypotheses H3 and H4 were formed to test this assumption.</p><p>H3: The perceived recommendation quality has a positive effect on attitude towards mobile recommender systems. H4: The perceived recommendation quality has a positive effect on collectivism related to recommender systems.</p><p>Enjoyment is defined as that, as well as performance improvement, the user may use a certain system just because he or she finds it enjoyable <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Davis, 1989)</ref>. Some mobile recommender systems have entertainment features such as creating personalized playlists (Apple Genius Mixes) and categorizing musical preferences of users (Music Aurora Pro).</p><p>"Last.fm" produces playlists based on preferences of target users and listening history of other users. These recommendations may enable users to discover new songs. Although accuracy is one of the most significant objectives of recommendation algorithms, innovations which may bring new products or services to the attention of target users are important performance criteria for recommendation algorithms since they can provide an enjoyable experience for users <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Herlocker et al., 2004)</ref>. A user can enjoy functions of a recommender system and develop more positive feelings for the service in general while accumulating experiences with a recommender system <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lee et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Xu, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Similar to the perceived recommendation quality, "enjoyment" may improve the attitude towards the mobile recommender system. The following hypotheses were formed accordingly.</p><p>H5: Enjoyment has a positive effect on attitude towards mobile recommender systems.</p><p>H6: Enjoyment has a positive effect on collectivism related to mobile recommender systems.</p><p>Collectivism is related to social effects used to enable opinions and attitudes of one or more individuals to impact opinions and attitudes of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Martin and Hewstone, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Sharing recommended products with close acquaintances, knowing friends' areas of interest, and facilitating their access to this knowledge may improve the attitude towards mobile recommender systems. Various studies have shown that social effects have an impact on user attitude towards mobile recommender systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Choi et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lee et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Al-Gahtani et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bandyopadhyay and Fraccastoro, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">and Hofstede, 2001</ref>). In our model, hypothesis H7 was suggested for the relationship between collectivism and behavior.</p><p>H7: Collectivism has a positive effect on mobile recommender system use behavior.</p><p>Since it is believed that positive attitude towards mobile recommender systems would affect mobile recommender system use behavior positively, hypothesis H8 was suggested.</p><p>H8: Attitude has a positive effect on mobile recommender system use behavior.   <ref type="formula">1</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝜂 = 𝐵𝜂 + 𝛤𝜉+ 𝜁 (1)</formula><p>In Equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>; 𝜂 represents the endogenous latent variable, 𝜂∶ 𝑚𝑥1 represents the onedimensional endogenous latent variable vector, 𝐵∶ 𝑚𝑥𝑚 represents the matrix of coefficients between endogenous latent variables whose main diagonal is zero, 𝛤∶ 𝑚𝑥𝑛 represents the matrix of coefficients between one-dimensional endogenous and exogenous latent variables, 𝜉∶ 𝑛𝑥1 represents the one-dimensional exogenous latent variable vector, 𝜁∶ 𝑚𝑥1 represents the one-dimensional latent error terms vector.</p><p>The matrix representation and structural equations for the model proposed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> can be expressed as shown in Equation 2 and 3.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">B C D E F                      = 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 DB DC EB EC FD FE            B C D E F                      + 0 0 0 BA CA          A    + B C D E F             <label>(2)</label></formula><p>(3)</p></div>

In other words, an increase of one unit in expected recommendation quality related to mobile recommender systems led to an increase of 0.77 units in perceived recommendation quality and an increase of 0.64 units in enjoyment. "Perceived Recommendation Quality" was observed to positively affect "Attitude". The path coefficient between perceived recommendation quality and attitude was 0.64.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The main purpose of this study was to reveal factors affecting attitudes and behaviors of students towards mobile recommender systems and the relationship between these factors using a proposed SEM. To the best of our knowledge, the number of studies investigating factors affecting mobile recommender system use in Turkish universities and the relationship between these factors is limited. Thus, we believe that our study will contribute to the literature by providing a different dimension with the proposed research model and the SEM analysis of this model.</p><p>According to the SEM analysis results of the proposed research model, the variable of perceived recommendation quality positively affected the students' attitudes towards mobile recommender systems. Some of the results of this study were similar to those in the literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Xiao and Benbasat (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Turel et al. (2006)</ref> found that the recommendation quality of information services was a significant factor affecting attitudes towards information services.</p><p>In a mobile recommender system, the perceived recommendation quality is considered as the perceived benefit of the mobile system. When users wish to search restaurants that they could visit using their mobile devices, they might prefer restaurants closer to their current location rather than those further away. Therefore, a high recommendation quality received from mobile recommender systems, users develop positive attitudes towards mobile recommender systems. In this way, perceived recommendation quality becomes even more important than expected in terms of promoting positive attitudes towards the service <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Choi et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In our study, enjoyment was found to positively affect mobile recommender system use behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Herlocker (2004)</ref> reported that users enjoyed some mobile recommender systems due to features such as creating personalized playlists (Apple Genius Mixes) and categorizing musical preferences of users (Music Aurora Pro). The author also highlighted that "Last.fm" produced playlists based on preferences of target users and listening history of other users and users enjoyed these recommendations since they direct them to new songs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Herlocker et al., 2004)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lee et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Xu (2006)</ref> found that users enjoyed using recommender system functions since they allow users to accumulate experiences and generally developed more positive feelings towards the service.</p><p>In our study, another factor affecting the attitude towards mobile recommender systems was collectivism. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Choi et al. (2014)</ref>, the dimension of collectivism is necessary for recommender systems since users of mobile recommender systems may consider opinions of others more easily when making purchasing decisions and adapt more to general tendencies of the society. Collectivism was considered a significant factor in revealing cultural differences in many previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Al-Gahtani et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bandyopadhyay and Fraccastoro, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">and Hofstede, 2001)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lee et al. (2007)</ref> found that collectivism</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>identified the factors affecting user attitudes towards mobile recommendation systems. In addition, the authors examined how these factors affect cultural attitudes as well as technology attitudes. Based on the theory of justified action, belief factors for mobile recommendation systems are defined in three dimensions: functional, contextual and social. The research model was tested based on data collected in China, South Korea and the United Kingdom. The findings showed that functional and social factors have important effects on user attitudes towards recommendation systems. Huang (2011) investigated whether these utility-based techniques outperform the traditional content-based technique for online recommendations. A laboratory experiment was conducted in two e-commerce contexts to compare the decomposed and holistic utility-based methods, simple multi-attribute rating technique exploiting ranks (SMARTER) and radial basis function network (RBFN), with the content-based method vector space model (VSM) in terms of recommendation accuracy, time expense, and user perceptions. The results demonstrate that the performances of utility-based methods depend on recommendation contexts.</figDesc></figure>

Future studies may be conducted with students from different universities and by adding different dimensions to the model in order to reveal the relationship between factors affecting mobile recommender systems. Also, the analysis results and relations between variables may be compared with the results of this study. The results obtained in the study can be used especially for electronic commerce.</p></div>			</div>
