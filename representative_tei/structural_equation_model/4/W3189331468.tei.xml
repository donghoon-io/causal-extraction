<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Contextual perceptions have a complicated effect on soundscapes in urban open public spaces. The objective of this study was to explore the systematic relationship between urban contextual factors and soundscape evaluations in open public spaces with a recreational function. Six areas in northern China were selected, and a questionnaire survey was conducted to evaluate the satisfaction with contextual factors and soundscapes. The results showed that dominant sound sources of talking and children playing were positively related to soundscape of interest and comfort. Most contextual factors were positively related to soundscape descriptors. Structural equation modelling was conducted using five dimensions: three dimensions of urban contextual perception, namely, urban management, natural and urban conditions, and the physical environment, and two dimensions of soundscape, namely, eventfulness and pleasantness. Urban management showed the most significant positive influence on the soundscape dimension of pleasantness. Physical environment was positively related to the dimension of pleasantness, and natural and urban conditions positively contributed to eventfulness.</p><p>Moreover, natural and urban conditions and urban management both influenced the physical environment.</p></div>

Noise pollution has been shown to have adverse effects on the ecological environment, including adverse effects on biodiversity and physiological and psychological health <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Newport et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Münzel et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Payne, 2013)</ref>. Early studies on environmentally sustainable acoustics were primarily concerned with the control and management of noise pollution <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Yu, 2008)</ref>. However, noise reduction does not automatically lead to a better acoustic environment and psychological experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kang, 2006)</ref>. Urban renewal offers an opportunity to improve the quality of life and create sustainable cities <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Yildiz et al., 2020)</ref>. The consideration and involvement of soundscape in the process of urban design can provide design strategies for sustainable urban and social development in the urban renewal process.</p><p>Soundscape refers to the auditory atmosphere of cities as a part of the holistic experience of urban spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cao &amp; Kang, 2021)</ref>. It is an acoustic environment in a context as perceived, experienced, or understood by people <ref type="bibr">(ISO 12913-1: 2014)</ref>. The introduction of a particular context with regard to the soundscape was deemed important because objective indicators did not always significantly correlate with subjective perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jambrošić et al., 2013)</ref>. The soundscape paradigm includes complex contexts, including non-acoustic indicators. Some non-acoustic indicators are related to conditions, such as the urban context <ref type="bibr">(Hong and Jeon, 2017b</ref>) and physical environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Jeon et al., 2011)</ref>, and others are related to social and cultural significance for a community <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Yang and Kang, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kang, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Deng et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Tarlao et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>So far, a limited number of studies have explored the impact of urban-related factors on soundscape evaluations, and the relationships between the factors, in the process of urban renewal.</p><p>The factors of urban conditions and management, as non-acoustic indicators in urban open public spaces, influence urban soundscapes. In urban environments, morphological parameters can be useful indicators for examining the soundscape dimension of pleasantness <ref type="bibr">(Hong and Jeon, 2017b)</ref>. When a soundscape is being characterized, the visual scene is likely to be an important modifying factor in auditory perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Pheasant et al., 2010)</ref>, along with natural features and noise levels, which influence tranquillity <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Pheasant et al., 2008)</ref>. As a natural element and a large restorative space, the sea and its presence improve soundscape quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Puyana, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hong et al., 2020)</ref>. In addition, colour coherency and greenery are useful for increasing the soundscape quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Yu et al., 2014)</ref>. Crowd density has a parabolic relationship with the subjective parameter of acoustic comfort, which differs from the objective parameter of sound pressure level and subjective loudness <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Meng et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Zhao et al., 2018)</ref>. It has been implied that the Sustainable Cities and Society, Volume 74, November 2021, 103192 factors of urban conditions and management affect soundscape evaluation. The abovementioned studies investigated the influence of a single or several descriptors on soundscape. However, the relationship between the factors of urban management and soundscape evaluation has not yet been examined systematically.</p><p>The physical environment also influences soundscape evaluations. Daylight dominates soundscape perceptions in urban spaces, in addition to acoustic comfort and visual images, according to social surveys and soundwalks <ref type="bibr">(Jeon et al., 2011a)</ref>. Thermal and general satisfaction with a place is also considered in this regard <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Botteldooren et al., 2013)</ref>. The visual environment and its congruence with the auditory environment are usually related to acoustic comfort <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Ren and Kang, 2015)</ref>. Soundscape, light scape, and space determined the cognitive persistence of soundscape <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hong et al, 2019)</ref>. Fragrance was found to decrease the annoyance caused by traffic noise and increased auditory and olfactory satisfaction in urban streets <ref type="bibr">(Ba and Kang, 2019b)</ref>. The interactions of visual stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Li and Lau, 2020)</ref>, odour <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Jiang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sanchez et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ba and Kang, 2019a)</ref> and sound have been investigated, and found to influence soundscape evaluations.</p><p>In urban open public spaces, physical environment is not only affected by the weather, but also by the local urban conditions and design, thus affecting the soundscape evaluation. However, the relationships among physical environment assessment, urban management, and soundscape have not yet been explored. Evaluation models for urban soundscapes have been constructed with influencing factors. A general conceptual model of the environmental experience for soundscapes has been proposed based on interactions between the person and the place, activity, and environmental experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Herranz-Pascual et al., 2010)</ref>. Based on the method of artificial neural networks, models for soundscape evaluation with the factors of physical environment, behaviour, society, demographics, and psychology have been constructed at various types of locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Yu and Kang, 2009)</ref>. A soundscape quality model for urban waterfronts has been developed through subjective evaluations and objective acoustic and visual parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Romero et al., 2016)</ref>. Furthermore, the influences of urban contexts of functional spaces on sound sources and soundscape evaluations have been explored through a structural equation modelling approach in urban open public spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hong and Jeon, 2015)</ref>, along with soundscape and visiting experiences in a historical block <ref type="bibr">(Liu et al., 2019b)</ref>. A model of the influence of contextual factors related to person and social interaction on soundscape evaluations has been developed through structural equation modelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Tarlao et al., 2021)</ref>. Extensive research on soundscapes in urban open public places has been conducted in several regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Guastavino, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Schulte-Fortkamp et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Jeon et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aletta et al., 2016a)</ref>, and has various functions of the public spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Nilsson and Berglund, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Schulte-Fortkamp and Fiebig, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hong and Jeon, 2015</ref>; Sustainable Cities and Society, Volume 74, November 2021, 103192 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gozalo et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Pérez-Martínez et al., 2018)</ref>. However, research on the effect of contextual perceptions of urban factors, such as urban conditions, urban management, and physical environment, on soundscape has yet to be conducted systematically and comprehensively.</p><p>As mentioned above, the effects of a single or several indicators influenced on urban soundscape have been explored; however, research on the detailed relationships between urban contextual perceptions and soundscape has been limited in terms of urban-related factors. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the relationship between contextual perception of urban factors and soundscape evaluations, and construct a model for the influences of the urban context on soundscape through structural equation modelling (SEM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Site selection</head><p>Six recreational areas were selected as the targeted urban open public spaces, with the aim to include both inland and coastal areas, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Three inland squares and three coastal areas were selected in the cities of Harbin and Huludao, respectively, which are important, typical, and well-known tourist spots in northeast China. Site 1 was the Flood Control Monument in Harbin. The Flood Control Monument is a famous landmark in Harbin and a popular spot for tourism and leisure. It is situated at the end of the cultural commercial street and is surrounded by open urban parks. Site 2 was a square in Zhaolin Park, which is an urban park located in a commercial centre and surrounded by urban roads in Harbin. There are various spatial forms, greenery, and facilities in the park that attract tourists. Site 3 was St. Alekseyev Church, which is located in a residential community in Harbin. It is the main spot for leisure activities for residents of the surrounding areas, and tourists also visit it. Site 4, site 5, and site 6 were the coastal areas of Longwan, Xingcheng and Dongdaihe, respectively, in the city of Huludao. The six open public spaces are all well-known and conveniently located. Their main function is recreation, providing a place for local residents and tourists to engage in leisure and recreational activities, especially in summer. Various sound sources are present in these areas; for instance, water and wind as natural sounds, footsteps and talking as people sounds, and the sound of traffic as mechanical sounds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Questionnaire design</head><p>The questionnaire was composed of three parts, and the basic framework was taken from ISO/TS 12913-2 (ISO/TS 12913-2: 2018). The first part of the questionnaire recorded interviewees' basic data regarding demographic and social indicators. This included gender (male or female), age (age groups: below 18, <ref type="bibr">18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, above 55)</ref>, level of education (primary school, middle school, undergraduate or postgraduate), and place of residence (local or nonlocal). The second part collected information regarding sound source perceptions. The interviewees were asked to select the sounds they perceived at each investigated site.</p><p>Sound sources were listed in the questionnaire according to the sound source classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jambrošić et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Axelsson et al., 2012)</ref> and the field conditions of each site. The sound sources included wind, water, and animals among natural sounds;</p><p>footsteps, talking, children, and sellers/hawkers among people sounds; live music, broadcast, and phones among electronic sounds; and the sound of traffic among mechanical sounds. A five-point Likert scale was used to evaluate the perceived sound sources, using the following ratings: 1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = neutral, 4 = a lot, and 5 = completely.</p><p>The third part collected information regarding the urban contextual factors and soundscape evaluations by the interviewees. These factors were also used for developing the research hypothesis of the SEM. The urban context is related to indicators and conditions of urban open spaces with different functions, landscapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Liu et al., 2019a)</ref>, visual factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hong et al., 2020)</ref>, and environment <ref type="bibr">(Jeon et al., 2011a)</ref>. In this study, the urban context was classified into three aspects, that is, urban management, natural and urban conditions, and physical environment. Urban management is mainly related to traffic, crowd, and urban planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Jiang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hong and Jeon, 2017b</ref> 2017; <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Zhao et al., 2018)</ref>, representing the management results of design and strategies.</p><p>Natural and urban conditions mainly refer to water, air, colour, and cleanliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Pheasant et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Yu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Puyana, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hong et al., 2020)</ref>, representing material and visual elements. Physical environment refers to humidity, temperature, daylight, wind, odour, and sound <ref type="bibr">(Jeon et al., 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Botteldooren et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ren and Kang, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ba and Kang, 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hong et al, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Li and Lau, 2020)</ref>. In total, 13 descriptors of contextual perceptions were selected to evaluate the degree of satisfaction. A five-point</p><p>Likert scale was used to asses satisfaction, with the following ratings: 1 = very dissatisfied, 2 = dissatisfied, 3 = neutral, 4 = satisfied, and 5 = very satisfied. Additionally, the overall satisfaction of interviewees with the entire survey site was evaluated. Further, five adjective word-pairs of descriptors were used to evaluate the soundscapes. Two adjective word-pairs, uneventful-eventful and unpleasant-pleasant, were selected as the two main dimensions of soundscape evaluation, based on previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aletta et al., 2016b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Axelsson, 2015)</ref>. Three adjective word-pairs of soundscape descriptors, uncomfortable-comfortable, agitating-calming, and boring-interesting, were selected as being related to the main factors of relaxation, communication, and interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kang and Zhang, 2010)</ref>, respectively. A five-point Likert scale was employed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Field study</head><p>The surveys were conducted during the summer season in 2014. A total of 522 interviewees participated in the field questionnaire investigation; they were selected randomly at each investigated site. The information collected from them is presented in detail in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Men comprised 54.1% of the sample, while women comprised 45.9%.</p><p>The percentage of interviewees aged 18 to 34 years exceeded those of the other age groups.</p><p>The questionnaire surveys were conducted during the summer vacation, and therefore, a larger number of young couples with children, families, and students travelling together were present, especially in these well-known tourist attractions. Moreover, because of their convenience and enthusiasm, the proportion of young people and couples filling out the questionnaire was slightly higher. According to their level of education, the sample included mainly middle school and undergraduates. The percentage of nonlocal interviewees exceeded 40%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Data analysis and structural equation modelling</head><p>The SPSS 24.0 software package was used to analyse statistical parameters according to the information collected via field questionnaire surveys at the six recreational sites. Spearman's rho correlation analysis was used as the main statistical method to identify the relationship between sound source perceptions and contextual and soundscape evaluations. Furthermore, the relationships between contextual factors and soundscape evaluations were investigated via SEM. SEM is an extension of multivariate statistics, which integrates factor analysis and path analysis. It is a useful statistical tool for exploring the entire set of relationships among latent constructs. Through SEM, the constructs and their interrelationships can be indirectly measured through a series of observable variables from questionnaire responses.</p><p>The aim is to test the causal relationships between each category of the conceptual framework and determine the direction of the relationships and their statistical significance <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Wu, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hong and Jeon, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Acun and Yilmazer, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019b)</ref>. During the process of SEM, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis are carried out <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Wu, 2010)</ref>. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is used to extract the principal factors to explore the validity of the investigated data, without a preconceived structure of the outcome. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is used to validate the hypotheses regarding the observed and latent variables, based on a theory or hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hair et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wu, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hong and Jeon, 2015)</ref>. An SEM for the relationships between urban contextual factors and soundscape evaluations was developed in this study, based on the results of EFA and CFA. SPSS 24.0 was used to perform EFA. AMOS 23.0 was used to conduct CFA and SEM.  contextual perceptions than other soundscape evaluations. Thus, the survey sites were related to functions of recreation, relaxation, and rest. Moreover, the dominant factors that affected the soundscapes were according to the main functions of the place, which is similar to the result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hong and Jeon (2015)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">SEM of contextual perceptions and soundscape evaluations</head><p>Based on SEM, the relationships between soundscape evaluations and the urban contextual factors were examined. As described in Section 2.4, the validity of factor analysis for the investigated data was explored based on EFA. The reliability and validity of the relationships between the observed and latent variables were verified based on CFA.</p><p>Conceptual and modified structural equation models were constructed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Step 1: EFA of contextual perceptions and soundscape evaluations</head><p>According to the investigated results, EFA was carried out to extract the principal factors for contextual perception and soundscape evaluation for satisfaction. Varimaxrotated principal component analysis was carried out to extract the orthogonal factors. Sustainable Cities and Society, Volume 74, November 2021, 103192</p><p>According to the value of Bartlett's test of sphericity (p = 0.001, p &lt; 0.01) and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO=0.889), the possibility of using SEM to model contextual perception and soundscape was confirmed. With the criterion of the corresponding eigenvalue exceeding 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Xue, 2017)</ref>, factors were extracted, as presented in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. Five factors were derived, and they represented 65.3% of the total variance with factor loadings that ranged from 0.4 to 0.9. Soundscape evaluations were interpreted based on Factors 4 and 5, which explained 11.9% of the variance in total. Factor 4 was associated with the eventful-factor of the soundscape, which included uneventfulness-eventfulness, agitating-calming, and boring-interesting, and explained 6.4% of the variance. Factor 5 was associated with the pleasant-factor of the soundscape, which included unpleasant-pleasant, overall satisfaction, uncomfortable-comfortable, and sound environment satisfaction, and explained 5.4% of the variance. Thus, the five principal factors derived via EFA formed the main factors of the SEM for contextual perceptions and soundscape evaluation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Step 2: CFA for the contextual perceptions and soundscape evaluations</head><p>The reliability and validity of the contextual perceptions and soundscape evaluations for the SEM were examined by CFA, with the observed and latent variables. Based on the results of Cronbach's alpha calculation, the reliability of five latent factors was verified. The Cronbach's alpha values were all higher than 0.7, indicating satisfactory reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Wu, 2010)</ref>. Convergent and discriminant validity of the factors, which composed their construct validity, were examined. In terms of the convergent validity, various indicators such as factor loading, average variance extracted (AVE), and construct reliability (CR) were evaluated. The standardized factor loadings refer to the influence of latent variables on observed variables, where values higher than 0.5 are required to confirm satisfactory convergent validity. CR refers to the reliability coefficient of the latent variable of the model in SEM analysis. AVE indicates what extent of the variation explained by the latent constructs was due to measurement error.</p><p>Additionally, a CR higher than 0.7 and AVE higher than 0.5 are required to suggest adequate convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Wu, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Liu et al., 2019)</ref>. Discriminant validity is the degree to which a latent variable is distinct from other latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hong and Jeon, 2015)</ref>, using AVE to compare with the squared value of the correlation coefficients between latent constructs. In terms of the discriminant validity, the values of the maximum shared variance (MSV) and average shared variance (ASV) are required to be less than the values of AVE to show satisfactory discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hair, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wu, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hong and Jeon, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Liu and Wang, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>As presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>, the results of CFA for the contextual perceptions and soundscape evaluations regarding the reliability and construct validity were calculated.</p><p>Cronbach's alpha values of the five latent variables were all more than 0.7, thereby indicating satisfactory reliability and showing reasonably satisfactory convergent validity.</p><p>The standardized factor loadings were all more than 0.5, the values of CR all more than 0.7, and the values of AVE nearly more than 0.5. The constructs showed satisfactory discriminant validity.

Ten paths out of thirteen research hypotheses (three main hypotheses of Ma, Mb, and Mc and modified research hypotheses of Mn1, Mn2, and Mn3), were statistically significant, except for Ma1, Ma3, and Ma5.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regarding hypothesis Mb, as presented in</head><p>In terms of the modified research hypotheses Mn1, Mn2 and Mn3, the traffic conditions and crowd conditions for urban management showed a positive correlation (β = 0.25, p &lt; 0.001), thereby demonstrating both the relationships and the importance of facilitating traffic and reducing crowding in recreational areas. The relationship between air conditions and wind environment also showed a positive effect (β = 0.34, p &lt; 0.001), thereby highlighting satisfaction with the physical environment, especially in open public spaces when people stay outside for longer durations in summer. Additionally, a statistically significant relationship was identified between the daylight environment and sound environment (β = 0.27, p &lt; 0.001). The soundscape was positively correlated with characteristics of the physical environment, such as daylight and temperature. This result is similar to those of previous studies <ref type="bibr">(Jeon et al., 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Jeon et al., 2011b)</ref>  <ref type="formula">2017</ref>) explored waterscape influenced soundscape evaluation. These elements were both related to natural and urban conditions. Meanwhile, natural and urban conditions and urban management influenced the physical environment. Therefore, construction of a favourable physical environment is recommended, including urban planning, spatial layout, and visual qualities, similar to previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Galal et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Ng, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hao et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">La Malva et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The physical environment, including daylight and temperature, which is one of the main non-auditory contextual factors was positively correlated with soundscape evaluation.</p><p>This result corresponds to those of previous studies <ref type="bibr">(Jeon et al., 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Jeon et al., 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brown et al., 2011)</ref>. Various components of contextual perceptions were related to sound sources; these findings can be used to improve soundscape evaluations, and develop strategies for pleasant soundscape evaluation.</p><p>Based on the proposed model of the relationships between perception of urban contextual factors and soundscape evaluations, which was obtained via SEM, soundscape design strategies for applications should be investigated. The process of soundscape planning and design should be integrated in urban design and renewal. Urban construction and urban management can be improved with the utilization of facilities and conditions, including the physical environment and visual qualities, thereby improving the soundscape in urban recreational public spaces. Moreover, natural resources in recreational areas should be conserved to enhance the ecological environment and soundscape with natural sounds.</p><p>Users can be guided and managed through designing urban spaces and providing an improved interesting and comfortable soundscape atmosphere. Sounds of human beings talking and children playing are also positively correlated with soundscape evaluations. Appropriate sound sources (such as fountains) can be added to form a masking noise and construct a pleasant and comfortable atmosphere. Thus, the vitality of open public spaces can be improved in terms of location, microclimate, and other facilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chen et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chen et al., 2020)</ref>. The soundscape is an important approach to increase such attractiveness and vitality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Effects of sound sources on contextual factors and soundscape</head><p>The sound sources differed based on the types of main activities and functions of the investigated sites. According to a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hong and Jeon, 2015)</ref>, user activities, birds, and wind were the main sound sources in urban recreational spaces. Human and natural sounds in these spaces could overcome the negative effects of noise that was generated by the surroundings and influence soundscape evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Szeremeta and Zannin, 2009)</ref>. Therefore, human and natural sounds should be conserved suitably to create and maintain a comfortable and interesting atmosphere, especially in recreational spaces. The sounds of people talking and children playing positively related to the soundscape dimensions of interest and comfort, which is similar to a previous study of human behaviour in response to soundscape evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Jo and Jeon, 2020)</ref>. Human sounds, especially the sounds of other people's activities, can contribute to the social soundscape and stimulate interactions among users in a public space <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cao and Kang, 2021)</ref>. According to previous studies, human sounds corresponded to a dynamic experience and increased liveliness in urban parks.</p><p>The presence of music in public spaces led to differences in soundscape evaluations, based on the adaptability of the type of spatial function, the demographic information of visitors, and stay time in the site. In this study, music related to square dancing was negatively correlated to interest and comfort in urban open public spaces. This result is similar to that of <ref type="bibr">Liu et al. (2019b)</ref> who conducted their study in a historical block. It also corresponds to the result of a previous soundscape evaluation study of square dancing in a Chinese urban park <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ba et al., 2017)</ref>, namely that, when there was a square dance, the Sustainable Cities and Society, Volume 74, November 2021, 103192 acoustic comfort and pleasure would gradually decrease as the duration increased. This may be likely due to the differences in the visiting purposes of visitors and interviewees in open squares, urban parks, and renovated historical blocks. Additionally, the effect of music is related to the type and form of performance. Live music is popular in open public spaces and the type of music is less important. However, if the music is played from a loudspeaker, the influence of the type, melody, and beat of music on subjective evaluations must be considered <ref type="bibr">(Yang and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kang, 2005, Suhanek et al., 2020)</ref>. For example, Chinese folk songs are helpful for improving the pleasure and suppressing annoyance among the elderly <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Qin et al., 2020)</ref>, while young people prefer music from stores and passing cars <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Yang and Kang, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Sound sources have impacts on the soundscape evaluation, and some sources are regulated by urban conditions, urban design, and management. Reasonable planning and design would preserve or create natural and ecological environment, and then produce rich sounds of natural sounds. The design of waterscape adds interactive perception of vision and hearing. In urban management, electronic sound source is also recommended to be control. For urban design and management, it affects the perception of some sound sources, and soundscape evaluation.</p></div>

The main limitations of the measured data are the social aspects of the survey, namely that, contextual perceptions and soundscape evaluations should be considered in other cities and countries as well, based on the corresponding cultures.</p><p>Additionally, the SEM model of the relationship is based on the main functions of recreation and leisure for soundscape evaluations and contextual perceptions.

The following conclusions were obtained. First, the correlations between urban contextual perceptions and soundscape evaluations were examined. Eventful, calming, interesting, and comfortable soundscapes were positively correlated to satisfaction of most urban factors in urban public spaces. Pleasantness of the soundscape had less influence on the urban contextual descriptors than other soundscape indicators. Second, a structural equation model of the influence of urban contextual factors on soundscape evaluations was explored. Urban management and the physical environment were positively related to soundscape pleasantness. Natural and urban conditions showed positive effects on soundscape eventfulness. This study illustrated systematic factors regarding urban factors as non-acoustic indicators. It provides a better understanding of the complex roles of urban management, natural and urban conditions, and the physical environment in soundscape evaluation.

Proper spatial design of an open square, such as functional zoning, positions of exit, open and closed organization, and separation of spaces can provide a rich spatial form and spatial experience. At the same time, a variety of activities can be created, such as Tai Chi, dancing, skateboarding, and so on. Various groups of people can be formed according to the type of activities they want to indulge in, to avoid a large crowd in the same place. Facilities such as seats, performances, lights, and aromatic plants would also affect people's choice of where to stay in the squares.</figDesc><table /></figure>
