Especially since the 1990s there has been an enormous increase in theoretical development, partly because of advances in graphical modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.

Knoop are with Expert Centre for Chronic Fatigue, Radboud University Medical Centre, the Netherlands. • * The members of OPTIMISTIC consortium are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>be divided into two approaches: constraintbased and score-based. Constraint-based approaches work with conditional independence tests. First, they construct a skeleton graph starting with the complete graph and excluding edges between variables that are conditionally independent. Second, edges are oriented to arrive at a causal graph. Examples of constraintbased approaches are the IC algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, PC-FCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and TC <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Constraint-based approaches do not have to rely on the causal sufficiency assumption, and then can detect common causes of the observed variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. A disadvantage of this approach is the use of independence tests on a large number of conditioning variables, making it less reliable <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Score-based approaches assign scores to particular graph structures based on the data fit and the complexity of the graph. Different scor-ing metrics that are often used are the Bayesian score <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and the BIC score <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. An example of a score-based method is greedy equivalence search (GES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The goal of the score-based approach is to find the graph structure with the highest score. An advantage of this approach is that it measures the reliability of the inferred causal relationships, which makes the result easy to interpret <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Score-based approaches typically do make the causal sufficiency assumption, and then cannot detect common confounders of the observed variables. Moreover, the involved optimization problem is usually NP-hard, so that different search heuristics are often used. The approach advocated in this paper is an example of a score-based approach.</p><p>Furthermore, in causal modeling based on observational data, the causal models are undetermined unless a preference for parsimonious models over more complex models is made <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In score-based approaches, such simplicity assumptions are typically implemented by adding a penalty for model complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Constraint-based approaches often make the implicit assumption of so-called causal faithfulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, which states that there are no conditional independencies that hold in the density over a set of variables V , except those that are entailed by the causal structure. However, in practice faithfulness can be violated and better constrained-based approaches have been developed to handle this, such as CPC <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and ACPC <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>A drawback of both score-based and constrained-based approaches, however, is the inherent instability in structure estimation. With finite samples small changes in the data can lead to completely different optimal structures. Outcomes of borderline independence tests can be incorrect and can lead to multiple errors when propagated by the discovery algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The present work introduces a new scorebased causal discovery algorithm, called stable specification search, that is robust for finite samples based on advances in stability selection using subsampling and selection algorithms. Structure search is performed over Structural Equation Models (SEM), which is the most widely used language for causal discovery in various scientific disciplines. The method uses exploratory search, but allows incorporation of prior background knowledge. In order to show that our method can handle various kinds of data (continuous, discrete, and a combination of both) we evaluated our method on simulated and real-world data. The simulated data is used to compare our method with some advanced constrained-based approaches (PCstable <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, CPC) and a score-based approach (GES). Specifically, we compare the robustness of each method in computing causal structure. The real-world data sets, about Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, are used to compare our results with some previous studies. The results show that our exploratory, hypothesis-free approach gives significant improvement over alternative approaches, and is able to obtain structure estimates that are consistent with the hypothesis driven models constructed by medical experts based on medical data and years of experience.</p><p>The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes all the background material obtained from the existing literature. Section 3 describes our robust score-based approach for causal discovery. Section 4 presents experimental result on one simulated and two realworld data sets. Section 5 gives conclusions and suggestions for future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Directed Acyclic Graph</head><p>We first describe some graphical notation and terminology used in the remaining sections. A graph is a pair (V, E) with V a set of nodes and E a set of edges. A directed graph has all edges in E directed (arc); a single arrowhead on every edge, e.g., A → B. Directed cycles represent feedback or reciprocal relationships, e.g., A → B → A. A graph with no directed cycles is called acyclic. A graph which is both directed and acyclic is called a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> depicts a DAG of four variables. The skeleton of a DAG is the undirected graph that results from removing the directionality of every edge. A v-structure in a DAG G is an ordered triple (x, y, z) such that G contains the directed edges x → y, z → y, and x and z are not adjacent in G <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Causal Modeling in SEM</head><p>In this study, we focus on causal models with no reciprocal or feedback relationships, and no latent variables. Generally, there are two common ways of representing a model in SEM: by stating all relations in the set as equations, which is called a causal model, or by drawing them as a causal diagram (graph). The general form of the equations is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x i = f i (pa i , ε i ), i = 1, . . . , n.<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where pa i denotes the parents which represent the set of variables considered to be direct causes of X i and ε i represents errors on account of omitted factors that are assumed to be mutually independent <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Specification Search in SEM</head><p>Typically, a SEM is used as follows: 1) set a hypothesis as the prior model, 2) fit the model to the data, 3) evaluate the model, and 4) modify the model to improve the parsimony and score <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The last step is called specification search <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. This typical model refinement approach is hypothesis-driven. It works by adding or deleting some arcs between variables from the initial model. Typically only a few models are evaluated, making it difficult to derive causal relationships. An alternative approach is exploratory search in which no prior hypothesis is specified. Typical approaches in the literature for addressing the exponential search space include tabu search <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, genetic algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, ant colony optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Multi-objective Optimization</head><p>Following the principle of Occam's razor, we should prefer models that are simple and fit the data well. These two objectives, however, are often conflicting as a well-fit model is likely to be a complex model. In this paper, we propose to make use of multi-objective optimization to explicitly optimize both objectives.</p><p>In multi-objective optimization, optimal solutions are defined in terms of domination. A model x 1 is said to dominate model x 2 , if the following conditions are satisfied <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x 1 x 2 iff ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , M } f i (x 1 ) ≤ f i (x 2 ) ∃j ∈ {1, . . . , M } f j (x 1 ) &lt; f j (x 2 )</formula><p>(2) The first condition states that the model x 1 is no worse than x 2 in all objectives f i . The second condition states that the model x 1 is strictly better than x 2 in at least one objective. By using this concept, given the population of models P , we can partition P into n sets called fronts F 1 , . . . , F n , such that F k dominates F l where 1 ≤ k &lt; l ≤ n and the models within the same front do not dominate each other. The so-called Pareto Front or non-dominated set F 1 includes models that are not dominated by any member of P . Essentially, using multi-objective optimization we efficiently find the best fitting models over a whole range of model complexities using a single coherent optimization approach. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> provides a sketch. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1">NSGA-II</head><p>Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II or NSGA-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> is a well-known multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), still widely applied in various fields, such as image retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, reactive power planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, building design <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and robot grippers <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>A characteristic feature is fast non-dominated sorting which sorts models based on the concept of domination. With M the number of objectives and N the size of population, the time complexity has order O (M N 2 ), which is better than a naïve approach with O (M N 3 ).</p><p>Another characteristic feature is crowding distance sorting which is implemented to preserve the diversity among the solutions in the Pareto front. This feature sorts models based on the distance metric which explains the proximity of a model to other models. The iterative procedure of NSGA-II shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> is a sequence of steps started by generating a population of solutions P of size N . P is then manipulated by genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation, forming a new population Q of size N . P and Q are then combined into population R with size 2N . After that R is sorted using fast non-dominated sorting, yielding a set of fronts F . In the next iteration each front in F is sorted using the crowding distance sorting and the first N members are used to generate a new population P . At t = 0, P is formed by creating N random solutions sorted with fast non-dominated sorting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Stability Selection</head><p>Structure estimation is a notoriously difficult problem, both because of computational aspects (finding the optimal structure can be NP hard) and because of instability (small changes in the data can lead to completely different optimal structures). In this section we describe the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> for robust estimation of model structure based on subsampling in combination with selection algorithms. The method has been shown to yield finite sample family wise error control and improved structure estimates.</p><p>Let β be a sparse p-dimensional vector which generally represents, for example, the coeffi- Crowding distance sorting Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>: Adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. P is the current population with size N and is manipulated to make a new population Q. Both are combined, forming R, which will be sorted using fast nondominated yielding a set of fronts F . Every member of front F n ∈ F will be assigned a socalled crowding distance in order to sort F k . The first N members of F will be selected to be the next population P . cient vector in linear regression or the edges in a graph. In structure estimation the goal is to infer the set S = {k : β k = 0} of non-zero components from noisy observations. Many methods tackle this problem by minimizing some loss function augmented with a regularization term to avoid overfitting. Usually the regularization term is parameterized by λ ∈ Λ ⊆ R + and each λ leads to an estimated structure Ŝλ ⊆ {1, . . . , p}. The objective is to determine λ such that Ŝλ is identical to S with high probability. To this end, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> introduces the concepts of selection probabilities and stability paths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1 (Selection probabilities).</head><p>Let I be a subset of {1, . . . , n} of size n/2 randomly drawn without replacement, K ⊆ {1, . . . , p}, and Ŝλ (I) be the selected set Ŝλ for subsample I. The probability of K being in set Ŝλ (I) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Πλ K = P K ⊆ Ŝλ (I)</formula><p>where the probability being is with respect to the random subsampling and possibly the construction of Ŝλ (I).</p><p>Definition 2 (Stability path). For each variable k = 1, . . . , p the stability path is given by the selection probabilities { Πλ k : λ ∈ Λ}. Furthermore, in stability selection we do not select a single element from the set of models { Ŝλ : λ ∈ Λ} as traditional methods do, but perturb the data many times and select structures that occur in a large fraction of selected sets. To this end, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> introduces the concept of stable variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 3 (Stable variables). The set of stable variables is defined as</head><formula xml:id="formula_3">Ŝstable = {k : max λ∈Λ Πλ k ≥ π thr }</formula><p>where π thr is a cutoff with 0 &lt; π thr &lt; 1.</p><p>Variables with a high selection probability are kept whereas those with low selection probabilities are disregarded. The threshold π thr is a tuning parameter but its influence is small and sensible values (e.g., π thr ∈ (0.6, 0.9)) tend to give similar results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Model Equivalence</head><p>There is one further subtlety that makes our approach for finding stable models (or submodels) slightly more complicated than that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. If we find a particular model, we have to account for the fact that there may be different models that are observationally indistinguishable. Causal models represented by DAGs have their corresponding model equivalent classes, called Completed Partially Directed Acyclic Graph (CPDAG). This means that every probability distribution derived from a model in a particular CPDAG, can also be derived by models belonging to the same CPDAG. In SEMs, these models are called covariance equivalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The characterization of equivalent structures is given by the following theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Furthermore, a directed edge x → y is compelled in G if for every DAG G equivalent to G, x → y exists in G. For any edge e in G, if e is not compelled in G, then e is reversible. A CPDAG can be represented by a directed edge (arc) for every compelled edge and an undirected edge for every reversible edge <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Converting a model into a CPDAG allows one to observe the relations that hold among the variables. Arcs in a CPDAG indicate a cause-effect relation among variables since the same arc occurs in all members of the CPDAG. Undirected edges A -B in a CPDAG indicate that some members of the CPDAG contain an arc A → B whereas other members contain an arc B → A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PROPOSED METHOD</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The General Idea</head><p>Our proposed method can be divided into two phases. The first phase is search and the second phase is visualization. In the search phase SEM and NSGA-II are synergically combined for exploratory search of the model space. As portrayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, the inner loop is an iterative process, searching over the model space and returns a Pareto front of models. The outer loop is an iterative process that samples a different subset of the data in each iteration and at the end returns a number of Pareto fronts coming from those subsets. Each model returned by the outer loop is transformed into a CPDAG which  On top of the stability graphs we perform stability selection. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, stability selection is defined in terms of a regularization parameter λ. In our approach we do not have a regularization parameter and instead use model complexity (defined in Section 4.1) which is one of the objectives in our multi-objective optimization approach. We therefore define two thresholds. The first threshold is the boundary of selection probability π sel and corresponds to π thr in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. For example, setting π sel = 0.6 means that all causal relationships with edge stability or causal path stability (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>) above this threshold are considered stable. The second threshold is the boundary of complexity π bic , which is used to control overfitting and corresponds to minimal λ in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. We set π bic to the level of model complexity at which the minimum average Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) score is found. For example, π bic = 7 means that all causal relationships with an edge stability or a causal path stability lower than this threshold (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>) are considered parsimonious. Causal relationships that intersect with the top-left region are considered both stable and parsimonious and called relevant.</p><p>In the visualization phase we combine the stability graphs into a graph with nodes and edges. This is done by adding the relevant edges and orienting them using background knowledge (if any, see Section 3.2) and the relevant causal paths. In addition we annotate each edge with the highest selection probability it has across different model complexities in the top-left region of the edge stability. This visualization eases interpretation but the stability graphs are considered to be the main outcome of our approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Constrained SEM</head><p>In practise, one often has prior knowledge about the domain, for example, that A does not cause B directly, denoted by A → B.</p><p>The method proposed here can include such prior knowledge, extending previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, since this translates to a DAG with no directed edge from A to B. 1   Model specifications should comply with any prior knowledge when performing specification search and when measuring the edge and causal path stability. When DAGs are converted into CPDAGs in the outer loop, a constraint A → B may be violated since arcs B → A in the DAG may be converted into undirected (reversible) edges A -B in the CPDAG. In order to preserve constraints we therefore extended the efficient DAG-TO-CPDAG algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> which runs in time O (|E|) given a DAG G = (V, E).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> provides pseudocode for the constrained DAG to CPDAG algorithm. Line 2 produces a total ordering E over the edges in DAG G. Lines 3-6 impose an arc upon the edges that match the constraints. Finally, Line 7 uses <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> to label the remaining edges E \ E in G with "compelled" or "reversible" and returns the constrained CPDAG G .</p><p>A DAG without edges will always be transformed into a CPDAG without edges. A fully connected DAG without constraints will be transformed into a CPDAG with only undirected edges. However, if background knowledge is added, a fully connected DAG will be transformed into a CPDAG in which the edges corresponding to the background knowledge are directed. From these observations it follows that in the edge stability graph all paths start with a selection probability of 0 and end up in a selection probability of 1. In the causal path stability graph when no prior knowledge has been added all paths start with a selection probability of 0 and end up in a selection probability of 0. However, when prior knowledge is added some of the paths may end up in a selection probability of 1 because of the added constraints.</p><p>1. This still allows for directed edges from B to A or indirect relations from A to B.</p></div>

Line 13 forms a new population Q by manipulating P using binary tournament selection, one-point crossover, and one-bit flip mutation, which are compatible with a binary representation.

Onepoint crossover takes two models from M pool and swaps the data after the crossover point (the middle). One-bit flip mutation flips each bit according to a predetermined rate.

We did not do a comprehensive parameter tuning for NSGA-II, instead, we followed guidelines provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The parameters were set as follows: the number of generations (inner loop) was 20, the size of the population P was 100, the crossover rate was 0.85, the mutation rate was 0.075 and with binary tournament selection.</p><p>We score models using the chi-square χ 2 and the model complexity. The χ 2 is considered the original fit index in SEM and measures whether the model-implied covariance matrix is close enough to the sample covariance matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>The model complexity represents how many predicted parameters the model contains. Assuming that variances of parameters are always predicted, the maximum model complexity with n variables is given by n(n -1)/2.</p><p>When using multi-objective optimization we minimize both the χ 2 and model complexity objectives. These two objectives are, however, conflicting with each other. For example, minimizing the model complexity typically means compromising the data fit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Application to Simulated Data 4.2.1 Data Generation</head><p>In this experiment we generated data using the Waste Incinerator network in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>, which is a model of waste emissions from an incinerator plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. This model contains both discrete and continuous random variables, with B the waste burning regimen, W the compositional differences in incoming waste, C the concentration of CO2, F the filter state, E the filter efficiency, L the light penetrability, D the emission of dust, M in the metals in waste, and M out the metals emission. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, we treat all discrete variables as continuous. We added prior knowledge that none of the variables directly cause the filter state. We generated 10 data sets containing 400 samples from this network using the BNT toolbox with the default parameter setting as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Performance Measure</head><p>We compared the stable specification search with GES (score-based method), PC-stable, and CPC (both constrained-based methods). Our method intrinsically subdivides the data in a number of subsets, here 50 of size 200 samples, For a fair comparison, for each algorithm we consider subsampling (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>), giving each method 50 subsets. For every subset, each algorithm returns a CPDAG from which we can derive the edges and causal paths.</p><p>Since the true model of the Waste Incinerator data is known, we can measure the performance of both methods by means of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The True Positive Rate (TPR) and the False Positive Rate (FPR) are computed with respect to the CPDAG of the true model. For example, in the case of causal path stability, a true positive means that a causal path with any length obtained through our approach or the PC algorithm is actually present in the CPDAG of the true model. By increasing the threshold π sel , we increase the TPR at the expense of the FPR. In addition, we conducted three significance tests to compare the ROC curves. The first test <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> compares the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the ROC curves based on the theory of Ustatistics. The second test <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, a modification of <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, compares the AUC of ROC curves that are generated from bootstrap replicates. The third test <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> compares the actual ROC curves by evaluating the absolute difference. The null hypothesis is that the AUC of the ROC curves of our method and the PC algorithm are equivalent.</p><p>We repeated the above procedure 10 times on different Waste Incinerator data sets and computed the ROC curves using two different schemes: averaging and individual. In the averaging scheme, the ROC curves are computed based on the average edge and causal path stability from different data sets. We conducted statistical significance tests on these average ROC curves. Conversely, in the individual scheme the ROC curves are computed directly from the edge and causal path stability on each data set. We conducted individual statistical significance tests on the ROC curves for each data set and then used Fisher's method, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, to combine these tests into a single test statistic. Both schemes are intended to show empirically and comprehensively how robust the results of each algorithm are across changes in the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Discussion of Waste Incinerator Result</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> shows the ROC curves for (a) the edge stability and (b) the causal path stability from the averaging scheme. The corresponding AUCs for edge stability are 0.96 (stable specification search), 0.89 (PC-stable), 0.88 (CPC), and 0.69 (GES). The AUCs for causal path stability are 0.98 (stable specification search), 0.85 (PCstable), 0.88 (CPC), and 0.61 (GES).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> lists the results of the significance tests for both the averaging and individual schemes. The ROC and AUC for the edge stability are comparable with PC-stable and CPC (p-value &gt; 0.1), but always significant (p-value &lt; 0.01) compared with GES. The ROC and AUC for the causal path stability compared with CPC are marginally significant (p-value &lt; 0.1) using the averaging scheme, but significant using the individual scheme (pvalue &lt; 0.01); compared with PC-stable significant (p-value &lt; 0.05) using the averaging scheme, but highly significant using the individual scheme (p-value &lt; 10 -5 ); compared with GES highly significant using both schemes (p-value &lt; 10 -5 ). To conclude, we show that the stable specification search obtains at least comparable performance as, but often significant improvement over alternative approaches, especially in obtaining the causal relations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Application to Real-world Data</head><p>This section describes the results of applying our proposed method on two real-world data sets. Both of them are about particular diseases, for which the underlying causal relationships are often not clear.

We compare the stability graphs to studies reported in the literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Application to CFS</head><p>In this experiment we consider a data set about Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) of 183 subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Originally the data comes from a longitudinal study with five time slices, but in this paper, we focus only on one time slice representing the subjects after the first treatment.</p><p>The data set contains six discrete variables; fatigue severity assessed with the subscale fatigue severity of the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS), the sense of control over fatigue assessed with the self-efficacy scale (SES), focusing on symptoms measured with the Illness Management Questionnaire, the objective activity of the patient measured using an actometer (oActivity), the subject's perceived activity measured with the subscale activity of the CIS (pActivity), and physical functioning measured with subscale physical functioning of the medical outcomes survey (SF36). We refer to the original paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, for a detailed description of the questionnaires used and the actometer. Missing values were imputed using an imputation method Expectation Maximization implemented in SPSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. As all of the variables have large scales, e.g., in the range between 0 to 155, we treat them as continuous variables. We added prior knowledge that the variable fatigue does not cause any of the other variables directly.</p><p>The total computation time for one subset was around 5.5 minutes. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> shows that eight relevant edges were found. These edges are between pActivity and fatigue, focusing and fatigue, functioning and fatigue, control and fatigue, pActivity and focusing, pActivity and oActivity, focusing and control, and functioning and control.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> shows that four relevant causal paths were found. These causal paths are: pActivity to fatigue, control to fatigue, functioning to fatigue, and focusing to fatigue.</p><p>The stability graphs can be combined into a model as follows. First, the nodes are connected according to the eight relevant edges obtained. Second, the edges are oriented according to the background knowledge added. The fact that the variable fatigue does not directly cause any other variable results in four directed edges, which, in this case, correspond exactly to the relevant causal paths obtained. The inferred model is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">11</ref>.</p><p>A (direct) causal path X → Y in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">11</ref> indicates that a change in variable X causes a change in variable Y . All variables except for objective activity were found to be direct causes for fatigue severity, which are corroborated by literature studies. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, changes in physical activity, sense of control, and focus on symptoms measured, were shown to result in changes in fatigue. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, changes in perceived activity, sense of control, and physical functioning were shown to result in changes in fatigue. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, an increase in sense of control, perceived activity, and self-reported physical functioning, as well as a decrease in focusing on symptoms resulted in a decrease of fatigue, whereas changes in objective activity did not  <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> in Appendix A for more detail.</p><p>result in any change in fatigue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">Application to ADHD</head><p>In this experiment we consider a data set about Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) of 245 subjects with 23 variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, we excluded instances with missing values and variables that either have insufficient instances or are considered irrelevant. The remaining data set consists of 221 instances and six variables with gender the gender of subjects, AD the attention deficit measure, HI the assessment of hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms, aggression the measure of aggressive behavior, medication the medication status of subjects, and handedness represents whether a subject uses the right and/or left hand. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, we treat all discrete variables as continuous variables. We added prior knowledge that the variable gender does not cause any of the other variables directly. The total computation time for one subset was around 4.9 minutes. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref> shows that there are four relevant edges, namely between gender and AD, AD and medication, AD and HI, and HI and aggression. Moreover, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref> shows that there are seven relevant causal paths; gender to AD, gender to HI, gender to medication, gender to aggression, AD to HI, AD to medication, and AD to aggression.</p><p>The stability graphs can be combined into a model as follows. First, the nodes are connected according to the four relevant edges obtained. Second, the edges are oriented according to the background knowledge added. The fact that the variable gender does not directly cause any other variable results in one directed edge gender → AD. Third, the edges are oriented according to the relevant causal paths obtained. This results in two directed edges, AD → HI and AD → medication. Since there is no relevant edge between AD and aggression and no relevant causal path from HI to aggression we cannot orient any other edges and therefore The causal relations obtained for ADHD are corroborated by studies reported in the literature. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, gender is shown to be a direct cause for attention deficit, attention deficit is shown to be a direct cause for both hyperactivity, medication, and aggression, and hyperactivity and aggression are related but neither variable is a direct cause for the other.  The comparison conducted on the simulated data shows that our method, the stable specification search, shows significant improvement over alternative approaches in obtaining the causal relations. The results on both real-world data sets, CFS and ADHD, are consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. In general we may conclude that our causal discovery algorithm is able to robustly estimate the underlying causal structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>Several issues have not yet been explored in our current approach that warrant further research, such as latent variables and longitudinal data. Taking into account the existence of latent variables can further improve our structure estimate by properly identifying dependencies between variables as an unmeasured common cause acting on both variables. In longitudinal data several subjects are measured at different time slices which provides a richer structure that can be incorporated in the causal discovery algorithm. A first attempt in this direction can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>Our approach can be viewed as a novel application of multi-objective optimization. The main idea of stability selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, is to increase the robustness of structure estimation by considering a whole range of model complexities. In the original work, this is done by varying a continuous regularization parameter. For causal discovery we have to explicitly consider different discrete model complexities. Furthermore, finding the optimal structure for each model complexity is a hard optimization problem. By rephrasing stability selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, we can jointly run over various model complexities and find the corresponding optimal structures for each model complexity. In this paper, we have used NSGA-II for multi-objective optimization, because of its popularity and availability, but realize that more recent multiobjective optimization approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, [57] may be even more efficient. This is beyond the scope of this work and left for future research. In the same spirit, one can easily combine freely available software packages, e.g., for scoring Structural Equation Models, bootstrap sampling, and multi-objective optimization, to build one's own robust structural estimation approach.</p><p>Computation, IEEE Transactions on, vol. 11, no. 6, pp. 712-731, 2007.</p><p>[57] H.
