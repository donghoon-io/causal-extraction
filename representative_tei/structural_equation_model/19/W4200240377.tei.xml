<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) has remained prevalent in information systems, business, and social science research <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hwang et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Khan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Petter, 2018)</ref>. Current advances in PLS-SEM enable a variety of nuanced analyses and encourage use of further robustness checks <ref type="bibr">(Sarstedt et al., 2020b)</ref> and predictive assessments <ref type="bibr">(Chin et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hair, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Shmueli et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sharma et al. 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sharma et al. , 2021) )</ref> to better interpret PLS-SEM analysis. However, although mediation analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Nitzl et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sarstedt et al., 2020a)</ref> and moderation analysis <ref type="bibr">(Becker et al., 2018)</ref> in PLS-SEM are frequently employed and well understood, the same does not apply to conditional mediation (CoMe) analysis that draws on both. Indeed, extant PLS-SEM applications of CoMe analysisoften referred to differently-vary in their execution and how they are interpreted. Hence, this paper seeks to provide guidance to proficiently conduct CoMe analysis in PLS-SEM.</p><p>Applications of CoMe analysis in a PLS-SEM context are scarce. Based on a search of papers published from 2000 to 2019, we could identify only 27 papers that in some way considered CoMe in PLS-SEM. Eleven of them appeared to disregard the use of a continuous variable when conducting CoMe analysis in PLS-SEM (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Lee-Rodríguez et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ahadzadehet et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Koay, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Park et al., 2019)</ref>. Instead, they employed a separate PROCESS macro in their analysis. Meanwhile, 16 studies performed multigroup analysis (MGA) when conducting CoMe analysis using a categorical variable. However, the majority of these studies (14 studies) did not examine the difference in the mediated effect before comparing each group's mediated effect values (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Calvo-Mora et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Willems et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Limaj &amp; Bernroider, 2019)</ref>, except for two studies from <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Rezaei and Valaei (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hernandez-Ortega et al. (2017)</ref>. Furthermore, many prior studies have remained vague in specifying whether the theoretical reasoning for their hypothesized CoMe relationship(s) concerns the rate of change (slope) or difference in strength (magnitude) of the effect(s). Clearly, the use of CoMe analysis in PLS-SEM is still in its infancy, which is of fundamental concern to researchers seeking to employ PLS-SEM when assessing theoretical arguments and deriving robust managerial recommendations that rest on relationships that are mediated but conditional on certain exogenous variables.</p><p>CoMe analysis can concern distinct types of CoMe models (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hayes, 2018)</ref>, which in turn require different analyses. However, some researchers appear to be not familiar with these requirements when conducting PLS-SEM analysis. Furthermore, many researchers still combine their PLS-SEM analyses with <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hayes's (2017)</ref> PROCESS macros for SPSS or SAS. This is not surprising, because assessing whether a mediated relationship is moderated is relatively easy using a PROCESS macro. Recently, however, <ref type="bibr">Sarstedt et al. (2020a)</ref> provided several reasons why this combination is not advisable. They stressed that simultaneous estimations in a nomological network, in contrast to conducting a supplementary regression analysis, are necessary to produce reliable and valid results, especially in the case of multi-item construct measurements. Notably, the sole use of PLS-SEM for estimating a CoMe model offers the following advantages: (1) it overcomes the limitations of traditional sequential approaches by enabling researchers to analyze complex interrelationships between latent variables simultaneously, (2) while accounting for the measurement error inherent in the multi-item measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Edwards &amp; Lambert, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hayes &amp; Scharkow, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Muller et al., 2005)</ref>. Additionally, in PLS-SEM applications, computing the significance of the index of moderated mediation (the CoMe index) and evaluating it remain scarce <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hair et al., 2022)</ref>. The CoMe index quantifies the effect that a moderator has on a mediated relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hayes, 2015)</ref>. If the CoMe index is significantly different from zero, a conditional mediated effect is smaller, larger, or opposite in sign at different levels of the moderator. One reason for the infrequent consideration of the CoMe index could relate to the lack of established and adopted conceptual understanding about the nuances of CoMe analysis (i.e., distinguishing between distinct types of CoMe models), in general, and within the PLS-SEM context, in particular. Related, the issue of scarce and sometimes vague applications of CoMe analysis in PLS-SEM likely rests on lacking access to detailed step-by-step procedures for its conduct in the PLS-SEM setting. Summarizing these concerns, <ref type="bibr">Sarstedt et al. (2020a)</ref> recently noted that clear guidelines for conducting CoMe analysis must be urgently provided; otherwise, its use in PLS-SEM will be hindered.</p><p>Overall, this study bridges this gap by offering researchers a guide for estimating and assessing CoMe models in PLS-SEM. This paper first clarifies CoMe analysis. In doing so, the paper illuminates conceptual fundamentals and develops guidelines for CoMe analysis within the PLS-SEM context. Subsequently, the paper outlines the illustrative use of CoMe analysis in and presents detailed step-by-step procedures for the PLS-SEM setting. Together, these conceptual guidelines and practical step-by-step procedures should enable a more proficient CoMe analysis in PLS-SEM applications. In turn, results from CoMe analysis using PLS-SEM in information systems studies should provide a better basis for drawing accurate conclusions to advance theory and produce practical insights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What is Conditional Mediation Analysis?</head><p>A mediated relationship, also referred to as an indirect relationship, is defined by the presence of one or more variables that intervene to transmit the influence of, for example, variable X on variable Y <ref type="bibr">(Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Pirlott &amp; MacKinnon, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zhao et al., 2010)</ref>. In particular, in mediation analysis, researchers examine whether a change in an independent construct changes a mediator, which in turn results in changes in the dependent construct in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Demming et al., 2017)</ref>. This analysis considers three relationships: a direct path between the independent and dependent variables, a first-stage path (representing the link between an independent variable and the mediator), and a second-stage path (signifying the relationship between the mediator and the dependent variable). In contrast, a moderating effect is defined by the presence of a variable that changes the influence of variable X on variable Y by impacting the nature, direction, or strength of this influence, which can vary under the value of the moderator <ref type="bibr">(Aguinis &amp; Gottfredson, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Dawson, 2014)</ref>. Although many guidelines for modeling mediating and moderating effects (see <ref type="bibr">Aguinis et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gardner et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Holland et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008)</ref> and some directly concerning PLS-SEM (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Becker et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Carrión et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Nitzl et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sarstedt et al., 2020a)</ref> have been widely adopted, explicit guidelines concerning the CoMe analysis in PLS-SEM do not exist.</p><p>As already indicated, CoMe analysis combines mediation and moderation analyses to examine and test hypotheses about how mediated relationships vary because of context, boundaries, or individual differences. It occurs when a moderator interacts with one or more of the paths of the mediated effect, such that the value of the mediated effect changes depending on the value of the moderator <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hayes, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hayes, , 2018))</ref>. This type of modeling is well suited to investigate how relationships between cause and outcomes vary depending on the characteristics of their contexts <ref type="bibr">(Bachl, 2017)</ref>. For instance, "Does an effect operate through different relationships for certain individuals or under certain circumstances?" or "Is the mediated effect transmitted via some mediators stronger or weaker for some individuals or in some situations than others?" More formally, in a CoMe model, the independent variable of X influences the outcome variable of Y through one or more mediators of M, and the relationship is conditioned by the values of one or more moderators of W and/or Z <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hayes, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hayes, , 2018))</ref>.</p><p>Scholars in various fields have encouraged researchers to go beyond the separate analysis of mediating and moderating effects as part of the quest to understand and predict theorized effects better <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Edwards &amp; Lambert, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hayes, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hayes &amp; Scharkow, 2013)</ref>. Two considerations explain why the integration of mediation and moderation can provide a more complete understanding of a phenomenon rather than focusing solely on either mediation or moderation alone as distinct processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Karazsia et al., 2013)</ref>. First, examining mediation is not always a universal process. Any bivariate or linear relationship of X on Y can be moderated by a third variable. Thus, researchers may be interested in understanding whether a mediated relationship is moderated by another variable such that the mediated effect value changes depending on the moderator's value (or the mediated effect value is conditional on the moderator's value). Second, the particular process(es) through which a moderating effect occurs may be of considerable interest. Thus, researchers may wish to examine whether a moderator conditions the firststage path or the second-stage path in the mediated relationship, or both. The literature has referred to this type of CoMe analysis also as conditional indirect effect analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Edwards &amp; Lambert, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hayes, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Preacher et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>A CoMe effect represents an effect which is mediated through M, through which X exerts its influence on Y, and depends on the value of a moderator W <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hayes, 2017)</ref>. In other words, a CoMe effect is present when the magnitude, size, or direction of the mediated effect of variable X on variable Y via a mediator M varies according to the value of a moderator Z <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Preacher et al., 2007)</ref>. However, many previous studies that purported to test CoMe effects lacked precision in describing how analyses were conducted or draw on different terminology. Hence, the descriptions concerning CoMe analysis vary greatly in literature, making it difficult to fully comprehend what has been done or ought to be done.</p><p>In the earlier literature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Muller et al. (2005)</ref> discussed mediated moderation in which a single variable moderates the three paths in a simple mediation model. However, this view has been criticized for some of the same concerns that have been raised about the causal-step approach discussed by <ref type="bibr">Baron and Kenny (1986)</ref>. Subsequently, Morgan-Lopez and MacKinnon (2006) depicted a formal test for both moderated mediation and mediated moderation that researchers could use to establish that an interaction effect on some outcome is carried through a mediator. In their view, mediated moderation refers to the effect of a mediated interaction on a dependent variable, whereas moderated mediation occurs when the strength of the mediated effect depends on the level of a moderator. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Edwards and Lambert (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Preacher et al. (2007)</ref> also referred to mediated moderation, but they went far beyond the single model delineated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Muller et al. (2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Edwards and Lambert (2007)</ref> described eight models that could be established by allowing a single variable to moderate one or more causal paths in a mediation process and how the various direct and mediated effects can be assessed. Subsequently, they considered the term mediated moderation to be a specific case of moderated mediation. Nonetheless, this concept is subject to debate. Meanwhile, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Preacher et al. (2007)</ref> introduced a formal definition of conditional mediation into the lexicon of statistical mediation analysis. They demonstrated how CoMe analysis is conducted to test hypotheses via the construction of standard errors and bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs). They also illustrated how moderated mediation could be conceptualized in a model with two moderators of different paths in the causal system.</p><p>Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hayes and Preacher (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hayes (2017)</ref> challenged the relevance of the very notion of mediated moderation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Edwards and Lambert (2007)</ref> and advised against using this term because the corresponding analysis provides no additional insights into the path model effects. Specifically, they argued that the interaction term in a mediated moderation model "has no substantive grounding in the measurement or manipulation process. The product does not quantify anything. And if … [the interaction term] has no meaning and no substantive interpretation, then what does the indirect effect of a product mean? The answer, in my opinion, is that it means nothing" <ref type="bibr">(Hayes, 2017, p. 466)</ref>. Furthermore, establishing theoretically reasonable underpinnings of mediated moderation models that can be empirically tested is often challenging. For these reasons, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hayes (2017)</ref> called to disregard the concept of mediated moderation. Instead, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hayes and Preacher (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hayes (2017)</ref> emphasize moderated (conditional) mediation. In their work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hayes and Preacher (2013)</ref> took a covariance-based structural equation modeling approach in estimating conditional direct and mediated effects simultaneously to demonstrate the evidence of a CoMe effect. Since then, various methodological studies regarding CoMe analysis have appeared to address the means of conceptualizing and quantifying the contingencies of a mediated effect <ref type="bibr">(Borau et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wang &amp; Preacher, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we use to the term "CoMe model" when referring to the theoretical (research) model. The term "CoMe analysis" denotes the statistical assessment carried out when analyzing and estimating a CoMe model. And the term "CoMe effect" represents the value that is generated through CoMe analysis and quantifies the mediated effect conditional on a moderator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual Fundamentals of and Guidelines for Conducting Conditional Mediation Analysis in PLS-SEM</head><p>To conduct CoMe analysis in PLS-SEM, this paper proposes a conceptual logic reflected in a decision tree (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). It captures conceptual fundamentals and encapsulates guidelines for CoMe analysis in PLS-SEM. Distinguishing between two goals that may guide the CoMe analysis, we outline two general paths of actions that ought to be followed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Analysis Goal</head><p>Commonly, researchers would be theory-driven, not data-driven, in their research design, especially when testing a hypothesized research model. This means that researchers would normally develop appropriate hypotheses that they seek to test drawing, in our case, on a CoMe model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hair et al. (2022)</ref> stated that hypotheses are individual conjectures and are developed following the scientific method used to explain and predict outcomes. It allows researchers to follow a set of formal steps in conducting calculated analysis on their data. Theory-driven hypotheses can take on either of the following two forms when specifying a CoMe model, which concern either the rate of change (or slope) or difference in the strength (or magnitude) of a relationship:</p><p>Note: * indicates that both ±2 SD or ±3 SD can be easily adopted if a researcher is interested in obtaining wider intervals of SD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Decision Tree of Conditional Mediation Analysis in PLS-SEM</head><p>1. The mediated relationship (M) between X and Y increases as W increases (vice-versa).</p><p>2. The mediated relationship (M) between X and Y is greater for high values of W (or Group A) than for low values of W (or Group B) (vice-versa).</p><p>Drawing from the above mentioned, any research design to test a CoMe model must be informed by underlying theory. Underlying theoretical reasoning has two crucial implications. First, it substantiates the distinct type of the CoMe model considered (please see latter sections for more details on distinct types of CoMe models). Second, the theoretical argument determines whether to assess either the rate of a slope's change or differences in the strength (i.e., magnitude) of a path. To answer this question, if researchers seek to assess the first type of hypothesis (i.e., rate of change/slope), they should assess and interpret the interaction term, whereas if researchers seek to assess the second type of hypothesis (i.e., differences in the strength/magnitude of a path), then they must compare the path values of two or more different groups. This means that the theoretical argument ought to drive the goal of the analysis; in turn, the choice of variable-regardless of continuous or categorical moderator-and the approach of estimation (interaction term or MGA), which are explained in the latter parts of this paper. Importantly, when the analysis goal is pre-determined via a hypothesis, it should enable the researcher to specify and implement a suitable research design that, in turn, guides the collection of appropriate data to fit the required estimation approach to assess the hypothesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type of Moderating Variable</head><p>Two types of moderating variables can be embedded in CoMe analysis: continuous and categorical moderating variables. When a moderator is continuous (e.g., switching costs, firm resources, or privacy concerns), researchers can generate an interaction term that expresses the joint influence of the exogenous construct and moderator on the endogenous construct (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hair et al., 2022)</ref>. This approach would suit estimating the rate of change (i.e., slope) of a relationship. Alternatively, when a moderator is categorical (e.g., industry, gender, or nationality), the variable may serve as a grouping variable that divides the data into subsamples. The theoretical model is then estimated for each distinct subsample. Researchers are usually interested in understanding any significant differences between subsamples; thus, the model estimates for the subsamples are usually compared using MGA <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Sarstedt et al., 2011)</ref>. The latter approach would enable assessments of differences in the strength (i.e., magnitude) of one or more paths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditional Mediation Analysis with Continuous Moderators</head><p>An index term analysis should be conducted when the moderator is continuous and the goal of the CoMe analysis is to assess the rate of change (or slope) of a relationship. An "index term is known as the index of moderated mediation" that can be defined as a "direct quantification of the linear association between the indirect effect and the putative moderator of that effect" <ref type="bibr">(Hayes, 2015, p. 3)</ref> In CoMe Model A (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hayes, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hayes, , 2018))</ref>, moderator W is assumed to affect the first stage of the mediation process (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). W moderates the effect of X on M, but the effect of M on Y is independent of W. To substantiate that the mediation is moderated, researchers traditionally note the need for evidence of a significant moderation of the path linking X and M <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Muller et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Preacher et al., 2007)</ref>, which is equivalent to testing the significance of path (p5) in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hayes and Rockwood (2020)</ref> have emphasized that a nonsignificant moderation result does not necessarily imply that W does not moderate the mediated effect of X on Y. Additionally, researchers must consider the impact of the moderator on the mediated effect as a whole rather than on a single element of the mediated effect in isolation (in this case, path p2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hayes, 2018)</ref>. To formally test this effect in CoMe Model A, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hayes (2018)</ref> proposed the CoMe effect, which is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ω = p1 • p2 + p2 • p5 • W (1)</formula><p>Based on equation 1, the path coefficients of "p2 • p5" refer to the interrelationships of M between the constructs of X and Y (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), whereas W refers to the moderator. If the index "p2 • p5" is significantly different from zero, the mediated effect of X on Y through M depends on moderator W. In other words, "p2 • p5" is the slope of the mediated effect of W contingent upon ω, which represents the CoMe index <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hayes, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Morgan-Lopez &amp; MacKinnon, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The index is a product of path coefficients; hence, a bootstrap-based percentile confidence interval should be used for inference without any assumption about the shape of its sampling distribution. 3 The CoMe index (ω) can be easily obtained based on the path coefficient output generated by any software that enables running of PLS-SEM algorithms (e.g., R, SmartPLS, WarpPLS, ADANCO, etc.).</p><p>The second way to combine mediation and moderation is through the second-stage conditional process model (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). In CoMe Model B, moderator W affects only the second stage of the mediation process, in which the relationship between the mediator M and endogenous variable Y is assumed to be moderated by W. In other words, this second-stage conditional process model fixes the effect of X on M to be constant but allows the effect of M on Y to be moderated by W. To assess the occurrence of this second-stage conditional process model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hayes (2018)</ref> defined the CoMe effect as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= p1 • p2 + p1 • p5 • W (2)</formula><p>Based on equation 2, if the index "p1 • p5" is significant, the mediated effect through M is significantly moderated by W. The index also quantifies the effect of W on the mediated effect of X on Y through M. However, at present, such an output of the CoMe index (ω) cannot yet be directly obtained from any type of PLS-SEM software (R, SmartPLS, WarpPLS, ADANCO, etc.). Hence, the path coefficient results must be examined using the bootstrap sample output.</p><p>For example, a researcher can copy the bootstrap results into an Excel spreadsheet and multiply all lines (e.g., 5,000 or 10,000 subsample bootstraps) of p1 and p5, to calculate the bootstrap CIs from the data in this new calculated column. Alternatively, using other software packages such as the R software is an efficient way for generating this result (i.e., p1 • p5 and the bootstrap CIs) (R Core Team, 2021). The third type of CoMe model, shown in CoMe Model C, is the combination of the first-and second-stage conditional process models, in which W simultaneously moderates the effects of both X on M and M on Y (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The proposed conditional effect is specified like any mediation model (p1 • p2) but includes the product for testing the moderating effect of both X•W on M and M•W on Y. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hayes (2018)</ref> defined the following conditional effect equation for CoMe Model C:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ω = p1 • p2 + (p2 • p5 + p1 • p7)W + p5 • p7W 2 (3)</formula><p>In this equation, "p2 • p5 + p1 • p7" is the CoMe index (ω) for CoMe Model C. When this sum of the products is significant, the CoMe effect occurs; that is, the mediated effect of X on Y through M is moderated by W.</p><p>The fourth type of CoMe model, shown in CoMe Model D (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>), is similar to CoMe Model C. The only difference is that CoMe Model D has two distinct moderators influencing the mediated effect. Particularly, W moderates the effect of X on M, and Z moderates the effect of M on Y. Additionally, the proposed conditional effect is specified like any mediation model (p1 • p2) but includes both the product of X•W and M•Z in the models of the effect of X on Y through M <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hayes, 2018)</ref>.

In CoMe Model E, X moderates its own mediating effect on Y through M via the moderation of the effect of M on Y by X.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditional Mediation Analysis with (Multi)Categorical Moderators</head><p>When W is a categorical (or dichotomous) moderator (possibly transformed from a continuous variable 4,5 ), we can conduct an interaction analysis for a CoMe model if the research goal is to study the rate of change (or slope) of a relationship. These variables are usually dummy coded (i.e., 0 and 1), whereby 0 represents the reference category <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Henseler &amp; Fassott, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wooldridge, 2015)</ref>. For instance, suppose W is gender, then the researcher could use a variable with 0 for "Male" and 1 for "Female" (vice-versa). Meanwhile, when W is a dichotomous variable represented in the data with values that differ by one unit (e.g., W = 0 and W = 1), the CoMe index (ω) is the difference between the mediated effect of X on Y in the two groups. In referring to Equation 1 (the same applies similarly for equations 2-5), when W acts as a categorical moderator in the CoMe model, the indexes of "p2 • p5" will be tested as usual; that is, the two values of W chosen to code the two groups can be used in place of ω.</p><p>However, in many studies, W is multi-categorical, for example, (1) a control group versus two or more experimental conditions and (2) the positions on W could be three values on a continuous variable that are operationalized "high," "medium," and "low" on that variable. In such a scenario, the researcher should rely on the fact that CoMe effect differences can be estimated with a linear model by representing groups with a set of k-1 variable, where k is the number of groups that should be transformed into as many dummy variables as there are levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Henseler &amp; Fassott, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wooldridge, 2015)</ref>. For example, in the case of three groups suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hair et al. (2022)</ref> (e.g., for a service-type variable: short-term contract, long-term contract, and prepaid), researchers can split the moderator into two dummy variables, which are simultaneously included in the model. Particularly, both dummy variables would take the value of 0 for the reference category (e.g., prepaid). The other two categories would be indicated by the value 1 in the corresponding dummy variable: dummy 1 (prepaid: 0 vs. short-term contract: 1) and dummy 2 (prepaid: 0 vs. long-term contract: 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generating and Testing Interaction Terms in Conditional Mediation Analysis</head><p>To generate the interaction term, Becker et al. ( <ref type="formula">2018</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fassott et al. (2016)</ref> highlighted three potential procedures, namely, the product-indicator approach <ref type="bibr">(Chin et al., 2003)</ref>, the orthogonalizing approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lance, 1988)</ref>, and the two-stage approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Henseler &amp; Fassott, 2010)</ref>. The latter approach is more commonly considered as the more suitable one (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hair et al., 2022)</ref>. When interpreting the results of a moderation analysis, scholars are primarily interested in the significance of the interaction term. Suppose that the effect of the interaction term significantly moderates at least one path in the causal process linking X to Y via M. When the remaining unmoderated path is also significantly different from zero, the presence of a CoMe effect could exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Muller et al., 2005)</ref>. However, PLS-SEM researchers should conduct a formal test to assess the CoMe index (ω) because a mediated effect can be moderated even if one cannot show significant moderation of its causal process linking X to Y via M.</p><p>Importantly, before estimating these several types of CoMe models (Models A-E), approaches that gauge measurement error must be considered <ref type="bibr">(Hair &amp; Sarstedt, 2019)</ref>. Doing so is important to monitor the quality of the variables' measurement models, in consideration of either reflective (Mode A estimation) or formative (Mode B estimation) measurement modes. 6 Particularly, if a reflective measurement mode is used, researchers must ensure that the indicator loading has a value of at least 0.708 with an associated significant result <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hair et al., 2022)</ref>. Then, the measurements must be considered reliable (i.e., indicator reliability, Cronbach's alpha, and composite reliability) and valid (i.e., convergent validity and discriminant validity) to detect a CoMe effect (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hair et al., 2020)</ref>. Alternatively, if we have a formative measurement mode, convergent validity <ref type="bibr">(Cheah et al., 2018)</ref>, variance inflation factor <ref type="bibr">(Becker et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mason &amp; Perreault Jr, 1991)</ref>, and the statistical significance and relevance of the indicator weights must be monitored <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hair et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hair et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Once the properties of the measurement models for the constructs embedded in the CoMe model are validated (irrespective of whether reflective or formative), the researcher can then start to examine the CoMe index (ω) using the bootstrapping technique.</p><p>Particularly, to establish the presence of the CoMe index (ω), the researcher must observe 90 percent or 95 percent CI of index ω. 7 If the CoMe index (ω) is significantly different from zero (or statistically significant), researchers can conclude that the mediated effect of X on Y through M depends on W. This allows establishing a CoMe effect. Vice-versa, if the CoMe index (ω) is not statistically significant, the CoMe effect is not verified. Even though a mediated effect may exist, it does not depend on the level of the moderator. The lack of significance of the CoMe effects for low, medium, and high levels of the moderator means that the moderator cannot produce a differential effect. A higher level of the moderator leads to a similar effect as the lower level of the moderator. Therefore, PLS-SEM researchers should subsequently analyze the mediation and moderation separately because the results might be individually significant in explaining a mediated or interaction effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditional Mediation Analysis at Different Levels of the Moderator</head><p>Once the existence of a CoMe effect is supported by the CoMe index (ω), one may wish to investigate the mediated effect at representative levels (or values) of the moderator (depicted as the CoMe effect) to explore further the conditions under which mediation exists <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Preacher et al., 2007)</ref>. Specifically, researchers must determine how the moderator at different levels (or values) influences the mediated effect, which may be stronger, weaker, or opposite in sign.

To clarify these equations, we draw on explaining this for CoMe Model A. 8 In the initial step, the researcher must run bootstrapping for each path coefficient to obtain the bootstrap subsample result (i.e., 5,000 or 10,000 subsamples) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hair et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Streukens &amp; Leroi-Werelds, 2016a)</ref>. Then, the researcher can take the path coefficient from the interaction term to the mediator (p5) and multiply it by the SD values of W (the moderator), which represent low (mean-1 SD of the moderator), medium (mean of the moderator), and high (mean + 1 SD of the moderator) levels. 9 Next, the researcher must take these three values and multiply them by the path coefficient from the independent variable to the mediator (p1). Finally, the product of these values will be multiplied by the path coefficient from the mediator to the dependent variable (p2) to obtain CoMe effects for low, medium, and high levels of the moderator.</p><p>Conversely, if W is a (multi)categorical moderator, the researcher can follow the procedures by taking the path coefficient from the interaction term to the mediator (p5) and multiplying it by the SD values of W (similar to Models B-E).

Particularly, the researcher can use the simple slope or Johnson-Neyman's plot suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Preacher et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditional Mediation Analysis Using MGA</head><p>In most cases, where the moderator (W) is categorical and the goal is to understand the differences in the strength (magnitude) or directionality of mediated effects, an MGA can be used to understand the CoMe effect more comprehensively. Notably, the MGA can also be applied drawing on a continuous moderator if the aim is to test the differences in the strength (magnitude) or directionality of mediated effects. In this case, the continuous variable must be dichotomized, however. Once the observations are grouped, models are estimated separately for each group of observations. The differences in the mediated effects between the data groups are interpreted as CoMe effects. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">7</ref> depicts the CoMe effect based on comparing effects for two groups, in which the impact of W can be estimated using a nominal variable such as Group A versus Group B or high values versus low values of a particular moderator. Researchers are usually interested in analyzing group effects related to mediated relationships. More precisely, a population parameter p1•p2 is hypothesized to be different (d) across two subpopulations (i.e., p1 (1) •p2 (1) and p1 (2) •p2 ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) ), which are expressed by different modalities in the categorical moderating variable.</p><p>Additionally, an MGA enables the researcher to test for differences between identical models estimated for different groups. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Shrout and Bolger (2002)</ref>, a group comparison can be useful for analyzing mediated effects. For instance, a CoMe effect may occur when the mediated effect of one group is significantly stronger than or even different from that of another group. Such groups can, for example, relate to observable characteristics (e.g., gender) or refer to experimental conditions (e.g., high value of W versus low value of W). For instance, a researcher may assume that X influences Y indirectly through M, but the effect is stronger for men (or the high value of W) than for women (or the low value of W); alternatively, the effect is perhaps present only for men or women (or only for the high or low value of W) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hair et al., 2018)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> shows that full mediation exists in Group A: Male (or the high value of W), whereas it does not exist in Group B: Female (or the low value of W).</p><p>To test group effects in PLS-SEM, researchers must conduct a measurement invariance test to determine whether construct measurements are similarly suitable across groups or heterogeneous data <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Henseler et al., 2016)</ref>. 10 In other words, this test concerns the statistical property of an instrument, indicating that the same construct(s) are measured in the same way across subgroups of respondents. The reason for such differences may stem from (1) respondents embracing different cultural values who interpret a given measure in a conceptually different manner or gender, ethnic, or other individual differences that entail responding to instruments in systematically different ways, and (2) respondents who use the available options on a scale differently (or tendency to choose or not choose the extremes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hair et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Vandenberg &amp; Lance, 2000)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Henseler et al., 2009)</ref>, the non-parametric distance-based test <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Klesel et al., 2019)</ref>, the parametric test <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Keil et al., 2000)</ref>, or the Welch-Satterthwaite test <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Welch, 1947)</ref>. Drawing on these available MGA methods allows comparing a model across different groups to determine whether the strength (i.e., magnitude) of one or more relationships in the model is different between groupbased estimations and whether any differences are statistically significant. If the test does not support a significant difference in the mediated effect between groups, the researcher should reject the existence of a CoMe effect. In other words, if the CoMe effect is not significant in the MGA estimation, the PLS-SEM researcher should subsequently analyze mediation and moderation separately.</p><p>Before performing an MGA, the researcher should ensure that measurement invariance is achieved drawing on the measurement invariance of composite models (MICOM) procedure (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Henseler et al., 2016)</ref>. By establishing MICOM, the researcher can be assured that the group differences in the model estimates do not result from distinct content and meanings of measurements used for the latent variables across groups. Notably, conducting an MGA requires partial measurement invariance, which is given when configural and compositional invariance hold. If partial measurement invariance is confirmed and the composites have equal mean values that vary across the groups, full measurement invariance is confirmed, which supports the pooled data analysis. In contrast, if partial measurement invariance is not present, this absence can deflate the power of statistical testing, influence the accuracy of estimators, and provide misleading results in further analyses.</p><p>In the initial step, a significant difference must exist in the mediated effect for the groups by subtracting the mediated effect for Group A from that for Group B (i.e., d = p1 (A) •p2 (A) -p1 (B) •p2 (B) ). This procedure can be performed using the MGA estimation approach to determine whether the mediated effect is significantly different, noting that the CoMe effect is present <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Ryu &amp; Cheong, 2017)</ref>. A p-value smaller than 0.05 suggests that the difference d between the group-specific mediated effect is present. 11 Thus the researcher can continue with comparing the mediated effects for each of the two groups (comparing the β values of the mediated effect for Group A and Group B).</p><p>The comparison of the mediated effect for the two groups can be generated using any of the MGA techniques that we mentioned earlier (i.e., the permutation test, the non-parametric distance-based test, etc.). For example, if the mediated effect for the group with male individuals is large and significant (CI 90 percent of the mediated effects exclude zero), whereas it is small and significant (CI 90 percent of the mediated effects exclude zero) for the group with female individuals, one would then conclude that the mediated effect is significantly stronger (i.e., the magnitude of the relationship is greater) in the male group than in the female group. Alternatively, if the mediated effect for the group with male individuals is significant (CI 90 percent of the mediated effects exclude zero), but it is not significant for the group with female individuals, one would infer that the mediated effect only occurs in the male group but not in the female group. In other words, this approach allows the researcher to compare group differences in terms of the obtained significant mediated effect values. Finally, PLS-SEM researchers can compare the type of mediated effect such as full mediation versus partial mediation (complementary or competitive) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Nitzl et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of Differences in Direct Effects to Determine the Type of Conditional Mediation Model</head><p>CoMe analysis that draws on the interaction term approach (as per Sections 3.1-3.4) to examine hypotheses that concern the rate of change (i.e., slope) is based on an a priori specified type of CoMe model. However, the type of CoMe model must be determined a posteriori when conducting MGA to assess hypotheses that concern differences in the strength (i.e., magnitude) of relationships. Hence and as per Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, it is necessary to identify whether a CoMe Model is of the A, B, or C type, when carrying out MGA, in which the researcher analyzes whether p1•p2 in Group 1 is different from that in Group 2. Based on the results and the presence of a significant difference in the two groups' mediated effects, the researcher can now observe whether p1 is also significantly different between groups 1 and 2; thus, the researcher will find a Model A type CoMe. If only p2 is significantly different, the researcher will find a Model B type CoMe. Lastly, if both p1 and p2 are significantly different, the result will indicate that the researcher has a Model C type CoMe, where a particular categorical variable moderates both paths.</p></div>

In illustrating their application, we also refer to detailed step-by-step procedures for implementation in a PLS-SEM setting and outline these procedures in corresponding appendices to this paper.</p><p>The illustrative example of a CoMe model was extracted from the research model of <ref type="bibr">Cheah et al. (2020b)</ref>. The data were collected from 400 consumers who had experienced purchasing luxury products from a luxury retail store. The four main variables were modeled as composites: behavioral intention (BI), price image (PI), perceived value (PV), and sugrophobia (SUGRO). 12 BI was established as a composite estimated in Mode B, whereas PI, PV, and SUGRO were designed as a composite estimated in Mode A. Although their measurement models and their respective measurement modes were theoretically substantiated, to assess potential for any misspecification in measurement mode, confirmatory tetrad analysis (CTA-PLS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gudergan et al. 2008</ref>) was used (see Appendix A). The CTA-PLS assessment for PI, PV, and SUGRO revealed that all tetrads vanished, providing support for the employed reflective measurement mode. Conversely, the CTA-PLS assessment showed that several tetrads failed to vanish for BI, implying that its measurement mode is indeed not reflective but rather formative. Importantly, the evaluation of the measurement models by using standard evaluation criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hair et al., 2022)</ref> supports the measures' reliability and validity. This also holds for discriminant validity assessment using <ref type="bibr">Henseler et al.'s (2015)</ref> heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) criterion. Moreover, prior study has analyzed how PV positively mediates the relationship between PI and BI. In addition, SUGRO is posited to negatively moderate the link between PI and PV (see <ref type="bibr">Cheah et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the abovementioned, we extend past findings by illustrating the CoMe analysis for three types of CoMe models (Models A, B, and C) and for two types of moderators, either using a continuous moderator or a categorical moderator that has been transformed from a continuous one. 13 In regard to our empirical illustrations that draw on the transformation of a continuous moderator to a categorical moderator for CoMe analysis, we reiterate that researchers ought to be cautious in doing so because this transformation can produce a reduction in prediction power. Therefore, unless the researcher seeks to present findings in a particular way that serve a particular purpose (e.g., presentation of findings to a managerial audience to ease comprehension of actionable insights), or encounters data characterized by irregular or nonnormal distributions or outliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(DeCoster et al., 2009)</ref>, estimations drawing on such transformed data ought to be avoided. Thus, the illustrations of the CoMe analysis for the three types of CoMe models (Models A, B, and C) with the transformation of the moderator (SUGRO) to a categorical variable serve merely as empirical illustrations on how to establish both the CoMe index (ω) and CoMe effects (see Section 4.1) 14 when explicitly desired by the researcher.</p><p>In drawing on the abovementioned research model of <ref type="bibr">Cheah et al. (2020b)</ref>, we first illustrate the CoMe analysis in a PLS-SEM setting to assess the rate of change (i.e., slope) in the mediated relationship(s) and focus on the following hypothesis: The indirect effect of the consumer's PI on his or her BI via PV decreases as SUGRO increases. Therefore, in Section 4.1, we illustrate CoMe analysis drawing on the interaction term approach to assess the conditional mediated relationship(s). Then, we demonstrate the CoMe analysis in a PLS-SEM setting to examine differences in strength (i.e., magnitude) in the conditional mediated relationship(s) and consider the following hypothesis: The indirect effect between PI and BI via PV is more pronounced for the group of female consumers than for the group of male consumers. In doing so, we outline in Section 4.2 CoMe analysis employing the MGA approach. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditional Mediation Analysis-Interaction Term Approach Conditional Mediation Analysis Model A-Continuous and Categorical Moderator</head><p>For CoMe Model A, 15 we focus on testing the influence of the moderator (SUGRO) on the mediated effect (p1 • p2) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">9</ref>). We first assess the CoMe index (ω), which is derived from the following equation: <ref type="formula">1</ref>). Based on the estimation (Appendix B(i); see Figure <ref type="figure">B1, Panels A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>), the result shows that "p2 • p5" (or PI*SUGRO -&gt; PV -&gt; BI) for the use of the continuous moderator is supported, as the CI excludes zero (90 percent CI: -0.065 to -0.010). Similarly, the estimation (Appendix B(ii); see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">B7, Panels A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>) also shows that the result of "p2 • p5" (or PI*SUGRO -&gt; PV -&gt; BI) for the use of the categorical moderator is supported, as the CI excludes zero (90 percent CI: -0.093 to -0.004). Since the index "p2 • p5" of SUGRO is significant for both the continuous (β = -0.037) and categorical (β = -0.049) variable uses, we can conclude that the mediated effect of PI on BI through PV negatively depends on the moderator SUGRO (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">ω = p1 • p2 + p2 • p5 • SUGRO (Equation</formula><p>Then, we investigate the mediated effects at different levels of the moderator <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Preacher et al., 2007)</ref> for both continuous and categorical moderators. Following the procedures derived from our guidelines (see Appendix B(i)), we initially assess the SD of the moderator (SUGRO) when using the continuous moderator, as it will denote that the moderator is one SD below and one SD above the mean. 16 To estimate the CoMe effects for low, medium, and high levels of the moderator, we use equations 6-8 for CoMe Model A (see Appendix B(i), Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">B2-B5</ref> for the details of the analysis). Results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> show that the path coefficients for the CoMe effects become weaker when the SUGRO effect is one SD above the mean. Additionally, the CoMe effects for low, medium, and high levels of the moderator are significant because both extremes of the CI are positive. For the use of the categorical moderator, we illustrate this for the comparison between the low value (0) and the high value (1) (see Appendix B(ii), Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">B8-B11</ref> for the details of the analysis). Moreover, the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> show that the path coefficient for the CoMe effect for high SUGRO (β = 0.130) is weaker than for low SUGRO (β = 0.178), and both CoMe effects are significant because both the extremes of the CI are positive. Therefore, we find some evidence supporting the hypothesis in CoMe Model A for both the categorical and continuous moderator use. That is, the indirect effect of PI on BI via PV decreases due to the negative impact of SUGRO (to corroborate this finding, also see Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref> that depicts the results using the Johnson-Neyman plot and simple slope for both the continuous and categorical moderators). 17</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditional Mediation Analysis Model B-Continuous and Categorical Moderator</head><p>For CoMe Model B, we focus on testing the influence of the moderator (SUGRO) on the mediated effect (p1 • p2) (Figure <ref type="figure">11</ref>).

Based on our estimations (see Appendix C(i); Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">C4</ref>), the results show that "p1 • p5" for the use of the continuous moderator is not supported, as the CI does include zero (90 percent CI: -0.044 to 0.002).

The index "p1 • p5" of SUGRO is significant for the categorical moderator (β = -0.078); therefore, we can conclude that the mediated effect of PI on BI through PV decreases as the moderator SUGRO increases, but not when estimating with the continuous moderator (β = -0.021) (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). 18 Then, we investigate the mediated effects at different levels of the moderator <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Preacher et al., 2007)</ref> for both the use of continuous and categorical moderators.

To estimate the CoMe effects for low, medium, and high moderator levels, we use equations 9-11 for CoMe Model B (to conduct the analysis, also see Appendix C(i), Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">C5-C7</ref>). Results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> show that the path coefficients of the CoMe effect become weaker when the SUGRO effect is one SD above the mean. 19 Additionally, the CoMe effects for low, medium, and high moderator levels are significant because both extremes of the CI are positive. However, we could not reveal whether a CoMe effect exists for the use of a continuous moderator because of the insignificant result of the CoMe index (ω). Meanwhile, the use as categorical moderator concerns the comparison between the low value (0) and the high value (1) (for the analysis, also see Appendix C(ii), Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">C12-C14</ref>). Results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> show that the path coefficients of the CoMe effect for high SUGRO (β = 0.134) are weaker than for low SUGRO (β = 0.212), and both CoMe effects are significant because both extremes of the CI are positive. Therefore, we find some evidence supporting the hypothesis included in CoMe Model B for the use of the categorical moderator only; that is, the mediated effect of PI on BI via PV reduces as SUGRO increases (to corroborate this finding, also see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">12</ref> that depicts the results using the simple slope for categorical moderator).</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ω = p1 •p2 + p1 •p5• SUGRO (Equation</formula></div>

Based on our estimations (see Appendix D(i); Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">D4</ref>), the results show that "p2 •p5• + p1 •p7" for the continuous moderator is supported, as the CI does not include zero (90 percent CI: -0.057 to -0.013).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditional Mediation Analysis-MGA Approach Using Categorical Moderator</head><p>In this section, we continue drawing on the data from <ref type="bibr">Cheah et al. (2020)</ref> to illustrate the use of MGA in CoMe analysis, especially when the moderator is categorical and the research aim is testing the difference in strength (magnitude) between mediated effects. Hence, we re-estimate the model by replacing SUGRO with gender as the categorical moderator. 23  As outlined above, the three constructs (PI and PV) are modeled as composites and estimated in Mode A, while BI is modeled as a composite and estimated in Mode B. Additionally, since gender is used as a potential moderator, the total of 400 consumers sample is split into two groups: female (n = 206) and male consumers (n = 194) (Figure <ref type="figure">15,</ref><ref type="figure">Panel A</ref>).</p><p>In this illustration, we evaluate whether the mediated effect of p1•p2 for the female group is significantly different from that for the male group. 24 The equation for this significant difference is d = p1 (Female) • p2 (Female) -p1 (Male) • p2 (Male) . Thus, an MGA is carried out. After following the MICOM procedure and concluding that partial measurement invariance is established, we apply a permutation-based test <ref type="bibr">(Chin &amp; Dibbern, 2010)</ref>, representing the most powerful nonparametric MGA testing approach <ref type="bibr">(Klessel et al., 2021)</ref>. 25  The permutation-based test shows how the difference in mediated effects between the female and male groups is significantly different from zero (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). Therefore, the mediated effect of PI on BI through PV is conditional on gender as the moderator. Although we observe partial mediation in both groups (see the results in Figure <ref type="figure">15</ref>, Panel B and Table <ref type="table">4</ref>), the mediated effect is significantly higher for the female group (β = 0.249) than for the male group (β = 0.113). 26 Therefore, we find support for a significant CoMe effect. 27 Finally, given that the study shows a significant difference only between p1 (Female) and p1 (Male) , the model described here corresponds to a CoMe Model A (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary and Conclusions</head><p>CoMe analysis often opens up new avenues for analyzing new research questions. Such modeling provides deeper insights into the intricacies of processes or under which conditions they occur, which is not the case when mediation and moderation are tested independently. However, the use and application of CoMe analysis in PLS-SEM have been scarce and, in many cases, vague in their explanation. One reason could be the lack of experience and knowledge to handle such complexities in a PLS-SEM setting, especially when the estimation procedure is not straightforward. With these issues in mind, this paper illuminates conceptual fundamentals and develops guidelines for CoMe analysis within the PLS-SEM context. In doing so, clear distinction between the different types of CoMe models (i.e., Models A-E) is made. Furthermore, the paper outlines the illustrative use of CoMe analysis in PLS-SEM and presents detailed step-by-step procedures to estimate and assess CoMe effects in the PLS-SEM setting (as per corresponding appendices). In doing so, we explain how to estimate the CoMe index (ω), and illustrate the applications of CoMe analysis in PLS-SEM for the most prominent CoMe models (i.e., Models A, B, and C). Such detailed illustrations will increase researchers' awareness of the procedures for and serve as a guide for estimating and interpreting CoMe results in PLS-SEM use. Thus, this paper responds to the recent claim by <ref type="bibr">Sarstedt et al. (2020a)</ref> about the unnecessity of using PLS-SEM and PROCESS in tandem.</p><p>To recap the utility of conducting CoMe analysis in PLS-SEM, we provide three concluding recommendations concerning model specification, causal inferences, and issues regarding sample size. Although some of these recommendations apply to all research areas, they are particularly crucial for proficiently conducting CoMe analysis. First, a clear and robust theoretical basis must be established for any CoMe model (i.e., first-, second-, or first-and second-stage moderation) <ref type="bibr">(Borau et al., 2015)</ref>. Holland et al. ( <ref type="formula">2017</ref>) have stressed the importance of theoretical rigor to substantiate the correct CoMe model and whether hypothesized arguments concern the rate of change (i.e., slope) or differences in the strength (i.e., magnitude) of mediated relationships that are conditional. The guidelines and procedures provided here, regardless of how robust and effective they are, in no way undermine the central importance of a theoretical foundation on which a CoMe model ought to rest. In other words, each moderated path in a mediation model must be founded and rooted clearly in a theoretical framework (see <ref type="bibr">Holland et al., 2017)</ref>. The same logic applies when multiple or serial mediation relationships are moderated in a model: each moderation must be justified. Hence, the approach to conducting CoMe analysis rests on sound theoretical substantiation and suitable data from a fitting research design.</p><p>Second, CoMe analysis implies sequential causation, which may occur simultaneously but can also happen over time, where changes in some variables affect changes in other variables over various points in time <ref type="bibr">(Holland et al., 2017)</ref>. Therefore, drawing on data from experimental and longitudinal research designs is often appropriate (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mathieu et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Roemer, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Stone-Romero &amp; Rosopa, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Streukens &amp; Leroi-Werelds, 2016b)</ref>. However, this does not render the use of data from cross-sectional research designs useless when conducting CoMe analysis. Despite the limitations of such research designs (i.e., omitted variable problems that can cause spurious relationships), CoMe analysis resting on such research designs still allows drawing inferences about the direct and mediated effects and differences in the rate of change (i.e., slope) or in the strength (i.e., magnitude) in relationships produced by moderation.</p><p>Thus, one might use the approach provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hult et al. (2018)</ref> to assess and control endogeneity, particularly in the case of omitted variables <ref type="bibr">(Sarstedt et al., 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Spector, 2019)</ref>, to conclude a causal effect from the CoMe effect estimation in PLS-SEM. Furthermore, when theoretical reasoning requires constructs being measured at certain points in time, such should be considered in a cross-sectional research design underlying the data when conducting CoMe analysis.</p><p>Third, when researchers seek to conduct MGA to detect CoMe effects, sufficient statistical power must be given to avoid type II errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Dawson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hayes, 2017)</ref>. Researchers must ensure that the split samples for each group have close to equal and sufficient sample sizes to achieve sufficient statistical power <ref type="bibr">(Aguinis et al., 2017)</ref>. Likewise, if researchers choose to work with categorial data that are transformed from continuous one, all CoMe analyses ought to be based on sufficient statistical power to warrant producing consequential results. They can rely on power analyses that consider the model structure, the anticipated significance level, and the expected effect sizes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Marcoulides &amp; Chin, 2013)</ref>. Alternatively, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hair et al. (2022)</ref> have provided power tables that indicate the required sample sizes for various measurement and structural model constellations. <ref type="bibr">Finally, Kock and Hadaya (2018)</ref> suggested the inverse square root method and the gamma exponential method as two new approaches for minimum sample size calculations assess whether sufficient statistical power exists.</p><p>Overall, we hope this paper, together with the detail provided in the appendices, will increase the number of studies applying CoMe analysis in PLS-SEM proficiently. Although our paper offers guidance for carrying out CoMe analysis in PLS-SEM, future research should seek to extend the detail provided here. For example, researchers could examine CoMe analysis for different types of CoMe models such as CoMe Model D or CoMe Model E that we had excluded in this paper but also others such as one in which two exogenous moderators (rather than one) simultaneously condition either the first-stage or second-stage of the mediated relationship.</p><p>Additionally, researchers could explore the efficacy of the PLS algorithm when estimating the CoMe effect against other composite-based SEM methods, such as consistent PLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dijkstra &amp; Henseler, 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">2015b)</ref>, generalized structured component analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hwang et al., 2010)</ref>, and regularized canonical correlation analysis <ref type="bibr">(Tenenhaus &amp; Tenenhaus, 2011)</ref>, with the adaptation of sampling weight adjustments in PLS-SEM <ref type="bibr">(Becker &amp; Ismail, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cheah et al., 2020a)</ref>. Moreover, researchers could explore consideration of more complex CoMe research frameworks, such as how a moderator influences parallel or serial mediating models simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hayes, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, a further interesting direction for future research is to examine how best to incorporate CoMe analyses into repeated-measures designs (experimental designs) given that repeated-measures data allow scholars to target statistical inference at between-subject and within-subject sources of variation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Curran &amp; Bauer, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Streukens &amp; Leroi-Werelds, 2016b)</ref>. Similarly, assessments of CoMe models that involve intricate research designs, such as multilevel modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hwang et al., 2007)</ref> and longitudinal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Roemer, 2016)</ref>, although in their early stages of development, require further advancement within the PLS-SEM context, in general, and when assessing CoMe models, in particular. Also, whereas the approaches to CoMe analysis presented and outlined in this paper concern a priori, theoretically derived determination of CoMe models and considerations of whether moderations concern the rate of change (i.e., slope) versus differences in the strength (i.e., magnitude) of mediated relationships, the guidance presented here can be Notes 1 The illustrative uses of the CoMe index (ω) for CoMe Model A, CoMe Model and CoMe Model C are explained in Section 4.1. As for the CoMe index (ω) for CoMe Model D and CoMe Model E, the present study does not illustrate the empirical procedures but researchers could refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hayes (2015)</ref> or contact the corresponding author. 2 A "conditional direct effect" occurs when the direct effect of X on Y estimates how differences in X relate to differences in Y holding constant the proposed mediator <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hayes, 2017)</ref>. In other words, the conditional direct effect quantifies the effect of X on Y independent of the mediator but conditioned on a value of a moderator. 3 To obtain the bootstrap confidence intervals, in line with Aguirre-Urreta and Rönkkö (2018), "researchers should generally use the percentile method. However, when the reliability coefficient's bootstrap distribution is skewed, the bias corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap interval method" should be used (p. 9). 4 If using existing data-especially continuous ones-that do not align with requirements of the analysis goal (i.e., researchers may have hypothesized that the first-and/or second-stage paths in a mediated relationship differ in terms of strengths/magnitude or directionality), researchers could subsequently transform their data into categorical data to test the CoMe effect. 5 Researchers need to be very cautious when converting continuous variables to categorical variables (also known as artificially dichotomizing) for testing a CoMe model. Doing so can reduce the statistical power to detect a CoMe effect and can produce a downward bias in the size of estimated CoMe effects <ref type="bibr">(Aguinis et al., 2017)</ref>. Additionally, some researchers also throw up theoretical questions about what particular dividing points (i.e., mean, median, and percentile) should be used <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hayes &amp; Preacher, 2014)</ref>. Hence, researchers expanded to also incorporate exploratory approaches that draw on the assessment of unobserved heterogeneity. For instance, approaches such as FIMIX-PLS in combination with, for example, PLS-POS, PLS-GAS, or PLS-IRRS (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ratzmann, Gudergan, &amp; Bouncken, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Sarstedt, Ringle, &amp; Gudergan, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sarstedt, Ringle, &amp; Hair, 2017)</ref> can be applied in a CoMe analysis context, especially when assessing differences in the strength (i.e., magnitude) of certain paths.</p><p>Finally, although we advocate rigorous theoretical substantiation for any CoMe model, another direction for future research concerns developing approaches for model selection among different CoMe model types (e.g., Models A-B). Such advances can build on using the effectiveness of various quality criteria available in PLS-SEM, such as the model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dijkstra &amp; Henseler, 2015a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, 2015b)</ref>, PLS_predict <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Shmueli et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Shmueli et al., 2019)</ref>, cross-validated predictive ability testing <ref type="bibr">(Liengaard et al., 2020)</ref>, and model selection criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Danks et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Sharma et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>ought to exercise caution unless converting a continuous variable to a categorical variable has strong underlying reasoning and justification. Despite these well-known problems, dichotomizing from a continuous variable is frequently used by experimental consumer researchers. Furthermore, some of the benefits surrounding the continued use of dichotomization are: (1) it produces meaningful findings that are easy to understand for a wider, possibly less technically knowable, audience (i.e., practitioners), and (2) it allows dealing with irregular or nonnormal distributions, or the presence of outliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(DeCoster et al., 2009)</ref>. 6 By default, the estimation of reflectively specified constructs draws on Mode A, whereas PLS-SEM uses Mode B for formatively specified constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hair et al., 2022)</ref>. When using Mode A (i.e., correlation weights), the bivariate correlation between each indicator and the construct determine the outer weights. In contrast, Mode B (i.e., regression weights) computes indicator weights by regressing each construct on its associated indicators. 7 To test the significant of ω, the 95% percentile is often used for testing a two-sided hypothesis, in which the t-value must be greater than 1.96. However, if researchers are interested in testing a one-sided hypothesis, they can use the 90% percentile <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kock, 2015)</ref>. 8 To obtain further clarification of these equations for CoMe Models B-E in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, researchers can contact the corresponding author. 9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hair et al. (2022)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Henseler and Fassot (2010)</ref> pointed out that when estimating a basic moderating effect, often researchers encounter the collinearity problem, especially when creating the interaction term from an exogenous construct and moderator. Thus, they typically standardize the indicators of the moderator before creating the interaction term. The standardization converts each variable to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which reduces collinearity introduced by indicator reuse. Furthermore, this standardization procedure helps facilitate the interpretation of the moderating effect. Based on these reasons, ±1 SD is used in estimating the CoMe effect. However, researchers can easily adopt the ±2 SD or ±3 SD because using a wider interval of SD will help researchers show how the data are scattered. 10 Before performing an MGA, the researcher should ensure that measurement invariance is achieved drawing on the measurement invariance of composite models (MICOM) procedure (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Henseler et al., 2016)</ref>. By establishing MICOM, the researcher can be assured that the group differences in the model estimates do not result from distinct content and meanings of measurements used for the latent variables across groups. Notably, conducting an MGA requires partial measurement invariance, which is given when configural and compositional invariance hold. If partial measurement invariance is confirmed and the composites have equal mean values that vary across the groups, full measurement invariance is confirmed, which supports the pooled data analysis. In contrast, if partial measurement invariance is not present, this absence can deflate the power of statistical testing, influence the accuracy of estimators, and provide misleading results in further analyses. 11 To test the significant difference in the mediated effect, the 95% percentile is often used for testing a two-sided hypothesis, in which the t-value must be greater than 1.96. For instance, the CoMe effect of A on B via M will be different in groups 1 and 2. However, if researchers are interested in testing a one-sided hypothesis, they can use the 90% percentile. For instance, the CoMe effect of A on B via M will be higher in group 1 than in group 2. Furthermore, if researchers are interested in examining the differences in the mediated effect of more than two groups, either Bonferroni correction or the Šidák procedure are the standard approach for controlling for the familywise error rate <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2018, p. 282)</ref>. 12 The term "sugrophobia" indicates consumers' fear of being taken advantage of, duped, and exploited by salespeople, especially when they are less savvy or experienced regarding a purchase <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Vohs et al., 2007)</ref>. Consumers experience sugrophobia when they are concerned about whether the salespeople judge them as less savvy or less experienced about a purchase. Moreover, consumers who are highly sugrophobic may show signs of paranoia and distrust in uncertainty during the purchasing, thus the effect could weaken the decision-making process from price image to behavioral intention <ref type="bibr">(Cheah et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Babin et al., 2016)</ref>. 13 For the transformation of continuous data, we used the median split. Additionally, we have conducted a mean split, and the estimated CoMe results for Models A-C are similar to the median split (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). 14 The descriptions of the procedures employed to assess the CoMe index (ω) and CoMe effects for CoMe Model A, CoMe Model B, and CoMe Model C (using Excel) are available from the corresponding author (or see Online Supplement OS.1). 15 The interaction effect (PI × SUGRO) was computed by applying the two-stage approach <ref type="bibr">(Becker et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Bootstrapping based on 10,000 subsamples was used to test the significance of the parameters. The hypothesized effects were assessed by applying a one-tailed test for a tdistribution (90% CI). 16 The standard deviation of SUGRO is 1.0013. 17 If a continuous moderator is used in determining the different level of the CoMe effect, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Preacher et al. (2007)</ref> suggest to use the Johnson-Neyman's plot rather than the simple slope that we use for a categorical moderator. Often, it is interpreted by examining the middle line (black color) and the upper and lower bound values. The middle line represents the mediated effect, in which the top point of the middle line represents a low conditional mediated effect and the bottom point of the middle line represents a high conditional mediated effect. Looking at Figure <ref type="figure">10 (Panel A</ref>), the mediated effect becomes weaker based on the conditional effect of SUGRO. If a categorical moderator is used in determining the CoMe effect, one can use the simple slope suggested by <ref type="bibr">Preacher et al. (2017)</ref>, in which the researcher can compare the direction and steepness (or gradient) of the CoMe effects for low and high values of the moderator (in our case this is Low Sugro and High Sugro) (see Figure <ref type="figure">10,</ref><ref type="figure">Panel B</ref>). 18 If the CoMe index (ω) is nonsignificant, researchers should stop assessing the CoMe effects for different levels of the moderator; rather, they should analyze moderation and mediation separately (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). In our case, we continue with the empirical illustration by showing the steps on how to obtain the results of the CoMe effects for different levels of the moderator. 19 The standard deviation of SUGRO is 1.0011. 20 When the analysis aims to examine differences in the strength (magnitude) of the mediated effects, the researcher could transform the data into categorical data for CoMe Model C and perform an MGA test. For the details of the steps for doing this, researchers can refer to Section 4.2. 21 The standard deviation of SUGRO is 1.0012. 22 For further explanations on in-sample and out-of-sample predictions, please refer to <ref type="bibr">Chin et al. (2020)</ref>. 23 Many empirical studies have demonstrated differences between men and women's behavior on their information processing and purchase decision-making, such as in social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Pivec &amp; Maček, 2019)</ref>, consumer purchase behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Lim et al., 2021)</ref>, and in other m-commerce settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Faqih &amp; Jaradat, 2015)</ref>. Therefore, examining gender as the potential moderator variable for any mediated effect is warranted. 24 See Appendix E.</p></div>

If the CI for the product "does not include a 0 value, this result means that the mediated effects at different levels of the moderator are significantly different from 0." In our example, the CoMe effects for low Sugro and high Sugro are significant because both extremes of the CI are positive.

In our case, given that our hypothesis postulates a direction, we use a one-sided test, and we estimate a 90% CI (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">D4</ref>).

Therefore, we do find evidence to support the hypothesis of CoMe Model C; that is, the mediated effect of a consumer's PI on BI via PV reduces as SUGRO increases, even though "p1 • p7" is insignificant. Next, we will continue to examine the mediated effects at different levels of the moderator.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B(i). Step-by-Step Procedure for Conditional Mediation Analysis of CoMe Model A Using a Continuous Moderator</head><p>To obtain the index of "p2 • p5", this result can be directly obtained from any type of PLS-SEM software (e.g., SmartPLS). Specifically, the researcher needs to estimate the path coefficients using the bootstrapping output of the specific mediated effect. After the convergence of the bootstrapping result, the researcher needs to examine the significance of "PI*SUGRO -&gt; PV -&gt; BI" from the specific mediated effect output (see Figure <ref type="figure">B1</ref>, Panel A and Panel B). Next, we examine the mediated effect at different levels of the moderator. To formally test this for CoMe Model A, we initially assess the standard deviation of the moderator (SUGRO), as it will denote that the moderator is one standard deviation below and one standard deviation above the mean. The standard deviation for SUGRO is 1.0013. This standard deviation value can be obtained, for example, via the SPSS software or the use of an Excel spreadsheet. Subsequently, using a spreadsheet application (i.e., MS Excel), we suggest carrying out the following steps:</p><p>1) Take the 10,000 path coefficients from all direct effects created by the bootstrap sampling and copy and paste them into a spreadsheet (see Figure <ref type="figure">B2</ref>). 5) Finally, the researcher can create a graphical plot of the mediated effects at different levels of the moderator by using the proposed Excel template (see <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/cortrudolph/Conditional_Indirect_Effects">https://github.com/cortrudolph/Conditional_Indirect_Effects</ref> or <ref type="url" target="http://www.md2c.nl/">http://www.md2c.nl/</ref>). Once the researcher has inserted this result (see Figure <ref type="figure">B6</ref>), he or she can easily produce the graphical plot (see Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref> in the main body of this paper).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B(ii). Step-by-Step Procedure for Conditional Mediation Analysis of CoMe Model A When Moderator Is Converted from Continuous to Categorical</head><p>To obtain the index of "p2 • p5", this result can be directly obtained from any type of PLS-SEM software even when continuous data has been transformed to categorical data via median split. Specifically, the researcher needs to estimate the path coefficients using the bootstrapping output of the specific mediated effect. After the convergence of the bootstrapping result, the researcher needs to examine the significance of "PI*SUGRO -&gt; PV -&gt; BI" from the specific mediated effect output (see Figure <ref type="figure">B7</ref>, Panel A and Panel B). Next, we examine the mediated effects at different levels of the moderator. To formally test this effect for CoMe Model A, a researcher must be aware that there is no CoMe effects at low, medium, and high levels of the moderator as specified in the main body of the paper (see equations 6 to 8); rather, it requires them to insert the value of low SUGRO as 0 and high SUGRO as 1 into the formula of CoMe effects of Model A. Subsequently, using a spreadsheet application (i.e., MS Excel), we suggest carrying out the following steps:</p><p>1) Take the 10,000 path coefficients from all direct effects created by the bootstrap sampling and copy and paste them into a spreadsheet (see Figure <ref type="figure">B8</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix C(i): Step-by-Step Procedure for Conditional Mediation Analysis (CoMe Model B) Using a Continuous Moderator</head><p>Given that the index of "p1 • p5" cannot be directly obtained from any type of PLS-SEM software (e.g., SmartPLS), we need to examine the results of the path coefficients using the output of the bootstrapping sample. Consequently, once we run the estimations, we next a bootstrapping procedure with 10,000 subsamples. Then, using a spreadsheet and multiplying the bootstrapping outputs (i.e., p1 • p5), we calculate the percentile bootstrap CI for the index of "p1 • p5". Thus, using a spreadsheet application (i.e., MS Excel), we suggest carrying out the following steps:</p><p>1) Take the 10,000 path coefficients from all direct effects created by the bootstrap procedure and copy and paste them into a spreadsheet (Figure <ref type="figure">C1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure C1. Step 1 Illustrative Example for Use of Continuous Moderator (CoMe Model B)</head><p>2) Create a new column for the index of "p1 • p5" under assessment, and calculate the product of "p1 • p5" (see Figure <ref type="figure">C2</ref>). Given that the index of "p1 • p5" cannot be directly obtained from any type of PLS-SEM software, we need to examine the results of the path coefficients using the output of the bootstrapping sample, even when continuous data been transformed to categorical data via median split. Consequently, once we estimate the model, we next perform a bootstrapping procedure with 10,000 subsamples.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix D(i).</head><p>Step-by-Step Procedure for Conditional Mediation Analysis (CoMe Model C) for continuous moderator</p><p>Given that the index of "p2 • p5" can be obtained except for "p1 • p7", we decided to examine the results of the path coefficients using the output of the bootstrapping sample. Consequently, once estimate the model, we next perform a bootstrapping procedure with 10,000 subsamples. Then, using a spreadsheet and multiplying the bootstrapping outputs, we calculate the percentile bootstrap CI for the index of "p2 • p5" and "p1 • p7". Subsequently, we estimate the index of CoMe Model C by estimating the sum of both index of "p2 • p5" and "p1 • p7". Thus, using an excel spreadsheet, we suggest carrying out the following steps:</p><p>1) Take the 10,000 path coefficients from all direct effects created by the bootstrap procedure and copy and paste them into a spreadsheet (Figure <ref type="figure">D1</ref>). 2) Create a column for both the index of "p2 • p5", "p1 • p7", and "p2 • p5 + p1 • p7" as well as calculate the product of the paths that form the index under assessment (see Figure <ref type="figure">D2</ref>). 3) Calculate the original values (O) to obtain the index value of "p2 • p5", "p1 • p7", and "p2 • p5 + p1 • p7" (see Figure <ref type="figure">D3</ref>). Given that the index of "p2 • p5" can be obtained except for "p1 • p7", we decided to examine the results of the path coefficients using the output of the bootstrapping sample. Consequently, once we estimate the model, we next perform a bootstrapping procedure with 10,000 subsamples. Then, using a spreadsheet and multiplying the bootstrapping outputs, we calculate the percentile bootstrap CI for the index of "p2 • p5" and "p1 • p7". Subsequently, we estimate the index of CoMe Model C by estimating the sum of both index of "p2 • p5" and "p1 • p7". Thus, using an Excel spreadsheet, we suggest carrying out the following steps:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix D(ii</head><p>1) Take the 10,000 path coefficients from all direct effects created by the bootstrap procedure and copy and paste them into a spreadsheet (Figure <ref type="figure">D11</ref>). 2) Create a new column for both the index of "p2 • p5", "p1 • p7", and "p2 • p5 + p1 • p7" as well as calculate the product of the paths that form the index under assessment (see Figure <ref type="figure">D12</ref>).  ). The results show that the path coefficient effects of the CoMe effects become weaker for high Sugro than for low Sugro. Subsequently, estimate the percentile bootstrap confidence interval (CI) using the function PERCENTILE (range, k), where k is the percentile value between 0 and 1 (see Figure <ref type="figure">D15</ref>). If the CI for the product "does not include a 0 value, this result means that the mediated effects at different levels of the moderator are significantly different from 0." In our example, the CoMe effects for low Sugro and high Sugro are significant because both extremes of the CI are positive. Therefore, we find some evidence to support the hypothesis of Model C; that is, the mediated effect of the consumer's PI on BI via PV reduces as SUGRO increases.</p><p>Appendix Based on Appendix E, the results show that all composite constructs have significant differences in terms of the composite mean values and variances ratio because the results fall outside the upper and lower bounds of 95% confidence interval. Partial measurement invariance is thus established for the female and male groups (see last column in above table). It can be surmised that the different model estimations for the female and male groups are not distinct in terms of content or meaning of the constructs.</p></div>			</div>
