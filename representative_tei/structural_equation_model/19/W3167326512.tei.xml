<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper investigates female shoppers' attitude and purchase intention towards green cosmetics. Underpinned with an extended theory of planned behaviour model, the research framework examines consumers' attitude and purchase intention. In addition, the moderating influence of consumer involvement is tested. Data (n = 408) were collected from South Africa and analysed through structural equation modelling. The results show that subjective norm has a significant positive impact on the consumers' purchase intention for green cosmetics. Also, ecological motive and environmental knowledge impact the consumers' attitude towards green cosmetics. In addition, consumers' involvement strengthens the positive relationship between attitude and purchase intention. However, the role of perceived behavioural control and health consciousness were non-significant. The findings suggest that practitioners should try to enhance the consumers' knowledge and involvement about green cosmetics. They should inform and educate the consumers through an integrated marketing communication approach by means of campaigns, advertisements, and public relations. Thus, through relevant environmental information or knowledge, consumers will be more educated aiming to impact positive attitude and purchase intention.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Natural 'green' cosmetics is moving from an option to a must as an industry standard to regulate modern production of these beauty products. According to Future Market Insight (2019), the global natural and organic cosmetic industry is anticipated to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% during 2018 -2027, expecting to reach US$ 54.5 billion by 2027 from estimated market size of US$ 34.5 billion in 2018. This industry comprises of product categories namely skincare (34.8%), colour cosmetics (make-up) (27.6%), hair care (19.9%) and other (17.7%) (Oral care, toiletries, feminine hygiene) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(IBISWorld, 2019)</ref>. While many studies have investigated the various aspects of green purchase behaviour (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Shiel et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Rustam et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cheah and Phau, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hansen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Yadav and Pathak, 2016)</ref>, the market is now experiencing a renewed interest in ecologically oriented issues such as purchasing environmentally friendly or "green" products with a more pervasive focus on the consumer marketplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ghazali et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Zhang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Dong et al., 2020)</ref>. Research has shown that consumers today have radically reshaped the beauty and personal care industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Pop et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Singhal and Malik, 2018)</ref>. In particular, female consumers are noted to have positive attitude towards purchasing green cosmetics and beauty care products. According to literature, women engage heavily in sustainable lifestyles, as natural cosmetics and beauty care products are believed to harmonise their self-image, health risks and feminism which explain the growing demand for eco-friendly cosmetics and beauty care products (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Singhal and Malik, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Pudaruth et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Nowadays, consumer trends suggest that shoppers are seeking natural materials and additives, this is particular notable for cosmetic products <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Roberts, 2021)</ref>. However, to what extent are 'healthy', 'natural', or 'clean' attributes in beauty and personal care of importance to the everyday female shopper? According to a recent global survey on health and wellness <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Masory, 2019)</ref>, these buyers want beauty and personal care products with natural ingredients that are sourced and manufactured following ethical and environmental standards. This attention to healthy and clean products is driven by a number of factors.</p><p>There is a growing awareness as well as some confusions among the general public regarding many ingredients in beauty and personal care products, such as the apparent negative effects of synthetic materials and chemicals on health and the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Patnaik et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hsu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kim and Seock, 2009)</ref>. This has created a sense of fear and mistrust among beauty companies regarding production and labelling of beauty and personal care products <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Wischhover, 2018)</ref>, thus there has been a shift in buyer behaviour from conventional purchase behaviour to green purchase behaviour.</p><p>South Africa, as a developing country, has established significantly less groundwork for sustainable behaviour than typical first-world countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Owusu-Sekyere et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bisschoff and Liebenberg, 2016)</ref>. As an emerging green economy, there are around 250 players operating in South Africa's formal cosmetics sector, with the growth coming mainly from the SMME sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Research and Markets, 2019)</ref>. According to recent statistics, South Africa poses a fairly equitable workforce in terms of gender with women making up 45.3% of the entire labour force <ref type="bibr">(Mordor Intelligence, 2019)</ref>. This has remained one of the key factors for the increased demand in South Africa for skin care products with herbal, natural and green ingredients. While the skincare market in South Africa is forecasted to have an annual growth rate of 7.4% in the next five years <ref type="bibr">(Mordor Intelligence, 2021)</ref>, it is also noteworthy that buyers in this market are aware of the long-term effects of harsh chemicals on their skin and prefer natural products and are willing to pay marginally more for premium brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Scott and Vigar-Ellis, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Anvar and Venter, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies have examined the consumer purchase behaviour of natural cosmetic products in the developed and developing countries, such as in the USA <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kim and Seock, 2009)</ref>, Greece <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Tsakiridou et al., 2008)</ref>, Malaysia <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Jaini et al. 2019)</ref>, Mauritius <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Pudaruth et al., 2015)</ref>, Hong Kong <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Lai and Cheng, 2016)</ref>, and Vietnam <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Nguyen et al., 2016)</ref>, however the outcomes in relation to consumer attitude towards natural 'green' cosmetics and green consumer behaviour as a whole have remained largely inconclusive <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Wang et al., 2019)</ref>. Thus, the attitudebehaviour gap is largely attributed to the impact of social mechanisms such as subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control that tend to differ as they influence consumer purchase behaviour. Furthermore, the country context of the study may suggest that some variability as well as differences in buyer behaviour will exist especially when dealing with consumers in an environmentally conscious setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Quoquab and Mohammad, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, the dearth of research in uncovering consumer attitudes and purchase intention towards green products in particular natural or green cosmetics within the context of an emerging market such as South Africa necessitates the need to conduct further studies in this area.</p><p>Despite the advances in teasing out the relationships between concerns over sustainability and eco-friendly consumption, several questions remain unanswered. For example, why does concern for the environment not always translate into effective purchase behaviour; why are intentions not converted into environmentally friendly actions or activities <ref type="bibr">(do Paco et al., 2019)</ref>? Therefore, this gap in the literature provides an opportunity for further research to expand on these antecedents or 'drivers' of consumer attitude and buying behaviours towards green cosmetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(ElHaffar et al., 2020)</ref>. Another omission from the findings of most studies in the field is the lack of product category specificity, and a failure to address specific types of eco-friendly products (e.g., natural 'green' face masks). This has an important implication as currently there is an imbalance in the literature between the growing use of natural cosmetics and the limited research attention focused on this category of product alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(ElHaffar et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Liobikienė et al, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Paul et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Nguyen and Rowley, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>To revisit consumers' purchase intention of eco-friendly products, in particular 'green' cosmetics, this study empirically tests a conceptual model. The research aims are twofold. First, the study utilises the conceptual framework based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen's (1991)</ref> Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) model which is an extension of the Theory of Reasoned Actions (TRA) to investigate and understand the relationships between the constructs in explaining the acceptance and engagement towards green cosmetics. Other antecedents derived from the literature, and examined, include: (1) health consciousness; (2) ecological motive; and (3) environmental knowledge, against the dependent variable of female consumer attitudes towards green cosmetics. Second, the study investigates the relationship between female consumers' attitudes towards and purchase intention of green cosmetics. The study's third objective is to investigate the moderating effect of consumer involvement on the relationship between attitude and purchase intention for green cosmetics. The following sections review the related literature, develop the research hypotheses, describe the methodology of the study to test the hypotheses, report the results and discuss the implications of the findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Relevant literature and hypotheses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Definition of green cosmetics</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Lin et al. (2018, p.</ref> 2) green cosmetics are defined as being a "multifaceted construct for the preservation of the environment, minimisation of pollution, responsible use of non-renewable resources, and animal welfare and species preservation". The term 'green' or 'environmentally-friendly' in products denotes to attributes that are <ref type="bibr">'natural', 'organic', 'sustainable', 'clean,', 'eco-friendly' and 'non-toxic' (Patnaik et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hsu et al., 2017)</ref>. In addition, <ref type="bibr">Csorba and Bogela (2011)</ref> indicate that green cosmetics are also considered natural cosmetics that are made out of natural resources such as botanicals and fruit-based formulae and ingredients, without the usage of chemicals, colouring additives, or other non-natural mixtures. It is also important to note that green and organic cosmetics should not be mistaken for each other. There are several underlying differences between the two, however organic is well known to have a stricter definition than green or natural, for instance, the term 'organic' is highly regulated by governing bodies and agencies such as the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA, which means that selling them in consumer systems can also be a significant challenge (e.g., storage, expiration etc.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Amberg and Fogarassy, 2019)</ref>. Furthermore, the difference in certification between the percentages of natural or organic ingredients needed to fulfil the certification criteria is also another distinguishing factor. Natural cosmetics products may contain ingredients that are not 100% organic. This means that natural products can contain chemicals, while organic products cannot. For instance, an organic product must have between 95-100% chemical-free ingredients, while a natural product usually is 50-70% chemical free <ref type="bibr">(Attitude Organic, 2020)</ref>. Moreover, a label that reads "certified organic" means 95% of ingredients are organic while "made with organic ingredients" means at least 70% of ingredients are organic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">The eco-gender gap and buyer behaviour among female shoppers</head><p>Past research has explained this 'eco-gender' gap in environmental sustainability by exploring differences in personality traits typically observed in women versus men. A number of studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Tsakiridou et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cervellon et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Pudaruth et al. 2015)</ref> have suggested that women are more likely than men to be green, and that in the past that gender gap has been attributed to personality differences. For instance, women show a greater tendency to be prosocial, altruistic and empathetic; display a stronger ethic of care; and assume a futurefocused perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Tsakiridou et al., 2008)</ref>. Research also shows that women have higher levels of socialisation to care about others and be socially responsible, which then leads them to care about environmental problems and be willing to adopt environmental behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Briscoe et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cervellon et al., 2010)</ref>. Moreover, other studies have also suggested that femininity and 'greenness' have come to be cognitively linked (by men and women), and this is largely evidence by many green marketing efforts targeting areas in which "women tend to be more involved than men, such as cleaning, food preparation, family health, laundry, and domestic maintenance" <ref type="bibr">(Brough et al. 2016, p. 568)</ref>, with most eco-friendly products being marketed to women. Past findings have also revealed that female buyers are likely to respond favourably to eco-labels, green claims and environmental branding, in particular towards cosmetics and beauty care products <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Thøgersen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Banytė et al., 2010)</ref> In addition, several studies have indicated factors such as 'animal welfare', 'environmental concern', 'health' and 'safety' are major factors motivating female shoppers to purchase green cosmetics and beauty care products <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Singhal and Malik, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Pudaruth et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Tsakiridou et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cervellon et al., 2010)</ref>. Organic beauty products are perceived as possessing higher quality, being good for health and safer due to the avoided risk of pesticide residues often found in cosmetics and beauty products <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Pudaruth et al., 2015)</ref>. Some studies have noted that women do not purchase cosmetics and beauty care products solely because of environmental concerns or personal beliefs but also for health reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bilal et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Vermeir and Verbeke, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, from an ecological perspective, female buyers are more likely to choose beauty products and cosmetics that reflect their desired lifestyle, status or self-image in society <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Thomas and Peters, 2009)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Roberts (1996, p. 222)</ref>, "ecologically conscious consumers are defined as those who purchase products and services which they perceive to have a positive (or less negative) impact on the environment". However, past literature has noted inconsistent normalities in relation to an attitude-behaviour gap when it comes to consumers "readiness to be green" <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Polonsky et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Leire and Thidell, 2005)</ref>. Several studies have subsequently argued that it is essential for policymakers and marketers to have a clear understanding of the antecedents of pro-environmental consumer behaviour for promoting such behaviour (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Roberts and Bacon, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Follows and Jobber, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Taufique and Vaithianathan 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Theory of planned behaviour (TPB)</head><p>The theory of planned behaviour has been widely acknowledged and applied as the theoretical framework to understand and determine the behavioural intentions of consumers by utilising the factors of attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control as the bases of predicting the behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. Extant literature has used the TPB framework in explaining and envisaging consumer intentions in an extensive variety of green and proenvironment areas, such as green hotels <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Chen and Tung, 2014)</ref>, organic personal care products <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ghazali et al., 2017)</ref>, organic/sustainable food <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Lim et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Tarkiainen and Sundqvist, 2005)</ref> and green products <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Paul et al., 2016)</ref>; thus, proving the robustness and applicability of the framework.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Sun et al. (2018)</ref>, the 'readiness to be green' constitutes important factors such as consumer attitude, conscientiousness, extraversion and openness which ultimately predicts the buyers' intention to purchase green products. Several studies have also emphasised that using green cosmetics is a lifestyle of treating self and the environment with respect <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kim and Seock, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hansen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Paul et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Liobikienė et al, 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kim and Chung (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Taufique and Vaithianathan (2018)</ref> applied the TPB in predicting purchase intentions towards natural personal care products. Their findings demonstrate that TPB predictors were significant in relation to purchase intention; in particular, consumers' attitude towards the environment influences the behavioural intention directly and positively. Furthermore, the TPB was utilised in a study on organic food products to determine the antecedents of sustainable food consumption among young adults in Belgium where the findings demonstrate that the TPB provided approximately 50% of variance in an explaining consumer purchase intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Vermeir and Verbeke, 2006)</ref>. Similarly, several other studies applied the TPB framework in examining the consumer intention to purchase organic food revealing that subject norms and attitude were able to explain variances of purchases intentions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Sultan et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Arvola et al., 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Extending the theory of planned behaviour</head><p>Conner and Armitage (1998) argue that the TPB model is barely a representation of a complete theory, it is rather a description of the processes in where beliefs and attitudes determine behaviour. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen (1991)</ref> proposes that in principle the TPB model remains open to change and the inclusion of additional predictors. Hence, various studies in green consumer behaviour followed this suggestion by extending the model in a range of studies such as green skincare products <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Hsu et al., 2017)</ref>, organic food products <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Zhou et al., 2013)</ref> and general green products <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Lai and Cheng, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yadav and Pathak, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The frameworks that are developed in the bases of these theories are usually country specific and thus outside the country of context which suggests that it cannot be readily applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Paul et al., 2016)</ref>. Furthermore, it is suggested that in view of other cultural settings, additional cognitive factors are to be embraced in predicting green purchase behaviour by utilising a modified TPB framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Jaiswal and Kant, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Joshi and Rahman, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Wei et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In addition, several research propose the incorporation and inclusion of other cognitive, internal</head><p>and external factors such as environmental knowledge and health consciousness in the assessing of green purchase intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kim and Chung, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Kumar et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Mostafa, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Yadav and Pathak (2016)</ref> extended the TPB framework, by including the antecedent of environmental knowledge in predicting young consumers' intention to purchase green product in India. Moreover, it is also reported by previous research that environmental knowledge is an important subjective phenomenon in predicting green consumer intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Tan, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Joshi and Rahman, 2015)</ref>. While subjective norms and PBC will provide insights towards green purchase intention, it is important to understand how consumer attitudes towards green purchases are developed, especially for developing countries such as South Africa.</p><p>Furthermore, past studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Wei et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Mostafa, 2007)</ref> that have examined green consumption in developing countries have confirmed that these factors will contribute to our understanding of how green attitudes are formed and subsequently influence the purchase intention as underpinned by TPB model. Based on the extent literature, the current study extends the TPB model by incorporating the influence of the internal and external factors (i.e., ecological motives, health consciousness and environmental knowledge) on consumer attitude towards green product consumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Subjective norm</head><p>Subjective norm relates to the normative guidance or perceived social influence/pressure that an individual obtains from significant relevant persons' such as family, friends and peers, to perform or not to perform in a behaviour, though this influence may vary across consumers given its subjectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Paul et al., 2015)</ref>. These significant relevant others refer to individuals whose preferences about a person's behaviour in his/her area are important to the individual. For instance, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Teng and Wang (2015)</ref> if a consumer perceives that those relevant persons to them have a positive opinion and attitude on a product, then they tend to have a positive purchase intention to that product. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hansen et al. (2012)</ref> relate that depending on situational factors this normative guidance may vary for the same person due to the situation and subjectivity.</p><p>On the other hand, several previous studies have encompassed subjective norm in green consumption literature, revealing that the relationship between subjective norm and purchase intention is insignificant and weak towards green products (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Pop et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ghazali et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Uddin and Khan, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Nguyen et al., 2016)</ref>. For example, in a developing country context <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Kumar et al. (2017)</ref> demonstrate that subjective norm has a weak effect towards sustainable products on purchase intention which could be attributed to levels of accessibility to information and resources. Similarly, another study reveals a weak influence of subjective norm on purchase intention towards green products <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Nguyen et al., 2016)</ref>. This is suggested to be due to apparent low levels knowledge and awareness of green consumption.</p><p>However, other studies state that an understanding of how social influence promotes green product diffusion and purchase intention is relevant for marketing and scholarly implications <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hansen et al., 2012)</ref>. Whilst literature also suggests that it positively contribute into acquiring insight into green consumer behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hansen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Persaud and Schillo 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Previous research identifies that subjective norm has a significant positive effect on consumers' purchase intention towards green products such as organic food <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chen, 2007)</ref>, green hotels (Kun-Shan and Teng, 2011) and organic personal care <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kim and Chung, 2011)</ref>. It is proposed that in the context of consumer behaviour in relation to beauty and skin care management, that subjective norm will have a significant positive influence on an individual's purchase intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kim and Chung, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Paul et al., 2016)</ref>. Therefore, the following is hypothesised: H1. Subjective norm will have a significant positive impact on consumers' purchase intention towards green cosmetics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Perceived behavioural control</head><p>Ajzen (1991) defines the perceived behavioural control concept as an individual's perception of the extent to which performance of the behaviour is easy or difficult. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Moser (2016)</ref> finds that in the implementation of green consumption, consumers are faced with complexities or obstacles which inhibit them from behaving accordingly. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen (1991)</ref> suggests that individuals are likely to have a high degree of perceived behavioural control if they perceive that there are opportunities and have accessibility to the requisite resources in performing the behaviour. For example, it is stated that when it is believed by consumers that they have more resources such as time, money, and skills their perceptions of control are high and hence their behavioural intentions increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kim and Chung, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Wang et al.

The interaction was supported with R 2 = 0.28, F = 52.15, β = 0.08, t = 2.66, p = 0.008, indicating that consumers' involvement strengthens the positive relationship between attitude towards and purchase intention for green cosmetics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>This research expanded the application of the theoretical framework of theory of planned behaviour by the addition of ecological motives, environmental knowledge and health consciousness as predictors of attitude towards green cosmetics products in South Africa.</p><p>Subjective norm was found to be a strong predictor of the consumers' purchase intention towards green cosmetic. This result is consistent with previous research that examined the relationship between subjective norm and purchase intention <ref type="bibr">(Sreen et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hsu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kim and Chung, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hansen et al., 2011)</ref>. This finding is explained by the experience of information which relates to the relevant information regarding cosmetics products purchase intentions and possible decision factors. Moreover, this could be attributed to cosmetics product's notion of being socially visible products. Hence, consumers accept and act according to the guidance and opinions received from relatives and peers <ref type="bibr">(Hansen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cheng and Lam, 2008)</ref>. This research also demonstrates that perceived behavioural control did not have a significant impact on the consumers' purchase intention. This result reflects that South African consumers' perceived behavioural control in terms volitional control does not influence the purchase intention for green cosmetics products and hence insignificant in impacting their behavioural intentions <ref type="bibr">(Joshi and Rahman, 2012)</ref>. The plausible explanation of such nonsignificant finding may also contribute to the notion that consumers do not believe to have more access to resources that enables them to form decisions that would lead to purchasing green cosmetics products (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kang et al., 2012)</ref>. This may also relate to the culture, values and socio-economic constraints faced by the consumers in a developing country (i.e., South Africa). This research further confirms that attitude is a significant predictor of purchase intentions for green cosmetics. This result is consistent with the classic attitude-behaviour relationship of the TPB model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref> and therefore validates the framework within the context of green cosmetics. Moreover, this finding aligns with the past research that states that consumers' attitude has a positive, significant and relatively strong effect on organic and green purchase intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alzubaidi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ghazali et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kim and Chung, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Contrary to the expectation, South African consumers' health consciousness did not have a significant positive impact on their attitude towards green cosmetics.

Also, noteworthy that the measurement items of the health consciousness were related more towards the gastronomy and physical fitness. Therefore, the construct possibly did not accurately capture the participants' health consciousness related to the consumption of green cosmetics.</p><p>The significant and positive relationship between ecological motives and consumers' attitude towards green cosmetics indicates that consumers' concern towards the welfare and the environment impacts their decision making and purchase of green cosmetics.

The finding suggests that elementary information or understanding of environmental issues are sufficient to motivate consumers to adjust towards sustainable and environmentally friendly attitude and purchase intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Yadav and Pathak, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, additional information on related issues may lead to an increase in environmental knowledge which in turn might support the consumers' understanding of the product attributes and trust in green products. Therefore, the enhanced knowledge may reinforce a positive attitude and purchase intention to such green products. Conversely, an absence of environmental knowledge may prevent consumers from translating their concerns to influence a positive attitude and purchase intention towards ecologically sound products <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Tanner and Kast, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Vermeir and Verbeke's, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>This research also addressed the gap in literature in green product research by examining the moderating effect of involvement on the relationship between attitude and purchase intention towards green cosmetics. The findings of the research reveal that higher the consumer's involvement with green cosmetics, stronger the relationship between attitude and purchase intention. A higher level of involvement will encourage consumers to engage in an extensive information searching and processing that will subsequently reduce the perceived risks and uncertainties related to the green cosmetics consumption. In particular, consumers' intention to buy green cosmetics can be amplified when their positive attitude is conditioned with relevant information and appeals <ref type="bibr">(Lee, 2011)</ref>. Overall, the consumers with a higher involvement will psychologically consider and evaluate the traits and benefits of green cosmetics which in turn will strengthen the purchase intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Implications</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Theoretical implications</head><p>The findings of this research contribute to the theoretical understanding of green consumption in several ways. First, this research validates the theory of planned behaviour within the context of purchasing green cosmetics among South African female consumers. Thus, this paper fulfils an existing gap within the domain of eco-gender gap and behavioural intention. Second, there is a growing consensus that consumers' understanding of personal well-being and environmental concerns influences the phenomenon of green consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Yue et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Mutum et al., 2020)</ref>. Therefore, from a conceptual standpoint, the inclusion of health consciousness, ecological motive and environmental knowledge provides a more robust understanding of green purchase behaviour. Third, the extant literature often refers to the multiplicity of the attitude-intention relationship due to the external variables (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">ElHaffar et al., 2020)</ref>. Hence, this research provides empirical evidence that consumers' level of involvement is a critical driver in enhancing the relationship between attitude and purchase intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Managerial implications</head><p>Managerially, the results of this research would benefit the practitioners within the South Africa's green cosmetic and beauty industry in several ways. More specifically, this study will aid a marketer in (a) identifying, segmenting and profiling female shoppers and consumers in terms of their motivation to purchase green cosmetics, as well as to inform marketers of (b) how to best promote their green cosmetics products to their prospective target audience. The key implications are threefold. Firstly, the results have highlighted the importance of environmental benefits and adherence to animal welfare when promoting green cosmetics to consumers <ref type="bibr">(Chen, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Teng and Lu, 2012)</ref>. Marketers of green cosmetics and similar products will therefore need to be aware that the environmental benefits of their products should not be 'implied' rather it should be visible and communicated ostentatiously. For example, this awareness could be created through labelling the green cosmetic products with environmental claims and eco-certifications. Other forms of novel eco-friendly packaging is also a good way to cultivate awareness around the matter. Secondly, the results have shown us that interpersonal influence (i.e., subjective norms) is interesting and that it acknowledges that individuals do not make decisions in a bubble. It is likely that the environmental learnings or leanings of friends and family will influence how individuals feel about green cosmetics products. Therefore, it is important that marketers set up promotion initiatives that emphasises the 'collective' as well as promote social value <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Smith and Paladino, 2010)</ref>, whether it is through social media marketing, promotion activities (e.g., family &amp; friends discounts) <ref type="bibr">(Hansen et al., 20120)</ref> or the actual buying process (e.g., online group buying). Thirdly, environmental knowledge or eco-literacy as an antecedent towards attitude contributes to one's purchase intention. This means that empowering consumers through education and learning is critical if they are to be motivated or convince of their green purchases (as oppose to alternatives). This can be done with an integrated marketing communication campaign to educate consumers about the benefits and risks of their purchases. Thus, encouraging the consumption behaviour would be a first step to eradicate consumer concerns as well as informing consumer decision making when it comes to building sustainable attitudes and purchase intention towards green cosmetics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Limitations and future research</head><p>There are several limitations of this research that might addressed in future research. First, this research did not examine the psychological and personality traits that might potentially have influence on the consumers' attitude and intention towards green cosmetics. This can be investigated in future studies. Second, the generalisability of the findings can be tested in future research with samples (e.g., male consumers) from different market with another green product category. Third, it would be insightful to explore the moderating role of governmental influence <ref type="bibr">(Sreen et al., 2020)</ref>, generativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Shiel et al., 2020)</ref>, self-concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Sharma et al., 2020)</ref>, and country of origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cheah et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Cheah and Shimul, 2018)</ref> in relation to determining attitude and buyer behaviour within the context of green product purchase. Also, to provide rigour to the findings of this research, future research may undertake experimental design to test the interplay of consumers' knowledge, involvement, and attitude and purchase intention.</p><p>Future studies may examine the mediating effect of attitude within the TPB framework, which could also warrant insights as to whether a "halo effect" or direct effects of the propose antecedents towards purchase behaviour would exist. Another avenue that could be explore is the impact of consumers' morality. Further research is warranted if advertising appeals (e.g., pride vs. guilt) would have any differential effect on consumers' evaluation of green cosmetics.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1: Research framework</figDesc><graphic coords="17,72.00,323.24,451.30,176.55" type="bitmap" /></figure>
