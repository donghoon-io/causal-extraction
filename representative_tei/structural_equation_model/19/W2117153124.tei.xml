<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study examined the construct validity of a model and measure of life balance conceptualized as both congruence among desired and actual time spent in activities, and equivalence in the degree of discrepancy between desired and actual time spent across activities that meet health, relationship, challenge/interest and identity needs. The life balance inventory (LBI) was used as the measure for life balance and was pre-tested for construct validity. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized relationships between life balance (LBI), perceived stress (DASS21 stress subscale), personal well-being (PWI-A), and need satisfaction (BPNS) in the hypothesized life balance model (LBM). Four hundred and fifty eight participants representing mixed demographic groups participated in the study by completing the 4 instruments. SEM results indicated that congruence, moderated by equivalence predicted lower stress, higher personal well-being and higher need satisfaction, but equivalence alone did not.</p><p>Working, having children at home, and being non-white negatively moderated congruence and larger family size positively moderated congruence. This study provides initial construct validity evidence for the hypothesized model and measure of life balance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The construct of interest in this study is life balance, a term frequently heard in everyday conversations or seen in the popular press related to healthy lifestyles. Although the life balance construct seems to be accepted in everyday parlance, it remains the focus of scholarly investigation. This research will explore whether empirical evidence can be found for a model and measure of life balance as they relate to stress, need satisfaction and well-being.</p><p>Stress is a reality of modern society. Modern family lives are often perceived as rushed and stressed, where keeping up with the demands of home and work exceed people's ability to cope with them. Evidence of this perception is widespread within developed countries as seen in increased reports of stressful lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bachmann, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Robinson, &amp; Godbey, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Statistics Canada, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">2005)</ref>. Nearly half of U.S. workers report that their jobs interfere some or a lot with their personal lives, and nearly three quarters of working mothers and fathers report feeling that they do not have enough time to spend with their children <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bond, Galinsky, Swanberg, &amp; Prottas, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Beck &amp; Arnold, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Family stress has been a concern for researchers and practitioners for decades and according to family stress theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hill, 1949)</ref>, if the stress is severe enough, and for a long enough period of time, it could lead to physical, emotional or relational crisis within families. The cumulative research is increasingly more compelling that the consequences of prolonged everyday stress has a cumulative impact on physical and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Kiecolt-Glaser, McGuire, Robles &amp; Glaser, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">McEwen &amp; Lasley, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Seeman, et al., 2002)</ref>. There is a need to understand how individuals and families can best cope with such stressors and create satisfying and healthy lives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Popular Press Notions of Life Balance</head><p>The popular press has been promoting life balance as one of the answers to stressful lives. Although not quantified or defined, the general idea of life balance relates to wanting enough time devoted to work, self care, leisure, and rest, and to the stress that results without that perceived balance. A web search conducted while writing this manuscript using the term lifestyle balance produced 22 million hits; a search for the term life balance produced roughly four-fold more. Clearly the phrase has become commonly accepted and people seem to accept the idea that living a balanced life is desirable and possible. A brief scan of the titles from the first 20 websites that appeared in the iGoogle™ search showed that information and services are available that are intended to help people gain life balance, well-being, and more satisfying lives. Some of the messages delivered on these web sites assert that people can create optimal lives if they make the "right" choices about what they do in everyday living, that many people are not making the "right" choices and are therefore stressed, unhappy or unhealthy, and that they could make improvements with the "right" information or service.</p><p>There seems to be an assumed <ref type="bibr">(and prescriptive)</ref> understanding of what constitutes life balance and what influences it, such as stress, exercise, nutrition, relationships, adequate sleep, a positive attitude, or workplace satisfaction. Similar to a food pyramid, life balance is sometimes depicted in the popular press as a prescribed amount of daily activities and attitudes that are seen as necessary for everyone. It is also generally assumed that life balance is a good thing to strive for, and if successful, a balanced life will result in better health, less stress, and an overall better life. The popular press is full of examples and helpful hints to help people achieve life balance.</p><p>Do people ever actually achieve a balanced life? Does a balanced life mean a better life? And if that's possible, what does a balanced life look like? These questions led to efforts to understand and articulate the phenomenon, which resulted in a proposed theoretical model of life balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Matuska &amp; Christiansen, 2008)</ref> and development of an instrument to measure it. Given the growing need for successful adaptation to stressful lives in modern times, studying life balance may be timely and useful for understanding important components in life considered necessary for reducing the consequences of chronic stress and for enhancing health and well-being. Research is only beginning to explore this idea, however, and there is no common understanding about what a balanced life really is and whether or not it contributes to health and well-being.</p><p>Given the important relationships between stress, lifestyles and well-being, understanding the recurring patterns of life activities that reduce stress and promote health is of potential value. Although it is widely accepted that certain activities are more beneficial to health and quality of life than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Christiansen &amp; Matuska, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Sternberg, 1997)</ref>, little theoretical or empirical work has been done to identify optimal lifestyle patterns. What constitutes a balanced life? How is it related to other aspects of well being?</p><p>For the purposes of this research, the term life balance is used as a conceptualization of a type of life that is optimal for health and well-being. Recently, a model of life balance was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Matuska and Christiansen (2008)</ref> based on a comprehensive review of the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Christiansen &amp; Matuska, 2006)</ref>, but there is no evidence to support its validity. One way to provide validity evidence for a theoretical model is to create and test a measure built from the dimensions of the model, and see if predicted associations among known constructs within the model can be empirically verified. Thus, if construct validity evidence is found for a measure of life balance that was created from a theoretical model of life balance, then both the measure and the model have empirical support. Exploration of the validity of a measure of life balance that has been developed is a major focus of this study. The following section describes the theoretical underpinnings of the measure of life balance, the Life Balance Model (LBM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Life Balance Model</head><p>The theoretical model of life balance (LBM) that underlies this research was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Matuska &amp; Christiansen (2008)</ref>. This life balance model builds on interdisciplinary research about the physiological and psychological attributes considered important for well-being, and conceptualizes life balance based on how the configurations of everyday activities meet essential human needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Christiansen &amp; Matuska, 2006)</ref>. A more thorough discussion of that research appears in Chapter 2, Review of the Literature. Here, the theoretical model and instrument used to test the model's validity, the primary foci of this study, are described.</p><p>The everyday activities that people engage in, such as grooming, bathing, cooking and eating, driving, working, child rearing, and leisure comprise activity configurations.</p><p>The model proposes that activity configurations should enable people to: (1) meet basic instrumental needs necessary for sustained biological health and physical safety; <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> have rewarding and self-affirming relationships with others (3) feel engaged, challenged, and competent; (4) create meaning and a positive personal identity <ref type="bibr">(Matuska &amp; Christiansen, 2008, p. 11)</ref>. The model proposes that to the extent people are able to engage in configurations of activities that address all of these need dimensions, they will perceive their lives as more satisfying, less stressful, and more meaningful, or balanced. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Matuska &amp; Christiansen (2008)</ref> proposed a fifth need-based dimension, "to organize their time and energy in ways that enable them to meet important personal goals and renewal" (p. 11), but in the LBM described here, this dimension has been conceptualized as a skill rather than a need.</p><p>The definition of life balance in this model is "a satisfying pattern of daily activity that is healthful, meaningful, and sustainable to an individual within the context of his or her current life circumstances" <ref type="bibr">(Matuska &amp; Christiansen, 2008, p.11)</ref>. The term satisfying in this definition means congruence between the amount of time one actually spends participating in activities and the amount of time one would like to spend participating in activities. Healthful means the activity configurations contribute to both physiological and mental health, meaningful means that the activities participated in are valued and important, and sustainable means the activity configurations can be maintained over the long term. The focus on activity configurations (ovals A and B) as the means for meeting important needs differentiates life balance from other positive state constructs such as happiness and satisfaction with life. Definitions of those constructs (happiness and life satisfaction) typically focus more on global, subjective appraisals of well-being. The LBM proposes that life balance is best understood by knowing how people live their lives, and that life balance can be conceptualized through actual configurations of activities that people engage in on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. In other words, what people actually do (activity configurations) is a representation of their lives and that certain configurations are considered balanced or imbalanced depending on whether their needs are met.</p><p>Although the need-based dimensions of the LBM need empirical validation, another fundamental question is yet to be answered as well. What constitutes a balance among these need dimensions? And is a balance among the need dimensions important for positive physical and mental health outcomes? If people report satisfaction with their activity configurations, it might not represent life balance, but simply a level of life satisfaction.</p><p>To address the balance part of the LBM, two components are considered: activity configuration congruence, and activity configuration equivalence. Activity configurations are represented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> by two separate ovals, activity configurations that are congruent (oval A) and activity configurations that are equivalent (oval B). Each of these will be described in detail next.</p><p>Oval A represents congruence of activity configurations which means that one's actual activity configuration in everyday life matches one's desired activity configuration in everyday life. The LBM proposes that one component of a balanced life is high activity configuration congruence. In other words, if people report the amount of time spent in most activities is about right; not too much or too little, then they would have high congruence. Conversely, if people report spending too little or too much time in most activities relative to what they desire, then they would have low congruence. This represents the fifth dimension proposed in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Matuska and Christiansen (2008)</ref> life balance model, "to organize their time and energy in ways that enable them to meet important personal goals and renewal" (p. 11). In the LBM, this dimension reflects a skill needed to manage time and energy in ways that create optimal satisfaction with activity engagement in everyday life and is reflected by a person's reported congruence in activity configurations.</p><p>Time and energy are viewed as key dimensions in the proposed LBM because they are central to lay understandings of life balance, play a pervasive role in the orchestration of social activity, influence how and when activities are undertaken and experienced, and perhaps most importantly, contribute in significant ways to the creation of meaning. Organizing time and energy is viewed in two distinct ways in the LBM; one view refers to the more immediate perception of time as in the allocation of time in day to day activities (activity configuration congruence and equivalence), while the other view recognizes that life choices and values change with the passage of time and context (not visible in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, but part of the theoretical foundation about changes over the lifespan).</p><p>Partitioning a prescribed amount of time to various activities is not what is proposed in the LBM. Rather, it is the contextual influence of time relative to meeting needs (health, positive relationships, challenge, and meaning) that is proposed to contribute to lower stress and life satisfaction. In other words, in balanced lives, needbased activities are engaged in through time in a manner that, at the end of the day, week, month, or year, people feel satisfied that their needs have been met and that their important goals have been achieved.</p><p>Congruence is conceptualized as only one part of activity configurations in the LBM because it does not take into consideration the holistic nature of lives and health. It is conceivable that an individual might regularly spend a large amount of time in one activity with very little time in other activities. For example, 0 hours desired, and 0 hours actual, in a given activity shows congruence, or 15 hours desired and 15 hours actual in a given activity also shows congruence. Thus, for example, a person who works 15 hours a day (as desired) and spends no time in relationships (as desired) would be considered balanced. Similarly, a person who spends 8 hours a day working (as desired) and 8 hours a day viewing pornographic web sites (as desired) would also have congruence and be considered balanced. The LBM addresses the potential limitations of considering only congruence by proposing another component to life balance, activity configuration equivalence.</p><p>Oval B represents equivalence of activity configurations. The LBM proposes that the second component of a balanced life includes activity configurations that allow people to meet the four need dimensions identified in the LBM: "(1) meet basic instrumental needs necessary for sustained biological health and physical safety; <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> have rewarding and self-affirming relationships with others (3) feel engaged, challenged, and competent; (4) create meaning and a positive personal identity" <ref type="bibr">(Matuska &amp; Christiansen, 2008, p. 11)</ref> The LBM depicts an overlap between equivalence and congruence because both are proposed as necessary for a balanced life <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Matuska &amp; Christiansen, 2008)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> suggests that both high congruence and high equivalence lead to a balanced life (line a), and low congruence or low equivalence (or both) lead to an imbalanced life (lines c). The relationship in the LBM of congruence and equivalence to a balanced life (line a in</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) will be directly tested in this research, but their relationship to an imbalanced life will not be directly tested.</p><p>Life balance, represented by oval C in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, is expected to relate to lower stress, higher need satisfaction and higher personal well-being. Life balance is expected to share some common attributes with these three constructs, but it is also expected to have its own unique dimensions. The relationships among life balance, stress, need satisfaction, and personal well-being are expected to be moderate. If the relationship between life balance and any of these constructs is too strong (for example if personal well-being shares 80% of the variance with life balance), then it is possible that life balance and personal well-being are the same thing.</p><p>This research will test the relationships between life balance, stress, need satisfaction, and personal well-being. Life balance is expected to be positively related to need satisfaction and personal well-being, and stress is expected to be inversely related to life balance. As stress increases, it is proposed that people will report less balance in their lives. Similarly, if people engage in activity configurations that do not meet the needbased dimensions of the LBM, it is presumed that they will also report higher stress.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows stress as a circle that intersects with life balance (and imbalance) and need satisfaction and that is related (through need satisfaction) to personal well being.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> indicates that an expected consequence of life balance is positive physical and mental health. A discussion of this expected relationship will follow, but this relationship will also not be directly tested in this research.</p><p>Life imbalance is represented by oval D. Low congruence and/or low equivalence in activity configurations are expected to relate to life imbalance and to reports of high stress, low need satisfaction and low personal well-being. Life imbalance is characterized by configurations of daily activities that are perceived to be unsatisfactory (incongruent)</p><p>to the individual and which: 1) increase the risk for physical and mental health problems,</p><p>2) limit or compromise participation in valued relationships, 3) are incongruent with establishing or maintaining a satisfactory identity, 4) are felt to be mundane, uninteresting or unchallenging, or 5) are not sufficiently organized or comprehensible to enable self renewal or goal achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Matuska, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Matuska &amp; Christiansen, 2009)</ref>. Life imbalance is also expected to relate to poor health outcomes as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. This assumption will not be directly tested in the current research.</p><p>Finally, the entire figure is surrounded by a large oval representing the supports and barriers of the environmental context. The environmental context includes: the physical context, (such as where one lives and works); the social context, (such as social roles and responsibilities); the cultural context, (such as values and traditions); the political and economic contexts, (such as availability of resources); and the temporal context, (such as age or life stage). The interaction between the person and the environment is dynamic; where one's presence and actions influence the environment and alternatively, the physical and social characteristics of the environment influence the emotions and actions of the individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Shaw, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wells, 2002)</ref>. This person-environment interaction is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> by the arrows representing a two-way relationship between the activity configuration and the surrounding environment.</p><p>However, in some contexts, the interaction is one way only. For example, where one's gender, race, or age may influence activity configurations, but are not malleable to change based on one's actions.</p><p>The LBM suggests that choosing activity patterns that are optimal for one's overall perception of a balanced life is not entirely within one's personal control. The forces of the environment may make it difficult to engage in the kinds of activities desired. It is conceivable, for example, that resource limitations can influence the extent to which a person can meet needs and participate in valued activities, thus constraining the opportunity to attain a balanced life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LBM critique</head><p>The LBM was proposed based on a comprehensive review of the literature that provided a context for identifying specific life characteristics and activity configurations relating to positive health and well-being outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Christiansen &amp; Matuska, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>There is research to support the idea that meeting important needs is linked to positive physical and mental health outcomes, but there is no evidence to date that the need dimensions proposed in the model are those essential for a balanced life. Furthermore, there is no evidence that a balance in the degree to which these needs are met is essential.</p><p>It is possible that people could do very little to meet one or two of the proposed needs dimensions outlined in the model, yet perceive their lives to be satisfactory and/or have little stress.</p><p>It was also suggested that the LBM reflects four need dimensions that are universal to humans and influenced by their environments. In other words, people need to engage in culturally relevant activities that meet those need dimensions for optimal satisfaction with life, need satisfaction, and lower stress. And when they are unable to do so, because of environmental constraints (poverty, oppression, illness, etc.), they will not experience life balance, and may perceive poorer satisfaction with life, higher stress, and lower need satisfaction than those who are able to engage in a pattern of activities that meet the four need dimensions. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Whiteford (2009)</ref> observed that life balance is shaped and understood in a Eurocentric discursive tradition and in connection with the labour market issues associated with Western Capitalism. She questioned whether the pursuit of life balance is a universal, cross cultural value and whether life balance is attainable or even relevant in the face of significant forces that mitigate against it. For the older women members of Grandmothers Against Poverty and Aids (GAPA) she interviewed in South Africa, it seemed that they had more important, extra-personal concerns, and life balance was irrelevant. Thus, she concluded that life balance may be a luxury and relevant only to those with adequate fiscal, material and educational resources. Additionally, the need-based dimensions of the LBM may overly reflect a western perspective, where people in other cultures may not identify the same needs as important or may identify an entirely different set of needs.</p><p>If activity identification or value is culture-specific, then one potential strength of the LBM is that the model allows for very different ways to meet the four need dimensions and is not prescriptive in its approach. For example, people from different cultures may engage in very different types of activities, yet meet their needs for meaning, or satisfactory relationships. This assertion remains untested, however and will not be tested in this research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LBM Summary</head><p>The LBM is a theoretical model that conceptualizes life balance and imbalance through their relationships to activity configurations, health and well-being outcomes, and the influence of the environment. Activity configurations are the focus of the LBM where high levels of congruence or equivalence in activity configurations are proposed to lead to a balanced life with resultant lower stress, higher personal well-being and need satisfaction, resulting in positive health and well-being outcomes. Conversely, low levels of congruence or equivalence in activity configurations are proposed to lead to an imbalanced life resulting in higher stress and lower personal well-being and need satisfaction, resulting in negative health and well-being outcomes. Finally, the environment is expected to have an influence on all the dimensions in the model.</p><p>These proposed relationships have not been tested, however, and are the focus of this research. The life balance dimension of the LBM will be tested in this research by examining the relationship between activity configuration congruence and equivalence to the other dimensions in the model, including some aspects of the environment. The proposed relationship between life balance and positive health will not be tested in this research. Furthermore, the life imbalance dimension of the LBM will also not be directly tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Plan</head><p>This research will focus on the life balance dimension of the LBM by examining the relationships between activity configuration congruence and equivalence, and stress, personal well-being and need satisfaction. An instrument was developed to measure activity configuration congruence and equivalence, the Life Balance Inventory (LBI).</p><p>However, because the instrument requires additional validity testing, a second focus of this research will be to examine the LBI for construct validity. If the construct validity of the LBI is supported, then the validity of the underlying theoretical model from which it was built will also be supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Questions and Hypotheses</head><p>This research is a non-experimental, cross sectional design looking for relationships among variables at a given point in time. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows the hypothesized relationships between activity pattern congruence and equivalence, and between the constructs of stress, personal well-being, need satisfaction, and some aspects of the environment that will be tested in this research.</p><p>The overarching research purpose is to examine the construct validity of the Life Balance Inventory (LBI) and the underlying theoretical model, the Life Balance Model (LBM).</p><p>The specific research questions are:</p><p>1. Is there content and construct validity evidence for the Life Balance Inventory (LBI) and its subscales?</p><p>2. Does overall congruence (match between actual and desired time spent in valued activity categories) relate to lower perceived stress, higher personal well-being, and higher need satisfaction? (b, c, d in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>)</p><p>Null hypothesis: There is no relationship between congruence and perceived stress, personal well-being, or need satisfaction, or the relationships are in the opposite direction.</p><p>3. Does equivalence relate to lower perceived stress, higher personal well-being, and higher need satisfaction? (e, f, g in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> )</p><p>Null hypothesis: Equivalence shows no relationship to perceived stress, personal wellbeing, or need satisfaction or the relationships are in the opposite direction.</p><p>4. Is congruence related to equivalence? (a in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>)</p><p>Null hypothesis: congruence is unrelated to equivalence.  The Life Balance Inventory If life balance is a valid and unique construct, worthy of study, with potential implications for individuals, family and societal well-being, then there needs to be a measure of the life balance construct that can be used for research. Without such an instrument, the life balance construct will continue to be weakly defined, poorly understood, and without empirical support. This section will describe the development and pilot testing of the Life Balance Inventory (LBI), the measure for the construct of life balance used in this research.</p><p>The LBI is this researcher's attempt to measure the construct of life balance. The LBI is built on the conceptual life balance model (LBM) framework and was developed to measure congruence and equivalence as central constructs that comprise life balance.</p><p>The LBI is intended to assess perceived congruence between how people want to spend their time in various activity categories and how they actually spend their time in those categories. It is meant to be used for both research and as a personal assessment of life balance that can inform individuals (and/or their counselors) about the balances and imbalances in their lives that may need to be addressed. The LBI was developed to include activity categories that represent common ways of meeting the need-based dimensions reflected in the equivalence component of the LBM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the Life Balance Inventory</head><p>The LBI is a 53 item questionnaire that measures how individuals meet their needs through daily activity configurations. The items are believed to represent common categories of activity that people in Western cultures engage in that meet the need-based dimensions outlined in the model of life balance. The LBI contains four subscales, each containing items intended to reflect one of the LBM dimensions. For example, items such as relaxing and getting regular exercise are in the health subscale and are intended to reflect activities that meet the need-based LBM dimension of maintaining health. Items such as doing things with friends and having an intimate sexual relationship are in the relationships subscale and intended to reflect activities that meet the need-based dimension of having satisfactory relationships. Items such as taking care of your appearance, and participating in religious events are in the identity subscale and intended to reflect activities that meet the need-based dimension of creating a satisfactory identity. Finally, items such as working for pay, making music and gardening are in the challenge/interest subscale and intended to reflect activities that meet the need-based dimension of being challenged and having interests. (See appendix A for the LBI measure.) On a dichotomous scale of yes/no, respondents record whether or not they do each activity or want to do the activity. For each of the items that they do, or want to do, they rate their perceived satisfaction with the amount of time they spent doing that activity in the past month compared to the amount of time they wanted to do the activity as: always less than I want, sometimes less than I want, about right for me, sometimes more than I want, and, always more than I want. This scoring method individualizes the results to reflect the unique activity configuration of each individual by ignoring activities the person does not do or does not want to do.</p><p>The satisfaction ratings for each item reflect the fifth dimension of the life balance model related of organizing time and energy to meet goals. The center score, "about right for me" represents perceived balance (congruence) in that activity, and is scored the highest (3). Ratings of either "too little" or "too much" on any item represent imbalance, and are scored (2) if rated "sometimes" and (1) if rated "always." Scoring of the LBI generates a total average score across all items respondents do or want to do (sum of ratings divided by number of items rated) and reflects the congruence component of the LBM. The four subscales are scored by taking an average satisfaction score across all items respondents do or want to do within the subscale items (sum of ratings divided by number of items rated in the subscale).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of the LBI</head><p>The LBI has been through several iterations since its earliest version created in 2001. The following discussion will describe the development of the LBI used and tested in this research.</p><p>Item Development. The first method used to develop the activity categories for the Life Balance Inventory (LBI) was to create a list of activity categories that represented common ways of meeting the wide range of basic human needs discussed in connection with the LBM. Activity categories include several different activities. For example "getting regular exercise" is considered an activity category because it can be expressed through various activities; swimming, walking, tennis, etc. "Doing things with friends" is another example of a category where the actual activities engaged in with friends can vary greatly (hanging out, going for walks, sharing a meal, etc). The items were meant to be broad, to encompass the various ways people engage in the activity categories. Six scholars in occupational science were solicited in 2002 to collapse or expand the list by eliminating redundancies and adding activity categories that were missing. These experts were asked to respond to whether the activity categories were described with generally accepted meanings and if the categories reflected most activities and contexts of modern life.</p><p>The resultant initial version of the LBI had 30 broad categories of activities thought to relate to basic need fulfillment. Instructions asked respondents to rate the importance of each activity category on a 5 point rating scale (not important to extremely important), and their level of satisfaction with that aspect of their life for each activity category on another 5 point rating scale (not satisfied to extremely satisfied).</p><p>Pilot Test I. The first pilot test of the LBI focused on test-retest reliability. The LBI was administered to a convenience sample of adults between the ages of 18-65 years who were friends, family or acquaintances of the researchers, and graduate students who were gathering data for their theses <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Kleist, 2002)</ref>. After initial approval from the Institutional Review Board, 150 participants were given a consent form, two copies of the LBI, a demographic form, a questionnaire about the LBI, and two stamped envelopes.</p><p>They were instructed to complete and return the forms and the first copy of the LBI and complete and return the second copy of the LBI two weeks later.</p><p>One hundred and eight sets were returned (91 with complete data) out of 150 distributed among 18-65 year olds. The mean age was 39.7 years. Ninety-four percent were Caucasian, and 58 percent were female (demographics in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>importance items respondents completed initially and two weeks later (p .000).</p><p>Correlation coefficients for the satisfaction ratings at the two points in time were .60 or above for 16 of the 30 items (p&lt; .000). Finally, respondents completed a questionnaire that asked open ended questions about whether the LBI mentioned all the activity categories that were important and meaningful to them, and if not, to indicate the activity categories that were missed. The questionairre also asked respondents to indicate how they felt about completing the LBI and whether or not they found it useful. Most respondents reported that it was easy to answer, thought provoking, and covered most aspects of their lives. Some respondents reported confusion about how to rate a satisfaction level for an activity category that they also rated as not important. Most respondents reported some new insight as a result of taking the LBI, such as being pleased that they were relatively balanced or satisfied, or recognizing some areas that needed to be changed for greater life satisfaction.</p><p>As a result of the feedback from the respondents, five new items representing additional activity categories were created and one was deleted. The five new activity categories were: eating nutritiously, getting adequate sleep, caring for pets, personal hygiene, and managing money. The item that was deleted was having a balance of daily activities as it seemed redundant. Some items were also reworded for clarity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pilot Test II</head><p>The revised 34-item LBI was further refined for clarity and comprehensiveness.</p><p>These revisions were: 1) adding 20 items that increased the activity specificity, 2)</p><p>revising the scaling, and 3) clarifying instructions as recommended by participants after 3 think-aloud tests (where participants say what they are thinking as they fill out the measure). The additional 20 items added specificity to many of the items. For example "Participating in outdoor sports" was revised to include "participating in organized sports" and "doing outdoor activities (hunting, fishing)" and "communing with nature."</p><p>Another notable revision was made in the way the LBI was rated and scored.</p><p>Instead of rating every activity category item for "importance" and then for "satisfaction" as the phase I LBI had asked respondents to do, the revised LBI asked respondents to only rate activity categories they "do or want to do." This eliminated the confusion about rating levels of satisfaction with activities that were not important to the respondents. For activities respondents "do or want to do" the scaling became: always less than I want, sometimes less than I want, about right for me, sometimes more than I want, and always more than I want. This revised rating scale was intended to more precisely elicit respondents' perceptions of balance and to be applicable to both too much and too little time, both of which are balance perceptions.</p><p>After human subjects ethics review, the pilot test of the revised LBI was conducted in February, 2008 with 282 primarily white (96%) females (90%) ranging in age from 19 years to 90 years (mean =42.8 years). Although primarily white and female, the participants were quite diverse in age, level of education, marital status, number of children living with them, employment status, and type of community where they lived.</p><p>See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> for demographic information about the sample.</p><p>The data in pilot test II were subjected to Rasch analysis using the Winsteps program <ref type="bibr">(version 3.62.1;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Linacre, 2006)</ref>. Rasch analysis was used to obtain valuable information about the LBI at the item level and about its rating scale structure that is not available using classical test development processes. In the Rasch analysis, the ordinal data were transformed to interval data through a series of logarithmic calculations. The 53 responses on the revised LBI and the people taking the LBI were placed on the same hierarchical scale according to their relative ability or trait of balance. The items that most respondents reported "about right for me" (or balance) were placed lowest on a balance continuum and the items rarely rated "about right for me" even for the most balanced individuals (highest overall scores) were placed highest on the balance continuum. The analysis showed that the items were capturing a range of balance traits and that the items fit intuitively with the model of life balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Matuska &amp; Christiansen, 2008)</ref>. For most common everyday activity categories, people felt the time used for these activities was "about right for me." It took a high level of overall balance, however, to also be satisfied with dance, travel, exercise, art composition, music (the items listed high on the item map). This indicated that the people with the highest balance scores, also felt that they spent time in those activities as they wanted ("about right for me"), and people with low overall balance scores were less likely to be satisfied with the time spent in those activities.</p><p>Finally, the items that discriminated best between high and low overall balance were:</p><p>doing things with friends, participating in groups (clubs, etc), participating in organized sports, doing outdoor activities (hunting, fishing), communing with nature, and doing crafts/hobbies.</p><p>Phase II pilot data indicated that all the items on the LBI as a whole fit the expectations of the Rasch model, meaning that each item contributed positively to the total score <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Thorndike, 2006)</ref>. The internal consistency was good (r =.89) meaning 89 % of observed score variance is the true score variance and 11% is measurement error variance. Since Rasch analysis results in scores that are at the interval level, inferential testing of the LBI was now possible.</p><p>LBI Critique. Construct validity of the LBI is a major focus of the present study.</p><p>The LBI is intended to provide information about two components of life balance. First, it is intended to measure congruence between desired and actual time spent across a broad configuration of activities. This is reported as the total average satisfaction score. The expectation is that closer congruence between desired and actual time spent in activities will be related to greater need satisfaction, higher personal well-being, and lower perceived stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Sheldon, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Sheldon et al., 2008)</ref>. Second, the LBI is intended to provide information about activity configuration equivalence, the perceived satisfaction across the need-based dimensions of the LBM, 1) health, 2) relationships, 3) identity, and 4) challenge/interest. The expectation is that when there is a similar perceived average satisfaction across the four LBI subscales, there will be an associated greater need satisfaction, higher personal well-being, and lower perceived stress.</p><p>Phases has not been tested for validity. To test the LBM, an appropriate instrument was needed that measured the key constructs of the model. The LBI was created to measure both congruence and equivalence in activity configurations, the two key constructs in the LBM proposed to lead to life balance. As described in this chapter, the LBI was pilot tested for content validity, but additional testing is needed to support its construct validity. There needs to be evidence that the relationships proposed in the LBM occur with expected strength, and in the directions predicted. Testing the relationships between activity configuration congruence and equivalence (using the LBI), and stress, personal well-being, need satisfaction, and the environment (depicted in the LBM) is a necessary next step for validity of both the model and measure, and is the focus of this research.</p><p>Chapter 2</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Historical Context for Balanced Living 1</head><p>The idea that living balanced lives will lead to health and well-being has persisted for centuries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Aristotle (1908)</ref> described human flourishing in the context of life activities that were virtuous and balanced to the interests, goals, values and capabilities of the individual. Hippocrates, and later Galen, each maintained that emotions influenced physical health, and these ideas persisted well into the middle ages <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Sternberg, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Teachings from belief systems ranging from Chinese medicine to Native American healing hold that maintaining health requires a balance among thoughts, actions and feelings, and that the physical and social environments in which people live provide them with both opportunities and challenges for meeting needs and maintaining well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alter, 1999)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Pierce (2003)</ref> observed that in Western cultures, an understanding of life balance is deeply rooted in the history of society such as the changes emanating from the ________________________________________________________________________ protestant reformation, industrialization, and Victorian ideals. These periods changed daily patterns of living through introducing modern forms of paid work and other changes, and adaptation was necessary, such as creating new emphasis on leisure and dealing with health problems associated with sedentary lives. A common theme across the ages has been that well-being and happiness can be promoted by patterns of activities that reflect a satisfactory relationship with self, others and the environment.</p><p>Unfortunately, in modern living, the social, economic, political and cultural environments are not wholly supportive of people creating balanced lives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modern Context for Balanced Living</head><p>The Global Burden of Disease Study projected that the majority of the conditions that will consume worldwide health resources by the year 2020, can be directly or indirectly related to Western lifestyles <ref type="bibr">(World Health Organization, 2008)</ref>. Some of these conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and motor vehicle crashes are directly related to unhealthy or unsafe lifestyle habits. Others, such as unipolar major depression, substance abuse, and self-inflicted injury (suicide), can be traced to life circumstances that are not perceived by the individuals affected to be enjoyable, meaningful, or worthy of engagement. These have been aptly termed diseases of meaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Jobst, 2006)</ref>. The alarming incidence of meaning-related conditions creates a compelling need for a reappraisal of the personal and environmental factors that create social conditions which exceed the coping resources of individuals and families and make life seem unbearable.</p><p>Evidence of perceived life imbalance is widespread within developed countries as seen in increased reports of stressful lives. For example, in the United States during 1994 and 1995, over half of surveyed respondents reported experiencing "a lot" or "moderate" stress during the previous year <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bachmann, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Robinson, &amp; Godbey, 1997)</ref>. A study by the Conference Board of Canada that found the number of Canadians who reported moderate and high levels of stress as a result of perceived work-family imbalance increased from 26.7% in 1989 to 46.2% in 1999 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bachmann, 2000)</ref>. One of the most significant social transformations of the past few decades has been the increase in the total time spent at the workplace by couples, essentially driven by the substantial rise in the labor market participation of women <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Marshall, 2009)</ref>. The combined paid work hours of couples increased from an average of 58 per week in 1976 to 65 in 2008. The number of dual-earner couples rose from 1.9 million (43% of couples) to 4.2 million (68% of couples) <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Marshall, 2009)</ref>. Although there is some evidence that parents are spending more time with their children <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bianchi, 2000)</ref> there is also evidence of increased pressure and stress in families trying to juggle work-life demands <ref type="bibr">(Bond, Thompson, Galinsky, &amp; Prottas, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Beck &amp; Arnold, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The link between lifestyles, stress, and health has become increasingly clear with genesis in early research showing the need to re-establish homeostasis after disruptive life changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cannon, 1939)</ref>, and the bodily reaction to stressful life demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Selye, 1946)</ref>.</p><p>In the past quarter century, perhaps because of the growing recognition that psychosocial factors play a major role in the most prevalent and costly health conditions of our time, there has been a renewed interest in lifestyle factors and their influence on our health, particularly as these factors relate to the body's stress responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Baum, Garofalo, &amp; Yali, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">McEwen, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Seeman, Singer, Ryff, Love, &amp; Levy-Storms, 2002</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref>Research relating cumulative stress to mental and physical health is extensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kemeny, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Kiecolt-Glaser, McGuire, Robles, &amp; Glaser, 2002)</ref>.

They identify competence, autonomy and relatedness as the fundamental psychological needs that must be satisfied for self-organization and relations with society. Deci and Ryan propose that satisfaction of these needs is associated with effective functioning and that negative consequences will result from their neglect.</p><p>According to Self Determination Theory, then, well-being requires competence and flexibility to interact effectively with a changing environment; relatedness to connect meaningfully with others and integrate into society; and autonomy for self-regulation of actions and to be true to one's identity.</p><p>Considered together, Maslow's need hierarchy, Ryff's Psychological Well-being Theory, and Deci &amp; Ryans Self-Determination Theory propose need categories that are similar to each of the need-based dimensions proposed in the LBM (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). The need-based theories mentioned above form the empirical foundation underlying the LBM's focus on how key needs are met or are not met through activity choices. Because life is complex, it is likely that a person's activity choices at any one instant will be motivated by a multitude of factors with changing influences. Moreover, people often make choices that, in hindsight, are contrary to their best interests.

An assumption underlying the LBM is that without good health, the likelihood of sustaining activities to meet other critical needs is diminished. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows that the LBM and Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory address physiological needs directly, but physiological needs are ignored in the Self Determination theory and Psychological Wellbeing Theory.</p><p>One of the key influences to physiological health is managing stress. This ability has direct relevance to the LBM because stress is related to life choices. Research has established that chronic stress can have serious health consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(McEwen &amp; Lasley, 2002)</ref>, whether resulting from situations where people are feeling constantly pressed for time, or because people live in environments that do not enable them to pursue a satisfying pattern of activities that supports human flourishing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>________________________________________________________________________</head><p>The negative physical effects of chronic stress on health can be measured as allostatic load, or the cumulative effect of ten physiologic responses to stress: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist-hip ratio, serum HDL, cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin, serum DHEA-S, cortisol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(McEwen &amp; Lasley, 2002)</ref>. When allostatic load is elevated over a long period, the physiological responses are harmful to the body, and can contribute to cardiovascular disease and immune response suppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(McEwen &amp; Lasley, 2002)</ref>. Stress has also been associated</p><p>with depression, disrupted sleep patterns, memory problems, obesity, and various other health conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Sapolsky, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Given the significant impact of stress on health and well-being, a balanced life would be one where stress is managed in a way that minimizes its long term negative effects. Considerable research has shown that there are certain life choices that buffer against stress and improve overall health. For example, regular exercise has been associated with decreased stress response <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Skully, Kremer, Meade, Graham, &amp; Dudgeon, 1998)</ref>, improved sleep (Youngstedt, O'Connor, &amp; Dishman, 1997), and decreased depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Craft &amp; Landers, 1998)</ref>.

Therefore, this factor is considered one of the key need-based dimensions in the model of a balanced life.</p><p>Have rewarding and self-affirming relationships with others.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">foot_4</ref> Relationship needs are clearly addressed in the LBM, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory (affiliation) Self Determination Theory (relatedness), and the Psychological Well-being Theory (positive relations with others) as displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Having rewarding and self-affirming relationships with others is also well supported in the literature. For example, socially supportive environments have been associated with psychological well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Thompson &amp; Heller, 1990)</ref>, quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Achat, et al, 1998)</ref>, higher cognitive performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Seeman, Lusignolo, Albert, &amp; Berckman, 2001)</ref>, and healthy aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Gurung, Taylor, &amp; Seeman, 2003)</ref>. Socially supportive family environments have long term effects in children by reducing their risk for mental health disorders, chronic diseases, and early mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Repetti, Taylor, &amp; Seeman, 2002)</ref>. Even when people live in stressful situations such as in low socioeconomic conditions, social support seems to lower stress associated with living in impoverished environments <ref type="bibr">(Taylor &amp; Seemen, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>The link of positive relationships to overall health status has growing evidence with strong associations found between social support and specific physiological functions, including the cardiovascular, immune and endocrine systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Uchino, Cacioppo, &amp; Kiecolt-Glaser, 1996)</ref>. Social support also appears to be a buffer to stress because it has been linked to lower levels of allostatic load (Kiecolt-Glaser, <ref type="bibr">McGuire, al., 2004)</ref>. The positive physiological benefits of social support have also been shown to reduce worker sickness and absenteeism. In research on middle aged employees, workers with satisfactory social support reported significantly less sickness and less absenteeism than workers who did not have satisfactory social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Melchoir, Niedhammer, Berkman, &amp; Goldberg, 2003)</ref>. Additionally, studies show that even when people become ________________________________________________________________________ ill, better recovery from the illness and less onset of disability in activities of daily living is fostered by social support (Mendes de <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Leon, et al, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>One component of healthy relationships that requires more research involves understanding the balance between care for self and care for others. Healthy relationships involve both giving and receiving support, but little is known about a healthy balance between the two. Care giving can be deeply meaningful, but in excess it can be depleting as well. The Western focus on individualism is also contrasted by the Eastern values of collectivism, and these cultural differences can influence one's perception of optimal balance. In other words the meaning of activities or the needs met by doing activities may look different with people from different world views. Caring for elders for example, may have a more positive meaning, and meet needs of establishing a positive identity, or fostering a rewarding relationship for people with a collectivist worldview; whereas, care-giving may feel more like a burden for people with an individualist worldview <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Whiteford, 2009)</ref>. The LBM does not prescribe activity patterns necessary for healthy relationships, but proposes that the meaning and satisfaction with chosen activity patterns in context influences perceived balance.</p><p>Feel engaged, challenged, and competent. The LBM proposes that an important component of a balanced life includes opportunities to feel competent and engaged through activities that are interesting and challenging. The idea of challenge, engagement, and competence as representing important needs is also evident in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory (aesthetics/cognition), Self Determination Theory (competence), and the Psychological Well-being Theory (personal growth) as displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Engagement in activities is fundamental to life because it is through the active transactions with people, places and things in an environment that people develop a sense of competence and self-efficacy. This contributes to identity and creates meaning in lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Christiansen, 1999)</ref>. When people are successful in their actions to meet their needs and fulfill their roles, they develop mastery, which increases their sense of competence and self-efficacy.</p><p>This leads to a willingness to try other novel or challenging things <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bandura, 1977</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bandura, , 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bandura, , 2001))</ref>. Since life is continually changing, people need to have the ability to respond to these challenges in new ways that allow them to continue to grow as individuals.</p><p><ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> Competency and efficacy are not only important for continued adaptation to the demands of living; they also have been linked to well-being and quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000)</ref>. A sense of control over one's personal environment relates to competency and efficacy and is fundamental to life and drives behavior. For example, the ability to make decisions and control many of the events in life has been linked to improved alertness, participation in daily activities, and well-being in nursing home residents <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Langer &amp; Rodin, 1976)</ref>. In a study of personal project dimensions on 120 adults, Christiansen, Backman, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Little, &amp; Nguyen (1999)</ref> found that efficacy and stress were the factors explaining the most variation in well-being. Efficacy emerged as a central factor in explaining progress and outcome, and was significantly related to the dimension of project meaning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Britt and Bliese (2003)</ref> also found that being personally self-engaged in activities was related to well-being of soldiers in stressful situations through its effect as a stress-buffer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>________________________________________________________________________</head><p>The idea of an optimal person-environment match for a sense of well-being was researched extensively by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Csikszentmihalyi (1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Csikszentmihalyi ( , 1997))</ref>. He described a phenomenon termed "flow" that occurs when people have a sense of control over what they're doing, where they feel competent and efficacious in their ability to do the activity, where they know the goal of the activity and receive feedback from their efforts, and where time is suspended because they are deeply involved in the activity for its own sake. This optimal state is achieved when there is a balance between high skill and high challenge resulting in enjoyment, interest and motivation. In contrast, activities that provide low challenge and require low or medium skills result in apathy or boredom <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Persson, Eklund, &amp; Isacsson, 1999)</ref>. The physical and psychological consequences of engagement and participation in activities can range from emotional rewards (such as pleasure and satisfaction) to increased knowledge and wisdom and a sense of life meaning and are important for a balanced life.</p><p>Create meaning and a positive personal identity. 7 Frankl (1984) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Antonovsky (1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Antonovsky ( ,1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Antonovsky ( , 2003) )</ref> are among prominent scientists who have asserted the importance of creating meaning (or life purpose) in human flourishing, suggesting that it may be the life characteristic that is most important for resilience under stressful conditions. Meaning and identity are also considered important needs in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory (self actualization), Self Determination Theory (autonomy), and the Psychological Wellbeing Theory (self acceptance, purpose in life, autonomy) as displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</p></div>

In pursuing meaningful lives and creating a positive identity, people engage in an array of activities, some of which are related to understanding of their situations at the moment and others pertaining to evaluating purpose in their lives over the longer course. These activities range from regular meditation and contemplation during walks in the forest for example, to more formal rituals and fellowship embodied in the activities and worship of organized religion, for example. These spiritual activities, and their meanings, need to be fully considered in studies of lifestyle and health.</p><p>A physically healthy lifestyle but with little meaning, may be insufficient for a balanced life <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Ryff, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Reker, Peacock, &amp; Wong, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Wong, 2000)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Maslow (1970)</ref> distinguished between people who are merely healthy and those who are transcenders.</p><p>The transcenders are those who live more at the level of being, who have more peak experiences and are motivated to a greater good beyond them. Similarly, Victor <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Frankl (1984)</ref> believed that "Man's search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life" (p.</p><p>121). Frankl considered finding meaning as fundamental to our existence and that we accomplish it by creating or doing, experiencing people or things, and by the attitude we take towards suffering. This ability to find meaningfulness in our everyday events, even in deplorable circumstances makes the difference between a life worth living and despair.</p><p>Other theorists support the belief that a prolonged existence without meaning, values or ideals creates boredom and apathy, lack of personal fulfillment, personal distress, and illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Frankl, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Maslow, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Yalom, 1980)</ref>.</p><p>The inadequacy of defining health as the merely the absence of symptoms is clear when one considers why two individuals given similar illnesses have remarkably different life outcomes or why individuals considered physically robust can be at the brink of despair. Certainly, some of these differences are related to how different actions are experienced and interpreted. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Persson, Erlandsson, Eklund, &amp; Iwarsson (2001)</ref> described value dimensions of activities and related these to how people assign meaning to what they do. Based on their research, they concluded that personal meaning is based on the perceived value underlying action and that individuals, within the context of their lives and situations, interpret meanings uniquely.</p><p>Yet, although they are highly individual, such meanings must also have coherence. Aaron <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Antonovsky (1979)</ref> proposed a salutogenic model of health that emphasized factors that keep people healthy. His clinical work revealed that a basic attitude of experiencing the world as manageable, meaningful and comprehensible seemed to contribute to a sense of coherence that was central to maintaining health.</p><p>According to Antonovsky, this attitude reduced states of tension and was related to increased health promoting behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Antonovsky, 1987)</ref>.</p><p>Other researchers have found that living a meaningful existence or having a purpose in life is associated with well-being. Studies of personal projects have shown that having projects with personal meaning in and relating to one's identity are associated with greater well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Christiansen, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Little, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Little &amp; Chambers, 2003)</ref>. Of particular interest in these studies is the finding that people make time for those goalrelated activities that are viewed as important by themselves and others. In summary, there is abundant empirical evidence supporting the importance of having lives that engender the creation of meaning and a positive identity.</p><p>Organize time and energy in ways that enable them to meet important personal goals and renewal. In order to meet needs, the LBM suggests that people must manage the multiple demands on their time sufficiently to accomplish their goals and create opportunities for energy renewal. Lay understandings of life balance universally involve the perceived time-stress associated with social pressures to fit more activities within a timeframe that cannot be expanded. In contemporary Western society, there is a growing perception that the routine demands of living exceed the time available for them, and that there is insufficient time to rest or participate in discretionary pursuits or to accomplish workrelated tasks at desired performance levels <ref type="bibr">(Robinson &amp; Godfrey, 1997)</ref>. Time is seen as a commodity that must be rationed <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Peloquin, 1990)</ref> and results in stress when there is a perceived press for time or multiple demands on time.</p><p>Time management can also be viewed as activity management because it represents a planned and purposeful choice of which activities will be engaged in over time. As the LBM suggests, a balanced life would be one where there is satisfaction in the congruency between desired and actual use of time. One approach to finding congruency is using time management strategies that organize attention and energy for satisfactory completion of daily activities. This was demonstrated in several studies of college students who typically have multiple demands on their time. Compared to college students who had poor time management, students who used effective time management strategies demonstrated less stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Misra &amp; McKean, 2000)</ref>, and had better academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Britton &amp; Tesser, 1991)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Activity Configuration Congruence</head><p>One of the earliest studies that supported the concept of congruence in activities was by <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Seleen (1982)</ref>, who found that for older adults, perceived congruence between desired and actual time use among ten categories of activities was related to life satisfaction. Arguably, the congruence between actual and desired time use could be construed as balance but the authors did not describe it as such. <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Wilcock, Hall, &amp; Hambley, (1997)</ref> also found that ideal balance was represented by Australian respondents as approximately equal involvement in physical, mental, social and rest activities, and a significant relationship was found between the closeness of current activity patterns to those perceived by the respondents to be ideal and his or her reported health. The congruent idea was also supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Håkansson, Dahlin-Ivanoff, Sonn, (2006)</ref> who found that women with stress-related disorders reported a sense of balance (that they felt was synonymous with well-being) when they had a harmonious repertoire of daily activities that were meaningful and created a positive self image, and when they used strategies to manage and control everyday life.</p><p>The research reported above explored what people actually do versus what they desire to do, and their self-reported levels of satisfaction in certain areas. This may be confounded by psychological traits such as neuroticism or other affective states and may be difficult to differentiate from personal well being, life satisfaction, or other positive states. In other words, self-reported satisfaction with daily activities may not actually reflect life balance it may just reflect a personality trait of the person reporting. If perceived life balance yields personal well being, happiness, or other positive psychological states, then there is the question of whether or not researchers can differentiate life balance from these constructs. For example, if we expect that people who report having balanced lives will also report more life satisfaction or happiness (or any other positive state), then, is life balance and life satisfaction or happiness so related that they cannot be differentiated? Are they essentially the same thing?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Activity Configuration Equivalence</head><p>In multiple studies with samples from United States, India, and Australia, <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Sheldon, Cummins &amp; Khamble (2008)</ref> found that life balance was a unique construct and the discrepancy among desired and actual time use in daily activities related to need satisfaction and personal well being in significant and predictable ways. They also found that relatively equal apportionment of time across ten activity categories: sleeping, school/or paid work, household chores, community activities, recreation, commuting, relationships, health and self-care, spirituality or religious activities, predicted need satisfaction and personal well being, but less robustly than the discrepancy of time use predicted lack of need satisfaction and lower personal well-being. The relative equal apportionment is critical here. It does not make intuitive sense that the same amount of time should be spent in each of the 10 activities. Commuting, for example seems suspect.</p><p>In a given day most people would consistently show differences in time use in the 10 activities and perhaps this measure might only be useful when extreme time use differences are noted in any one or two of the activities, i.e. large number of hours at work, small number of hours sleeping. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Sheldon, et al.'s (2008)</ref> method of conceptualizing life balance through time use was supported by their findings that balanced time use predicts personal well-being and need satisfaction and they concluded that life balance may be a unique construct, worthy of further study.</p><p>The research on time use above, that studied desired versus actual time allocation among activities, and equal apportionment of time across activities related to health, comes close to the LBM except they do not address the outcome of stress and limit their activities to 10 categories. The LBM is not limited to 10 major activity categories, suggesting that any activity that meets the need dimensions should be included. As an example, such activities as art, music, or writing might be extremely important to some people even if engaged in only rarely in a given time period.</p><p>The combined research on activity patterns suggests that certain configurations of activities or attitudes about activities relate to need satisfaction or personal well-being.</p><p>None of them have tested that relationship to life balance directly, although some have shown how activity configurations relate to other positive outcomes such as well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Cummins, 2009)</ref>. The present research will test the relationship between activity configurations, life balance, and stress, personal well-being, and need satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Life Balance: Alternative Perspectives</head><p>The LBM associates activity configurations described above with either a balanced life or imbalanced life. High equivalence and high congruence of activity configurations is expected to relate to life balance and conversely, low equivalence or low congruence of activity configurations is expected to relate to life imbalance. Other researchers have theorized life balance in very different ways. The following discussion will summarize the two broad categories of research addressing life balance: studies that examined characteristics of daily activities (role balance, experiential balance, occupational integrity, time use), and studies that examined the outcomes of life choices (happiness, need satisfaction). Perspectives in these studies will be compared and contrasted with those in the LBM.</p><p>First, there is the question of whether or not life balance is a legitimate concept, worthy of research. Philosophically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Birchenbach and Glass (2009)</ref> questioned whether balanced living is necessarily desirable. They challenged popular press ideas of life imbalance suggesting that it may not be a problem for some people and that researchers should not discount variations of lifestyles by turning them into problems, particularly medical problems (i.e. too much work creates health problems). They warn of dangers in prescribing a one size fits all lifestyle and question whether medical or professional judgements should be made in this area. Their argument points to the importance of considering the outcome of life for each unique individual (such as contentment, happiness, accomplishment, etc.) rather than the specific repertoire of activities people engage in on a daily basis.</p><p>It seems that <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Birchenbach and Glass (2009)</ref>  Life balance viewed as role balance. Sociologists often view lifestyles through role fulfillment which has some similarities to the activity configuration concept in the LBM. Research about roles has consistently found that participation in valued roles is related to life satisfaction and measures of well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Verbrugge, 1983)</ref>. Too much conflict among multiple roles can be associated with stress <ref type="bibr">(Goode, 1960</ref>), yet having more social roles typically has beneficial consequences, since it may enable the individual to have access to more social support and reduce a person's vulnerability to stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Linville, 1987)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Marks and MacDermid (1996)</ref> showed that finding a way to balance multiple demands on one's time and role responsibilities correlated with peoples' perception of ease and satisfaction for adequately meeting daily role demands. They found that positive role balance was reflected in a person's "tendency to become fully engaged in the performance of every role in one's total role system, to approach every typical role and role partner with an attitude of attentiveness and care" <ref type="bibr">(1996, p. 421)</ref>.</p><p>People who maintained more balance across their entire role systems had lower reported stress, lower rates of depression, and higher self-esteem and overall well-being than people who did not have balance among their roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Marks &amp; MacDermid, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Although research on roles has provided insight into some factors that contribute to or alleviate the consequences of life stress, studies have generally failed to provide information about the patterns or types of specific activities and practices that typify the roles of the most (or least) successful study participants. Research on roles does not help us understand daily lives because engagement in activities could fulfill more than one role, i.e. cooking dinner with children could fulfill the role of parent or the role of homemaker. Conversely, activities chosen to fulfill roles will vary significantly among individuals. For example, one mother may feel that cooking nutritious meals for regular family dinners is important whereas another mother may find that less important and emphasize taking her children to activities (that often interfere with regular meals). Thus, for one mother (but not another), cooking is important, and if the pressures of life make it so that she cannot cook as much as she would like to, she may report feeling imbalanced.</p><p>The LBM emphasizes daily activity patterns rather than specific roles because engagement in activities could fulfill more than one role.</p><p>Life balance viewed as experiential balance. From an occupational science perspective, <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Persson and Jonsson (2009)</ref> propose a model of experiential balance whereby they believe a balanced mix of types of everyday experiences is important for health and well-being. They define 3 key experience dimensions in daily activities:</p><p>"highly or moderately challenging experiences that are matched with high skills (challenging, intense, but rewarding), highly challenging experiences that are not matched with high skills (somewhat stressful, stretches one's ability level), and low to moderately challenging experiences (not challenging, routine, little effort required). They theorize that all three experience types and their relationships are important for achieving balance in life, meaning that none of them is intrinsically positive or negative <ref type="bibr">(Persson &amp; Jonsson, 2009, p 137)</ref>. being able to say "no") and living with the consequences of making choices that may let others down or incur disapproval from the environment. The failure to make activity choices from a stance of personal values over time will negatively affect our well being <ref type="bibr">(Pentland &amp; McColl)</ref>.</p><p>Like the <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Persson and Jonsson (2009)</ref> model discussed previously, the model of occupational integrity by <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Pentland and McColl (2009)</ref> describes living in congruence with values as the single most important aspect of balanced living, but it falls short of addressing the full complement of life choices. For example, it is conceivable that a person might value hard work and believe that providing financial support to his/her family is the single most important thing to do, but this value may not match family members' values, creating stress. Additionally, this model does not address the physiological needs that are affected by life choices. Living with integrity aligns with one of the 5 dimensions in the LBM, meaning and the development of a satisfactory personal identity but does not explain a balanced life along other dimensions.</p><p>Research that considers life outcomes would be a potential way of addressing the differences in everyday activities across cultures. For example, if people (in any culture)</p><p>were given opportunities to create lives that were satisfactory to them, would they have better overall life outcomes than people who cannot create satisfactory lives? This line of inquiry would help determine the universality of life balance without imposing culturally laden values on the types of activities that necessarily make up peoples' lives.</p><p>Life balance viewed as happiness. From a sociological perspective, Veenhoven (2009) agreed that researching life outcomes has theoretical and empirical value. He described three potential ways to assess life balance and asserted that depending on which approach is chosen, the results will be quite different. For example, should balance be a subjective sense of how balanced people think they are? Should it be based on a preconceived idea of what balance should be (so much time in certain activities)? Or is balance a life-style-mix that yields the most happiness? He asserted that balance reflects best in satisfaction with life-as-a-whole, that is, in happiness. A life full of short lived pleasures is not necessarily a balanced life and neither is a life with incidental peak experiences. Likewise, satisfaction in particular domains of life does not denote balanced living, such as having high job-satisfaction if it is costing low satisfaction with family life <ref type="bibr">(Veenhoven)</ref>. With this perspective of life balance, research would focus on subjective appraisals of lives and compare and contrast lifestyles that bring the most and least levels of happiness.</p><p>This approach is consistent with the LBM whereby life balance is conceived by the subjective outcome of the configuration of everyday activities as a whole. The difference is in the outcome of interest. In the LBM, need satisfaction is the outcome of interest, rather than happiness. One could argue that need satisfaction and happiness are highly related to each other, or that they at least share some variance related to a balanced life. Sorting out these confounding variables to a balanced life will be important for future research.</p><p>Life balance viewed as need satisfaction. Another way to conceptualize life balance from a psychological perspective is to focus on whether or not daily activities are deemed satisfactory for meeting needs considered essential for health and well-being. In four studies using multiple designs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Sheldon &amp; Niemiec (2006)</ref> found that a balance of satisfaction in relatedness, autonomy, and competence, the three need areas in Self Determination Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000)</ref> had unique additive effects on psychological well-being (equivelance). In other words, people who experienced balanced need satisfaction (similar scores across need areas) reported higher well-being than those with greater variability in need satisfaction, even when the sum of total scores was equal.</p><p>Later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Sheldon (2009)</ref> found that people with non-discrepant (or congruent) time use had significantly higher need satisfaction than those who had imbalanced (incongruent) time use. This higher level of need satisfaction was in turn, associated with personal wellbeing. In other words, their research suggested that balanced (equivalent and congruent) lives helped people meet their psychological needs and positively impacted their personal well-being. This research along with the balanced time research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Sheldon et al. (2008)</ref> mentioned above was highly influential in the development of the LBI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stress</head><p>The importance of stress to overall health and well-being outcomes was described in the earlier section discussing the physiological need based dimension of the LBM. The evidence reported clearly linked stress to poor health outcomes.</p><p>The importance of rewarding relationships is one of the need-based dimensions of the LBM. If important family relationships are strained, it may influence life balance.</p><p>There is a large body of literature about family stress, much of it built from family stress theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hill, 1949;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">1971;</ref><ref type="bibr">2003)</ref> where it is believed that if the stress is severe enough, and for a long enough period of time, it could lead to physical, emotional or relational crisis within families. In such a crisis, then, the need dimension of rewarding relationships may not be met. Different theorists have explanations for how families cope with stress, one of the most prominent being the double ABCX model of family stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(McCubbin &amp; Patterson, 1983)</ref>, where adequate family resources and supports, and family perceptions and self-efficacy are seen as buffers to stress. According to the LBM, family stress will likely be an influence on life balance, and an individual or family's ability to create balance lives may be an influence on perceived stress (or a stress buffer).</p><p>This research will explore the relationship between stress and life balance as perceived by individuals, an untested association. Additional research will be needed to explore relationships between family stress and life balance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective Well-being</head><p>Subjective well-being (SWB) is a field of psychology that attempts to understand people's evaluations of their lives. Subjective well-being (SWB) refers to how people evaluate their lives, and includes variables such as life satisfaction and marital satisfaction, lack of depression and anxiety, and positive moods and emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Diener, Suh, &amp; Oishi, 1997</ref>). People's goals, cognitive styles, and activities are also likely influences of SWB <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Diener, et al., 1997)</ref>. External circumstances are often less important to SWB but extreme situational differences such as that between life in the wealthiest and poorest nations do appear to affect SWB. Additionally, values are related to positive SWB in that people who are involved in goal-directed activities that they believe are important are more likely to experience feelings of well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Diener, et al., 1997)</ref>. The idea that goals, activities, and values influence SWB suggests that people who report life balance may also report high SWB. Subjective well-being is expected to have a positive relationship with life balance. If people report activity configuration congruence and activity configuration equivalence, the LBM suggests that they will have an overall positive appraisal of their lives, or subjective well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Need Satisfaction</head><p>The LBM proposes that meeting the four need-based dimensions is important for a balanced life. These need-based dimensions were explained in detail in Chapter one.</p><p>Validation of the LBM will require the need-based dimensions to be compared with expected outcomes in related areas. According to the LBM, equivalence and congruence in activity configurations would mean that the need-based dimensions are met. One way to test this assumption is to compare LBM equivalence and congruence with a measure of need satisfaction to see if they are related as would be expected.</p><p>attractive parks and recreational facilities, represent helpful environmental features for maintaining an exercise regimen.

For example, among 3000 older tenants in 153 planned housing units, living in safe, quiet, and small communities accounted for a significant proportion of variance in every index of well-being. The LBM accounts for the profound impact of the environment on activity choices and opportunities, the various ways that needs are met given the context and that in some contexts, essential needs cannot be met.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>The concept of life balance has been considered for centuries and has had different meanings in different historical contexts. There appears to be accumulating empirical support for the interaction of certain patterns of living and healthy life outcomes as conceptualized in the LBM. The need-based dimensions of the LBM were supported through interdisciplinary research and theories. There are many gaps in what is known about life balance, however, with very little research testing the construct directly.</p><p>There is no universally agreed-upon definition of the term, conceptualizations of the life balance construct are widely different, and measures used in life balance research have tested different constructs and have not been validated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>The Life Balance Model (LBM) proposes that activity congruence (match between desired and actual time spent in activities) and equivalence (equal perceived satisfaction across four activity need-based dimensions) represent the construct of a balanced life. The purpose of this research is to find evidence for the validity of the Life Balance Inventory (LBI), the instrument used to measure the construct of life balance proposed in the LBM (also lending validity to the LBM). The development and pilot testing of the LBI was described in Chapter one. This current research tested the LBM predicted relationships between life balance and stress, need satisfaction and personal well-being. Each of these variables were measured using tools and procedures described below and were tested for their relationship to congruence and equivalence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures Used</head><p>Life Balance Inventory. The LBI is an instrument developed by the researcher to measure life balance. Its theoretical foundation is the lifestyle balance model <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Matuska &amp; Christiansen, 2008)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">, 2006)</ref>. Each domain has been regressed with "satisfaction with life as a whole" with results showing that each domain makes a unique contribution to the explained variance <ref type="bibr">(International Wellbeing Group, 2006)</ref>. Convergent validity (relationship to an instrument measuring a similar construct) evidence was demonstrated (r = .78) with another well known subjective well being measure, the Satisfaction with Life Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Diener, Emmons, Larsen, &amp; Griffin, 1985)</ref>. The PWI-A has demonstrated good sensitivity, and acceptable reliability, (test-retest reliability, with intra-class correlation of .84) and Cronbach alpha between .70 and .85. The PWI-A was chosen for this study rather than the Satisfaction with Life Scale because, although they both measure the same construct (well-being), the PWI-A can be analyzed at the level of individual domains that may be useful in subsequent analysis of the data from this research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basic Psychological Needs Scale (BPNS).</head><p>The Basic Psychological Needs Scale (BPNS) was developed according to the Self Determination Theory (SDT) proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Deci &amp; Ryan, (2000)</ref>. According to the SDT theory, it is assumed that some basic psychological needs are innate and universal. The theory identifies competence, autonomy, and relatedness as the universal needs that must be satisfied for people to develop and function in optimal ways. The BPNS measures the degree to which people experience satisfaction in autonomy, competence, and relatedness yielding subscale scores for each need area. Participants are asked to respond to 21 items, thinking about how each item relates to their life, and how true the statement is for them using a seven point scale: e.g., 1.) not true at all, 4.) somewhat true, 7. In each recruitment situation, the researcher contacted a key leader who had access to the group to gain permission to administer the measurements. For example, college professors were asked to provide access to students in their classes, and community leaders were asked to provide access to group members.</p><p>A deliberate attempt was made to have a sample that reflected demographic characteristics of the general U.S. population. The researcher attempted to have equal representation of both men and women; across the adult lifespan, at least 25% of the participants from diverse racial groups, and different income and education levels, marital statuses, and various employment situations represented. To recruit such a diverse sample, stratified and snowballing sampling methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Dillman, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Goodman, 1961)</ref> were used. Stratified sampling purposefully samples from selected demographic groups, and snowballing asks participants to provide information or contacts for additional participants. All participants were recruited from a Midwest USA, urban or suburban area. Following is a summary of the recruitment strategies used.</p><p>Young women (ages 18-30) were recruited in summer classes at a private university.</p><p>Young men (ages 18-22) were recruited through the varsity football team at another private university.</p><p>Middle-aged women and men (ages 30-60) were recruited through 1.) friends, family, acquaintances, and professional colleagues, 2.) two evening classes at a private university consisting of older women, and 3.) two retail work-sites employing primarily men.</p><p>Older men and women (ages 60-90) were recruited from 1.) a senior high rise, 2.) a senior citizen educational event at a private university, and 3.) a retired men's</p><p>Habitat for Humanity work group.</p><p>Asian adults were recruited through a community center serving neighborhood Hmong Americans. The researcher made contact with the director of the center who distributed the surveys to her staff (who were primarily Hmong). Then, several staff members who were contacted by the researcher agreed to bring surveys to their family, friends or acquaintances. The surveys were provided in a packet with a stamped envelope addressed to the researcher.</p><p>Hispanic adults were recruited through a community center with a large population of Hispanic members, and Spanish-speaking members of a suburban church.</p><p>African American participants were recruited through a church with a large African American membership, and through acquaintances of the researcher.</p><p>Diversity within the sample also occurred naturally within all the recruitment sites. For example, there were racially diverse individuals within the university student samples, and within the elderly sample. Diversity in marital status, employment status, education levels, income levels, number of children, and number of children at home also occurred naturally within the other variables used to stratify the sample and were not used to further stratify the sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection Procedures</head><p>There were two procedures used for data collection: in-person, and U.S mail. For the in-person procedure, with permission from a key contact person, the potential participants were approached when they were already in a group or classroom for another purpose (class, church meeting, registration event, etc.). The researcher introduced herself and explained the purpose of the research and gave willing participants a packet of information. The packet contained an invitation for them to participate with instructions, a consent form, demographic form, Lifestyle Balance Inventory, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale: Stress subscale (DASS21), the Personal Wellbeing Index -Adult (PWI-A), and the Basic Psychological Needs Scale (BPNS). The consent process was conducted before they were asked to complete the surveys. The consent process included an explanation of the purpose of the research, what was expected from the participant, the potential risks, confidentiality, and contact information for answers to additional questions about the research. If potential participants agreed to participate after the explanation was given, they would sign the consent form and return it with the surveys. Potential subjects were asked to complete the surveys and return them immediately to the researcher who was present. The researcher assigned a subject number to each of the documents completed by a participant.</p><p>For the U.S mail procedure, the same packet of information described above and a stamped envelope addressed to the researcher were given to people who wanted to complete the surveys at another time, or who agreed to bring a packet to family or friends. Return of the surveys implied consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Data analysis occurred in several steps. First, analysis was conducted to assess the validity of the LBI, and second, analysis was conducted to assess validity of the LBM. To assess validity of the LBI, Rasch analysis was run to determine the appropriateness of the LBI items, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was run to determine if there was empirical evidence to support the LBI subcategories.</p><p>To assess validity of the LBM, several data analysis steps were taken. First, the ordinal raw data from the LBI total score was converted to interval data using Rasch analysis, creating the congruence score. Second, the LBI subscales were converted to a single equivalence score by determining the Euclidian distance between subscale scores.</p><p>Third, structural equation modeling (SEM) was run for both the LBI total (congruence)</p><p>scores and the LBI subscales (euclidian distance) scores with the scores from the Personal Well-being Index (PWI), Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS21) and the Basic Psychological Needs Scale (BPNS) measuring Autonomy, Relatedness, and Competence.</p><p>Additionally, demographic variables were analyzed descriptively using SPSS 11.5.0 software. Mean scores for the nominal variables (gender, age categories, race, education levels, employment, and marital status) were compared using multiple t-tests based on two-sided tests assuming equal variances with significance level of 0.05.</p><p>Adjustments were made for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction (desired critical value, divided by number of comparisons). Multiple t-tests were used because the comparisons were exploratory rather than testing a directional hypothesis.</p><p>Pearsons r correlations were used to determine the relationship between congruence, equivalence, stress, personal well-being and need satisfaction and the continuous demographic variables of number of children and number of children living with you.</p><p>Finally demographic variables were added to the SEM models to determine whether any demographic variables moderated and improved the models. Each of the data analysis procedures are described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confirmatory Factor Analysis</head><p>Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to determine if the LBI subscales were supported sufficiently to be used for subsequent analysis. This procedure is appropriate when there is a theoretical basis for organization of the instrument subscales <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Pett, Lackey &amp; Sullivan, 2003)</ref>. Factor analysis is not a single statistical method but is a complex array of procedures used to identify the interrelationships among a large set of observed variables and then to group of smaller sets of these variables into dimensions or factors that have common characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Pett, et al., 2003)</ref>. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the extent to which the hypothesized organization of the LBI subscales (Health, Relationships, Identity and Challenge/interest) fit the data. The analysis was run using software (Version 6; <ref type="bibr">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The first step in analysis of factors was to examine the model fit statistics that support whether or not the grouping of items into subscales indicated an improved model relative to a baseline model, where predicted correlations and covariance equal the observations <ref type="bibr">(Klein, 2005)</ref>. The Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) is a "badness of fit" (p.138) index in that a value of 0 indicates the best fit and higher values indicate a worse fit. The general rule of thumb is that when RMSEA ≤ .10, the fit is acceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kline, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The other model fit statistic used, the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) assessed the relative improvement in fit of the LBI subscales compared to a baseline model that assumes zero covariance. Assumed zero covariance means that when one variable changes, it does not change the other variable of interest. In other words, there is no relationship between the variables. The general rule of thumb is that CFI should be at least ≥ .90 <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kline 2005)</ref> to indicate a good fit. The CFI may provide useful model information, but it has received some criticism because zero covariance in a baseline model is usually implausible <ref type="bibr">(Klein, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The second part of the confirmatory factor analysis was an analysis of factor loadings among items on each subscale to determine how each item contributed to the overall subscale. The LBI gives a choice for each item of "No" I don't do or want to do this activity (scored 0), or "Yes" I do or want to do this activity (scored 1). The "Yes" items are then rated by the individual as to his or her satisfaction with the time spent in each activity category. The confirmatory factor analysis used the yes/no (1/0) ratings in determining loadings of each item on its subscale. The STDYX estimates (standardized coefficient) were calculated, which are the standardized factor loadings of each item and its contribution to the overall subscale. The associated p value is the probability of choosing the item being experienced as well as the other items in the subscale. A factor loading of .40 or higher and a p value of ≤ .05 were considered acceptable for this analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Item Response Testing (Rasch Analysis)</head><p>The ordinal ratings on the LBI (total score indicating congruence between actual and desired time doing activities) were converted to interval level scores with Rasch analysis using the Winsteps program <ref type="bibr">(version 3.62.1;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Linacre, 2006)</ref> through a series of logarithmic calculations. The converted raw score is called a "theta" rating. The theta scores were used in all subsequent analyses representing congruence. In other words, the higher the theta value, the more congruence between actual and desired time doing activities. People with high congruence will have high theta values compared to people with low congruence who will have lower theta values.</p><p>Rasch analysis also provides information about the test items. The 53 items on the LBI and the people taking the LBI were placed on the same hierarchical scale according to people's relative trait of congruence. The items that most respondents reported "about right for me" (or congruence) were placed on the low end of the congruence continuum and the items rarely rated "about right for me" even for the most congruent individuals (highest overall scores) were placed on the other end of the congruence continuum. The continuum can then be examined for its intuitive fit with the underlying theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calculating Euclidian distance</head><p>Several indicators of model fit were used; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), and the Comparative Fit Index (CFI). RMSEA assumes the model in the population is not perfect and a rule of thumb is that RMSEA ≤ .10 is acceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kline, 2005)</ref>. The RMSEA 90% confidence interval (CI) is given in the analysis which means a 90% confidence that the true RMSEA value falls between the two given numbers on the CI. SRMR is a measure of the mean absolute correlation residual, the overall difference between the observed and predicted correlations. "Values of SRMR of less than .08 are generally considered favor able" and support the hypothesized model <ref type="bibr">(Kline, 2005, p.141)</ref>. And commonly, the cutoff score for adequate fit using the CFI is ≥ .90 <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kline 2005)</ref>. Chi square was not used for model fit analysis because the chi square test is highly sensitive to sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref> where larger samples produce larger chi-squares that are more likely to be significant (Type I error). However, chi square values were used when comparing two models but one of the models had added variables that increased its complexity (see next section).</p><p>Estimated standard path coefficients among all the variables are calculated in the SEM analysis. Using standardized coefficients allows different variables to be directly compared when they have different scales <ref type="bibr">(Klein, 2005)</ref>. The coefficient is reported in a proportion of 1.0 where, for example, a coefficient of .822 means a .82 to 1 relationship between variables. When one variable is one full standard deviation above the mean, the variable with a coefficient of .822 will be .822 standard deviations above the mean.</p><p>Probability (p values) are also estimated indicating whether or not the observed relationship can be by chance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic variables added to the SEM</head><p>To determine if certain demographic groups changed the basic model, all demographic groups were added to the SEM analysis at once. Prior to this, categorical demographic data were dichotomized in the following way: Gender (male/female), race  it purports to measure. To provide this evidence, Rasch analysis was done to determine the contribution of each item to the overall measure and whether or not the items capture the range of congruence (balance) traits as expected. Additionally, confirmatory factor analysis was done to determine whether use of the subscales in subsequent analysis could be supported.</p><p>Rasch Analysis for the LBI. The Rasch analysis of the LBI (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) showed that its items are capturing a range of congruence traits and that the items fit intuitively with the model of life balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Matuska &amp; Christiansen, 2008)</ref>. The majority of items were responded to with "about right for me." In other words, for most common everyday activity categories, people felt that they participated in the activity about as much as they wanted to. People who chose "about right for me" for dance, travel, exercise, art, composing, music, outdoor activities, relaxation, and sleep (the items listed high on the item map) had especially high overall congruence scores. This indicates that the people with the highest overall congruence scores, also generally felt that they spent time in those activities as they wanted, and people with low overall congruence scores were less likely to report satisfaction with the time spent in those activities.</p><p>All the items on the LBI as a whole fit the expectations of the Rasch model, with every item having a Mean Square value between 1.82 and .82, meaning that each item contributed positively to the total score <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Thorndike, 2006)</ref>. Mean square values of 2.0 or larger indicate the item does not contribute to the overall measure (See Appendix C for the Rasch output table including Mean square values). The internal consistency was good (r =.97) meaning 97 % of observed score variance is the true score variance and 3% is measurement error variance. The results support the use of the LBI as a measure for the proposed construct of life balance used in this research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confirmatory Factor Analysis</head><p>The model fit statistics for the four-factor (Health, Relations, Identity, and Challenge/interest) LBI indicated a reasonable error of approximation with (RMSEA) =</p><p>.08. However, the CFI results did not indicate a good fit, CFI = .70.</p><p>In the Health subscale (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>), the factor loadings showed that all the items had a reasonable contribution to the subscale. The two items, taking care of hygiene and managing health needs were unusually high because almost everyone indicated that it was something they "do or want to do," with very little variance. All the other items also contributed to the scale. The STDYX is the standardized coefficient of each item. .000</p><p>In the Relationship subscale (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>), the factor loadings showed that all the items had a reasonable contribution to the subscale, except doing things with your spouse/significant other that was lower than the general parameter of approximately .40, considered acceptable for this analysis. This may indicate that the item is unrelated to the subscale or that there is little variance in responses. In other words, most respondents selected this item as something they do or want to do. Since theoretically, the item can be justified as a relationship factor, it has reasonable theoretical support for remaining in the relationship subscale.</p><p>In the Identity subscale (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>) taking care of appearance had very little variability (most did this) and participating in religious events and organized sports had weaker contributions to the scale. These are two items where responses of either No (0)</p><p>or Yes (1) were evenly split, more so than any of the other items, perhaps explaining the weaker contribution to the subscale. .000</p><p>In the Challenge/interest subscale (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">8</ref>), all the items had a reasonable contribution to the subscale, except managing money, that was clearly an outlier.</p><p>Examination of the CFA output indicates that there was essentially no variation in this item. Four percent of the participants did not choose this item, thus the lack of variation was a likely cause for this result. Watching TV was another item with little variation and a poor contribution to the scale with only seven percent of the participants not choosing the item. One of the goals in the development of the LBI was to reflect the uniqueness of individuals, and the activities they engage in or want to engage in. There is no theoretical expectation that someone who wants to dance for example, will also want to sew, for example. However, both could theoretically be described as an activity that provides challenge or interest, but choosing one may not be related to choosing the other.</p><p>Therefore, the confirmatory factor analysis was used as a guide for overall fit of the subscales to support the theoretical foundation of their development. Individuals are expected to have variation within the items they choose, with the theoretical expectation that everyone would choose at least a few items in each subscale to reflect breadth of daily activities.</p><p>Since some of the items in the relationship, challenge/interest, and identity subscales had weak factor loadings, an additional confirmatory factor analysis was run with every item with a factor loading of less than .40 removed from the subscale. The revised subscales were analyzed for Euclidian distance and CFA was run for the revised equivalence model. Based on Rasch analysis, CFA, and the underlying theoretical support, it was determined that validity evidence for the LBI was good enough to use it as a measure of life balance in this research. Additional research related to the subscales and their scoring needs to be done, however to increase confidence in their use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LBM Validity Evidence</head><p>The overarching research question for this study addressed the relationships between congruence and equivalence (proposed factors in the LBM), and stress, wellbeing, and need satisfaction, and demographic groups. The data presented will indicate the degree of support that was found for these relationships, providing construct validity evidence for the LBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Matuska &amp; Christiansen, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Research question two. Does overall congruence as measured by the LBI total score relate to lower perceived stress, higher personal well-being, and higher need satisfaction?</p><p>The null hypothesis for this research question is that there is no relationship between congruence and perceived stress, personal well-being, or need satisfaction, or a relationship in the opposite direction. SEM was run with the total congruence score, stress scale (DASS21), personal well-being index-adult (PWI-A), and basic psychological need satisfaction (BPNS, by relatedness, autonomy, competence) for the entire sample. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">9</ref> illustrates the model fit indices for the congruence model, and</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the congruence model with path coefficients. .97 ________________________________________________________________________ Based on these fit indices, congruence between actual and desired time spent in valued activities fits the observed data, and the congruence model is supported. There were no additional model fit indices recommended in the output. All pathways in the model were significant (p ≤ .000) and in the directions expected based on the life balance theory and existing research. Congruence was positively associated with personal well being (.49), and basic psychological need satisfaction (.47) in relatedness (.62), competence (.67), and autonomy (.86). Congruence was negatively associated with stress (-.40). In other words, high congruence scores were significantly related to higher personal well-being scores, higher psychological need satisfaction scores, and lower stress scores. The null hypothesis is rejected.</p><p>The mean scores of the health and identity subscales were higher than the mean scores of the relationship and challenge/interest subscales. This suggests that on average, participants were more satisfied with the actual versus desired time spent in health and identity categories of activities than in relationship and challenge/interest categories of activities. Additionally, there was a wider range of scores (and lower means across respondents) in the challenge/interest and identity subscales than in the relationship and health subscales, suggesting that more people report higher levels of dissatisfaction in these activity areas.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">10</ref> illustrates the model fit indices for the equivalence model for the full sample, and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> shows the equivalence model with path coefficients for the full sample. .95 ________________________________________________________________________ Based on these fit indices, equivalence between subscales fits the observed data, and the model is supported. There were no additional model fit indices recommended in the output. However, even though some of the model fit indices support the equivalance model, it is clear in the path coefficients that equivalance is not strongly related to personal well-being (-.02 p=.63), or basic psychological need satisfaction (.00 p =.99).</p><p>There is a significant negative relationship with stress, however (-.09 p=.04).</p><p>The equivalence model is not as favorable as the congruence model, but seems to contribute to the other variables only through its association with stress. The favorable fit indices may be a result of a strong relationship between equivalence and congruence, discussed next. The null hypothesis cannot be rejected. The null hypothesis for this research question was that congruence is unrelated to equivalence, that when congruence and equivalence are combined in the same SEM model, there is no additional strength in the relationships among the other variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Equivalence Model</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">11</ref> shows the model fit indices for the combined model and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> shows the combined model with path coefficients. .96 ________________________________________________________________________ Based on these fit indices, a combined model of congruence and equivalence fits the observed data. To test if the combined model is better than the equivalence or congruence models alone, the difference in model chi square values were compared. If there was a significant difference in chi square values between models, then the model with added variables is a better fit. The combined model chi square value was 42.400 (df, 8) and congruence model chi square was <ref type="bibr">31.226 (df, 5)</ref>. The difference between chi square values for the congruence model and combined model was significant (p ≤.01, df, 3), indicating the combined model is the best fit. The equivalence model chi square value was 37.587 <ref type="bibr">(df, 6)</ref>. The difference between the chi square values for the equivalence model and the combined model was not significant (p ≤.10, df, 2), indicating the equivalence model alone is a better fit (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">12</ref>). The congruence and equivalence models are unique from each other and viewed as separate models and analyzed with their dependent variables separately. The equivalence model alone was not as robust as the congruence model alone and did not account for major differences among variables in the combined model (models were not significantly different from each other). The congruence model alone, however, was robust with significant path coefficients, and was strengthened even more when combined with equivalence. Congruence and equivalence were also significantly related to each other in the combined model. This suggests that the congruence model as the baseline model is good, and when combined with equivalence, it is even better. The equivalence model as a baseline model is not good and adding congruence does not improve it. In other words, having a good match between desired and actual time spent in valued activities (congruence) and having a relatively equal (equivalence) scores among the health, relationship, identity, and challenge/interest subscales predicts lower stress, higher need satisfaction, and higher personal well-being better than congruence or equivalence alone. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> shows the standardized path coefficients of the combined model.  It is clear in the path coefficients that equivalance contributes to the model through it's relationship to congruence only. The significant relationship is negative, as expected, because a low equivalance score (a score of 0 means complete equivalence)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Combined Model</head><p>and a high congruence score (about right for me) were hypothesized to each contribute to life balance in the LBM.

(See Appendix E for the correlation matrix.)</p><p>Research question five. Does gender, age, race, education, marital status, income level, employment status, number of children or number of children living at home moderate congruence or equivalence?</p><p>The null hypothesis for this research question was that there are no differences in congruence or equivalence based on gender, age, race, education, marital status, income level, employment status, number of children or number of children living at home. Mean scores for congruence, stress, personal well-being, and each need variable (autonomy, relatedness and congruence) were compared across demographic variables. Appendix D</p><p>shows the mean and standard deviations of the observed measures. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">13</ref> shows the mean and standard deviation for LBI raw scores and euclidian distance scores for each demographic group. The differences in perceived stress scores among demographic groups are summarized as follows:</p><p>Women reported significantly higher levels of stress than men.</p><p>There was not a significant difference in perceived stress among participants with different ages, races, education, or income levels. Differences in stress scores for marital and employment categories approached significance.</p><p>Personal well-being scores were also compared among demographic groups using t-tests and the results are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">16</ref>. The differences in personal well-being scores among demographic groups are summarized as follows:</p><p>Participants who earned $55 thousand per year or more had significantly higher personal well-being scores than participants who earned $55 thousand per year or less.</p><p>Personal well-being scores were not significantly different for participants with different ages, marital status, education, or income levels. Differences in personal well-being scores for race, age and employment status approached significance.  The null hypothesis for this research question was that there are no differences in the relationships between equivalence and perceived stress, personal well-being, and need satisfaction for gender (male/female), age, race (white/non-white), education (≤ high school/ &gt;high school), marital status (single, divorced, widowed/married, partnered), income level, employment status (working or in school/retired, unemployed, homemaker), number of children, and number of children living at home.</p><p>Based on the findings described for research question 3 and 4, the equivalence model alone was not the preferred model, therefore testing it with all the demographic categories added was not expected to improve the model. As expected, the standardized path coefficients between equivalence and the demographic groups were not significantly related and did not change the overall model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The life balance construct was conceptualized in this research as described in the life balance model (LBM), yet central to testing a conceptual or theoretical model is testing the validity of the measure designed to assess the model construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Fishman &amp; Galguera, 2003)</ref>. Therefore, although tests of criterion-related validity of the LBI were done prior to this study, construct validity tests of both the measure (LBI) and model (LBM) were the primary focuses of this research. This discussion will first focus on the findings regarding validity evidence for the LBI, followed by a discussion of the results as they relate to validity findings for the LBM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LBI Validity</head><p>The criterion-related validity evidence needed for the LBI included face validity evidence, content validity evidence, predictive validity evidence, and concurrent validity evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Thorndike, 2006)</ref>. Face validity implies that the appearance of the LBI is acceptable as a measure of lifestyle balance to the people taking the test and content validity evidence implies the particular items chosen for the LBI reflect activities typical of everyday life. Previous pilot testing of the LBI demonstrated acceptable face validity evidence through think-alouds, and content validity evidence through expert review of items, sensitivity review, and feedback about the items from 108 subjects. As shown in pilot test II and the present study, the LBI met the assumptions of Rasch analysis indicating the items are contributing to a common construct.</p><p>The present study added additional support for the content validity of the LBI through Rasch analysis. The larger sample size and more diverse participants used in the present study produced results that were similar to those of the pilot study; i.e. each item contributed positively to the total score and the internal consistency was good, supporting the content validity of the measure.</p><p>The LBI subscales intended to reflect categories of activities corresponding with the four need-based dimensions of the life balance model (health, relationships, challenge/interest, and identity) were tested for the first time in the present study and the results are not conclusive. The confirmatory factor analysis was mixed, showing that one model fit statistic (RMSEA) was favorable, but another was not (CFI). Factor loadings for each item were generally favorable, yet several items were clearly not strong contributors to their corresponding subscale. This inconsistency might be explained by the pattern of responses on the weak items. For example, there was either very minimal variance (everyone chose the item as something they did), or there was an evenly split variance (half chose the item and half did not). These items then, did not predict responses on the other items in a meaningful way. The subscales were deemed acceptable enough to use in further analysis because of their theoretical base and the moderate factor loadings <ref type="bibr">(Klein, 2005)</ref>. In some ways, confirmatory factor analysis can only be a general guide for the overall fit of the LBI subscales because there is no theoretical expectation that someone who wants to dance for example, will also want to sew, for example. However, both could theoretically be described as an activity that provides challenge or interest, but choosing one may not be related to choosing the other.</p><p>In sum, the face and content validity of the LBI was supported by the pilot studies and the results of the present study through Rasch analysis. Evidence for validity of the LBI subscales is weaker and additional research is needed in order to have confidence in their use.</p><p>Construct validity of the LBI was tested in this research, or the extent to which the LBI predicted what it was hypothesized to predict, based on the theory underlying it. To do this, the LBI scores were compared to the scores of known, validated, tests of constructs (well-being, need satisfaction, stress) thought to be associated with, but not the same as life balance, from a theoretical perspective. The expectation was that if the LBI was indeed measuring something different from stress, well-being and need satisfaction (i.e. life balance), then the relationships between the LBI and measures of these other constructs should not be too strong. In other words, the LBI should predict personal wellbeing, need satisfaction and reduced perceived stress but have some unique variance of its own <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Fishman &amp; Galguera, 2003)</ref>. The path coefficients in the combined model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>) and combined-demographics-added model (Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>) used in this research show acceptable correlations (p ≤ .01) between the LBI scores and the other variables to indicate relatedness, and enough unique variance to conclude that the LBI is measuring a different construct. These correlations in the expected directions also provide rudimentary validity evidence for the LBM discussed next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LBM Validity</head><p>Evidence for criterion-related validity of the LBI was strong enough to warrant its use as a measure of life balance in this research. However, the LBM construct itself needed further clarification and study. The design of this research was meant to test the construct validity of the LBM and further validate the construct validity of the LBI.</p><p>Construct validity indicates the degree to which an instrument measures what it is intended to measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Fishman &amp; Galguera, 2003)</ref>. In order to make the claim that an instrument is measuring what it is intended to measure, it must demonstrate that it predicts or accounts for that criterion at a level that is viewed as satisfactory to the scientific community <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Fishman &amp; Galguera, 2003)</ref>. The predictive validity evidence provided by this study for the LBI gives the first evidence that the LBM is indeed, a unique construct with predictable relationships to other constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Congruence and Equivalence Combined</head><p>The life balance model outlined two components of life balance that were proposed to be related to positive health and well-being. The first component was congruence, or how close the match is between actual and desired time spent in valued activities. High congruence was hypothesized to relate to positive health and well being outcomes. The second component was equivalence, or the degree to which satisfaction in time spent in activities reflecting the four dimensions of the LBM is similar. More equitable satisfaction across these categories was hypothesized to relate to better health and well being outcomes than less equitable levels of satisfaction. Finally, it was expected that the environmental context would have an effect on life balance as well.</p><p>This research provided evidence of validity for the congruence hypothesis, that a good match between desired and actual time spent in activities was significantly related to lower stress, higher personal well-being, and higher basic psychological need satisfaction. Equivalence (or similar levels of satisfaction with time spent in activities across health, relationship, challenge/interest, and identity categories) moderated congruence. When both congruence and equivalence were combined in the same model, the expected relationships improved. Equivalence alone, however, did not relate significantly to personal well-being, need satisfaction or perceived stress and will be discussed later.</p><p>The findings that the congruence data reflected the hypothesized relationships in the LBM suggests that when people are generally satisfied with their time spent in an overall configuration of activities ("about right for me") there will be associated positive outcomes in stress levels, well-being and need satisfaction. The overall configuration of activities could vary between people; some having a wide range (choosing many items on the LBI as "I do or want to do") and others having a more narrow range (choosing fewer items). The overall configuration of activities is without judgment in the types of activities people choose, as long as they are satisfied with their time spent doing them.</p><p>With equivalence moderating congruence, however, the findings also suggest that when there is satisfaction with time spent across certain types of activities, there is a stronger association with stress, need satisfaction and personal well-being. In other words, the equivalence variable adds a certain prescriptive quality to the LBM, where satisfaction with a certain mix of activities that meet health, relationship, identity and challenge/interest needs are also deemed important for life balance.</p><p>The findings in this research are similar to findings in other research about a match between actual and desired time spent in broad activity categories relating to positive health and well-being outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Seleen, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Sheldon, Cummins &amp; Khamble, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Wilcock, et al, 1997)</ref>. Findings are also consistent with research showing that people need a balance of activities meeting different needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Ryff, 1989)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Sheldon and colleagues (2008)</ref>  In sum, the combination of equivalence and congruence was the strongest predictor of the outcomes. People who were most balanced had overall satisfaction with the actual and desired time use in activities and had relatively equal satisfaction across the four subscales of health, relationships, identity, and challenge/interest. These balanced individuals had higher scores in personal well-being and need satisfaction and lower scores in perceived stress than individuals with lower congruence and equivalence scores. This supports the <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Sheldon, et al., (2008)</ref> study finding that both equivalence and congruence among 10 broad activity categories related significantly to positive outcomes.</p><p>Their study, however, measured equivalence as the within-subject standard deviation across estimates of time in each of the 10 activity categories over a 24 hour day. This study added the finding that satisfaction in time use across categories is also important.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Equivalence Alone</head><p>The equivalence hypothesis was supported in this research but only as a moderator to congruence. Equivalence alone did not relate to the outcomes as expected.</p><p>There are several possible explanations for the findings in this research related to equivalence. The finding that equivalence alone was not a strong predictor (but congruence was) may suggest that people simply do not need to have balanced levels of satisfaction with activities that meet physical, relational, identity, and challenge/interest needs as long as, overall, they are satisfied with what they are doing. In other words, if people are satisfied with their time use overall, even if they engage in a minimal array of activities (e.g. health activities and challenge/interest activities), then they are "balanced" and will have good associated well-being, need satisfaction and stress outcomes.</p><p>Accumulated past research does not support this conclusion however, <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Seleen, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Sheldon, Cummins &amp; Khamble, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Wilcock, et al., 1997)</ref> and thus, other possible explanations are presented.</p><p>Another potential explanation is that equivalence might be a predictor of positive health outcomes as the life balance model suggests, but the subscales in the LBI did not adequately discriminate between activities that met health, relationship, identity and challenge/interest needs. The confirmatory factor analysis findings from this study were only moderately supportive of the LBI subscales, suggesting that there may be a better way to cluster the items. One of the possible reasons for this is that the LBI items measure satisfaction with time use in activities, not what the activities mean to the individual in context. For example, any given activity item could meet more than one of the four needs identified in the life balance model, and could change over time. Cooking for example, could meet a social need in the context of a party, a physiological health need (nutrition), a challenge/interest need when trying a new recipe, or an identity need if cooking fulfills a valued role. Thus, housing the item of "cooking" into only one subcategory on the LBI may not reflect its meaning to the individual in context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Activity Categories and Stress</head><p>One of the differences in this study compared to the other related studies is the use of the LBI for a measure of life balance that incorporated more specific activity categories corresponding with everyday life, including such things as participation in art, going to restaurants, dancing, and other activities that were not specified in past research.</p><p>Previous research categorized activities broadly such as leisure, or work. Arguably, even if some valued activities do not consume large amounts of time, or are engaged in sporadically, the match between how often people want to engage in them and how often they actually engage in them, may influence their sense of balance and ultimately their personal well being, stress, and psychological need satisfaction. The people who engaged in the activities of dance, travel, exercise, art, composing, music, and journaling as desired had the highest congruence scores (item map from Rasch analysis) which related to higher psychological need satisfaction, personal well-being, and lower stress. This suggests that measures of life balance should include such items instead of limiting the items to typical or broad activity categories used in other research.</p><p>This research also incorporated a measurement of stress not examined in other research. This was viewed as important because of the links associated with stress and lifestyles <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Marks &amp; MacDermid, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Sapolsky, 2004)</ref>. Findings of the present study showed that, as predicted, when people perceive they are not spending time in activities as desired, there is an associated higher level of perceived stress. This association that could also be viewed in reverse; when people are stressed, they spend less time in desired activities. This research used life balance as a predictor of stress in the SEM analysis, with a resulting significant negative relationship, but it would be useful to run the analysis with stress as the predictor to congruence or equivalence for further understanding of the direction of the relationship. Similarly, the directionality between life balance, personal well-being and need satisfaction was run with life balance as the predictor, but these could also be run the other way around in future studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Life Balance as a Universal Construct</head><p>The LBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Matuska &amp; Christiansen, 2008)</ref> proposed that congruence and equivalence would relate to positive health and well-being outcomes and that life balance is a universal, human construct. This research used a sample from the population that included men and women across race, wide age ranges, income levels, education levels, marital status, employment status, numbers of children, and numbers of children living at home. Twenty five percent of the sample represented African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American people. The sample was broad enough that it can be generalized to the U.S population (US Census <ref type="bibr">Bureau, 2000)</ref>, supporting in part, the claim that life balance is a universal human construct. Additional testing is required with non-western cultures before universality can be fully asserted, however.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Environmental Context as an Influence on Life Balance</head><p>The life balance model identified the environment (physical, social, economic, cultural, political, and temporal contexts) as influencing congruence and equivalence and the associated health outcomes. The environment can provide either supports or barriers to engagement in meaningful activities, influencing whether or not people can engage in activities as they desire. The environmental context includes the physical context, (such as where one lives and works); the social context, (such as social roles and responsibilities); the cultural context, (such as values and traditions); the political and economic contexts, (such as availability of resources); and the temporal context, (such as age or life stage). The findings related to different demographic groups in this study support the hypothesis that life balance is influenced by the environmental context. There were several groups (i.e., non-white, people working or in school, and people with children living at home) for which congruence was low and was associated with significantly lower personal well-being, psychological need satisfaction and higher stress.</p><p>Work. Employment status (social/economic contexts) moderated congruence which is consistent with a theoretical view that participating in work or school would likely interfere with satisfaction of time spent in other activities. This supports the finding that nearly half of U.S. workers report that their jobs interfere some or a lot with their personal lives, and nearly three quarters of working mothers and fathers feel they do not have enough time to spend with their children <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bond, et al., 2002)</ref>. The findings in this research that employed people report lower congruence and associated higher perceived stress, lower personal well being and need satisfaction than people who are not working contributes to the work-life balance body of literature. This research showed that managing work with other demands can be challenging, as found in other research <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Wallen, 2002)</ref>. This present research supports the idea that employees may benefit from family friendly practices that are supportive of their personal and family lives, while employers benefit from having more engaged employees, higher retention, and potentially lower health care costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bond, et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Clayton, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Halpern &amp; Murphy, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Wallen, 2002)</ref>. In other words, congruence between desired and actual time use in valued activities has beneficial consequences for workers, and other research shows that healthy workers benefit their employers <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Wallen, 2002)</ref>. The present study also showed a significant difference in mean congruence scores between working and retired participants (p ≤.00). Since congruence is related to positive well-being, need satisfaction and stress outcomes, it adds further evidence to the importance of supporting work-life balance for working adults.</p><p>Family. The number of children at home (social context) moderated congruence and suggested that having children at home interfered with satisfaction in time spent doing other activities. Having children at home was associated with higher stress and lower need satisfaction and personal well-being. The idea that parenting is stressful is not new. There is a large body of literature about family stress, much of it built from family stress theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Hill, 1949;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">1971;</ref><ref type="bibr">2003)</ref>, that emphasizes the significance of stress consequences in families. For example, parenting stress has been linked to high blood pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Taylor, Washington, Artiniam, &amp; Lichtenberg, 2007)</ref>, lower marital satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Lavee, Sharlin &amp; Katz, 1996)</ref>, and perceived time stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Craig &amp; Pooja, 2009)</ref> among others.</p><p>This study adds a new perspective to the stress research, however, suggesting that parents with children at home are not satisfied with their time use in activities, a possible contributor to the stress parents experience. Time use studies show that the time impact of becoming a parent is considerable. Leisure time use changes for parents, but more so for mothers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Beck &amp; Arnold, 2009)</ref> and women take on the greater workload associated with parenting <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Craig, 2006)</ref>. In this study, women had significantly higher perceived stress than men which seems consistent with research showing the increased role demands of motherhood.</p><p>The only group that had a significant and positive relationship with congruence was, interestingly, the group with the largest total number of children, whether the children were at home or not. This group included more people across more age categories because it was basically a rating of family size, not a rating of having young children or adolescents at home. The positive relationship of congruence with the other overall positive outcomes might be explained by the increased type of social activity opportunities when families are larger; more people to visit and do things with, frequent get-togethers, inter-generational activities, etc. There is considerable evidence showing the positive mental and physical health effects of social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Achat, et al, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Repetti, Taylor, &amp; Seeman, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Seeman, Lusignolo, Albert, &amp; Berckman, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Thompson &amp; Heller, 1990</ref>) and larger families could conceivably be providing that positive support to each other. Family size as a moderater to congruence might also reflect a more satisfied, less stressed, more reflective older adult (with adult children)</p><p>whose life characteristics include such conditions as retirement. When a Pearson correlation was run for participants in the present study who had children, the participant's age was significantly related to number of children (r = .38, p ≤ .01). In other words, having larger families was more typical of people who were older. Healthy aging has been associated with social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Gurung, Taylor, &amp; Seeman, 2003)</ref> that families may provide. This research suggests that larger families have a positive influence on life balance with associated lower perceived stress, higher need satisfaction and personal well-being.</p><p>Race. Being non-white was also related to lower congruence. Other research found that low social class and perceived financial strain predicted lower role balance in married women <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Marks et al., 2001)</ref>. Low income will constrain where people can afford to live. The availability and character of physical and social resources relates to opportunities for engagement in a variety of healthful activities <ref type="bibr">(Gibson, 1979</ref>). An example is the finding that the quality of one's neighborhood was associated with well-being. Living in safe, quiet, and small communities accounted for a significant proportion of variance in every index of well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Lawton, et al, 1980)</ref>.</p><p>Income and education disparities between white and non-white people continue to be present in the United States with resultant differences in lifestyle, quality of life and wellbeing. This research showed that disparities also exist in congruence and perceived stress.</p><p>People who were non-white had lower mean levels of satisfaction with their actual versus desired time spent in activities and reported higher stress levels than people who were white. This may reflect lower income and therefore fewer resources or opportunities to spend time in desired activities, less satisfying employment, stressful environments, or many other things. Reducing the disparities among whites and non-whites will require systemic changes with broad social policies aimed at creating more equitable opportunities for people to create satisfactory lives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>There are several findings from this research that should be of interest to researchers, individuals, health professionals, and family educators and could be used to inform both preventative and restorative goals.</p><p>Life balance is a commonly used term but with little empirical support for the construct. This research provides one way of viewing life balance that can be an anchor for additional research. With the empirical support for the life balance construct found in this research, additional research can continue to explore the relationships between life balance, and other outcomes. The LBI has shown enough validity in the present study to justify its use as a tool in this endeavor.</p><p>This research contributed additional support to the idea that a balanced life may have positive associated outcomes. This reseach has a practical application in that people might be encouraged to choose activities that increases their satisfaction in their overall configuration of activities. In a preventative way, life balance can be viewed through a wellness lens, or as something to strive for to promote overall health and well-being. For example, often wellness programs include coaching in physical activity, nutrition, and stress reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Heinz &amp; Pentland, 2009)</ref> but perhaps this research points to the importance of also promoting an overall pattern of everyday activities that is satisfying and meaningful to people for their health and well-being. Individuals could do a self-assessment with the LBI as a first step in assessing life choices and/or making positive lifestyle changes. In addition to an overall score, individuals taking the LBI can also assess themselves on an item by item basis, pointing out the specific activities they are most dissatisfied with, perhaps prompting some insight into positive changes they could make.</p><p>In a restorative way, professionals working with individuals or families who are struggling may address life balance as one element in a comprehensive evaluation of the situation. When families have to make adaptations in their everyday living such as having changes in daily routines, it can lead to stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(McDonald, 2008)</ref>. Perhaps the configuration of activites in their everyday lives is not consistent with their health, relationships, need for challenge/interest, or satisfactory identity. Counseling, coaching, or education professionals mayassist families and individuals to find ways to achieve or restore a sense of balance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Education</head><p>One of the findings of this research was that people who had children living with them had a poorer match between desired and actual time use that was associated with higher stress, and lower psychological need satisfaction and subjective well-being. This is consistent with other research that has found significant work-pattern differences between families with children and those without children. Families with children had significantly higher annual hours of work than those without children <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(LaRochelle-Côté &amp; Dionne, 2009)</ref>. Since having children is an environmental context that cannot be changed, family educators have an important role in helping families manage their stressors by educating them about how to successfully juggle the multiple demands on their time. Support for families could be through education for individual families and/or through advocating for broader social policies that will support families.</p><p>There is considerable research on how families allocate their time between work, leisure, and spending time together <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bianchi, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Harvey &amp; Singleton, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">LaRochelle-Côté &amp; Dionne, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Marshall, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Zuzanek, 2009)</ref>, which shows that increasing demands on time relates to increasing stress. This research added the variable of life balance (congruence and equivalence) to what is already known about family stress. The idea that life balance is associated with stress suggests that family educators may find the life balance construct useful and include it in their programming. For example, parents who are struggling with too many demands on their time may find it useful to think about their configuration of daily activities and how it matches their values and need satisfaction. With awareness and support, parents may be able to find ways to build in important activities without interefering with their valued role of parenting.</p><p>Family Educators can help parents become aware of the areas in their life where they are less satisfied with their time use. The LBI would be useful for this selfassessment. Then parents could problem solve about how they could make some adjustments in their time use for a more satisfactory balance. Such things as including their children in their regular exercise program, or limiting TV watching to allow for additional time in other pursuits, or learning short cuts to meal preparation may be helpful. Although small lifestyle changes may seem insignificant, it is important for families to feel a sense of control of their time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">McCubbin, Patterson, Bauman, &amp; Harris, (1981)</ref> found the most significant within-family resource was a sense of mastery over events. It seems then, that educating families about life balance is a practical way of helping them make active lifestyle choices that could influence their overall well-being.</p><p>It also might be important for parents to understand that childrearing is a stage in life that will change and that it might be acceptable to let go of some past interests for a short time in lieu of new family activities. Interestingly, this study also revealed that people who have more children overall (either living at home or not) had significantly more congruence than people with fewer or no children. In other words, the short-term challenges when children are at home, may result in more long-term rewards down the road.</p><p>This research revealed that the environment has an influence on life balance. In other words, sometimes it may be impossible to have the activity choices one desires because of the constraints of the environment. It seems that working and having children is not helpful to living a balanced life, which may be even more so for individuals and families when resources are limited. Family educators have a role in advocating at a broader systems level for social changes that provide support for families that may reduce the demands of parenting for adults with limited resources. This research revealed that congruence was significantly lower for women, people with lower income, lower educational levels, and parents with children at home. This suggests that congruence is not simply an individual skill that can be improved with training or coaching. Rather, supportive social structures are needed so that individuals can attend to improving their congruence when the other demands are lessened. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Craig (2005)</ref> highlights the gap in government assistance in daycare for single working mothers, and the resultant time stress single mothers are under. For this group, individual education may be helpful, but the greatest impact may be in broad social changes. Such supports as high quality, flexible, and affordable daycare, quality after-care child programming in local schools, and businesses practices that are family-friendly would be helpful when parents are struggling with too many demands on their time and energy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research</head><p>Limitations in this research concern the generalizability of the findings. First, the convenience and snowball sampling used in this study limits generalizability of its findings to other populations. Additionaly, the inferences that can be made from this research are limited to people in developed, relatively affluent, western societies. An argument can be made that the concept of life balance may be completely inappropriate for people in environments where personal choices are constrained by poverty or limited resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Birchenbach &amp; Glass, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Whiteford, 2009)</ref>. Additionally, the life balance concept reflects a western value of individualism and may not resonate with cultures with collectivist values <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Pentland &amp; McColl, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>This research tested the life balance component of the life balance model but did not directly test the life imbalance component of the model. Therefore, findings reported here regarding validity of the LBM are limited to the life balance component only.</p><p>Establishing validity for the entire LBM requires that all components are tested. Future research should directly test the relationships between life imbalance and health outcomes as indicated in the LBM.</p><p>Additionally, the LBM and LBI should be tested with other, more diverse groups.</p><p>Repeating this research with groups of people from non-western cultures and with different opportunities and resources is important to support the generalization of the model.</p><p>The LBI subscales reflecting equivalance need continued testing and refinement because of their weaker contribution to the model. One of the challenges mentioned in the use of the subscales was the idea that the meaning of each activity in the subscales to the person responding, could change with context or over time. Qualitative research that addresses the meaning of activities to people would be a useful way to learn about the appropriateness of the subscales and to further refine them. Qualitative research to modify the items and subscales on the LBI should also occur in non-western cultures.</p><p>The directionality question is only partially answered. This research used life balance as a predictor to stress, need satisfaction and personal well-being, and found associations in expected directions. Future studies, could use the same variables as predictors to life balance. In other words, does stress predict lower life balance? Or does low personal well-being predict lower life balance, etc?</p><p>Finally, the life balance model asserts that life balance is associated with positive health and well-being outcomes. This research tested personal well-being and need satisfaction but other outcomes such as happiness, life satisfaction, and other physical and mental health indicators should also be tested. .03</p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>" The three experience types have different relationships to each other and are needed within the total context of everyday experience. If any of these three experiences is too dominating, an imbalance arises that in the long-term might risk developing into a destructive process; one that would lead to occupational deprivation and/or overload, with negative consequences on health and well-being. In other words, too much challenge will result in the stress of anxiety, and too little challenge results in the stress of boredom.The experiential model of life balance adequately addresses the experiential aspects of everyday living but may fall short of a full model for a balanced life because it does not address the other dimensions of living such as how these experiences may be balanced among relational, spiritual, or physiological aspects of life. Is it possible for someone to have these three activity experiences but still experience loneliness, for example? Or be unhealthy, such as having limited exercise or an addiction to cigarettes or alcohol? It is conceivable that an individual could have the experiential mix described above in a work setting or at home, yet not have other needs met in his/her life as a whole. The LBM similarly highlights the importance of a mix of challenging activities and the need for renewal, as this is one of the need-based dimensions in the model (oval B), but the experiential model does not addresses other aspects related to life balance.Life balance viewed as occupational integrity.<ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Pentland and McColl (2009)</ref> offer an alternative perspective on life balance, one they believe is missing from the current discourse. They propose that the extent to which people perceive their life to be in balance derives from the extent to which they are living congruent with their personal values and strengths or have occupational integrity. Thus, they believe "the metaphor of balance focuses on an idealistic and dualistic (either in balance or out of balance) outcome and obscures the fundamental characteristics and nature of this sought-after state. Living in occupational integrity involves choosing everyday activities that matter the most and the extent to which we can design occupational lives consistent with our values will influence the degree to which we feel a sense of balance and well-being" (2009). To do this requires reconciling and prioritizing what we choose to do on the basis of personal values (awareness and deciding what matters most), and assertiveness (i.e.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>) very true. Items are phrased both positively and negatively. Examples include, "I really like the people I interact with," "I feel pressured in my life" and "Most days I feel a sense of accomplishment from what I do." Psychometric properties of the scale are not published; the scale has been widely used in psychological research. The BPNS scale was chosen for this research because it measures autonomy, competence and relatedness which have been theoretically linked to the life balance model and there is no other direct measure for the Self-Determination Theory. See Appendix B for the PWI-A and BPNS scales.Demographic questions added to the LBI. The demographic questionnaire was created by the researcher to measure the environmental context represented in the LBM, and assess characteristics of participants in the study. The questions included the following items: age, gender, race, marital status, number of children, number of children living with the respondent, employment status, education level, and income. On the demographic survey, participants were instructed to choose the one item that best described them. For example, it was possible that a participant was both a student, and working full-time, or retired and working part time. The researcher instructed student groups to choose "student" and retired groups to choose "retired." (See Appendix A for the LBI and demographic questions)Participant RecruitmentRecruitment and data collection began after receiving IRB approval from the University of Minnesota and St. Catherine University in the spring of 2009. Data collection occurred between June, 2009 and September, 2009. Subjects were recruited as indicated below.</figDesc></figure>

The continuous variables of age, income, number of children, and number of children living at home were also entered into the SEM analysis. Model fit indices were then analyzed for the new demographic-added model.Additionally, chi square values were compared between the basic models of congruence and equivalence and the models with demographics-added. If chi square values were significantly different for the basic model and a model with added variables, it indicated that the more complicated model was a better fit<ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kline, 2005)</ref>. To calculate this, the chi square values from one model were subtracted from the chi square values from the other model. Additionally, the degrees of freedom (df) from one model were subtracted from the other model. The calculated difference between models (and df) was the value used in the chi square tables to determine the p value. If the p value was ≤ .05, then the models were considered significantly different and the more complicated model was the better fit.</figDesc></figure>

In other words a balanced life would be the same for all; certain ideal proportions of rest, work, and play. This type of life prescription would indeed, be inappropriate according to the LBM. The LBM addresses how regular activity patterns meet essential needs, It does not prescribe specific activities to be chosen to meet those needs. To illustrate, an individual may choose to spend a disproportionate amount of time in work activities that by some standards, would be considered excessive. But if the individual meets his/her needs in the five dimensions of the model through work and the other areas of life, then the greater proportion of time spent in work does not necessarily represent an imbalanced life.</figDesc><table /></figure>

In other words, the subjective satisfaction of whether time spent in activities was "about right for me" or "too much or too little" was compared across health, relationship, identity and challenge/interest activity categories. Being satisfied in all four categories equally contributed strength to the LBM.</figDesc><table /></figure>

Data from the US Census Bureau (2006) indicated large disparities in income by race, with Black adults earning 63% and Hispanic adults earning 75% of what White adults earned in 2006. Income levels are also related to educational levels where people with higher levels of education earn more than people with lower levels of education (US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2008). The education and income factors combined may have influenced the finding that being non-white predicted lower congruence and higher stress in this study.</figDesc><table /></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_46"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>This research supported the validity of the Life Balance Model and the Life Balance Inventory. Structural equation modeling showed that the best model is that in which congruence, moderated by equivalence predicts lower stress and higher need satisfaction and personal well-being. Congruence was negatively related to being nonwhite, having children at home, and working full time or in school. Family size was positively related to congruence. These findings indicate the impact of context on life balance. This research adds validity to the idea that having a balanced life is something of value and contributes to the overall evidence about what a balanced life might look like. This research also provided evidence that creating a balanced life may not be entirely within one's control, that life circumstances and contexts may limit the opportunities available for doing what one desires to do. Finally, this research is a valuable first step for additional research about life balance because it provided a model and measure that can be used as a foundation for additional study.

The subscales on the LBI reflect these need-based activity categories. The Euclidian distance calculation determines the average difference between scores on each of the four LBI subscales. This represents the sum of the individual's raw score on each of the 4 subscales minus the average score across subscales, squared or ( 1</p><p>An ED value of 0 means that there was no difference in scores between subscales, and ED values that are larger suggest a larger difference among subscale scores.

All of the factors in the hypothesized life balance model (congruence, equivalence, stress, personal well-being, psychological need satisfaction) are assumed to covary with each other, meaning that change in one variable will affect change in another variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kline, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Chapter Four</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings</head><p>The purpose of this research was twofold. The first purpose was to test the content validly of the instrument used to measure the construct of life balance, the LBI. The preliminary Rasch analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were done for the purpose of providing sufficient validity evidence to justify use of the LBI in this research. Results of this analysis are presented next. The second purpose was to test the proposed life balance model and hypothesized relationships among its variables for construct validity.</p><p>It was proposed that having congruence and equivalence in satisfaction with time use in categories of everyday activities represent the construct of life balance. Life balance was expected to be associated with higher personal well-being, greater need satisfaction, and lower stress. This research tested those associations and the results of these tests will be presented following the presentation of evidence regarding the validity of the LBI.   ) relate to lower perceived stress, higher personal well-being, and higher need satisfaction?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The null hypothesis for this research question is that equality among scores (equivalence) on the LBI subscales shows no relationship to perceived stress, personal well-being, or need satisfaction, or relationships are in the opposite direction. SEM was run with ED values, stress scale (DASS21), personal well-being index-adult (PWI-A), and basic psychological need satisfaction (BPNS, by relatedness, autonomy, competence)</p><p>for the entire sample.</p><p>Prior to running the ED analysis, the subscale means and ranges for the entire sample were recorded and are reported below. The highest possible subscale mean score is 3.0 meaning every item in the subscale was rated 3, "about right for me" by everyone.</p><p>Lower mean subscale scores indicate that some items were rated as either spending too much or too little time in the subscale activities.</p><p>In the Health subscale, the mean value of the raw score was 2.33 with a range from 1.67 to 3.0,</p><p>In the Relationship subscale, the mean value of the raw score was 2.29 with a range from 1.56 to 3.0,</p><p>In the Identity subscale the mean value of the raw score was 2.38 with a range from .46 to 3.0,</p><p>In the Challenge/interest subscale the mean value of the raw score was 2.22 with a range from .93 to 3.0.</p><p>The differences in congruence scores among demographic groups are summarized as follows:</p><p>Men had significantly higher congruence scores than women.</p><p>Whites had significantly higher congruence scores than non-whites (African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American included as non-white).</p><p>Participants who were married or partnered had significantly higher congruence scores than people who were single, divorced or widowed.</p><p>Participants who were retired, unemployed or homemakers had significantly higher congruence scores than participants who were employed (full time or part time) or students.</p><p>Participants who earned 55 thousand dollars per year or more had significantly higher congruence scores than participants who earned 55 thousand dollars per year or less.</p><p>There was not a significant difference in congruence among participants with different ages (although it approached significance), or levels of education.</p><p>Perceived stress scores were also compared among demographic groups using ttests and the results are displayed in Table <ref type="table">15</ref>.</p><p>The null hypothesis for this research question was that there is no difference in the relationship between congruence and equivalence based on gender, age, race, education, marital status, income level, employment status, number of children or number of children living at home.</p><p>When the combined model (both congruence and equivalence) was combined with all the demographic variables, the model was improved. Equivalence continued to be significantly related to congruence but unrelated to the other variables. Congruence continued to be related to stress, need satisfaction and personal well-being but moderated by employment status, race, number of children, and number of children living with you.</p><p>The model fit indices for this model were good and are displayed in Table <ref type="table">20</ref> and</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows the combined model with path coefficients. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background Information:</head><p>The purpose of this study is to test a theoretical model of lifestyle balance and provide validity evidence for a measure of lifestyle balance, the Lifestyle Balance Inventory (LBI). The LBI will be tested against subjective well being, basic need satisfaction, and perceived stress, to determine if the relationships among them are as predicted. The research will help determine if LBI is measuring life balance and if lifestyle balance is a legitimate and separate construct from stress, well being and need satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures:</head><p>If you agree to participate, you will be asked to complete 4 short surveys. The total time to complete all the surveys should be about 15 minutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risks and Benefits of Being in the Study:</head><p>The only risk for participating in the study is that you might feel embarrassed about answering personal questions about your feelings and lifestyle. There are also no immediate or expected benefits for you for participating in the survey. Your participation will allow me to learn about how perceived life balance is related to well-being and stress and to test the LBI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confidentiality:</head><p>The surveys are completely anonymous and confidential. Once your responses are entered into an electronic file, the original nameless surveys will be destroyed.</p><p>Results will be reported in aggregate only.</p></div>
