<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A theoretical model linking achievement and emotions is proposed. The model posits that individual achievement promotes positive achievement emotions and reduces negative achievement emotions. In contrast, group-level achievement is thought to reduce individuals' positive emotions and increase their negative emotions. The model was tested using one crosssectional and two longitudinal datasets on 5 th to 10 th grade students' achievement emotions in mathematics (Studies 1-3: Ns = 1,610, 1,759, and 4,353, respectively). Multi-level latent structural equation modeling confirmed that individual achievement had positive predictive effects on positive emotions (enjoyment, pride) and negative predictive effects on negative emotions (anger, anxiety, shame, and hopelessness), controlling for prior achievement, autoregressive effects, reciprocal effects, gender, and socio-economic status. Class-level achievement had negative compositional effects on the positive emotions and positive compositional effects on the negative emotions. Additional analyses suggested that self-concept of ability is a possible mediator of these effects. Furthermore, there were positive compositional effects of class-level achievement on individual achievement in Study 2 but not in Study 3, indicating that negative compositional effects on emotion are not reliably counteracted by positive effects on performance. The results were robust across studies, age groups, synchronous versus longitudinal analysis, and latent-manifest versus doubly-latent modeling. These findings imply that individual success drives emotional well-being, whereas placing individuals in highachieving groups can undermine well-being. Thus, the findings challenge policy and practice decisions on achievement-contingent allocation of individuals to groups.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Achievement emotions are an integral part of human personality, and they are ubiquitous across settings. Traditionally, these emotions have received little attention by personality researchers, except for studies on test anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Zeidner, 2014)</ref> and the link between causal attributions and achievement emotions <ref type="bibr">(Weiner, 1985, in press</ref>). More recently, however, there has been growing recognition that achievement emotions are central to human well-being and achievement strivings. These emotions are no longer regarded as epiphenomena that may occur in achievement settings but lack any instrumental relevance. Rather, achievement emotions are recognized as being of critical importance for psychological health, personality development, and the productivity of individuals, organizations, and cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ashkanasy &amp; Humphrey, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Boehm &amp; Lyubomirsky, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Efklides &amp; Volet, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Elfenbein, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Linnenbrink, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pekrun &amp; Linnenbrink-Garcia, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Warr, 2007)</ref>. In fact, across disciplines researchers investigating achievement have noted that there is an affective turn in their fields (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ashkanasy, Härtel, &amp; Daus, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Pekrun, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Given the importance of achievement emotions, more knowledge about their antecedents is needed. Prior research has considered individual success and failure as possible antecedents but has neglected the achievement of others. In this research, we argue that the level of achievement in one's reference group also plays a major role, over and above the influence of individual achievement. As such, we consider both individual and group-level achievement. We examine the role of these variables as antecedents to six major positive and negative achievement emotions, including enjoyment, pride, anger, anxiety, shame, and hopelessness.</p><p>The analysis is based on a theoretical model that disentangles the effects of individual and group-level achievement. In this model, we consider the compositional effects of group-level achievement on emotions. The term compositional effect is generally used to denote effects of the group-level aggregate of individual variables, such as achievement, gender, or socioeconomic status, over and above the contribution of these variables at the individual level (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Harker &amp; Tymms, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002)</ref>. 1 To test the model in ecologically valid ways, we used data from three large-scale studies of students' achievement and emotions in mathematics, a field that is known to generate intense emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chang &amp; Beilock, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Pekrun et al., 2017)</ref>. Although the model was tested using data from an educational context, it provides a general framework for understanding compositional effects of group-level achievement on emotion, whatever the specific context.</p><p>Our model explains how both individual success and failure and the achievement of others contribute to the arousal of achievement emotions. Specifically, we argue that the level of achievement in one's reference group determines opportunities to succeed relative to others, and that others' achievement prompts social comparison processes that influence achievement emotions and the self-concepts underlying these emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Huguet et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Pekrun, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Pekrun &amp; Perry, 2014)</ref>. As such, the model proposes that groups serve as frames of reference for the arousal of achievement emotions, and that the composition of groups prompts frame-ofreference effects on these emotions.</p><p>By considering groups as frames of reference shaping emotions, the model builds on social comparison theory and the literature on frame-of-reference effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Davis, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Festinger, 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stapel &amp; Blanton, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Zell &amp; Alicke, 2009)</ref>. This literature has shown that beliefs about oneself can be strongly influenced by social comparison, but has neglected the impact of social comparison on emotion. By targeting effects of group composition, the model also is related to existing research on compositional effects. Compositional effects are foundational to the impact of groups on individual differences and personality development <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Prior research in this field has focused on the effects of ability composition on cognitive performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baratta &amp; McManus, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">De Fraine, van Damme, van Landeghem, Opdenakker, &amp; Onghena, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Dicke et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Harker &amp; Thymms, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Thrupp, Lauder, &amp; Robinson, 2002)</ref> but has also neglected possible effects on emotion.</p><p>The present research addresses this gap in personality and social psychological research by integrating perspectives from the achievement emotion, frame-of-reference, and compositional effects literatures. In the following sections we first summarize prior research.</p><p>Next, we describe our reference group model and provide an overview of the present studies. We then present the findings of our three empirical studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prior Research</head><p>Prior research has focused on the relationship between individual achievement and emotion but has neglected the possible influence of group-level achievement. Furthermore, most studies used cross-sectional designs and failed to examine the impact of achievement on emotions over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Achievement and Emotions</head><p>Test anxiety research has found negative correlations between individual achievement and achievement-related anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Zeidner, 2014)</ref>. These correlations can be explained by the effects of achievement on the development of anxiety. Specifically, success and failure shape perceptions of competence and expectancies of failure underlying achievement anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Lang &amp; Lang, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Pekrun, 1992)</ref>. Alternatively, the relationship may be caused by effects of anxiety on task-irrelevant thinking that interferes with cognitive performance and contributes to low achievement (interference and attentional deficit models; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chang &amp; Beilock, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Eysenck, 1997)</ref>. In fact, the scarce longitudinal evidence available suggests that achievement and anxiety are linked by reciprocal effects over time. However, the influence of achievement on anxiety typically is stronger than reverse effects of anxiety on achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Meece, Wigfield, &amp; Eccles, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Pekrun, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Schnabel, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Steinmayr, Credel, McElvany, &amp; Wirthwein, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>For emotions other than anxiety, the evidence is limited. Positive correlations with achievement have been observed for students' enjoyment of learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Larson, Hecker, &amp; Norem, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Pekrun, Goetz, Frenzel, Barchfeld, &amp; Perry, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Pekrun et al., 2017)</ref>. Similarly, general positive affect has been found to correlate positively with students' achievement as well as employees' workplace performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Linnenbrink, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Boehm &amp; Lyubomirsky, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>However, null findings have been reported as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Linnenbrink, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Pekrun et al., 2009)</ref>. For anger, shame, and general negative affect, negative correlations have been found <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Boekaerts, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Pekrun et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Pekrun et al., , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Pekrun et al., , 2017))</ref>, although not in all instances <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Linnenbrink, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Turner &amp; Schallert, 2001)</ref>. For hopelessness, the findings suggest that relations with achievement are uniformly negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Pekrun et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Pekrun et al., , 2017))</ref>. However, longitudinal studies of achievement and emotions other than anxiety are largely lacking (for an exception, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Pekrun et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In summary, to date research on the relationship between individual achievement and achievement emotions is limited. Most studies addressed achievement anxiety and have demonstrated that anxiety is negatively related to achievement. A smaller number of studies have focused on other emotions, and found that enjoyment in achievement contexts tends to be positively associated with achievement, whereas anger, shame, and hopelessness tend to be negatively associated. More research is clearly needed on the relation between individual achievement and emotions (other than anxiety).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group-Level Achievement and Emotions</head><p>Evidence on the possible relation between group-level achievement and emotions is lacking, except for two studies of test anxiety in gifted students. These studies included gifted students who were either members of regular classes or of special classes for gifted students within Israel's national program for gifted students. In the first investigation, students from gifted (i.e., high average achievement) classes reported higher anxiety than students from regular, mixed-achievement classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Zeidner &amp; Schleyer, 1998)</ref>. In the second study, gifted students enrolled in gifted classes had higher anxiety scores than gifted students in mixedachievement classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Zeidner &amp; Schleyer, 1999)</ref>. The dataset of this study was reanalyzed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Goetz, Preckel, Zeidner, and Schleyer (2008)</ref> to directly examine the relations of individual and class-level achievement with gifted students' test anxiety. The results of hierarchical linear modeling showed that individual achievement was negatively related to students' test anxiety, whereas class-level achievement was positively related to their anxiety. These findings suggest that the group-average level of achievement can be linked to group members' anxiety. However, this evidence is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the analysis, use of small convenience samples, and inclusion of one negative emotion only.</p><p>Conclusions on the temporal ordering of variables and generalizability to other emotions cannot be drawn from these findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reference Group Model of Achievement and Emotion</head><p>It seems straightforward to assume that individual success strengthens positive achievement emotions whereas failure prompts negative emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Pekrun, Lichtenfeld, Marsh, Murayama, &amp; Goetz, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Zeidner, 1998)</ref>. Similar assumptions are widely held for group-level achievement. Being a member of a high-achieving group is thought to be beneficial for wellbeing and performance (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Stäbler, Dumont, Becker, &amp; Baumert, 2017)</ref>. For example, in education parents seek to have their children accepted to the "best" schools where they are surrounded by able peers who can serve as role models for learning and performance. Similarly, at work people strive to join successful companies and institutions, and in sports athletes dream of joining top-scoring teams. Being a part of high-achieving groups is perceived to convey high social status, thus presumably promoting pride and positive emotions, and reducing negative emotions such as shame.</p><p>In line with the test anxiety studies cited earlier, our model challenges this view by considering the emotional costs of being among high achievers. The model is based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Pekrun's (2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Pekrun &amp; Perry, 2014)</ref> control-value theory of achievement emotions. In this theory, achievement emotions are defined as emotions related to achievement activities or achievement outcomes. Examples are enjoyment, pride, anger, anxiety, shame, or hopelessness related to studying, working, or athletic performance and to the success and failure outcomes of these activities. According to the theory, these emotions depend on the perceived controllability of achievement activities and outcomes that are subjectively important. Achievement emotions are thought to be aroused if an individual feels in control over, or out of control of, these activities and outcomes. For example, anxiety should be triggered if an employee feels out of control over performance on an important project. Because perceptions of control are shaped by past performance, the theory can be used to derive hypotheses about the effects of individual and group-level achievement on emotions.</p><p>The theory considers different types of control appraisals including action-and outcomerelated expectations and attributions. As all of these appraisals hinge on perceptions of one's ability, self-concept of ability is thought to be of primary relevance among different constructs of control. Self-concepts of ability are defined as cognitive representations of one's abilities that are stored in long-term memory. Typically, these self-concepts are organized in domain-specific ways (e.g., math vs. verbal self-concepts; <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Möller &amp; Marsh, 2013)</ref>. High self-concept of ability is expected to promote positive achievement emotions and to reduce negative emotions (for a summary of supporting evidence, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Pekrun &amp; Perry, 2014)</ref>. By implication, factors influencing self-concept of ability, which include individual as well as group-level achievement, are expected to also influence these emotions.</p><p>By targeting the effects of both individual and group-level achievement, the model is similar to previous models of compositional effects (see <ref type="bibr">Dicke et al., in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Harker &amp; Tymms, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Thrupp, Lauder, &amp; Robinson, 2002)</ref>. The model has a multi-level structure that is consistent with the general logic of models considering compositional effects. It differs from other models by explaining emotions as outcomes. More specifically, the model proposes the following.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of Individual Achievement</head><p>The evidence cited earlier suggests that individual success and failure are prime antecedents of achievement emotions. Success prompts positive achievement emotions, including enjoyment and pride; failure triggers negative achievement emotions, including anger, anxiety, shame, and hopelessness. From the control-value theory, it follows that these effects can in part be explained by the influence of individual achievement on self-concept of ability.</p><p>Individual achievement is known to have positive effects on self-concept of ability (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arens, Marsh, Pekrun, Lichtenfeld, &amp; vom Hofe, 2017)</ref>. Self-concept of ability, in turn, is thought to have positive effects on positive achievement emotions (enjoyment, pride) and negative effects on negative achievement emotions (anger, anxiety, shame, hopelessness).</p><p>The effects of achievement on emotions and underlying self-concepts are thought to be universal, as individuals naturally judge their ability in relation to their performance on achievement tasks. The effects may be especially pronounced if the available information about achievement is salient, important, and consistent. These conditions are met if individuals receive distinct information about their performance, if performance has consequences that are important for one's current life or future prospects, and if performance information from different sources converges, as is typically the case with grades or test scores in educational institutions, ratings by supervisors at the workplace, or the results of competitions in professional athletes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of Group-Level Achievement</head><p>The level of achievement within reference groups determines one's chances to succeed relative to others. All else being equal, being in a high-achieving group makes it more difficult to be successful as compared with others and increases the likelihood of failure. Conversely, being in a low-achieving group makes it easier to succeed and reduces the likelihood of failure relative to others. Because success and failure drive achievement emotions, high group-level achievement is thought to reduce positive achievement emotions (enjoyment, pride) and to increase negative achievement emotions (anger, anxiety, shame, hopelessness).</p><p>Self-concepts of ability are thought to play a role in these effects as well. High grouplevel achievement is known to have negative effects on individuals' self-concept of ability, all else being equal (frog-pond effect or big-fish-little-pond effect; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Davis, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Marsh et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Marsh et al., , 2015;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh, Parker, &amp; Pekrun, 2018)</ref>. When group-average achievement is high and individual opportunities to succeed relative to others are reduced, social comparison with others results in less favorable self-perceptions. As such, being in a high-achieving group undermines one's self-concept of ability, whereas being in a low-achieving group promotes a positive self-concept, all else being equal. The big-fish-little-pond effect is also expected to be, and has been shown to be, universal as individuals rank-order themselves based on perceptions of their ability relative to others, in line with social comparison theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Marsh et al., 2015)</ref>. The effect is remarkably robust across genders, age groups, student characteristics, school settings, and cultures <ref type="bibr">(Marsh, Hau, &amp; Craven, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Marsh et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Marsh et al., , 2015;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Seaton, Marsh, &amp; Craven, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The effects of group-level achievement on emotions may also be especially pronounced if the available information about the achievement of others is salient, relevant, and consistent. As such, it is expected, and has been shown empirically, that salient "local" groups generate stronger frog-pond effects than more distant reference groups ("local dominance effect;" Alicke, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Zell, &amp; Bloom, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Zell &amp; Alicke, 2009)</ref>. For example, the level of achievement in a students' class is likely to exert stronger effects than state-wide achievement in the students' country, and the level of achievement in one's local sports team may be more important for one's emotions than the national team's performance. As such, to properly examine the possibility of compositional effects on emotion, it is important to adequately select the units of observation at the group level.</p><p>In sum, we hypothesize that individual achievement is positively linked to emotional well-being (i.e., associated with more positive emotions and less negative emotions). In contrast, group-level achievement is expected to be negatively linked to well-being (i.e., associated with less positive emotions and more negative emotions), due to the negative effects of group-level achievement on opportunities to succeed and to develop favorable self-perceptions of ability. As such, our model implies that being in a low-achieving group relates to better emotional wellbeing compared with being in a group of high achievers. We suggest calling this relation the "happy-fish-little-pond effect" (it's better to be a happy fish in a little pond than an unhappy fish in a big pond of high achievers), using a term that expresses the consistency of the relation with the big-fish-little-pond effect on self-concept, while also denoting that the target of the effect is emotions rather than self-appraisals.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of Studies</head><p>Datasets from one cross-sectional and two longitudinal studies were used to test the model. The three studies were located in an educational context and examined students' achievement and emotions in mathematics, including math-related enjoyment, pride, anger, anxiety, hopelessness, and shame. Subject-specific emotions were assessed rather than generalized emotional traits, because achievement emotions have been shown to be organized in domain-specific ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Goetz, Frenzel, Pekrun, Hall, &amp; Lüdtke, 2007)</ref>. Standardized mathematics tests and self-report were employed to measure achievement and emotions, respectively. We used test scores rather than grades as an indicator of achievement because grades are derived from grading-on-the curve within classes, implying that they cannot be used to assess differences in group-average achievement between classes. Studies 2 and 3 additionally included students' math self-concept.</p><p>The studies included representative student samples from the German secondary public school system which uses achievement-based tracking. Progression through the system is made contingent on achievement, whereby low-achieving students are retained or transferred to a lower school track, indicating that achievement is salient and critically important for students' educational career. As such, we expected to discover the proposed relations of achievement to emotions in these samples.</p><p>Study 1 used a cross-sectional design for an initial exploration of the proposed achievement-emotion links. Studies 2 and 3 used longitudinal designs. One major obstacle to examining effects of compositional variables, such as group-level achievement, over time is change in the composition of groups. To minimize this problem, two-wave designs were used that provided stability of classroom composition from wave to wave (grade 5 to 6 in Study 2, and grade 9 to 10 in Study 3). Achievement and emotion were assessed at both waves, making it possible to control for autoregressive and reciprocal effects.</p><p>Multi-level modeling with latent variables was employed to analyze the data. To consider the multicollinearity between emotions (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), separate models were estimated for the different emotions. As students are nested in classes and performance assessment is class-based in German public schools, classes were considered as the relevant unit of analysis at the group level (also see <ref type="bibr">Marsh, Köller, &amp; Baumert, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh, Kuyper, Morin, Parker, &amp; Seaton, 2014)</ref>. Classes represent students' immediate reference groups; as such, this choice is consistent with considering the local dominance effect as discussed earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alicke et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Zell &amp; Alicke, 2009)</ref>. Students' gender and family socio-economic status (SES) were controlled in the analysis (for the influence of gender on math emotions, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beilock, Gunderson, Ramirez, &amp; Levine, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Goetz, Bieg, Lüdtke, Pekrun, &amp; Hall, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head><p>Study 1 explored the links between achievement and four major achievement emotions in mathematics, including enjoyment, anger, anxiety, and hopelessness. The study used data from a cross-sectional investigation which is part of the multi-study Project for the Analysis of Learning and Achievement in Mathematics, PALMA (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Marsh et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh et al., , 2018;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Murayama, Pekrun, Lichtenfeld, &amp; vom Hofe, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Murayama, Pekrun, Suzuki, Marsh, &amp; Lichtenfeld, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Pekrun et al., 2017)</ref>. 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>The study is a secondary analysis of an existing dataset (see <ref type="bibr">Pekrun et al., 2007)</ref>. The studies of the PALMA project received Institutional Review Board approval from the Bavarian State Ministry for Education, Science, and the Arts (reference III/5-S4200/4-6/68 908).</p><p>Sample and procedure. The sample consisted of 1,610 students (grades 5-10; 47.5% female) from 69 classrooms in the state of Bavaria, Germany, and comprised a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, including both rural and urban areas and students from all three schools tracks of the public school system in this state (low-achievement track: Hauptschule; medium-achievement track: Realschule; high-achievement track: Gymnasium). The mean number of participating students per class was <ref type="bibr">23.3 (minimum = 11,</ref><ref type="bibr">maximum = 33,</ref><ref type="bibr">SD = 4.86)</ref>.</p><p>The sample included 292 students (50.7% female) from grade 5 (mean age = 11.24 years, SD = .48), 253 students (43.9% female) from grade 6 (mean age = 12.41 years, SD = 0.77), 271 students (45.4% female) from grade 7 (mean age = 13.31 years, SD = 0.55), 311 students (46.3% female) from grade 8 (mean age = 14.37 years, SD = 0.63), 292 students (49.7% female) from grade 9 (mean age = 15.44 years, SD = 0.73), and 191 students (45.5% female) from grade 10 (mean age = 16.45 years, SD = 0.77). The assessment took place towards the end of the school year. All instruments were administered in the students' classrooms by trained external test administrators. Student participation was based on written parental consent, and students' responses were kept strictly confidential.</p><p>Variables and measures. The study variables included students' achievement, enjoyment, anger, anxiety, and hopelessness in mathematics as well as their gender and grade level. Pride, shame, self-concept, and SES were not assessed in this study.</p><p>Achievement. The PALMA Mathematical Achievement Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Murayama et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pekrun et al., 2007)</ref> was used to measure students' achievement. This is a standardized test using item response theory (IRT) scaling to assess competencies in arithmetic, algebra, and geometry across a wide range of ability.</p><p>Emotions. Short scales from the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire-Mathematics (AEQ-M; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Frenzel, Thrash, Pekrun, &amp; Goetz, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Pekrun et al., 2011)</ref> were used to assess students' math emotions. The instructions asked respondents to describe how they typically felt when attending class, doing homework, and taking tests in math. The scales assessed enjoyment (8 items; e.g., "I enjoy my math class"), anger (6 items; e.g., "My mathematics homework makes me angry"), anxiety (9 items; e.g., "I worry if the material is much too difficult for me"), and hopelessness (6 items; e.g., "During the math test, I feel hopeless"). Participants responded on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) scale, and the scores were averaged to form the emotion indexes (α range = .87 -.90; see supplemental materials, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic variables.</head><p>We controlled for gender and grade level in the analysis. Gender was coded 1 = female, 2 = male. Grade level was coded as it is defined in schools (i.e., grade 5 = 5, grade 6 = 6, etc.).</p><p>Multi-level modeling. Studies on compositional effects have moved from employing single-level models and ordinary least-square regression analysis to using multi-level modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gonzáles-Romá &amp; Hernández, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Marsh et al., 2009)</ref>. Single-level analysis renders conflated estimates of individual-level and group-level parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hox, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002)</ref>, making it difficult to interpret the results. As such, we used multi-level modeling (Mplus, Version 8, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2017</ref>; students at Level 1, classes at Level 2).</p><p>In the estimated models, we corrected for measurement error. Not correcting for measurement error can lead to over-or underestimation of compositional effects as well as false compositional effects (phantom effects; <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Dicke et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Harker &amp; Tymms, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hauser, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Marsh et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Televantou et al., 2015)</ref>. In supplementary analyses, we additionally corrected for sampling error. Sampling error refers to error in estimating Level-2 parameters caused by insufficient sampling of individuals from Level-2 units (e.g., if a project team comprises twenty members but only five have been assessed; see <ref type="bibr">Lüdtke et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Marsh et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Morin, Marsh, Nagengast, &amp; Scalas, 2014)</ref>. Sampling error can also lead to biased parameter estimates. The type and amount of bias caused by sampling error depends on the sampling ratio within Level-2 units. Not correcting for sampling error can lead to an underestimation of compositional effects, whereas correcting for such error can lead to an overestimation when sampling ratios are high <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Marsh et al., 2009)</ref>. Procedures for deriving point estimates for the true effect are not available; therefore, a reasonable strategy is to calculate both types of coefficients to obtain estimates for the range of possible true effects. Combined with a correction for measurement error, and using terms from <ref type="bibr">Marsh et al.'s (2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lüdtke et al., 2008)</ref> taxonomy of multi-level models, this implies using both latent-manifest modeling (correcting for measurement error but not sampling error) and doubly-latent modeling (correcting for both types of errors) to estimate compositional effects.</p><p>The IRT scores from the mathematics tests were used as latent estimates for achievement.</p><p>For the emotions, we followed a two-step procedure. We first used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to derive latent factor score estimates for the emotions. Following recommendations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Pekrun et al. (2011)</ref>, a correlated uniqueness approach was employed by including correlations between residuals for items representing the same setting (attending class, doing homework, and taking tests in mathematics). Subsequently, we used the factor score estimates in multi-level modeling. We did not use multi-level modeling to estimate the latent emotion variables due to insufficient between-class variance for the emotion items. With insufficient Level-2 item variances, item-based multi-level modeling is not suited to produce stable and meaningful solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Marsh et al., 2009)</ref>. As such, the two-step procedure was used to obtain latent measures while minimizing problems of non-convergence and model identification.</p><p>Based on these measures, we constructed latent-manifest models in which emotion is predicted by student-level and class-level achievement scores (see Supplemental Materials for the equations used to estimate these models). These models do not correct for sampling error; classlevel achievement scores are computed by aggregating individual achievement scores within each class rather than estimating them as class-level latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Marsh et al., 2009)</ref>. The studentlevel achievement scores are group-mean centered. For each classroom, most of the students participated in the study (i.e., the sampling ratios within classes were high). As such, we considered these models as adequate (see <ref type="bibr">Lüdtke et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Marsh et al., 2009)</ref>. However, to explore the possible impact of sampling error even under the present conditions of high sampling ratios, and following the methodology described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Marsh et al. (2009)</ref>, we additionally estimated doubly-latent models calculating the Level-2 achievement scores as class-level latent variables.</p><p>To estimate the model parameters, the robust maximum likelihood estimator (MLR) was employed which is robust to non-normality of the observed variables. The unstandardized compositional effects were calculated by subtracting the individual-level effects of achievement on emotion from the class-level effects (see <ref type="bibr">Kreft &amp; De Leeuw, 1998)</ref>. Subsequently, the standardized compositional effects (i.e., effect sizes for the compositional effects) were estimated using Effect Size 2 (ES 2; <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Marsh et al., 2009</ref>; also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Morin et al., 2014)</ref>. ES 2 is comparable to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cohen's (1988)</ref> d: ES = (2 * B * SD predictor ) / SD outcome where B is the unstandardized coefficient for the compositional effect, SD predictor is the standard deviation of the predictor, and SD outcome is the Level 1 standard deviation of the outcome.</p><p>There were a few missing data (0.79%). To make full use of the data from students with missing data, we applied the full information maximum likelihood method (FIML; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Enders, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>FIML has been found to result in trustworthy, unbiased estimates for missing values even in the case of large numbers of missing values <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Enders, 2010)</ref> and to be an adequate method to manage missing data in studies with large samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jeličič, Phelps, &amp; Lerner, 2009)</ref>. All of the models were saturated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary analysis. Descriptive statistics and Pearson product-moment correlations for</head><p>the study variables are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Enjoyment correlated negatively with anger, anxiety, and hopelessness, and the three negative emotions showed positive intercorrelations, as is typical for achievement emotions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Pekrun et al., 2011)</ref>. In addition, enjoyment correlated positively with achievement, and all three negative emotions correlated negatively with achievement.</p><p>Furthermore, the results of CFA support the measurement quality of the emotion constructs (see supplemental materials Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for factor loadings, factor determinacy scores, and correlations of factor score estimates). All factor determinacy scores were &gt; .93, demonstrating that the factor score estimates correlated highly with their respective factors, and the correlations among the score estimates attest to their validity. The CFA model showed a good fit to the data,  2 (254) = 1108.139, p &lt; .001; comparative fit index (CFI) = .959; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .046; and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = .042.</p><p>Multi-level modeling. The results of latent-manifest modeling support the proposed effects of achievement on emotions (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Figure 1; unstandardized coefficients in   supplemental materials Table 4</ref>). Student-level achievement was positively linked to enjoyment and negatively linked to anger, anxiety, and hopelessness. In contrast, class-level achievement had a negative compositional effect on enjoyment and positive compositional effects on anger, anxiety, and hopelessness. In doubly-latent modeling, the compositional effect estimates were essentially the same, although slightly higher (supplemental materials, Table <ref type="table">8</ref>). In addition, gender was positively linked to enjoyment and negatively linked to anger, anxiety, and hopelessness (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), indicating that male students reported more enjoyment and less anger, anxiety, and hopelessness than female students in mathematics. Grade level was positively related to anger and hopelessness, showing that older students reported more math-related anger and hopelessness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Based on a large-sample cross-sectional dataset, the findings confirm the expected links between achievement and emotions. Individual achievement was positively related to students' enjoyment and negatively related to their anger, anxiety, and hopelessness. In contrast, class-level achievement had a negative compositional effect on enjoyment and positive compositional effects on anger, anxiety, and hopelessness, supporting the happy-fishlittle-pond effect proposed in our theoretical model. These relations were robust when controlling for students' gender and grade level, indicating that they were not mere artifacts of these variables. Moreover, the relations were quite substantial. Effect sizes for the compositional effects ranged from .392 to .962 in the latent-manifest models and from .416 to 1.032 in the doubly-latent models. Across all four emotions included, these findings provide strong initial support for our theoretical propositions. However, interpretation of the findings is clearly limited by the cross-sectional design of the study, a limitation we attend to in Studies 2 and 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>Study 2 replicated and extended the Study 1 findings by using a longitudinal design and adding mathematics pride, shame, and self-concept. The study used grade 5 and 6 data from the longitudinal study that is part of the same multi-study project as Study 1 (PALMA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arens et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Marsh et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Murayama et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Murayama et al., , 2016;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pekrun et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Pekrun et al., , 2017))</ref>. To explain, the PALMA project contains multiple independent studies. Study 2 used a different sample of students and classes from different schools than Study 1. As such, the data from the two studies are independent. We also used the data from this longitudinal study to conduct supplemental cross-sectional analyses that investigated compositional effects of achievement on emotion in the remaining waves of the study (grades 7-9), and to conduct supplemental analyses of compositional effects while controlling for teacher behavior (for a summary of the supplemental analyses, see the Results section; for details, see the Supplemental Materials available online).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Samples and procedure. The study included annual assessments in grades 5 and 6 that took place towards the end of the school year. Intact classes were sampled. Sampling and the assessments were conducted by the Data Processing and Research Center (DPC) of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). The full student sample included 2,070 students from 83 classrooms in grade 5, and 2,059 students from 81 classrooms in grade 6. For the present analysis the sample was restricted to students from 78 classrooms in which at least ten students participated in both assessments, thus establishing a reasonable stability of classroom composition as well as sampling ratio within classrooms (for similar procedures, see <ref type="bibr">Marsh, Köller, &amp; Baumert, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Prenzel, Carstensen, et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The resulting sample included 1,759 students (50.0% female; mean starting age = 11.73 years, SD = 0.49) from 78 classrooms in 42 schools. The sample was drawn from the same three tracks of the secondary school system in Bavaria as in Study 1 (ns = 579, 500, and 680 students from 32, 19, and 27 classrooms in Hauptschule, Realschule, and Gymnasium, respectively) and was representative of the student population in this state in terms of students' school track as well as characteristics such as gender, urban versus rural location, and family background (SES; see <ref type="bibr">Pekrun et al., 2007)</ref>. The mean number of participating students per class was 22.6 (minimum = 12, maximum = 32, SD = 5.60). All instruments were administered in the students' classrooms by trained external test administrators. Student participation was based on written parental consent, and students' responses were kept strictly confidential.</p><p>Variables and measures. The study variables included students' achievement, enjoyment, pride, anger, anxiety, shame, hopelessness, and self-concept of ability in mathematics and demographic variables. Achievement, emotions, and self-concept were assessed at both waves.</p><p>Achievement. IRT scores from the same PALMA Mathematical Achievement Test as in Study 1 <ref type="bibr">(Pekrun et al., 2007)</ref> were used to assess students' mathematics achievement.</p><p>Emotions. Scales of the same Achievement Emotions Questionnaire-Mathematics (AEQ-M; <ref type="bibr">Frenzel et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Pekrun et al., 2011)</ref> as in Study 1 were used to assess math-related enjoyment, pride, anger, anxiety, shame, and hopelessness <ref type="bibr">(9, 6, 8, 15, 8, and 6 items, respectively)</ref>. Participants responded on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) scale, and the scores were averaged to form the emotion indexes (α range = .86-.90; supplemental materials Table 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-concept.</head><p>The PALMA mathematics self-concept scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arens et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pekrun et al., 2007)</ref> was used to measure self-concept (6 items; e.g., "In mathematics, I am a good student"; "It is easy for me to learn mathematics"). Participants responded on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) scale, and the scores were averaged to form the math self-concept index (αs = .88 and .90 at grades 5 and 6, respectively; supplemental materials Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic variables.</head><p>Gender and family SES were controlled in the analysis. Gender was coded 1 = female, 2 = male. SES was assessed by parent report using the EGP classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Erikson, Goldthorpe, &amp; Portocarero, 1979)</ref>, which consists of six ordered categories of parental occupational status. Higher values represent higher SES.</p><p>Multi-level modeling. The same multi-level modeling approach with Mplus (Version 8, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2017)</ref> as in Study 1 was used. CFA was used to derive estimates for latent emotion and self-concept measures and to test their measurement invariance over time.</p><p>Subsequently, we employed these measures to estimate longitudinal multi-level models. In these models, we examined the predictive effects of achievement, emotion, and self-concept at grade 5 on the same variables at grade 6. In each of the models, we controlled for autoregressive and reciprocal effects over time. Furthermore, we controlled for effects of gender and SES on all study variables at both waves. We estimated models of achievement and emotion not including self-concept as well as models that included self-concept. As in Study 1, the MLR estimator was used. There were a few missing data (1.12%), primarily because information about family SES was not available for some students (1.36% missed information about SES but had no other missing data). The full information maximum likelihood method (FIML; Enders, 2010) was used to deal with these missing data. All models were saturated.</p><p>In the models not including self-concept (Model 1), Time 1 achievement and emotion served as predictors and Time 2 achievement and emotion as outcome variables. These models estimated the predictive effects of achievement on emotion over time while controlling for autoregressive and reciprocal effects. In the models including self-concept (Model 2), Time 1 achievement, self-concept, and emotion served as predictors, and the same variables at Time 2 served as outcome variables (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). These models estimated predictive effects of achievement on self-concept, of self-concept on emotion, and of achievement on emotion over time while controlling for prior levels and reciprocal effects of all three variables.</p><p>Given the two-wave design of the analysis, it is not possible to derive estimates for the indirect effects of achievement on emotion as mediated by self-concept within the one-year time span of the study. However, if both the effect of Time 1 achievement on Time 2 self-concept and the effect of Time 1 self-concept on Time 2 emotion are significant and substantial, the evidence would be consistent with the hypothesis that self-concept can act as a mediator in the relation between achievement and emotion. Even if not sufficient to infer firm conclusions about mediation, effects of the predictor on the mediator, and of the mediator on the outcome, are two important requirements that need to be met for mediation <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(MacKinnon, Fairchild, &amp; Fritz, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>As such, we inspected the significance and size of these effects to judge support for mediation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Preliminary analysis. Descriptive statistics and Pearson product-moment correlations for the study variables are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Enjoyment and pride correlated positively, as did the negative emotions. The correlations between these two groups of emotions were negative. In addition, both positive emotions as well as self-concept correlated positively with achievement, and all of the negative emotions correlated negatively with achievement.</p><p>The results of CFA document the measurement quality of the emotion and self-concept constructs. As in Study 1, correlations between residuals for items representing the same setting (attending class, doing homework, and taking tests) were included. In addition, residuals of the same items over time were allowed to correlate (see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_6">S2</ref> for factor loadings, factor determinacy scores, correlations of factor score estimates, and goodness-of-fit indexes). All factor determinacy scores were &gt; .91, demonstrating that the factor score estimates correlated highly with their respective factors, and the correlations among the score estimates attest to their validity.</p><p>To test measurement invariance over time, we sequentially evaluated models of configural, metric, scalar, and residual invariance. Configural invariance is defined by equal patterns of factor loadings; metric invariance additionally requires equal size of factor loadings; scalar invariance requires equal factor loadings and intercepts; and residual invariance requires equal factor loadings, intercepts, and residual variances. To establish construct equivalence for analyzing correlations and path coefficients over time, metric invariance is the minimum needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Steenkamp &amp; Baumgartner, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>To evaluate invariance, we followed recommendations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chen (2007)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">Browne &amp; Du Toit, 1992)</ref>. As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Raykov and Penev (1998)</ref>, we interpreted RDR in relation to recommendations for the RMSEA. Following this rationale, RDR &lt; .05 would indicate strong equivalence of nested models, and RDR &lt; .08 an acceptable level of equivalence. As recommended, we did not use the  2 difference test because it is overly sensitive to sample size <ref type="bibr">(Marsh, Balla, &amp; McDonald, 1988)</ref>.</p><note type="other">.</note><p>The results show that configural, metric, scalar, and residual invariance can be assumed for all of the emotion and self-concept constructs (see supplemental materials Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). All of the models showed a good fit to the data. In the metric invariance models, fit indexes were CFI &gt; .963, RMSEA &lt; .042, and SRMR &lt; .038 for all of the emotion and self-concept constructs. Fit was good even for the most restrictive model (residual invariance), with CFI &gt; .959, RMSEA &lt; .043, and SRMR &lt; .058 for all constructs. For all sequential comparisons of models with increasing restrictions on invariance,  CFI was &lt; .005,  RMSEA was &lt; .006,  SRMR was &lt; .020, and RDR was &lt; .056 (supplemental materials Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>Multi-level modeling. Replicating the Study 1 findings, the model estimates supported our hypotheses (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and supplemental materials Table 9; for the unstandardized coefficients, see supplemental materials Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictive effects of achievement on emotion and self-concept. Individual achievement</head><p>was a positive predictor of enjoyment and pride and a negative predictor of anger, anxiety, shame, and hopelessness. In contrast, class-level achievement had negative compositional effects on enjoyment and pride and positive compositional effects on the negative emotions. These effects were robust across models despite substantial autoregressive effects of emotion over time.</p><p>An exception was the positive compositional effect on shame which was not significant (p =.096). Students' shame in an academic context may primarily be driven by social interaction in the classroom rather than social comparison with others' achievement. In doubly-latent models, estimates for compositional effects were essentially the same, although slightly higher (supplemental materials Table <ref type="table">9</ref>).</p><p>In the models including self-concept (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>), student-level achievement had positive predictive effects on self-concept, whereas class-level achievement had negative effects, despite substantial autoregressive effects of self-concept over time. These findings support the big-fishlittle-pond effect on self-concept within a controlled longitudinal design. Again, the compositional effects were essentially the same in doubly-latent modeling (supplemental materials Table 9). Self-concept, in turn, had positive predictive effects on the positive emotions and negative effects on the negative emotions, despite substantial autoregressive effects of emotions over time. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that selfconcept might be a mediator in the predictive effects of achievement on emotion.</p><p>Reciprocal effects. The emotions had reciprocal student-level effects on achievement over time. Enjoyment had positive predictive effects on achievement, and anger, anxiety, shame, and hopelessness had negative effects (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). These effects suggest that enjoyment can promote students' performance whereas negative emotions undermine performance. Combined with the predictive effects of achievement on emotion, the pattern of findings suggests that individual achievement and emotion were linked by reciprocal causation over time. Similarly, self-concept had positive reciprocal effects on achievement (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>); combined with the predictive effects of achievement on self-concept, these findings suggest that achievement and self-concept were also linked by reciprocal causation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Same-variable compositional effects.</head><p>Class-level achievement and self-concept had positive predictive effects on the same variables at the student level over time. Specifically, classlevel achievement at Time 1 had positive compositional effects on individual achievement at Time 2 ("peer achievement spill-over effect" <ref type="bibr">;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fruehwirth, 2013)</ref>. Unstandardized coefficients ranged from .370 to .431, and ES 2 from .691 to .804 across models (all ps &lt; .001; the unstandardized coefficients are derived by subtracting the student-level effects from the classlevel effects of Time 1 achievement on Time 2 achievement as depicted in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S5</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S6</ref>).</p><p>These effects suggest that class-level achievement positively influenced individual achievement controlling for prior achievement, in line with some previous studies on the effects of the achievement composition of classrooms (e.g., De <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fraine et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Stäbler et al., 2017</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Dicke et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, Marsh, 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">, and Televantou et al., 2015</ref>, for negative effects).</p><p>Similarly, class-average self-concept had positive compositional effects on individual selfconcept over time. This is a new finding. Unstandardized coefficients for this effect ranged from .490 to .954, and ES 2 from .231 to .449 (the unstandardized coefficients are derived by subtracting the student-level effects from the class-level effects of Time 1 self-concept on Time 2 self-concept as depicted in supplemental materials Table 6; all ps &lt; .05). The effect may be attributable to social transmission of self-confidence among members of the same classroom. For emotion, there also were positive compositional effects over time, but none of these effects was significant due to lack of variance of the emotion scores between classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relations for gender.</head><p>In line with the Study 1 findings, gender related positively to mathrelated enjoyment and pride and negatively to anxiety, shame, and hopelessness, indicating that male students reported more enjoyment and pride, and less negative emotions, than female students (supplemental materials Table 10). In addition, gender related positively to achievement and self-concept, showing that male students had higher achievement scores and reported higher self-concepts in mathematics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplemental analyses.</head><p>The PALMA longitudinal study comprises annual assessments from grades 5 to 9 <ref type="bibr">(Pekrun et al., 2007)</ref>. To control for the robustness of the results in the remaining waves (i.e., grades 7 to 9), we replicated the analysis for each of these waves in supplemental analyses (see Supplemental Materials). Because the change in class compositions from year to year after grade 6 precluded a longitudinal analysis, we conducted separate analyses for these waves. The results show the same pattern as in the grade 5-6 analysis (supplemental materials Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">11</ref>). An exception is the coefficients for shame which were not significant in the longitudinal grade 5-6 analysis but were significant in each of the cross-sectional analyses for grades 7 to 9. In the latent-manifest models, the standardized compositional effects of classaverage achievement on enjoyment (ES 2) were -.711, -.865, -.951 for grades 7, 8, and 9, respectively (all ps &lt; .001). For pride, the coefficients were -.587, -.719, -.770, respectively. For anger, they were . <ref type="bibr">573, .668, and .624; for anxiety, .521, .571, and .568; for shame, .268, .296, and .263</ref>; and for hopelessness .572, .596, and .659 (all ps &lt; .001, except for shame ps &lt; .01). In latent-latent analysis, the results were essentially the same.</p><p>To meet a concern that the compositional effects of class-average achievement may be caused by differences in teacher behavior across classes rather than achievement, we controlled for teacher behavior in additional analyses. Specifically, it could be that teachers of highachieving classes are more enthusiastic about teaching, or that they are stricter and exert more pressure on students than teachers of low-achieving classes. As such, we controlled for studentperceived teacher enthusiasm and pressure for achievement. These two variables have been found to be prime drivers of students' achievement emotions in the classroom. Teacher enthusiasm likely increases both perceived control and the perceived value of achievement, which explains their positive relations with students' enjoyment of learning (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Frenzel et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Frenzel et al., , 2017))</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, achievement pressure reduces control and has been found to exacerbate anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Zeidner, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Zeidner, , 2014))</ref>.</p><p>When including these variables as covariates in the latent-manifest longitudinal models for grades 5 to 6, the compositional effects of class-average achievement on emotions remained fully robust (see supplementary materials, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">12</ref>). The standardized compositional effects (ES 2) were -.280 (p &lt; .01), -.240 (p &lt; .01), .327 (p &lt; .01), .297 (p &lt; .01), and .333 (p &lt; .001) for enjoyment, pride, anger, anxiety, and hopelessness, respectively. As in the main analyses, the effect for shame was positive but not significant, ES 2 = .123 (p = .161). In the latent-latent models, the results were essentially the same. Similarly, when controlling for student-perceived teacher enthusiasm and teacher pressure for achievement in the cross-sectional grade 7, 8, and 9 analyses, the findings replicated the results not including these variables (supplemental materials Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">12</ref>). For enjoyment and pride, the compositional effects were again negative and significant (range of standardized effects [ES 2] = -.449 to -.713, all ps &lt; .001). For anger, anxiety, shame, and hopelessness, the effects were again positive and significant (range of standardized effects [ES 2] = .198 to .540; all ps &lt; .001, except for shame ps &lt; .05). In the latent-latent models, the effects were essentially the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The study findings replicate the results of Study 1 and fully support our theoretical model. The findings again confirm that individual achievement positively predicts achievement-related enjoyment and negatively predicts anger, anxiety, and hopelessness. They also confirm that group-level achievement has a negative compositional effect on enjoyment and positive compositional effects on the negative emotions, supporting the happy-fish-littlepond effect on emotion.</p><p>Beyond replication, the findings extend the results of Study 1 in several important ways. Based on a longitudinal dataset, the findings document that the predictive effects of achievement on emotion extend across an entire school year. This finding attests to the longevity of both individual-level and compositional effects of achievement on emotion.</p><p>Furthermore, the findings suggest that achievement also influences individuals' pride and shame, two emotions that have been regarded as particularly important for achievement strivings <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Heckhausen, 1991)</ref>. The findings indicate that individual achievement promotes pride and reduces shame, whereas group-level achievement reduces individuals' pride and exacerbates their shame when controlling for individual achievement. The results of supplemental analyses showed that these results were robust when controlling for teachers' enthusiasm and pressure for achievement, indicating that the predictive effects of achievement were not confounded with effects of these teacher behaviors.</p><p>The findings from the models including self-concept also support the big-fish-littlepond effect of group-level achievement on self-concept. Furthermore, the results show that self-concept of ability, in turn, positively predicted students' enjoyment and pride, and negatively predicted their anger, anxiety, shame, and hopelessness. This pattern of findings is consistent with propositions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Pekrun's (2006)</ref> control-value theory of achievement emotions and documents the importance of self-concept of ability for achievement emotions. Both the predictive effects of achievement on self-concept, and the predictive effects of self-concept on emotion, were substantial and significant for all of the emotions. Taken together, these effects are in line with the hypothesis that self-concept can act as a mediator in the relation between achievement and emotion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3</head><p>Study 3 used a longitudinal dataset (grade 9 to 10) with 15-year old students to examine the generalizability of the findings across age groups. The study was based on the German longitudinal extension of the 2003 cycle of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the PISA-I-Plus study <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Prenzel, Baumert, et al., 2006)</ref>. 3 As mathematics was the major domain in PISA 2003, the PISA-I-Plus study examined students' development in mathematics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples and procedure.</head><p>For the PISA-I-Plus study, intact classes including at least 10 students who participated in both assessments (grades 9 and 10) were selected from the German schools participating in the international PISA 2003 study <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Prenzel, Baumert, et al., 2006)</ref>. As in Study 2, sampling and the student assessments were performed by the Data Processing Center Achievement. The PISA mathematics test was used to assess achievement. The PISA test is a standardized achievement test assessing the competencies of 15-year olds across a wide range of ability. The database of the PISA study provides five plausible values based on item response theory scaling, rather than one single score, to estimate a student's mathematics achievement; this procedure was used to avoid biased population estimates of achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Davier, Gonzalez, &amp; Mislevy, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Prenzel, Carstensen, et al.. 2006</ref>). In accordance with the recommendations of the PISA documentation (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2005), we did not average plausible values within students, but conducted the analyses separately for the five plausible values and then averaged the resulting parameters.</p><p>Emotions. The PISA-I-Plus study used short scales from the same Achievement Emotions Questionnaire-Mathematics (AEQ-M; <ref type="bibr">Frenzel et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Pekrun et al., 2011)</ref> that was employed in Studies 1 and 2. The scales assessed enjoyment, anger, anxiety, and hopelessness (6, 4, 9, and 6 items, respectively). Participants responded on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree) scale, and the scores were averaged to form the emotion indexes (α range = .83-.93; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-concept.</head><p>The PISA 2003 mathematics self-concept scale was used (5 items; e.g., "I get good marks in mathematics"; "I learn mathematics quickly"). Participants responded on a 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree) scale. The scores were averaged to form the self-concept index (αs = .91 and .92 at grades 9 and 10, respectively; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic variables.</head><p>Students' gender and family SES were included in the analysis.</p><p>Gender was coded 1 = female, 2 = male. As in Study 2, SES was assessed using the EGP index <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Erikson, Goldthorpe, &amp; Portocarero, 1979)</ref>, with higher values representing higher SES.</p><p>Multi-level modeling. We used the same data analysis procedures as in Study 2. Again, the MLR estimator was used. There were a few missing data (3.32%), primarily because some students had not participated in either the grade 9 emotion assessment (1.47%) or the grade 10 assessment (4.20%). The full information likelihood method (FIML; Enders, 2010) was employed to deal with missing data. All models were saturated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary analysis. Descriptive statistics and Pearson product-moment correlations for</head><p>the study variables are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. As in Studies 1 and 2, enjoyment correlated negatively with anger, anxiety, and hopelessness, and the intercorrelations of the negative emotions were positive. Enjoyment and self-concept correlated positively with achievement, and the negative emotions correlated negatively with achievement. CFAs were used to test the measurement properties of the emotion and self-concept constructs. Again, we included correlations between residuals for items representing the same setting and between residuals for the same items over time (see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_7">S3</ref> for factor loadings, factor determinacy scores, correlations of factor score estimates, and goodness-of-fit indexes). All factor determinacy scores were &gt; .90, demonstrating that the factor score estimates correlated highly with their respective factors, and the correlations among the score estimates attest to their validity. Furthermore, the results show that configural, metric, scalar, and residual invariance can be assumed for all of the constructs (supplemental materials Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). All of the models showed a good fit to the data. In the metric invariance models, fit indexes were CFI &gt; .974, RMSEA &lt; .051, and SRMR &lt; .036 for all constructs. Fit was also good for the most restrictive model (residual invariance), with CFI &gt; .971, RMSEA &lt; .048, and SRMR &lt; .037 for all constructs. For all comparisons of models with increasing restrictions on invariance,  CFI and  RMSEA were &lt; .004,  SRMR was &lt; .007, and RDR was &lt; .049.</p><p>Multi-level modeling. Replicating the findings of Studies 1 and 2, the estimates again supported the proposed effects (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> and Supplemental Materials, Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">S7-S8</ref>). In longitudinal modeling, individual achievement positively predicted enjoyment and negatively predicted anger, anxiety, and hopelessness, whereas class-average achievement had negative compositional effects on enjoyment and positive compositional effects on the negative emotions.</p><p>These results were robust across models despite substantial autoregressive effects of emotion over time. In doubly-latent modeling, estimates for compositional effects were essentially the same, although slightly higher (supplemental materials Table <ref type="table">9</ref>).</p><p>The results of the models including self-concept also replicated the Study 2 findings, with student-level and class-level achievement predicting self-concept, and self-concept predicting the emotions. The compositional effects of class-average achievement on the emotions were substantially reduced, and the effects on enjoyment, anger, and hopelessness were no longer significant with self-concept of ability in the equation (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that self-concept might be a mediator in the predictive effects of achievement on emotion.</p><p>In addition, there were again reciprocal effects of emotion on achievement, in line with reciprocal effects models of these linkages <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Pekrun et al., 2017)</ref>. In contrast to the Study 2 findings, class-level achievement had no compositional effects on individual achievement over time (unstandardized coefficients &lt; .071; ES 2 &lt; .118; ps &gt; .372; see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>, S7, and S8). As in Study 2, there were positive compositional effects of class-level self-concept on individual self-concept, but these effects were not significant either. Finally, consistent with the Studies 1 and 2 findings, gender related positively to math-related enjoyment and pride, and negatively to anger, anxiety and hopelessness (supplemental materials Table 10), indicating that male students reported more positive emotions and less negative emotions than female students. Gender also related positively to achievement and self-concept, showing that male students had higher performance scores and more self-confidence in mathematics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Using a large-scale longitudinal dataset, the findings replicated the results of Study 2.</p><p>Extending Study 2, they show that these results hold for older students as well. The findings again confirm that individual achievement is a positive predictor of achievement-related enjoyment and a negative predictor of anger, anxiety, and hopelessness, whereas the compositional effects of group-level achievement are negative for enjoyment and positive for the negative emotions, in line with the proposed happy-fish-little-pond effect on emotion. As in Study 2, these relations proved not to be short-lived, but to extend over the course of an entire school year. Furthermore, as in Study 2, the findings document the big-fish-little-pond effect on self-concept, and they support the hypothesis that self-concept might be a mediator both for the individual-level effects and the compositional effects of achievement on emotions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Achievement emotions are critically important for engagement, learning, and performance in achievement contexts, and for personal growth and well-being more generally <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ashkanasy &amp; Humphrey, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Elfenbein, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Pekrun, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pekrun &amp; Linnenbrink-Garcia, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Zeidner, 2014)</ref>. Given the relevance of these emotions, it is important to acquire information about their origins. In this research, we considered two particularly promising candidates to explain the development of achievement emotions, namely, individual and group-level achievement. We developed a reference group model describing the possible effects of achievement on emotion, and we tested the model in three separate large-scale empirical studies.</p><p>By including both individual and contextual variables, this research contributes to our understanding of individual differences as well as the impact of social groups. The results suggest that personality and social psychological research on the influence of groups should attend to the emotional consequences of group composition. In addition, understanding how group composition influences emotion can also inform other disciplines. To the extent that the present findings are generalizable, they are relevant for sociology and management research as well as applied fields within psychology, such as educational, occupational, performing arts, and sports psychology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relations of Achievement to Emotion</head><p>Our theoretical model posits that individual achievement is related to more positive emotions and less negative emotions, whereas group-level achievement is related to less positive emotions and more negative emotions. Both of these propositions were supported across all three studies. From a total of 28 relevant path coefficients (student-level and compositional effects of achievement on four emotions in Studies 1 and 3 and six emotions in Study 2), all were in the expected direction, and all but one were significant. The findings were robust when controlling for autoregressive effects, reciprocal effects, gender, SES, and teacher behavior, and they were consistent across studies, analytical designs (synchronous vs. longitudinal), modeling procedures (latent-manifest vs. doubly-latent), and a range of age groups and grade levels. The size of the path coefficients was substantial and increased further across age, as can be seen from the Studies 2 and 3 results (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3-6</ref> and<ref type="table">S9</ref>). Overall, these findings attest to the importance of both individual achievement and group-level achievement as antecedents of achievement emotions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Role of Self-Concept</head><p>Based on our theoretical model, we expected that achievement predicts self-concept of ability, and that self-concept, in turn, predicts emotions. In two of the three studies, measures of self-concept were included to test these propositions. By linking the constructs of achievement emotion and self-concept, the present research contributes to the integration of two research traditions that have worked in relative isolation to date. The results support the proposed relations of self-concept of ability to achievement and emotions.</p><p>First, the results confirmed prior evidence that individual achievement is positively related to students' self-concept of ability, whereas group-average achievement is negatively related to self-concept when controlling for individual achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Marsh et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Whereas most previous studies used school-level achievement to examine compositional effects on self-concept, the present research demonstrates that these effects also occur when considering classes as reference groups, in line with a few previous studies that considered class-level achievement (see <ref type="bibr">Marsh, Köller, &amp; Baumert, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Trautwein, Gerlach, &amp; Lüdtke, 2008)</ref>. In fact, to the extent that the peers in one's class represent the immediate environment for evaluating achievement relative to others, studies considering class-level achievement may be particularly well suited to examine compositional effects of achievement, in line with the local dominance effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alicke et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Zell &amp; Alicke, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Self-concept, in turn, was a positive predictor of positive emotions and a negative predictor of negative emotions. This finding supports <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Pekrun's (2006)</ref> control-value theory of achievement emotions which posits that achievement emotions are shaped by competence beliefs. The two-wave design of our longitudinal studies (i.e., Studies 2 and 3) precluded longitudinal tests of mediation. However, taken together, the predictive effects of achievement on self-concept, and of self-concept on emotion, support the hypothesis that self-concept is a mediator in the effects of both individual and group-level achievement on emotion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reciprocal Effects and Spill-Over Effects</head><p>We found that achievement and emotion were linked by reciprocal relations over time, which confirms the functional importance of emotions for performance and supports reciprocal causation models of emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Pekrun et al., 2017)</ref>. Achievement was a positive predictor of positive emotions and a negative predictor of negative emotions controlling for prior emotion.</p><p>Positive emotions, in turn, were positive predictors of achievement, and negative emotions were negative predictors, controlling for prior achievement. These findings suggest that achievement and emotions are linked by virtuous and vicious cycles, with success and positive emotions mutually reinforcing each other, and failure being reciprocally linked with negative emotions.</p><p>Can the negative emotional effects of being in a high-performing group be outweighed by beneficial effects on achievement (peer achievement spill-over effects; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fruehwirth, 2013)</ref>? The findings show that class-level achievement had positive compositional effects on individual achievement over time in Study 2 but not in Study 3. Such a lack of consistently beneficial effects is counter to traditional expectations, but mirrors the mixed findings from other studies. Some studies found positive effects of group-average achievement (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burns &amp; Mason, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">De Fraine et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Opdenakker &amp; van Damme, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Stäbler et al., 2017)</ref>, whereas others found null effects or even negative effects <ref type="bibr">(Dicke et al., in press;</ref><ref type="bibr">Marsh, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Televantou et al., 2015)</ref>. As argued by <ref type="bibr">Dicke et al. (in press</ref>; also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hauser, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Harker &amp; Tymms, 2004)</ref>, it is important to use longitudinal designs and to control for autoregressive effects, measurement error, and pre-existing differences between students when examining these effects, because not including these controls can generate positive estimates ("phantom effects;" <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Harker &amp; Tymms, 2004)</ref> when the true effect is in fact negative or zero. Overall, the evidence suggests that being in a high-achieving group is not a reliable predictor of benefits for individual achievement.</p><p>In fact, given the negative compositional effects of group-level achievement on individual emotions, it is plausible to assume that group-level achievement can also have negative effects on individual achievement. The present findings document negative compositional effects of class-level achievement on self-concept and positive emotions, and positive compositional effects on negative emotions. Self-concept and positive emotions, in turn, had positive reciprocal effects on individual achievement, and negative emotions had negative effects. Taken together, this pattern of findings suggests that group-level achievement can have negative effects on individual achievement mediated by reduced self-confidence, reduced enjoyment, and increased negative emotions such as anxiety and hopelessness.</p><p>However, to more comprehensively judge the effects of being in a high-versus lowachieving group, it would also be necessary to consider effects on outcomes other than emotions or performance as measured in traditional cognitive assessments. For example, students in highachieving groups may be exposed to higher-level thinking or to more advanced methods and ideas. Furthermore, across education, work, and sports domains being in high-achieving groups may help individuals connect to unique social networks that can assist them socially and professionally. It is a task for future research to consider a broader range of outcomes and to disentangle effects of group-level achievement from associated variables that are extraneous to achievement itself, such as institutional resources or quality of leadership.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>The findings of this research provide robust support for our proposed reference group model. Nevertheless, a number of limitations may be noted and used to suggest directions for future research. First, as compared with experimental studies, the power of non-experimental field studies to derive causal conclusions is limited. In the absence of random assignment with experimental manipulation, or even when there is random assignment, typically there are alternative explanations of the effects. As such, although the present research used longitudinal structural equation modeling and controlled for related variables, autoregressive effects, and reciprocal effects, the possibility still exists that our findings are attributable to other variables that were not included in the study. A related limitation is the use of latent factor score estimates which implies some degree of factor indeterminacy, although small in the present research according to the factor determinacy scores (supplemental materials Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>On the other hand, field studies may be more ecologically valid than experimental emotion studies, which are limited in terms of situational representativeness and ethical concerns about experimentally manipulating emotions. Furthermore, statistical power is higher in field studies such as those presented here due to large sample size. The design of our research, including large-scale multi-level longitudinal analyses controlling for measurement error and sampling error, is arguably stronger than most previous nonexperimental research on compositional effects (Gonzáles-Romá &amp; Hernández, 2017).</p><p>To balance the benefits and drawbacks of different methodologies and make headway in this avenue of research, future investigations should further pursue the approach taken herein while complementing this approach with experimental studies. For future studies, it would also be important to consider additional third variables that could not be controlled using the present datasets, such as genetic dispositions that could influence the covariation between variables at the individual level. Studies using co-twin control or discordant-twin designs, for example, could help bolster the strength of conclusions drawn from the present investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(McGue, Osler, &amp; Christensen, 2010)</ref>. In addition, longitudinal research should consider designs that involve more than two waves and more fine-grained temporal resolution to investigate the generalizability of the findings across different time scales, and to make it possible to directly analyze mediation by variables such as self-concept.</p><p>The present results pertain to the achievement emotions experienced by students in mathematics. It is open to question whether the same pattern of relationships holds for other academic domains. In addition, it also is open to question whether similar effects will be found for achievement contexts other than education. Our theoretical model suggests that individual and group-level achievement should exert similar effects across various contexts (in work, sports, performing arts, etc.). Future research should examine the proposed links in these nonacademic contexts.</p><p>Furthermore, the present research included a range of age groups in adolescence.</p><p>Given that self-concepts of ability and related achievement emotions develop prior to entering formal education, it is plausible to assume that the happy-fish-little-pond effect emerges early in the preschool years. In addition, as implied by social comparison theory and control-value theory, it is plausible to except that this effect also plays a major role in adulthood. The possible generalizability of the findings to younger as well as older age groups has yet to be examined, however. Similarly, the present research analyzed achievement emotions in one cultural context only. The links between individual achievement, appraisals, and achievement emotions have been found to be robust across cultural contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Pekrun, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Pekrun, , 2018))</ref>, suggesting cross-cultural universality. However, the generalizability of the effects of grouplevel achievement on emotions across cultures has yet to be established. Finally, while achievement and self-concept of ability are important antecedents of achievement emotions, other factors are likely to be relevant as well. The links between achievement, self-concept, and achievement emotions were far from perfect in the present data, suggesting the need to attend to additional processes to more fully account for the origins of achievement emotions. It is also important to note that both self-concept and emotion were assessed using self-report in this research. When using other measures of emotion (e.g., behavioral and physiological indicators), the link between the two variables may be less strong and leave more room for detecting other possible mediators in the achievement-emotion relation. From the perspective of control-value theory, important additional candidates include achievement goals and the perceived value of achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Pekrun, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Pekrun et al., 2009)</ref>. Future research should examine the interplay of these various individual antecedents in shaping achievement emotions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Practice</head><p>From a policy and practice perspective, the findings should be of interest to individuals who make decisions about their membership in groups and participation in group-based programs. They also should be of interest to policy-makers, administrators, supervisors, coaches, and teachers shaping the composition of organizations, teams, and classes. As aptly argued by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Harker and Tymms (2004)</ref>, compositional effects are important to policy-making.</p><p>The way in which organizations group people matters to both individual and collective outcomes. Trying to explain and understand compositional effects is therefore vital. This is likely to be true not only for organizational and educational settings, the domains for which recent advances in the study of compositional effects may have been strongest <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gonzáles-Romá &amp; Hernández, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Marsh et al., 2009)</ref>. Compositional effects are equally relevant for institutions and groups in other contexts (economy, sports, the family, etc.; for similar arguments, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Jex &amp; Bliese, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kriwy, Gross, &amp; Gottburgsen, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Maltby, Wood, Vlaev, Taylor, &amp; Brown, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Rose 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Rousseau, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>More specifically, two important messages follow from the present research. First, the findings suggest that individual achievement may benefit emotional well-being, with successful performance facilitating the development of positive emotions and failure contributing to negative emotions. Accordingly, providing individuals with opportunities to experience success may help to promote their emotional well-being (e.g., by using intrapersonal standards to evaluate achievement and emphasizing mastery over competition goals; Pekrun, Cusack, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Murayama, Elliot, &amp; Thomas, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Second, the findings suggest that placing individuals in high-achievement groups may incur emotional costs. For future research and practice, it will be important to develop strategies to reduce the costs for emotional well-being that may be associated with membership in a highachieving group. Alternatively, policy-makers could consider establishing systems with lower levels of achievement-based stratification (also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Parker, Jerrim, Schoon, &amp; Marsh, 2016)</ref>. In sum, by documenting the predictive power of individual and group-level achievement for explaining emotions, the present findings elucidate one important factor that can be targeted by practitioners and policy-makers to reduce individuals' negative affect and facilitate the development of their emotional well-being and mental health. a Study 1 correlations were averaged across grade levels (5-10) using Fisher's z transformation. b Achievement scores were Rasch-scaled and z-standardized (M = 0, SD = 1) in all studies. p &lt; .01 for |r| &gt; .07, .07, and .04 in Studies 1, 2, and 3, respectively.       To further check the robustness of findings, we first investigated the compositional effects of class-average on emotion in the remaining waves of the PALMA longitudinal study in separate analyses for grades 7, 8, and 9 (see main text). Second, we performed additional analyses controlling for student-perceived teacher enthusiasm and pressure for achievement in the grade 5-6 longitudinal analysis and each of the grades 7, 8, and 9 cross-sectional analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses for Grades 7-9</head><p>Method. Samples included the grades 7, 8, and 9 participants of the PALMA longitudinal study (grades 7-9: Ns = 2,397, 2,410, and 2,528 students, respectively, 50.1%, 50.5%, and 51.1% female; see <ref type="bibr">Pekrun et al., 2007)</ref>. We used the same measures for achievement and emotion as in the longitudinal grade 5-6 analysis (see main text). For achievement, the IRT scores from the PALMA mathematical achievement test were used. The emotions were measured using the same Achievement Emotions Questionnaire-Mathematics as in the longitudinal analysis. Alpha reliabilities for the enjoyment, pride, anger, anxiety, shame, and hopelessness scales were . <ref type="bibr">88, .88, .87. .91, .87, and .90, respectively, in grade 7; .85, .89, .87, .91, .82, and .90 in grade 8; and .89, .89, .88, .92, .89, and .90</ref> in grade 9. Factor scores for the emotions were derived from separate confirmatory factor analyses for the three waves. As in the longitudinal grade 5-6 analysis, we constructed separate multi-level models for the six emotions, with achievement as the predictor and emotion as the outcome variable. Gender and SES were controlled in the analysis.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ij j ij j j ij r X X Y     ) ( . 1 0   j j j u X 0 . 01 00 0       10 1    j ij Y j 0  j 1  ij X j X . 00  10  j 0  j 1  01  j X . j u 0 ij j j ij j ij r u X X X Y       0 . 10 .<label>01</label></formula><p>Results. The findings replicate the results of the longitudinal grade 5-6 analysis (Table <ref type="table">S9</ref>). Again, individual achievement related positively to students' math enjoyment and pride, and negatively to their math-related anger, anxiety, shame, and hopelessness. In contrast, there were negative compositional effects of class-average achievement on enjoyment and pride, and positive compositional effects on anger, anxiety, shame, and hopelessness. The effects were stronger than in the longitudinal analysis, likely due to the cross-sectional design of the analysis involving an assessment of both achievement and emotion within the same school year. In contrast to the non-significant compositional effect on shame in the longitudinal analysis, the compositional effects on shame were significant for each of the grade 7, 8, and 9 analyses, which likely is also due to the nature of the design. In sum, the findings attest to the robustness of the student-level and compositional effects of achievement on emotion across each of the remaining waves of the longitudinal study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses Controlling for Teacher Behavior</head><p>Method. To control for teacher behavior, we replicated the grade 5-6 longitudinal analysis (Model 1 including achievement and emotion) and the grades 7, 8, and 9 cross-sectional analyses (see above) while including teachers' student-perceived teacher enthusiasm and pressure for achievement as predictors. For the grade 5-6 analysis, teacher behavior at grade 5 was entered as a predictor, in line with the longitudinal logic of keeping predictor and outcome variables temporally separate. In each of the four analyses, enthusiasm was measured using the PALMA Teacher Engagement and Enthusiasm scale (5 items; e.g., "Our math teacher is enthusiastic about teaching;" Cronbach's  = .84, .85, .87, and .87 at grade 5, 7, 8, and 9, respectively). Pressure for achievement was measured with the PALMA Teacher Pressure for Achievement scale (5 items; e.g., "My teacher expects better grades from me than I can possibly achieve;" Cronbach's  = . <ref type="bibr">72, .75, .68, and .69 at grade 5, 7, 8, and 9, respectively)</ref>. In multi-level modeling, the two variables were treated in the same way as the achievement predictors, that is, they were groupmean centered and entered in the models at both the student and class levels (at the class level, they represent students' shared perception of teacher behavior; at the student level, they represent students' individual deviation from shared perception).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results.</head><p>The results indicate that the study findings were robust when controlling for teachers' enthusiasm and pressure for achievement (for a summary of compositional effects, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S10</ref>). Specifically, class-average achievement again had significantly negative compositional effects on enjoyment and pride across the grade 5-6 and the grade 7, 8, and 9 analyses. Across these analyses, the compositional effects were significantly negative for anger, anxiety, shame, and hopelessness, except for the effect on shame in the longitudinal grade 5-6 analysis. As in the main analysis, this effect was negative but not significant. Overall, these findings suggest that the study results on the compositional effects of class-average achievement were not confounded with differences in teachers' emotion-relevant behavior across classes.

The sample consisted of N = 4,353 students (57.2% female; mean starting age = 15.58 years, SD = .55) from 194 classrooms located in 119 schools representing all major school types that exist in Germany, except the lower-track Hauptschule from which students graduated at the end of grade 9. Schools included the medium-track Realschule, the high-track Gymnasium, the comprehensive Integrierte Gesamtschule, and the Mittelschule which integrates low and medium tracks (Ns = 1,859, 1,864, 228, and 402 students from 81, 80, 13, and 20 classes in Realschule, Gymnasium, Gesamtschule, and Mittelschule, respectively). The mean number of participating students per class was 22.4 (minimum = 12, maximum = 30, SD = 4.26). The assessments took place towards the end of the school year. All instruments were administered in the students' classrooms by trained external test administrators. Student participation was based on written parental consent, and students' responses were kept strictly confidential.Variables and measures. The study variables included students' achievement, enjoyment, anger, anxiety, hopelessness, and self-concept of ability in mathematics and demographic variables. Pride and shame had not been assessed in the PISA-I-Plus study.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Footnotes</head><p>1 To denote the effects of group composition, we use the term compositional effect.</p><p>Alternatively, these effects have been called contextual effects in some of the literature. Both terms are used to depict effects of group-level variables on individual outcomes. However, the term "contextual" is often used to describe effects of group-level variables other than group composition, such as size, budget, leadership styles, or governance structures. In contrast, as argued by <ref type="bibr">Harker and Thymms (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Rose (2018)</ref>, "compositional" specifically refers to effects of the group-level composition of individual variables.
