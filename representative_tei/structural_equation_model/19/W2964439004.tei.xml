<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The importance of self-regulation in a MOOC has been extensively discussed in research studies that provide evidence about the significant relationship between self-regulated learning and success in an e-learning environment. Learners with high self-regulated learning are more independent in regulating their learning and have a greater probability of success in their online courses. This study identifies factors that influence self-regulated learning and determines relationships between these factors and self-regulated learning. A conceptual model is proposed for combining success factors for self-regulated learning in a MOOC environment. A research instrument based on the model was designed and administered to six hundred and twenty-two MOOC students enrolled in five universities. Relationships between relevant factors and selfregulated learning were examined using a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique, and the statistical findings revealed that three factors -service quality, attitude, and course quality -influence self-regulated learning in a MOOC.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>A Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is a new phenomenon in e-learning sector that has substantial capability to provide free online courses to a huge group of learners around the world. MOOC contributes to improvement of educational institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Mazoue, 2014)</ref> by allowing learners to effectively exchange knowledge and experience through collaborative learning. MOOC offers several features such as interaction, self-reflection, collaboration, and evaluation that support learning experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(de Waard et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the growth in MOOC implementation, there are some issues surrounding its successful implementation in higher education contexts; one such issue is the high dropout rate among MOOC learners <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Parr, 2013)</ref>. Research studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alraimi, Zo, &amp; Ciganek, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hew &amp; Cheung, 2014)</ref> have indicated that completion rates in MOOC courses could be less than 10%, and such high dropout rates have occurred across multiple institutions. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), for example, established its first MOOC in 2012 with a total of 155,000 students enrolled, experienced a dropout rate of more than 95 %, meaning that only 7,000 out of 155,000 students successfully completed the course <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Daniel &amp; Uvalic-Trumbic, 2013)</ref>. Such a high dropout rate obviously reflects an unsuccessful implementation of MOOC at the institutional level.</p><p>Since the literature strongly indicates that the high dropout rate in online learning courses may be due to a mix of factors associated with courses, services, and educational quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alsabawy, Cater-Steel, &amp; Soar, 2012)</ref>, understanding the factors that affect MOOC success is critical and careful consideration of these factors could help improve the effectiveness of implementing MOOC and diminish its failings <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alsabawy et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Authors, 2018)</ref>, especially for MOOC stakeholders, administrators, managers and scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alsabawy, Cater-Steel, &amp; Soar, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Current MOOC literature has described the important role of learners' self-regulated learning (SRL) skills in accomplishing MOOC success (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hood, Littlejohn, &amp; Milligan, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Littlejohn &amp; Milligan, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Terras &amp; Ramsay, 2015)</ref>. MOOC provides learners with powerful self-regulated learning skills (i.e., time management and effort regulation) to promote learning, particularly self-directed learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kizilcec, Pérez-Sanagustín, &amp; Maldonado, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Magen-Nagar &amp; Cohen, 2016)</ref>. This leads to a high degree of selfregulation that in turn leads to greater engagement within learning via MOOC and makes students more likely to succeed in their learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kizilcec, Pérez-Sanagustín, &amp; Maldonado, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Liaw &amp; Huang, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Adopting from the <ref type="bibr">DeLone &amp; McLean Information System model (2003)</ref>, this study extends the current literature by examining five (5) major factors that influence learners' SRL skills. The five factors are: (1) system quality; (2) information quality; (3) service quality; (4) attitude; and (5) course quality. Understanding the influence of each of these factors is important to support building a successful operational framework of MOOC success factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AIM OF THE STUDY</head><p>This study aims to combine the MOOC success factors for self-regulated learning in a proposed model based on the D &amp; M (2003) model, and to identify the relationships between these factors and SRL. It also seeks to offer interested researchers scientific results related to self-regulated learning skills in MOOC environments. Within this perspective, the research objectives for this study are as follows:</p><p>1. To determine the key factors that influence self-regulated learning in MOOC; and 2. To determine the relationships between the factors in the proposed model. This study has been guided by the following research questions:</p><p>1. What are the key factors influencing self-regulated learning in MOOC? 2. What are the relationships between 5 success factors (i.e. system quality, information quality, service quality, student attitude, course quality) and learners' self-regulated learning?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</head><p>This study intends to contribute to a better understanding of MOOC literature by highlighting the factors influencing self-regulated learning and combining them into a framework based on the D &amp; M (2003) model to guide researchers, educators, and instructional designers to develop effective MOOC environments that can effectively support learners self-regulated learning skills and subsequent success in MOOC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LITERATURE REVIEW</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Regulated Learning</head><p>The concept of self-regulated learning relates to how individuals manage their personal learning processes, especially how to monitor, regulate, and evaluate their own learning, and plan learning actions and behavioral processes that increase likelihood of goal attainment <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Zimmerman, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Self-regulated learning has received great attention in the online learning literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cho &amp; Kim, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Terras &amp; Ramsay, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zhao, 2016)</ref>. In these studies, the vital role of self-regulated learning with respect to learner behavior online was highlighted, and the influence of self-regulation on promoting success in online learning environments was revealed <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cho &amp; Kim, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Terras &amp; Ramsay, 2015)</ref>. Student success in e-learning clearly requires effective use of self-regulated learning strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barnard-Brak, Paton, &amp; Lan, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cho and Shen (2013)</ref> examined the role of self-regulation skills and found that since learners with a high level of self-regulation are more independent learners in regulating their learning thus, their probability of success in online courses is greater. Self-regulation skills contribute to supporting learners' engagement and improve learning strategies achieved through instructional interventions and practice in implementing the self-regulated learning process. Self-regulated learning skills can enhance learners' ability to regularly review their material, to effectively manage their time, to seek assistance from peers or instructors, and to provide the required metacognition skills that reflect their own learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(You &amp; Kang, 2014)</ref>. Self-regulated learning (SRL) contributes to develop learners' skills related to being active learners in obtaining the required knowledge and improving their personal steps toward mastering that knowledge. Enhanced self-regulated learning skills help learners to find the best solutions for challenges or obstacles facing them, thus achieving their learning goals and succeeding in their learning process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Broadbent and Poon (2015)</ref> indicated that highly self-regulated learners exhibit effective positive motivation and self-efficiency with respect to their own learning processes through such activities as selecting learning content, identifying learning goals, and organizing and controlling their learning processes.</p><p>Conversely, not all students have the motivation required to organize their online course activity, and not all of them are able to effectively regulate their online learning. Many studies have identified the lack of SRL skills among participants involved in online learning settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kizilcec &amp; Halawa, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lee, Choi, &amp; Kim, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Nawrot &amp; Doucet, 2014)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lee et al. (2012)</ref> argue that students without the ability to manage their own online learning will face difficulties and this may hinder their success in online courses.</p><p>The literature indicates that learners with low self-regulation skills would be less likely to achieve success in the e-learning field <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cho &amp; Shen, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kizilcec &amp; Halawa, 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">You and Kang (2014)</ref> highlighted that lack of self-regulation skills in e-learning environments may result in learners consuming extra time in completing the assignments, causing turning in late assignments or generally poor-quality work. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Nawrot and Doucet (2014)</ref> also indicated that lesser student experience with regulating their own learning (such as poor time management) can lead to increase in course withdrawal, frustration, and consequently poor academic outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MOOC and Self-Regulated Learning</head><p>MOOC is a platform for communication and collaboration in which participants exchange information to enhance their knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(de Waard et al., 2014)</ref>. Many MOOCs have been designed to encourage learners to regulate their learning all by themselves rather than depending on instructor guidance. Since MOOC learners can independently select learning resources and choose to participate in activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Davis, Chen, Jivet, Hauff, &amp; Houben, 2016)</ref>, they may require learners to regulate their learning while using MOOC. Previous research suggests that MOOC learners with highly self-regulated learning exhibit different cognitive, affective, and behavioral reactions toward learning in MOOC than those who exhibit lower levels of selfregulated learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hood et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Littlejohn &amp; Milligan, 2015)</ref>. It is clear that MOOC success requires high levels of self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, but at present not much research is available on how to support self-regulated learning skills in a MOOC environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Onah &amp; Sinclair, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>There is also growing evidence that MOOC has significant potential to support student self-regulated learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Littlejohn, Hood, Milligan, &amp; Mustain, 2016)</ref>. Since MOOC learners must be independent and active participants in the learning process, those with higher self-regulated learning skills exhibit more ability to engage in learning by individually setting learning objectives, identifying the effective learning techniques, and monitoring the processes of achieving their objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kizilcec et al., 2016)</ref>. Unfortunately, many groups of MOOC learners continue to struggle with self-regulating their learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Milligan, Littlejohn, &amp; Margaryan, 2013)</ref>. Consequently, because of the importance of SRL skill in MOOC system success and the rarity of available studies about the relationships between MOOC and student self-regulated learning, this study examines SRL as a dependent factor and investigates the factors that influence SRL in a MOOC environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DeLone and McLean Model</head><p>The DeLone and McLean model is considered one of the most important models contributed to assessment of e-learning systems success <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alsabawy et al., 2011)</ref>. The model hypothesizes that factors of information quality, system quality, and service quality all have positive influence on user satisfaction and use/intention to use particular systems. System quality relates to how well the hardware and the software work together; in other words, it refers to the effectiveness of processing system information <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(DeLone &amp; McLean, 2003)</ref>. Information quality is related to measurement of the quality of information created by a system <ref type="bibr">(Petter, DeLone &amp; McLean, 2008)</ref> while service quality refers to the level and manner in which services are provided by the information system sector or system providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(DeLone &amp; McLean, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Many studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Freeze, Alshare, Lane, &amp; Wen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hassanzadeh, Kanaani, &amp; Elahi, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tella, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wang &amp; Chiu, 2011)</ref> have tested the validity of DeLone and McLean's model. Some of these studies adopted DeLone and McLean's model in its entirety while others partially tested the model by examining some of its specific factors. Some studies, on the other hand, extended the DeLone and McLean model by including other external factors to achieve deeper understanding of system success.</p><p>Because of the vital role of self-regulated learning skills in e-learning environments, many studies have indicated that a self-regulated learning factor should be considered as a principal dimension in evaluating systems success, so <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lee and Lee (2008)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Model and Hypotheses</head><p>Samarasinghe (2012) indicated that there are insufficient dimensions in the D&amp;M (2003) model to measure system success and cover all of the relevant e-learning success features, so he recommended inclusion of other significant factors related to both learners and courses in the model.</p><p>This study therefore proposes a model that includes a total of six variables: information quality, system quality, service quality, course quality, attitude, and self-regulated learning. Arrows can be used to denote proposed relationships among the six variables in the research model as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. In this model, system quality refers to the degree to which learners perceive that a MOOC system is easy to use, easy to learn, has integrity, and is reliable. The second factor in this study, information quality, represents the quality and relevance of the information offered by MOOC systems. In other words, information quality refers to the ability of a MOOC to provide information that exactly meets learners' needs, is relevant to learners' job, is easy to understand, and is up to date. On the other hand, attitude refers to the set of learner beliefs in using MOOC regarding whether it is good or bad. Finally, course quality in this study refers the extent to which a learner believes that a MOOC offers quality content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses</head><p>Barnard-Brak et al., (2010) defined self-regulated learning as voluntary behavior of an individual to measure his or her own success in learning. MOOC can enable learners to individually regulate their learning processes by promoting self-reflection, developing learning objectives, planning time use effectively, and managing skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Onah &amp; Sinclair, 2017)</ref>. Some researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Littlejohn et al., 2016)</ref> have also discussed MOOC used to promote self-regulation skills. Learners with high self-regulation levels contribute to engagement within e-learning and are more likely to succeed in e-learning environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Liaw &amp; Huang, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zhao, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In a related study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zhao (2016)</ref> examined factors influencing self-regulation skill in an online learning environment such as MOOC and revealed the three (3) main factors related to system success: system quality, information quality, and service quality. The following hypotheses are therefore proposed:</p><p>H1: There is a positive relationship between system quality and learners' self-regulated learning in MOOC environment. H2: There is a positive relationship between information quality and learners' self-regulated learning in MOOC environment. H3: There is a positive relationship between service quality and learners' self-regulated learning in MOOC environment.</p><p>Since many studies have shown that self-regulation is a critical factor affecting student attitudes toward e-learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kramarski &amp; Gutman, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Zimmerman &amp; Schunk, 2001)</ref>, H4 is also proposed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H4:</head><p>There is a positive relationship between attitude and learners' self-regulated learning in MOOC environment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lin, Lin, and Hung (2015)</ref> argue that the perceptions of learners toward the quality and richness of course content have significant influence with respect to accepting the knowledge provided. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rai and Chunrao (2016)</ref> noted the role of quality of course in MOOC systems success. Therefore, H5 is proposed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H5:</head><p>There is a positive relationship between course quality and learners' self-regulated learning in MOOC environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODOLOGY Research Instrument</head><p>The questionnaire used in this research was gleaned and compiled various validated instruments from the literature reviewed on e-learning and MOOC but some modifications were made to wording to suit the context of this research. System quality and information quality factors were measured with a scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alsabawy et al. (2012)</ref> while service quality was measured by a scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Ozkan, Koseler, and Baykal (2009)</ref>. Course quality items were adapted from a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rhema and Miliszewska (2014)</ref> whilst self-regulated learning factor was examined by a scale for <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Onah and Sinclair (2017)</ref>. Most of these studies employed the D &amp; M (2003) model in their researches.</p><p>The research instrument is divided into two parts. Part 1 includes demographic information, including gender, age, and previous experience with MOOC, while the second part includes measurement items of the research model based on six constructs: system quality, information quality, service quality, attitude, course quality, and self-regulated learning. The questionnaire covered 41 items using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from "Strongly agree (5)," to "Strongly disagree (1)".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection and Analysis</head><p>The questionnaire was administered to 1000 undergraduate students from the top active MOOC user universities in Malaysia. All participants had been enrolled in at least one MOOC course via the OpenLearning platform, the official MOOC platform in Malaysia.</p><p>From the total number of 1000 questionnaires administered, 622 valid questionnaires were returned, an effective response rate of 62.2 %. In the final sample population, 63.8% participants were females and 35.9% were males. The majority of the participants, 54.2%, were of ages between 20 and 30 years. With regard to participants' experience in MOOC, 41.3% of the participants had limited experience with a current MOOC course.</p><p>Data from the questionnaires were analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Ringle, Wende, &amp; Becker, 2015)</ref> because PLS-SEM enables researchers to acquire an accurate study model and is considered suitable for testing new models <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Henseler, Ringle, &amp; Sinkovics, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reliability and Validity of the Proposed Model</head><p>The reliability of the questionnaire was measured using Cronbach's alpha (), the most common indicator for internal consistency, an  value greater than 0.70 indicating good reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hair et al., 2006)</ref>. The data analysis revealed that the Cronbach's alpha for the items in the questionnaire was between 0.70 and 0.915, reflecting its high reliability.</p><p>Analysis of validity was then conducted using PLS-SEM analysis. Validity refers to the capability of the measurement items to effectively measure the intended constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hair, Black, Babin, &amp; Anderson, 2010)</ref>. In this study, validity was measured in two stages: (1) analysis of the measurement model, and (2) analysis of the structural model <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hair, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2011)</ref>. The findings of these analyses are presented in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS Analysis of the Measurement Model</head><p>In the first stage, analysis of the measurement model was conducted by evaluating convergent and discriminant validity. Three indices were used to test convergent validity. First, by assessing factor loading, each item loading of the construct should be greater than 0.50 to achieve convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hair et al., 2006)</ref>. Second, the value of Average Variance Extracted (AVE) that should exceed 0.50 was tested. Third, the value of composite reliability (CR) of each item, that should be greater than 0.7, was examined <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hair, Hult, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2014)</ref>. The results of convergent validity determination for the questionnaire items are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, the factor loadings for all factors were all higher than 0.6., and the AVE values were also above 0.5. The composite reliability (CR) for the factors were 0.8 and higher, suggesting good convergent validity.</p><p>Next, the discriminant validity of the model factors was established. Discriminant validity is the degree to which measurement items of a specific factor reflect that factor instead of other factors in the same model <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hulland, 1999)</ref>. In this study, the new HTMT criteria using PLS was conducted to check for lack of discriminant validity. HTMT discriminant validity between two constructs is established when the HTMT 0.85 value is less than 0.85 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kline, 2011)</ref>, or HTMT 0.90 value is less than 0.90 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gold, Malhotra, &amp; Segars, 2001)</ref> when the confidence interval has a value of one <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Henseler, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2015)</ref>. The Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) Analysis is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The findings of the analysis revealed that there is no value of 1 for the confidence interval of the factors and all values passed the HTMT value of 0.90 tests. This result therefore showed no discriminant validity issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of the Structural Model</head><p>The purpose of this analysis is to confirm or reject the proposed hypotheses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hair, Anderson, Tatham &amp; Black (1998)</ref> noted that the structural model must involve set of relationships between factors of the hypothesized model. The structural model was evaluated according to the following criteria:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coefficient of Determination (R 2 ) and Predictive Relevance (Q 2 )</head><p>The R-square value (R2) indicates the amount of variance corresponding to the dependent variables while the quality of the structural model is evaluated using (Q2) to examine the predictive relevance for the structural model <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Tenenhaus, Vinzi, Chatelin, &amp; Lauro, 2005)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> displays the values of R2 and Q2. According to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> the R2 value is 0.563, meaning that all five factors (system quality, information quality, service quality, attitude, and course quality) explain 56.3% of the variance in self-regulated learning. Since the value of R2 = 0.563 was between 0.67 and 0.33. a moderate model is suggested <ref type="bibr">(Chin, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>The Q2 analysis applies to the endogenous constructs that represent reflective measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hair et al. (2014)</ref> noted that a Q2 value greater than zero showed that the model has sufficient predictive relevance for the endogenous construct. Table (3) showed that the model has adequate predictive relevance because the Q2 values for SRL (Q2=0.220) &gt; 0 and also displayed medium predictive relevance where SRL (0.220 &gt; 0.15) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Path Coefficients</head><p>Path coefficients indicate the strength of a relationship between two variables in the structural model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cohen, 1988)</ref>. In this section, a Bootstrapping technique with 5,000 resamples was used to obtain a resulting beta () value and t-values and to evaluate the significance of the hypotheses of the study as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chin, Marcolin, and Newsted (2003)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> displays the bootstrapping results. Referring to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, the predictors of self-regulated learning: service quality ( = 0.168), attitude ( = 0.328), and course quality ( = 0.205) were all significantly associated with SRL (p &lt; 0.01), so H3, H4, H5 were supported. System quality ( = -0.094) and information quality ( = 0.078) were not significant (p &gt; 0.05), so H1 and H2 were not supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect Sizes (f 2)</head><p>Effect size (f 2) is used to assess a change in the R2 when a particular factor is removed from the model. The cutoff values of effect size are: 0.02 small effect, 0.15 medium effect, and 0.35 large effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cohen, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Henseler et al., 2009)</ref>. The results for f 2 are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. With reference to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>, the effect sizes of H3 were: Service quality -&gt; SRL (f 2 = 0.024), H4: Attitude -&gt; SRL (f 2 = 0.080), and H5: Course quality -&gt; SRL (f 2 = 0.040), all relationships exhibited small effect sizes. However, the effect sizes for H1: (System quality -&gt; SRL), and H2: (Information quality Q -&gt; SRL) had no effect sizes.</p><p>In summary, the results for the research model used showed that all factors satisfied the criteria of both the measurement and the structural model, so the proposed model is reliable and demonstrates adequate validity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The Relationship between System Quality and Self-Regulated Learning in MOOC Contrary to other researchers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Liaw &amp; Huang, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zhao, 2016)</ref>, the result of testing (H1) showed that the influence of system quality on SRL was not supported, indicating that the quality of system features such as ease of use, ease in learning, user expectation of the system, system features, and integration does not influence students' SRL skills.</p><p>A possible explanation may be related to students' limited experiences with MOOC, since it is a relatively new field in Malaysia context <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Nordin, Norman, &amp; Embi, 2015)</ref>. Analyses of demographic data indicated that 41.3% of the respondents were new to the MOOC environment compared to other e-learning systems. Its features and the way it is conducted may have seemed quite complicated to novice MOOC students, and as novice users they might have experienced problems in navigating the content, activities, and assessments in MOOC.</p><p>It therefore seems that not all MOOC students may have the skills necessary to use all MOOC features and participants may also have had confidence issues in using this new technology. Since students new to MOOC tend have obstacles in management of MOOC resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kop, 2011)</ref>, it is suggested that MOOC lectures should provide university training for students to help them acquire the essential skills they need during the MOOC learning and teaching processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relationship between Information Quality and Self-Regulated Learning in MOOC</head><p>The findings of the study concluded that the hypothesis regarding influence of information quality on SRL (H2) was not supported, and result from testing the hypothesis indicated that more availability and understandability of MOOC information would not increase the level of students' self-regulated learning skills in MOOC. The result of this hypothesis testing was not consistent with some other studies conducted in the e-learning system field (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Liaw &amp; Huang, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zhao, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>One possible justification for the non-significant result of this hypothesis is that students have had problems dealing with the volume of information delivered to them via MOOC. This information includes course content, resources, materials, learning activities, and assessments. If these large bundles of information were not well designed, students may become overloaded with information and be unsure as to which should be prioritized. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rai and Chunrao (2016)</ref>  Consequently, to increase students' self-regulation toward learning via MOOC, it is important for instructors to provide support in terms of guidance and help in navigating the learning content, activities and assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lee &amp; Lee, 2008)</ref>. It also is best to deliver highly relevant information to the students and align it with the learning objectives of the course to enhance their ability to organize and regulate their learning processes in MOOC.</p><p>The Relationship between Service Quality and Self-Regulated Learning in MOOC</p><p>The results of this study showed that the influence of service quality on SRL (H3) is supported. This indicated that MOOC service quality, including quality of both instructor support and institutional support, can affect students' SRL skills and improve their effectiveness in MOOC participation and their ultimate success in MOOC learning. For example, the reliability of the MOOC system with respect to answering students' enquiries, and the ability of MOOC in delivering lectures, materials, and feedback to students within a reasonable timeframe, can enhance the students' SRL skills and improve their learning using a MOOC system.</p><p>Since several researchers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Liaw &amp; Huang, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zhao, 2016)</ref> shared similar findings, it is recommended that instructor and institutional support must be considered as key factors for improving self-regulated learning among MOOC students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relationship between Attitude and Self-Regulated Learning in MOOC</head><p>The findings of the study concluded that the influence of attitude on SRL (H4) was significant. In other words, a positive student attitude towards MOOC contributes to an improvement in SRL skills, thereby impacting learning success.</p><p>A possible explanation for this finding might be that the positive impression of students toward MOOC activities, such as feeling confidence, enjoyment, and interest in using MOOC, may lead to improvements in their self-regulated learning skills. These skills would include the ability to independently organize and plan the learning process, to set learning goals, and to identify effective ways to learn.</p><p>The results from hypothesis (H4) are consistent with studies conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kramarski and Gutman (2006)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Zimmerman and Schunk (2001)</ref> who found that student attitudes influence their self-regulated learning in e-learning. Researchers such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Presley and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Presley (2009), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hammoud (2010)</ref> indicated that student attitudes contribute significantly to successful e-learning implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Relationship between Course Quality and Self-Regulated Learning in MOOC</head><p>Testing hypothesis H5 showed that the influence of course quality on SRL was significant. This finding provided evidence that aspects of quality content such as design, appropriateness of outputs, and ease of understanding of course materials played important roles in supporting SRL skills in a MOOC learning environment.</p><p>The significant relationship between course quality and SRL indicated that success in MOOC depends on high-quality course design, its content, and ease of understanding the learning materials. The finding of this hypothesis is supported by studies such as those by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hassanzadeh et al. (2012)</ref>; Owens and Price (2010); and <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Sun, Tasi, Finger, and Chen (2008)</ref>, who indicated that content quality factor has a direct impact on the success of learning in online environments.</p><p>The quality of course content is one of the most crucial elements motivating learners around the world to join and engage in MOOC platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Yousef, Chatti, Schroeder, &amp; Wosnitza, 2014</ref>). An excellent course design will contribute to make students more independent in organizing and planning their learning process and encouraging them to set learning goals, identify effective ways to learn, and achieve success in MOOC learning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lin, Lin, and Hung (2015)</ref> argue that the perceptions of learners toward the quality and richness of MOOC course content have a significant influence on accepting the knowledge.</p><p>It is therefore suggested that MOOC developers and instructors should ensure that MOOC materials are easy to understand, and that only high-quality content is to be presented in high-quality format to establish real opportunities for students to become more responsible learners via MOOC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Several studies have highlighted the vital role of self-regulation skills in MOOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hood et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kizilcec et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Littlejohn et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Onah &amp; Sinclair, 2017)</ref>. Since learners with a higher degree of selfregulated learning are more likely to succeed, developing self-regulated learning abilities in MOOC is a key factor in achieving successful learning in a MOOC environment. While online courses have been found to be favorably regarded by students who have acquired self-regulated learning skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(You &amp; Kang, 2014)</ref>, research studies related to supporting students to enhance their self-regulated learning skills while learning in a MOOC environment are quite limited. This study, therefore, contributed to closing the gap in the current literature by examining six main factors that influence students' self-regulated learning skills in MOOC environments, and the findings add insight on how to create a successful MOOC environment to support self-regulated learning.</p><p>Based on the study's results, the empirical findings indicate that improvement of service quality, attitude, and course quality is very important for promoting self-regulated learning in MOOC environments. In other words, creating self-regulated MOOC environments should build effective interactive learning environments in which these three factors would be carefully considered.</p><p>The results of this study are supported by several MOOC study findings that showed the effectiveness of SRL on MOOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Magen-Nagar &amp; Cohen, 2016)</ref>. For instance, the result of study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Littlejohn et al. (2016)</ref> found that MOOC learners who reported high-level of SRL skills were apt to have more flexibility in their approach to learning and determined their learning paths by themselves.</p><p>In sum, this study has investigated the influence of five factors -system quality, information quality, service quality, student attitude and course quality -on students' self-regulated learning skills in a MOOC environment. Thus, this paper extends existing research on SRL to a newer form of learning -MOOC. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
