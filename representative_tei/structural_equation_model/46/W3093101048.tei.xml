<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose: This study aims to identify and investigate the antecedents for an enhanced level of cyber-security at the organisational level, from both the technical and the human resource perspective, using Human-Organization-Technology (HOT) theory. Design/methodology/approach: The study has been conducted on 151 professionals who have expertise in cyber-security in Indian organisations in sectors such as retail, education, healthcare, etc. The analysis of the data is carried out using Partial Least Squares based Structural Equation Modelling technique. Findings: The results suggest that 'legal consequences' and 'technical measures' are the most important antecedents for an enhanced cyber-security level in the organisations. The other significant antecedents include 'role of senior management' and 'proactive information security'. Implications: This empirical study has significant implications for organisations as they can take pre-emptive measures by focusing on the important antecedents and work towards enhancing the level of cyber-security. Originality/value: The originality of this study is combination of technical and human resource perspectives in identifying the determinants for an enhanced level of cyber-security in the organizations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Due to the ever-changing nature of cyber-attacks, the digital world calls for an enhanced level of cyber-security in every organisation and businesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Borrett et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Arachchilage and Love, 2014)</ref>. In line with the latter, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Fielder et al., (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Taib et al., (2019)</ref> also voice their concerns and state that with the increasing multiplicity and scope of these anonymous cyberattacks, their is need for organisations to prioritise how they safeguard themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Schaik et al., 2018)</ref>. Few examples of such attacks include data breach in the retail industry -Target (2013) and Home Depot (2014) 1,2 , data breach of Yahoo (2016)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> , network hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment (2014) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> , etc. The financial services industry was most affected by cyber-attacks in the year 2014, while the healthcare industry got most affected in the year 2015 <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> . Thus, many firms in healthcare are now adopting measures to prevent themselves from cyber-attacks. The cyber-security of an organisation is not only governed by the technical capabilities of the organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(McCormac et al., 2017)</ref>. It is equally dependent on the human resources deployed in the organisations. Thus, the current study aims to investigate the antecedents of enhanced cyber-security at the organisational level from both the technical and the human resource perspective.</p><p>The cyber-security at the organisational level can be determined by various factors, which include the role of senior management in enhancing cyber-security in organisation in terms of their perceived organisational support and commitment towards IT security <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Boss et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jarvenpaa &amp; Blake, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Barton et al., 2016)</ref>. Other antecedents include the strategies adopted for IT security <ref type="bibr">(McFadzean et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nassimbeni et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tang &amp; Liu, 2015)</ref>, nature of business of the firm <ref type="bibr">(Barton et al., 2016)</ref>, the presence of proactive information security measures, and technical measures adopted by the organisation to enhance cyber-security at the organisational level. The legal consequence of violations and enforcement of cyber-laws are some of the other antecedents for enhanced cyber-security found from the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Herath &amp; Rao, 2009)</ref>. The personality traits of employees including their agreeableness and conscientiousness towards security policy implementations and their attitude towards compliance are yet other antecedents derived from the literature review <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Boss et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Mishra &amp; Dhillon, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shropshire et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The objective of this study is multifold. Firstly, the study helps in identifying the important antecedents for enhanced level of cyber-security in the organisations. Secondly, the study is first of its kind to investigate the enhanced level of cyber-security in organisations from both technical as well as human resource perspective. Thirdly, the study has implications for company managers, policymakers, and cyber-security experts. To achive these objectives, the antecedents are identified from thorough literature review and discussion with experts. The prominent antecedents are then identified by Partial Least Square based Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) technique. The data is collected from 151 professionals at various levels of management (junior, mid-level, senior manager), working in sectors such as retail, education, healthcare, etc. The study has significant implications for organisations and businesses, i.e. pre-emptive measures and work towards enhancing cyber-security is required at large. Apart from the introduction, the paper has been divided into five sections. Section 2 deals with the background literature and hypothesis development. Section 3 illustrates the methodology, and Section 4 describes the results. Finally, Section 5 concludes the study stating the limitations and future scope of the work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">BACKGROUND LITERATURE AND HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT</head><p>The study derived the factors influencing the enhanced cyber-security in organizations from Human-Organization-Technology (HOT) theory. The HOT framework was initially developed for Health Information Systems (HIS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Yusof et al., 2008)</ref>. The HOT framework is built on previous models of IS evaluation, including the IT-Organization Fit Model and the IS Success Model. The framework propagates that the more technology, human and organization fit with each other, the higher the potential of HIS. The technology factors in HOT framework includes factors like system quality, information quality and service quality. The human factors in the HOT framework include factors like system use and user satisfaction. Similarly, the organizational factors in the HOT framework include structure and environment. The HOT theory is based on the premise that apart from technical issues, human and organizational aspects are also crucial in identifying the important factors for enhancing cyber-security in organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ahmadi et al., 2015)</ref>. Human factors that can influence cyber-security includes the role of senior management and personality traits of the IT Security manager. Organizational factors of HOT includes Strategies adopted by Senior Management of the organization, legal measures adopted for enhanced IT Security and proactive information security measures. Technological factors of HOT theory includes technical measures adopted for enhancing cybersecurity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Role of Senior Management</head><p>The role of senior management refers to the support, commitment, participation of the senior management towards the organisations. The role of senior management towards the development and management organisations is well studied by various researchers across the world <ref type="bibr">(Garrity 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr">Doll 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jarvenpaa &amp; Blake 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Dora, et al, 2013)</ref>. For our study, we categorise the role of senior management into the following four streams: legitimacy through regular participation, commitment, evaluation, and ethical leadership.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Legitimacy through regular participation of senior management</head><p>Legitimacy through regular participation consists of the set of activities such as review of IT security design, planning and development of Information Security Policies (ISPs) followed by the successful implementation <ref type="bibr">(Jarvenpaa &amp; Blake 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Hu et al., 2012)</ref>. Often, businesses view their cybersecurity spends as a cost center, and therefore information security investments in related training, technology purchases, and process improvements through Information Security Assessment (ISA), and improved Information Security Culture (ISC), are deemed as a burden for the entire organisation. <ref type="bibr">(Kaspersky, 2017)</ref>. Therefore, the active and regular participation of senior IT managers in ISA exercises such as Security Education, Training, and Awareness (SETA), security implementation and strategic decision-making <ref type="bibr">(Dhillon &amp; Torkzadeh 2006)</ref>, is often viewed as a positive reflection of information security compliance and has a positive effect on an enhanced level of cyber-security in the organisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Commitment of Senior Management</head><p>The existing literature in Information Systems Security (ISS) has extensively reported that the commitment of senior management is necessary to achieve an enhanced information security environment in organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(HöNe &amp; Eloff, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kankanhalli et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">McFadzean et al., 2006)</ref>. Further, Da <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Veiga &amp; Eloff (2007)</ref> reported that the commitment of senior management could play a crucial role in inculcating a tolerable level of ISC that could lead to establishing a successful Information Security Governance (ISG) framework. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Hu et al., (2012)</ref> found that if the employees perceived a more substantial top management commitment, it would positively motivate and reassure employees to pledge to compliance behaviour by participating in SETA and acquire necessary skills. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Holgate &amp; Hardy (2012)</ref> found that choosing the primary owners of ISG from the representatives of senior management of an organisation would further facilitate to establish the locus of ISGs concerning various governance mechanisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Ethical Leadership Behaviour of Senior Management</head><p>In an organisation, leaders are those whom employees trust and respect. Leaders also have the power to determine rewards or punishments for the employees' behaviours. Therefore, a leader plays a vital role in modelling the attitudes and manners exhibited by their subordinate employees <ref type="bibr">(Mulki et al., 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">In line with Brown et al., (2005)</ref>, ethical leadership can be defined as "the demonstration of appropriate conduct through personal actions and interpersonal relationships, and the promotion of such conduct to followers through two-way communication, and decision-making". Ethical leadership plays a vital role in influencing the behaviours of employees <ref type="bibr">(Mayer et al., 2010)</ref>. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Kacmar et al. (2011)</ref> found a positive association between ethical leadership and employee Organisational Citizenship Behaviour (OCB). Therefore, with the enforcement of organisational rules through ethical leadership, employees will perceive a highly ethical climate <ref type="bibr">(Mayer et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shin et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Xue et al. (2018)</ref> proposed that ethical leadership would promote the generation of positive information security climate in the organisation. They further noted that ethical leadership would also help to measure the negative effect of information security climate on ISP violation intention among employees through direct and indirect means. Thus, ethical leadership among senior management might enhance cyber-security in the organisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4">Regular Evaluation by Senior Management</head><p>Although senior management commitment, ethical leadership and participation alone does not guarantee adequate information security at the operational, strategic compliance levels, they are strong prerequisites for active growth, execution, and subsequent compliance with ISS controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Boss et al., 2009)</ref>. Therefore, ISS compliance among employees and subsequent evaluation by senior management helps to improve the effectiveness of ISS controls and supplements their presence, instead of solely depending on them <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Dhillon &amp; Mishra, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Herath &amp; Rao, 2009)</ref>. Additionally, researchers noted that senior management and primary stakeholders needed good situational awareness about the incumbent IT risk levels (such as strategic, operational, financial) <ref type="bibr">(Franke &amp; Brynielsson 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Dora, Kumar, Gellynck, 2016)</ref>, or of the external ISS background <ref type="bibr">(Webb et al., 2014)</ref>. Therefore, organisations where managers can maintain a strong link between ISS control compliance by employees, and their subsequent evaluation can achieve an enhanced cybersecurity level.</p><p>As a result of the above discussions, we hypothesize that: H1: Role of senior management (such as legitimacy through participation, commitment, evaluation, and ethical leadership) plays a positive role towards an enhanced level of cybersecurity in the organisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Strategies Adopted by Senior Management</head><p>The strategies adopted by the senior management, in general, align with the business strategies of the organisation <ref type="bibr">(Chang &amp; Yeh 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nassimbeni et al., 2012)</ref>. For our study, we have categorised the strategies adopted by senior management towards an enhanced level of cybersecurity in the organisation, into the following five streams: clear vision, institutionalised IT security governance, risk management controls, reward policy, and information sharing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Clear Vision about IT Security Strategies</head><p>Effective Information Security Management (ISM) is not a standalone activity, but it is established on a well-developed, and inter-linked IT strategy spread across the entire organisation <ref type="bibr">(Seeholzer, 2012)</ref>. Often, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the behaviour of top management and the characteristics of organisational culture (such as transformative vision about IT security implementation in the organisation) <ref type="bibr">(Ke &amp; Wei, 2008)</ref>. By championing the new initiatives, and model ISPs, the senior management can articulate a clear vision, strategy and can set a measurable IT security goal. Setting the right strategy may also include the organisational statements of core values, rationale, vision, strategic plans, ISS at operational-level, and ISS investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Baskerville &amp; Dhillon, 2008)</ref>. Such actions render significant legitimacy to ISA activities, SETA programs, enrich information security cultures (ISC), followed by framing of ISPs and controls. ISS strategies must be adopted by senior management in organisations, and they should be able to evaluate the efficacy of IS security as well as communicate its value to the organisation <ref type="bibr">(McFadzean et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nassimbeni et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tang &amp; Liu 2015)</ref>. While the IT strategy and organisation strategy for information security can percolate from the business strategy of an organisation, it essential that there remains an explicit synchronisation between each of these dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Baets, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bharadwaj et al., 2013)</ref>. Recently, one of the studies have analyzed the adoption of the International Information Security Management System Standard ISO/IEC 27001 by using web-mining approach (Mirtsch et al., 2020)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Institutionalised IT Security Governance (ISG)</head><p>Organisations draft IT governance procedures to ensure thorough execution of ISPs and security procedures <ref type="bibr">(Warkentin &amp; Johnston, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">IT Governance Institute, 2006)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Moulton &amp; Coles (2003)</ref>, ISG for an installed information system in an organisation is the "establishment and maintenance of the control environment to manage risks relating to C-I-A-NR (Confidentiality, Integrity, Authenticity, and Non-Repudiation) of information and its supporting processes and systems." Von <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Solms (2003)</ref> noted that an effective ISG must consist of successful and distinct implementation of both IT Governance and Corporate Governance. Over time, as organisations evolve, their ISGs also mature. Within this phase of change, however, they must strive to maintain a high level of information assurance <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Moulton and Coles, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">COBIT 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Von Solms, 2005)</ref>. In this context, IT governance and organisational design play a significant role in fulfilling the commitment of ISM. Thus, ISGs and ISS controls can also support regulatory compliance for the organisation. Finally, ISGs can support a firm to achieve ISS controls to be benchmarked and be embedded in key business processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Dhillon &amp; Mishra, 2006)</ref>. Therefore, through the ISGs, organisations must verify whether the business goals and vision are in alignment, and whether do they lead to executable IT security goals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">IT Risk Management Controls</head><p>What follows directly from the establishment of ISG-s, are the following Information Security Risk Management (ISRM) objectives, which includes: (i) identification of sufficient controls at the strategic level, (ii) whether they map with the outlined ISPs, and (iii) the degree to which these controls should be centralised or decentralised <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Van der Haar &amp; Von Solms, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Von Solms, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Von Solms, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">NIST 2013</ref>). The NIST framework presents a set of controls that an organisation needs to implement the C-I-A-NR of information security assurance and conform to the drafted ISPs. Often, certain dimensions of the C-I-A-NR triad could pose more important than others. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Knowles et al. (2015)</ref> noted that availability becomes the most important dimension in industrial control systems, thus making the triad as A-I-C-NR. Recently, one of the studies have conducted a cyber risk analysis for smart-grid and applied the model on the case study of an electric utility (Smith and Paté-Cornell, 2018).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4">Reward Policy for Employees' ISP Compliance</head><p>The extant literature on organisational theories highlights the role of sanctions and rewards to encourage the desired compliance behaviour among employees <ref type="bibr">(Huselid, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Herath &amp; Rao 2009)</ref>. Rewards are tangible or intangible forms of compensation (such as salary increments, promotions, and written appreciation letters) that an employee receives from the employer as recognition of ISP compliance <ref type="bibr">(Bulgurcu et al., 2010)</ref>. Rewarding employees for positive compliance behaviours are recently gaining popularity as incentive mechanisms. Recent studies have discussed their possibility in the context of information security <ref type="bibr">(Boss &amp; Kirsch, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pahnila et al., 2007)</ref>. Further, while rewards and sanctions generate external motivations for an enhanced OCB, intrinsic values of employees can support their internal motivations to abide by regulations <ref type="bibr">(Tyler &amp; Blader, 2005)</ref>. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Siponen et al., (2014)</ref> had shown that rewards could be detrimental on the intrinsic motivation of employees to comply, especially when they were tangible (such as gift coupons, or awards). Otherwise, rewards may also work well in organisations, where sanctions on information security behaviour do not stop violation among employees. <ref type="bibr">Bulgurcu et al. (2010)</ref> examined whether intrinsic benefits/safety of resources/rewards can stimulate the ISA of an employee. Hence, senior management in organisations needs to adopt a reward policy for ISP compliance and motivate an enhanced ISC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.5">Information Sharing as an IT Security Strategy</head><p>Sharing of information about IT risks among firms can encourage them to adopt a relatively proactive, rather than a reactive, approach towards investing in security technology and ISPs, such as the tendency to defer necessary investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Liu et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Skopik et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Safa and Solms, 2016)</ref>. The USA federal government has supported the establishment of industrybased Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (also known as ISACs). Governments in other nations have established Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), where they directly broadcast alerts, tips, major attacks, exploits, and disclosed vulnerabilities (CERT, 2019). These information-sharing activities have several advantages: (i) lower risk of security breaches in the future, (ii) identification and repairing of vulnerabilities in organisational IT systems, (iii) increased sales resulting from more effective security products, and (iv) improved reputation among consumers <ref type="bibr">(Gal-or &amp; Ghose, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Skopik et al., 2016)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Gordon et al., (2003)</ref> noted that when firms shared security information among themselves, they wanted to free ride and had reduced their investment incentives, thereby leading to possible discouragement among the ISACs. <ref type="bibr">In contrast, Gal-Or &amp; Ghose (2005)</ref> found that most firms perceived information security investments and information-sharing activities as "strategic complements". <ref type="bibr">Hausken (2006)</ref> has also demonstrated that the interdependence, and not their mutual competitiveness, is the key attribute of information-sharing. Hence, organisations need to find out whether they are actively contributing to ISACs by sharing relevant, actionable cyber-threat information. As a result of the above discussion, we hypothesize the following: H2: Strategies adopted (such as vision, institutionalised IT security governance, risk management controls, reward policy and information sharing) for IT security by senior management, play a positive role towards an enhanced level of cyber-security in the organisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Technical Measures for Enhanced IT Security</head><p>Organisations invest in technologies for improving security to prevent becoming victims of possible cyber-attacks. For our study, we categorise the technical measures for increased IT Security, into the following three streams: proactive and reactive prevention mechanisms, cyber-incident management, and minimise correlated risks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Proactive and Reactive Prevention Mechanisms</head><p>Technical measures for information security refer to the application of all possible contemporary security technologies to the existing IT assets of the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Venter &amp; Eloff, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gartner, 2009)</ref>. Much of academic literature in the discipline of computer science and cryptography has been dedicated to the invention of these technical measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Choo 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ab Rahman &amp; Choo, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Sureshkumar et al., 2019)</ref>. Broadly, they are categorised into two types -proactive and reactive. Proactive technology tools are those preventative measures that are built upon in a bid to secure data or resources before a security breach can occur. Reactive technology tools are those preventative measures, which are being applied by the organisation in a bid to secure data or resources as soon as a security breach is detected <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Venter &amp; Eloff, 2003)</ref>. Often organisations rely upon historical data on cyber-attacks to build both of these measures and applied at the network, host, or application level (N-W/H/A) within the organisation. Cryptography is a proactive technology measure because it safeguards data before a potential threat can materialise. It is performed by successfully encrypting the data and prevent it from frequent attacks such as wiretapping, sniffing, and snooping attacks <ref type="bibr">(Biswas &amp; Patra, 2018)</ref>. Similarly, the recent use of Cyber-Threat Intelligence (CTI) as a proactive technology measure in the analysis of external sources such as dark forums to identify ongoing and popular attack vectors and mitigate the organisation from future cyber-attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Samtani et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Biswas et al., 2018)</ref>. An Internet firewall is a software tool installed on a specially configured computer that serves as a blockade to unauthorised users. Firewalls are reactive technology measures because they are used to act against specific security incidents as soon as they occur. Therefore, organisations must find out whether they are investing in proactive/reactive technology measures to reduce chances of cyber-attacks in the organisation. The proactive information security measures include techniques such as those of digital signatures, cryptographic keys, digital certificates, and anti-virus and anti-phishing scanners. On the other hand, reactive information security measures include techniques such as those of Access controls, firewalls, passwords, and remote access, biometrics and intrusion detection systems. Recently, one of the studies has proposed a comprehensive model to manage cybersecurity incidents called SOTER (Onwubiko and Ouazzane, 2019).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Regularly Manage Cyber-Incidents and Vulnerabilities</head><p>A security incident can be any of the following, e.g. attempted intrusion, data breach, successful compromise, or an active threat. In the context of cyber-security, incident management is the process of recognising, managing, recording and examining security threats and incidents in real-time. Since the incident, response activities for cybersecurity events are relatively new to organisations, the effective functioning of Cybersecurity Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs)</p><p>is not yet fully developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Steinke et al., 2015)</ref>. In fact, a recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Martin et al., (2017)</ref> pointed out that a robust incident management and response system should be present in organisations, and that will lead to improved cyber resilience. Recently, one of the studies have presented seven pillars of cybersecurity, which includes Patient, Persevering, Persistent, Proactive, Preventive, Predictive, and Preemptive (Carayannis et al., 2019)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Minimise Correlated Risks</head><p>Shared software vulnerabilities can often lead to correlated failures of IT systems that are interconnected and can escalate the cyber-risk of the entire organisational network. Therefore, IT managers need to carefully choose software with uncorrelated vulnerabilities while building system configurations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Temizkan et al., 2017)</ref>. Diversification of correlated cyber-risk enables efficient assessment and mitigation of cyber-risks and reduces "software monoculture" <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Temizkan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Biswas &amp; Mukhopadhyay, 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Chen et al. (2011)</ref> have developed a simulation-based study to identify the correlated risks arising due to shared software vulnerabilities across multiple software platforms. Current research has adopted various techniques, such as (i) benchmarking to identify vulnerable sections within software codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Larsen et al., 2015)</ref>, and (ii) within operating system platforms <ref type="bibr">Garcia et al., (2016)</ref>, to achieve diversity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Hosseini et al. (2016)</ref> examined the propagation of malware across software platforms laden with shared vulnerabilities through epidemic modelling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Lagerström et al.

Sometimes, firms adopted a staggered form of the public announcement of data breaches, such as the theft of personally identifiable information in the cases of Target data breach and LinkedIn data breach. In these cases, the victim organisation reported intrusion(s) to individuals/customers whose personal data was breached and then to the public media <ref type="bibr">(HBR, 2015)</ref>.

Likewise, regulators need to frame contemporary guidelines that will take care of difficult issues (such as ethical hacking and cyber-analytics-based mitigation measures). A recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Samtani et al., (2017)</ref> noted that CTI is a far more effective practice to thwart cyber-attacks and hacking attempts on a business firm, than employing passive and reactive measures such as firewalls, antivirus, IDS, and SETA exercises. Often, attackers discussed attack techniques on hacker forums visible only on the Dark Web, thereby obscuring any digital attempts of future tracking.

For instance, the CSI-FBI Computer Crime and Security Survey <ref type="bibr">(CSI-FBI, 2006)</ref> showed that the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) had made a substantial impact across industries through mandatory compliance to data privacy of users. Further, most of the IT managers agreed that the necessary compliance with the SOX Act had raised the level of interest in IS security in their organisation. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 enforces organisations to comply with ISACs and information-sharing teams to fight cyber-crime. Often, these legal measures can evoke fear and desist attackers from launching cyber-attacks in the future.</p><p>Organisations also need to adhere to international legal frameworks that are pertinent to cybersecurity and data privacy in matching industries. For instance, botnet-based attacks can be launched from any geographical location in the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Hui et al., 2017)</ref>.

For this study, we categorised proactive information security measures adopted towards an enhanced level of cyber-security in the organisation, into the following streams: regular review and update of ISPs, presence of SETA programs and appearance of proactive information security measures. Recent work suggested proactive environmental scanning and locating potential threats and attacks for handling the cyber-attacks <ref type="bibr">(Appiah et</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Palmer et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rees et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Knapp et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bulgurcu et al., 2010)</ref>.

Extraverts generally tend to focus on feelings that help them associate with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Osatuyi, 2015)</ref>. Agreeableness, on the other hand, can be defined as the individual's act of being sympathetic, trusting, selfless and straightforward <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Goldberg, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1991)</ref>.

For this study, we categorised the measurement of enhanced cybersecurity in an organisation, into the following streams: current cyber-security maturity levels and assessment, adopted security control measures (such as C-I-A-NR), improved efficacy (such as technological, process and organisational), and extensible for dealing with external and internal deficiencies.</p></div>

Among the earliest Capability Maturity Models (CMM) were proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Humphrey (1989)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">White (2011)</ref>, who applied the CMM for software quality assessment. If the need arises, an organisation can also extend these models to address various aspects and domains of IT security risks. For instance, the ISO:IEC:27001 was drafted to enable the choice of appropriate IS controls which could ably protect the IS assets and additionally offer system assurance to the organisational stakeholders <ref type="bibr">(ISO, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Later NIST proposed the Information Security Maturity Model (ISM2), which helped firms in the accurate evaluation of the degree of current cybersecurity maturity through qualitative assessment in the following five dimensions: policy, processes, implementation, testing, and integration (NIST, 2005). Gartner developed an IT score-based Information Security Awareness Maturity Model that could track the information security development of an organisation through the following five levels: initial, developing, defined, managed, and optimising Gartner (2009). IBM built the Information Security Framework as a business-level security reference model to connect business drivers with IT security and risk management, based on standards and common practices <ref type="bibr">(IBM, 2007)</ref>. Similarly, NIST created the Cybersecurity Framework in 2014 to impose the federal-level regulations on responsible firms for critical infrastructure protection <ref type="bibr">(NIST, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> provides a summary of recent cyber-security maturity and assessment frameworks examined from the existing literature. Cybersecurity framework implementation in critical infrastructures. IT risk management involves the use of enterprise risk management techniques in the realm of information technology to cope with systemic or operational risks arising from the usage of information technology in organisations (Coles and <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Moulton, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">ISACA, 2009)</ref>. Whether an organisation adheres to a systematic methodology to tackle IT risks can be signalled by its formation, regular maintenance, and timely update of its ISMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Dhillon and Backhouse, 2000)</ref>. IT risk management is a continuous process that organisations follow, and associated techniques involve these distinct steps -understand, measure, and subsequently mitigate <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Debreceny, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Ruan (2017)</ref> presents a summary of qualitative and quantitative IT risk management methodologies that have been widely employed by organisations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.2">Assurance of Security Control Measures lead to Efficacy (Technology, Process, Organisation)</head><p>Through information security assurance at an organisation, it desires to recognise whether the imposed security control(s) are in effect, meet the C-I-A-NR and the explicitly identified functional requirements in the control statements/ISPs (von <ref type="bibr">Solms et al., 1994)</ref>. They also help the stakeholders to examine and confirm whether the above assurance steps lead to a better cyber-security environment in the organisation than earlier <ref type="bibr">(Ross et al., 2009)</ref>. Thus, organisations must honour the C-I-A-NR of the information assets, and consider it as the primary objective of ISM <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Dzazali et al., 2009)</ref>. Unfortunately, senior management at most organisations perceives information security as a technical problem. In contrast, the reality is that successful enforcement of ISPs and SETA are a managerial hurdle and not a technical one <ref type="bibr">(ITGI, 2005)</ref>. To begin with, the confidentiality of an information system lies in concealing necessary information from being accessed by unauthorised individuals (von <ref type="bibr">Solms et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">NIST 2013</ref>). For example, cryptography, encryption and other technical measures ensure confidentiality of business-level data during transmission between multiple IT systems. Next, the integrity of the information system ensures that any business-level data remains an accurate and unaltered depiction of the original information (von <ref type="bibr">Solms et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ross et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Further, organisations need to comply with strict guidelines regarding an appropriate categorization of information and related infrastructure and consequently maintain a consistent level of cyber-security assurance. To address this problem, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed a set of Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> and guidelines that adhere to the Federal Information Security Management Act <ref type="bibr">(2002)</ref>. The most widely used FIPS standards are FIPS-199 and FIPS-200 7 . FIPS guidelines provide a minimum level of security required for business information and related infrastructure allowing a range of risk-levels (such as lo, mid, hi) to categorize the associated information system. For instance, the information system for acquisitions at an e-commerce firm needs to manage the following: (a) sensitive contract information from its suppliers and pricing mechanisms for buyers, as well as (b) regular business activities and administrative information. Using the FIPS framework, the security categorizations (i.e., C-I-A) for type (a) and type (b) are SC1 = {(C, mid), (I, mid), (A, lo)} and SC2 = {(C, lo), (I, lo), (A, lo)}, shown in Figures <ref type="figure">2(a</ref>) and 2(b), respectively. Finally, these security categorizations are combined as max {SC1, SC2} to calculate the potential impact on the overall information system of the e-commerce firm as SC3 = {(C, mid), (I, mid), (A, lo)} and shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2(c</ref>  <ref type="figure">M</ref>) attacks to intercept business-critical data and modify it before the intended receiver can access it. Finally, the availability of the information system ensures that the concerned information is always readily accessible to the authorised user(s) (von <ref type="bibr">Solms et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">NIST 2013</ref>). Historically attackers have launched denial-of-service (DoS) attacks the websites of popular e-commerce firms (such as Amazon, eBay), social networks (such as Orkut, Facebook), banks (such as Bank of Spain, HSBC) to disable/disrupt their services. Therefore, after adherence to security control measures in organisations, their enhanced cybersecurity can be measured with the help of strict conformance to C-I-A-NR levels across the organisation-finally, these adopted security control measures to technological efficacy, process efficacy, and organisational efficacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.3">Extensible for Dealing with External and Internal Deficiencies</head><p>Availability of a comprehensive and robust set of security metrics is essential to meet various business objectives in an organisation. For instance, the European Union (EU) has issued a Directive on Network and Information Security <ref type="bibr">(ENISA, 2015)</ref>. Another case of externally enforced usage of cybersecurity regulations is while meeting security demands at the thirdparty levels to comply with contractual service-levels. Although regulations exist for specific business use-cases, there are hardly any cybersecurity regulations, which are generic across various industrial IT systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Le &amp; Hoang, 2016)</ref>.

Such as, during target breach, the attackers first compromised the IT systems of the facility provider Fazio, a third-party entity, and reached till the customer database of Target <ref type="bibr">(HBR, 2015)</ref>. Further, CMMs can only ensure bare minimum compliance rather than achieving an aspired level of cybersecurity maturity which will deal with the evolving IT risks, high demand of usage (A-I-C-NR), as well as guarding against advanced attacks <ref type="bibr">(Ross et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>A study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Knowles et al., (2015)</ref> shows that a degree of flexibility in security maturity models can address each dimension of cyber-space specifically or extend their existing dimensions to cope up with the emerging cyber-spaces. For instance, new attack vectors such as ransomware (a variant of malware) have emerged in recent times, which are marked with ransoms and extortions. The WannaCry, Petya and Locky ransomware has wreaked havoc in European organisations by demanding millions of ransom money to unlock their compromised IT systems and files <ref type="bibr">(Techrepublic, 2017)</ref>. Additionally, these deficiencies could be internal to the organisation, such as improving the existing risk posture, integrate cybersecurity during the product development period (to reduce the possibility of software vulnerabilities, and build secure source codes), support decision-making at strategic levels (such as, during the installation of new ERP systems) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Jansen, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Roumani et al., 2015)</ref>, and finally, estimate the ROI on security investments. The overall research model for the study is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The survey method is used to collect data and test the proposed hypotheses. For the purpose of collecting the data, a questionnaire was prepared. The first part of the questionnaire included demographics of the respondents such as sector, years of experience, education level, etc. The second part of the questionnaire included constructs and their respective measurement items. The measurement items for each construct were adopted from a thorough literature review. We used four items for 'Role of Senior Management', five items for 'Strategies Adopted', six items for 'Technical Measures', three items each for 'Legal Consequences' and 'Prospective Information Security' and five items for 'Personality Traits'. Four items are used to measure the dependent construct 'Enhanced Cybersecurity'. The items are measured using a 5-point Likert scale (1: "Strongly disagree"; 5: "Strongly agree"). The authors' ensured the content validity of the questionnaire from the literature review and discussion with experts.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DISCUSSIONS</head><p>The digital world has made a significant amount of progress in the recent years. Today, by using digital technology, one can successfully pursue any complex task. However, any business activity that is performed on digital devices needs to be secured from the risk of being impaired by the possible cyber-attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Seo and Park, 2019)</ref>. In this regard, IT risk management has gained greater importance in firms, and they need to identify those factors that can help in achieving an enhanced level of cyber-security in organisations. Among others, these primarily include proactive information security measures, the role of senior management, strategies adopted for IT security, technical measures, and personality traits. This paper empirically examines the antecedents to an enhanced level of cyber-security in organisations using the data collected from 151 professionals in various sectors and by applying PLS-SEM technique.</p><p>The results show that legal consequences, technical measures, the role of senior management, and proactive information security measures are the most important antecedents to improve and establish an environment of enhanced cyber-security in organisations. Among these three, legal measure is the most vital antecedent for an enhanced level of cyber-security (β=0.217).</p><p>In this regard, organisations need to follow the law enforced surveillance methods to protect against the cyber-attacks. They should also implement an organizational process where any cyber-attack or data breach is reported to the regulatory agencies. Next, we find that reporting prior cyber-attacks to regulatory authorities through compliance with the existing ISGs <ref type="bibr">(Hathaway et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ghappour, 2017)</ref>, law-enforced surveillance using proactive CTI <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Samtani et al., 2017)</ref>, and finally, adherence to cyber-laws <ref type="bibr">(Png et al., 2008)</ref> all contribute to an enhanced cyber-resilience. These findings are congruent with extant literature on cybersecurity legal frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Fischer, 2013)</ref>, and relevant in the recent business environment with the announcement of privacy laws such as GDPR, SOX, and HIPAA.</p><p>Technical measures adopted by the organisations is found to be the second most important determinant for an enhanced level of cyber-security (β=0.189). It suggests that firms need to invest in information security software and implement both proactive and reactive tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Venter &amp; Eloff, 2003)</ref> to prevent cyber-attacks. Proactive information security measures include digital signatures, digital certificates, anti-virus, and anti-phishing scanners <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Choo 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ab Rahman &amp; Choo, 2015)</ref>, whereas reactive measures include access controls, firewalls, biometrics and intrusion detection systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Curtis and Mehravari, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">D'Arcy and Galletta, 2009)</ref>. Next, robust incident management and response system should be present, which will lead to improved cyber-resilience in organisations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Van der Haar &amp; Von Solms, 2003)</ref>. Further, firms should perform regular vulnerability assessments, and system scans to track and then remove security vulnerabilities from infected systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Roumani et al., 2015)</ref>. Finally, managers should ensure that diverse OS platforms, applications and network software are installed in IT systems to minimize the chances of correlated failures <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Larsen et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Temizkan et al., 2017)</ref>. One of the latest studies also found that technical measures related to cyber-attack and cyber experience is an important antecedent for cybersecurity in social enterprises <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(White et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Role of senior management is found to be the third most crucial determinant for an enhanced level of cyber-security (β=0.174). Congruent to extant studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(HöNe &amp; Eloff, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">McFadzean et al., 2006)</ref>, we found that commitment of senior management was the most significant contributing factor among managers. Senior managers of an organisation need to be committed to enhance the level of cyber-security. We suggest this can be achieved through the establishment of a reformed information security culture that could lead to implementable security goals <ref type="bibr">(Da Veiga &amp; Eloff, 2007)</ref>. Whereas, in contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Xue et al. (2018)</ref>, our study reported ethical leadership behaviour as the least essential factor among senior management. Technological measures alone cannot improve the cyber-resilience of an organization to the desired level of maturity. Therefore, managers should regularly assess the level of incumbent cyber-security and work towards continuous improvement goals <ref type="bibr">(Webb et al., 2014)</ref>. In this context, findings from our study echoed those reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Boss et al. (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Dhillon &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Mishra (2006), and</ref><ref type="bibr">Herath &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rao (2009)</ref>. Finally, senior managers must conduct regular evaluation of employees' compliance with those ISPs <ref type="bibr">(Warkentin &amp; Johnston, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Proactive information security measures have been observed to be the next significant determinant for enhanced cyber-security (β=0.167). In this respect, we found that most employees believe that regular reviews and updates of the existing ISPs at their organisations could lead to enhanced cybers-ecurity. Contrary to technological measures, which are expensive, and are never fail-safe, SETA exercises are efficient social remedies, which organisations can administer first and then follow with IT security tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Whitman, 2003)</ref>. Therefore, if the IT managers and software developers are convinced of the ISPs employed by the senior management, they will be practising them, which will lead to regular and relevant updates for improvement <ref type="bibr">(Warkentin &amp; Johnston, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bulgurcu et al., 2010)</ref>. Our finding strongly resonates with those reported by extant studies in this context <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Doherty &amp; Fulford, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Knapp et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Cram et al., 2017)</ref>. Organisations should regularly conduct exercises and training, which can provide employees with an awareness of cyber-security <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Dhillon &amp; Backhouse, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Dhillon &amp; Mishra, 2006)</ref>. Our results matched with <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Haeussinger &amp; Kranz (2013)</ref>, who also noted that SETA exercises are capable of improving information security through increased awareness about potential IS risks and implementable ISPs.</p><p>Personality traits is also found to be one of the determinants for enhanced cybersecurity. From results, we have found that IT managers who have the personality traits of neuroticism (among the big five personality traits) do not exert any significant impact on the enhanced level of cyber-security in organisations. This result indicates that the associated item PT4 did not load efficiently onto the construct Personality Traits. It also shows that the neurotic personality (i.e., self-conscious, moody, worries a lot, gets angry, frustrated and feels lonely) of an information security manager may not play a significantly positive role towards enhancing the cybersecurity decisions in an organisation. Extant studies have reported mixed findings regarding the effect of neuroticism in cybersecurity decisions. Bashir and associates <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bashir et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Wee and Bashir, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bashir et al., 2017)</ref> found that the participants in a cybersecurity competition scored the lowest on neuroticism among the Big Five Personality traits, with females scoring higher than males. On the contrary, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">McBride et al., (2012)</ref> found that neurotic individuals, who possessed a lower self-efficacy, were less likely to violate cybersecurity protocols. However, other personality traits among Goldberg's Big Five, such as extraversion, agreeableness, openness, and conscientiousness have sufficient influence on the adoption of ISPs, practising SETA exercises, and senior managers' commitment towards an enhanced level of cybersecurity in an organisation. We found the support of our results in existing research as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Goldberg, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bashir et al. 2017)</ref>, where open, agreeable, extrovert and highly intellectual individuals can bring significant changes in cybersecurity levels in an organization.</p><p>Finally, results suggest that the strategies adopted by the managers did not have any significant impact on the enhanced level of cyber-security. While our findings were contradictory to extant studies that successfully examined organisational strategies to influence the maturity levels of cybersecurity <ref type="bibr">(Chang &amp; Yeh 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Pérez-González et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nassimbeni et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tang &amp; Liu 2015)</ref>, we posited that the conflicting results could be due to the lack of visibility of these strategies among the respondents in our study. Additionally, the lack of any significant positive effect of IT security strategies on the enhanced level of cybersecurity in organisations could be due to the choice of the industry sectors for our study, i.e., retail, education, and healthcare in the Indian context. While, for studies conducted in the U.S.A. and U.K.: (a) the healthcare data is highly sensitive and regulated by the government due to the availability of EHRs; (b) retailers are highly efficient and regularly communicate between supply-chain partners; and (c) the education sector has seen massive interests from the common public and private organisations alike <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Newhouse et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cabaj et al., 2018)</ref>. In contrast, IT managers in India did not perceive IT security strategies to influence the cybersecurity of organisations in a significant manner for these industry sectors. Additionally, IT managers might have adopted security strategies at the organizational level such as (i) clear vision about the cybersecurity goals, (ii) institutionalised IT security governance, (iii) exercise risk management controls, (iv) a favourable reward and incentive policy for employees, and (v) mutual sharing of critical information on IT infrastructure and software among ISAC members. However, many of these organizational IT security strategies, ISGs, and judgements were not explicitly visible to all the employees of an organization, unless they were part of the linked and executable decisions. Thus, information security management needs to be established on a well-developed and inter-linked IT strategy spread across the entire organisation <ref type="bibr">(Seeholzer, 2012)</ref>. Finally, senior management should adopt those strategies successfully, be able to evaluate the efficacy of cybersecurity maturity levels, and successfully communicate its value <ref type="bibr">(McFadzean et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tang &amp; Liu 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>With the progress of the digital world, there needs to be an enhanced level of cyber-security in organisations. The cyber-security level depends on several factors, such as technical capabilities, human resources, information security measures, etc. In this paper, we investigate the determinants for enhanced cybersecurity level in organisations. Firstly, determinants are identified by thorough literature review and discussed with experts. The critical determinants are then analysed by PLS-SEM technique using the data collected from 151 professionals in sectors such as retail, education, healthcare, etc. in India. The results show legal consequences, technical measures, the role of senior management and proactive information security measures to be the most important antecedents for enhanced cybersecurity levels in organisations. The study provides managers with the factors that need to be most focused for enhanced level of cyber-security in their respective organisations. Organisations can take pre-emptive measures and work toward improving the level of cyber-security.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Implications to Theory and Practice</head><p>The study provides implications for research as well as practice. The study can be used for developing insights for both managers and academicians.</p><p>Implications to Research: The present study explores the antecedents which impact the enhanced level of cyber-security in the organisations. The results of this study have several important research implications. Firstly, this is the first study of its kind which investigates the Cyber-security not only from a technical perspective but also from a human resource perspective. Secondly, the research found out that the legal consequences after a cyber breach, technical measures adopted by organizations, the role of senior management and proactive information security measures adopted by organizations are the most important antecedents for enhanced cybersecurity levels in organisations.</p><p>Implications to Practice: The findings of our study offer several significant managerial implications, especially for CISOs, information security managers, and related departments. Firstly, managers need to focus on the critical antecedents/factors that lead to an enhanced level of cyber-security in their respective organisations. While legal consequences, technical measures, the role of senior management, and proactive information security measures are found to be significant, personality traits and strategies adopted by the IT security managers are relatively weaker antecedents of organizational cyber-security. Therefore, IT security managers can focus on the significant factors and their sub-factors only. The security managers can further take pre-emptive measures towards enhancing the cyber-security in their firms, thereby leading to an enhanced cyber-security environment.</p><p>Secondly, we found that senior management plays an influencing role in improving organizational cyber-security through regular participation, self-commitment, evaluation, and ethical leadership. Across the organization, senior managers must pledge to an improved information security culture, established legitimacy through self-participations in ISA exercises and SETA drills, leading to a display of ethical leadership and regular evaluations 9 . We found that an enhanced effect is visible sans the personality traits of the IT managers who executed the strategic decisions. This observation is of particular interest given the fact that novel technologies such as big-data projects are often unsuccessful after implementation because of the lack of organizational alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bean and Kiron, 2013)</ref> and ineffective managerial best practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Ross et al., 2013)</ref>. Our study posited a similar effect for improving the effectiveness of the antecedents of enhanced cyber-security in organisations.</p><p>Thirdly, we found that proactive information security plays an essential role in enhancing the current level of organizational cyber-security. These processes include whether the organization regularly conducts SETA exercises for its employees, recurrently manages cyber-incidents and vulnerabilities and logs them for predictive analysis (if required), and minimise correlated risks. Additionally, the IT infrastructure must be equipped with proactive information security measures (such as digital signatures, cryptographic keys, and antiphishing scanners) instead of reactive measures (such as access controls, firewalls, passwords, and remote access, biometrics and intrusion detection systems). These findings have significant implications for the parent organization as well as auxiliary IT hardware and software industries and managed security service providers (MSSP). While business organisations gradually become less dependent on reactive measures, this will create new demand in the market for proactive hardware and software (such as spear-phishing filters 10 ), MSSPs, as well as for cyber-security professionals to impart SETA training 11 .</p><p>Fourthly, we have shown that the legal consequences of cyber-attacks is the most influential antecedent of enhancing cyber-security in organisations. This finding has interesting but diverse implications for the legislative department of a business organisation, and that may vary across countries. In India, the sole governing cyber-law is the Information Technology Act (2000) 12 , while companies in the U.K. must adhere to the Computer Misuse <ref type="bibr">Act (1990)</ref>, the General Data Protection Regulation, the Data Protection Act (2018), and the Network and Information Systems Regulation (2018) 13 . In contrast, there exists a robust and effective state and federal framework for cyber-legislation in the U.S.A 14 15 . In each of these countries, the defence institutions, govt. departments and the military offices primarily control cyber-security legislation and policies. Therefore, we recommend the inclusivity of business organisations, as they participate in commercial transactions, and are often targets for malicious attacks.</p><p>Additionally, there are enormous scopes for legal consultants, private and public organisations to contribute towards up-to-date and robust cyber-laws and policies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Limitations and future directions</head><p>Beyond our contributions to the extant research, we recognise that our study has few limitations. These limitations may hold the potential in contributing towards the future research studiesin this area. We have collected only the quantitative data for capturing the enhanced level of security. The collection of qualitative data would give additional insights concerning the enhanced level of cyber-security. Also, the data was collected from users who are based in India; hence the results cannot be generalized in the global context. The study can be extended by collecting data from other sectors, and results can be compared with this study to check whether there are any differences in antecedents for enhanced cybersecurity among different sectors. Finally, interrelationships between the antecedents can be identified using techniques such as interpretive structural modelling, analytic network process, DEMATEL, etc.</p></div>

Therefore, after adherence to security control measures in organisations, their enhanced cybersecurity can be measured with the help of strict conformance to C-I-A-NR levels across the organisation-finally, these adopted security control measures to technological efficacy, process efficacy, and organisational efficacy.</figDesc></figure>
