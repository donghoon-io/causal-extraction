<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose: The objective of this research was to study the influences that affect the business performance of the retail ready-made garment businesses in Thailand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method:</head><p>The study focused on the use of a qualitative method with a questionnaire as the tool for data collection from a sample of 400 retail ready-made garment businesses. Data analyses included descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussions:</head><p>The factors with the highest means are Customization (mean 5.47), Transactions (mean 5.36), and Supplier Connection (mean 5.30). The multiple regression analysis demonstrated that Customization, Supplier Connection, and Information influence the business performance of retail ready-made garment businesses in Thailand with statistical significance, whereas Transactions do not. Nevertheless, it was also revealed that, in the operation of retail ready-made garment businesses, the value chain for e-businesses includes business performance, production, logistics, the infrastructure of human resources, and finance. E-business adoption influences business performance by beneficially leading to efficient operations and the sustainable growth of organizations.</p><p>Research Implications: This disruption, thus, is an opportunity and destruction, which is a challenge for business. Therefore, the business should set the goal for sustainable development by adopting e-business as the key tool to drive the national economy. Furthermore, the use of big data or data analytics would upgrade business efficiency the same as the use of artificial intelligence (AI) that would support business operations, human resource management, and customer information management. Nevertheless, other factors affecting business growth are the use of various platforms, marketing strategies that access the customer widely, reliable services, adoption of technology to e-commerce, and skillful personnel in ecommerce, which would have sustainable positive impacts on the business operation.</p><p>Originality/Value: Due to the change in customers' behavior to become online users, the government sector should set the policy and provide aid to promote the knowledge to the people for employment and careers from the online business that would maximize the value of e-business in Thailand.</p></div>

Método: El estudio se centró en el uso de un método cualitativo con un cuestionario como herramienta de recogida de datos de una muestra de 400 empresas minoristas de confección. Los datos se analizaron mediante estadística descriptiva y análisis de regresión múltiple.</p><p>Resultados y Discusión: Los factores con las medias más altas son Personalización (media 5,47), Transacciones (media 5,36) y Conexión con el proveedor (media 5,30). El análisis de regresión múltiple demostró que la personalización, la conexión con el proveedor y la información influyen con significación estadística en los resultados empresariales de las empresas minoristas de confección en Tailandia, mientras que las transacciones no lo hacen. No obstante, también se puso de manifiesto que, en el funcionamiento de las empresas minoristas de confección, la cadena de valor de los negocios electrónicos incluye el rendimiento empresarial, la producción, la logística, la infraestructura de recursos humanos y las finanzas. La adopción del negocio electrónico influye en el rendimiento empresarial al conducir de forma beneficiosa a operaciones eficientes y al crecimiento sostenible de las organizaciones. Implicaciones de la Investigación: Esta disrupción, por tanto, es una oportunidad y una destrucción, lo que supone un reto para las empresas. Por lo tanto, las empresas deberían fijarse el objetivo del desarrollo sostenible adoptando el negocio electrónico como herramienta clave para impulsar la economía nacional. Además, el uso de big data o análisis de datos mejoraría la eficiencia empresarial, al igual que el uso de inteligencia artificial (IA), que apoyaría las operaciones empresariales, la gestión de recursos humanos y la gestión de la información de los clientes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Currently, the largest garment markets are in developed countries although the growth of the sales volume is slow or negative. Other markets involve those that are emerging; such as China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and</p><p>Vietnam. Furthermore, China and India are the countries with the highest demand for readymade garments. As a result, there is a gap in the growth of the ready-made garment market and the industries related to the technologies, particularly online sales which substitute physical shop sales (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>Online retail transaction value <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> Source: Lambert <ref type="bibr">Bu,2019</ref> Moreover, customer behavior has changed, as consumers are purchasing more from online sales with males buying more online garments; the growth of children's wear is also very dramatic. The increasing sales volume of garments is the result of the consumption of the teenager group and simpler access to the brands. The expansion of e-commerce in small towns and department stores indicates the fashion trends to the buyer. For this reason, many brands Millennials or Gen Y and Generation X or Gen X people spend 50% more time on online shopping than people from the Baby Boomer group to buy items for their daily life. The offline purchase is for a product that only fulfills a personal demand or luxurious experience.</p><p>Simultaneously, the consumer still has the demand for the omnichannel or the integration of online and offline sales, which gives a seamlessly positive experience to the customer. With this channel, the customer has more convenient alternatives. For instance, the customer might order online and collect the product from a physical shop, or order at the physical shop and use a home delivery service. Currently, 85% of the buyers in the garment e-commerce sales purchase from online and office channels, which is a 5% increase over 2017 <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, during the past few years, there have been continuous updates on the closing of branches of retail shops worldwide, both minor and major leading brands. The information from Coresight <ref type="bibr">Research [2]</ref>, a market research company in the USA, indicated that 4,810 branches of retail businesses in the USA were closed at the beginning of 2019.</p><p>That is to say the retail business is currently being disrupted or ruined by digital and new innovative technologies. Thus, it can be seen that the retail business will have more collaboration with tech startups in the future to leverage the technologies and innovations to upgrade to be an efficient business. The intense competition and customer behavior are the factors encouraging sellers to develop and generate more investment in transforming their business in the digital era. <ref type="bibr">Gartner,</ref><ref type="bibr">Inc. [3]</ref>, a world leading research and consulting company, predicted the technology expenses in the retail business sector around the world and found that it would expand 3.6% in 2019, accounting for 203.06 billion USD and would have a similar growth ratio in the next two years. Software investment would also have the most expansion and growth of the technology expenses.</p><p>However, there are many new faces of retail and wholesale garment entrepreneurs in Thailand; such as, the group of designers who manufacture and distribute their products by themselves at a shop decorated in a unique style to suit the garment, on the Internet, or at importing garment shops. Nevertheless, to survive in this business is not simple. A number of entrepreneurs are unsuccessful in business because the retail business and SMEs in Thailand . <ref type="bibr">Porter [7]</ref> proposed the sales marketing, supply, collaboration and operation concept within the retail firms that were aware of the marketing activities and the value chain of an efficient operation, production, logistics, infrastructure, human resources, and finance <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. For this reason, the researcher would like to study the model for the structural equation of the variables affecting the performance of the retail ready-made garment business by e-business adoption in Thailand to gain academic information that could be applied as a guideline for the retail ready-made garment entrepreneur, as well as other retail businesses and business sectors to set the strategies to enhance the performance efficiency and to propose the recommendations to the government regarding aid for the retail ready-made garment entrepreneurs who have encountered pressure from unstable domestic and international business circumstances. Objectives 1. To study the direct, indirect, and total impacts of the variables affecting the performance of the retail ready-made garment business by e-business adoption in Thailand.</p><p>2. To develop the structure equation model (SEM) of the variables affecting the performance of the retail ready-made garment business by e-business adoption in Thailand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</head><p>Thailand has initiated the digital economy policy to drive the modern economy to correspond with the policies, strategies, and projects, especially in the digital era where information is the key tool for generating predictions and making decisions on administrative policy and the direction of the organization and nation <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. The textile and garment industries in Thailand are pressured by their competitors and the government sector to be more aware of brand significance, understanding of the market demand, and the potential of Thai entrepreneurs to develop them to become original brand manufacturers and perform their business sustainably. Furthermore, the domestic markets are influenced by the online channel, which is very popular today, as well as other technologies that support convenient and quick purchases. The international markets, such as the USA, Europe, and Asia have a constant demand for importing from Thailand.</p><p>Rogers <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref> explained about the diffusion of innovation (DOI) that as time passed and the idea or momentum of the product increased and was diffused to a specific group of people or social system, the people, who were a part of that social system, applied a new behavioral concept or products. <ref type="bibr">Malinverni et al.,</ref><ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> discovered that acceptance was classified into Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards. Moreover, the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework was developed and explained as the process of deciding to apply technology to the system and the system's installation. The factors affecting the decision-making to apply the technologies were the technological, organizational and environmental factors. However, the application of e-business and the information system (IS), as well as the acceptance of the electronic structure to business; such as, e-procurement</p><p>[12], e-commerce [13], e-market [14] and e-supply chain <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>, and the use of an innovative information system; such as; cloud computing <ref type="bibr">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr">17]</ref> and the Internet of Things (IoT) <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>,</p><p>resulted in efficient performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">FIRM CHARACTERISTICS</head><p>Firm characteristics are determined within the framework employing the organizational management and system of the main organization, which comprises management processes, organizational culture, and organizational systems <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>. Firm characteristics refer to the quality of the business that transforms the production factors to the products or services using the strategy emphasizing the products or target markets to the organizational value construct to upgrade the efficiency and promote the business growth <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>. In previous research, firm characteristics were generally utilized because they had a high impact on the acceptance of innovation applications. Organizational characteristics consist of the firm size, top management support, and expectation of utilization <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>. Firm characteristics refer to the resources of the firm, size of the firm, managerial structure, and internal coordination <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">17]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Ling [24]</ref> discovered that a small business had a less complex organizational structure and less chance of more innovations because they were able to handle the risk, and had sufficient resources and infrastructure to ensure the innovation adoption. In addition, the age of the organization affected the business. A new business had a high feasibility of growth. Similarly, a young owner or manager was likely to achieve more success than an older owner. As such, the growth of the business was the result of the impact of the business and the owner's or manager's characteristics <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>. The firm characteristics in terms of the owner's or manager's characteristics and components of the establishment. They found that the components of the establishment, which included the age of the business, number of owners, complexity of the organizational structure, process, capital, number of employees, and the period of aid, were related to the business efficiency. Furthermore, the use of different strategies; such as, a lowcost strategy, differentiation, target market, and development, were significantly different to the growth of the return rate, sales volume, returns from the total assets, and investment return.</p><p>The application of new technologies was likely to receive more acceptance from the employees;</p><p>additionally, the top management played an important role in implementing the innovations in the business <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>. The top management could encourage the change of technologies to be more accepted by the employees by setting an obvious clear vision of the organization <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>. In an organization where the top management supports information technology, the concerned personnel and divisions would be willing to perform their functions at full capacity, which would finally result in efficient and effective performance <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. From the review of the relevant literature to the firm characteristics, the previous studies examined the following observed variables that applied to this current research.</p><p>1. Firm size refers to the difference of the organization in the use of production factors; such as capital, labor, and machinery, to construct the organization to have efficient performance.</p><p>2. Top management support refers to the essence that ensures the interest and attention of the executive in the resources and environmental development in the organization that facilitates the adoption of technologies and innovations. This was the key tool to overcome any obstacles and technological changes.</p><p>3. Expected benefits of e-business referred to the factor to acquire the acceptance in ebusiness within and outside the firm <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">29,</ref><ref type="bibr">30]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">INNOVATION CHARACTERISTICS</head><p>Innovation is an influential concept in the economy and society. Innovation creates new things and is considered as the fundamental strategy to sustainably maximize the firm's potential and competitiveness <ref type="bibr">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr">32]</ref>. Therefore, innovation is accepted by organizations and firms as a tool to construct success. <ref type="bibr">Schumpeter [33]</ref>   <ref type="bibr">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr">32]</ref>. Roger <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref> proposed that innovation characteristics comprised five components.</p><p>Firstly, a comparative benefit refers to the organization or individual who perceived that innovation was a better thing or had more benefits than what was currently in place. Secondly, compatibility refers to the level that the innovation was considered to be under the current technology or work procedure. Thirdly, a complexity that referred to the level that the innovation was considered to be difficult to use or understand. Fourthly, trialability refers to the level at which innovation was applied to the condition. Fifthly, noticeability refers to the level of the outcome that was visible to others; the greater the innovation outcome, the more acceptance. However, <ref type="bibr">Wu et al. [28]</ref> indicated that the factors of a successful business involved the difference of the business, innovations, the environmental context, and more importantly, the adoption of e-business, which differentiated the entrepreneur from others <ref type="bibr">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr">34]</ref>. From the review of the relevant literature to the innovation characteristics, the previous studies examined the following observed variables that applied to the current research.</p><p>1. Relative advantage refers to the perception of the benefits of the innovations or innovation acceptance, which the acceptor compared to other proposals, in terms of status, usage simplicity, and low price.</p><p>2. Perceived compatibility refers to the perception of the innovation receiver's view that the innovation matched and was appropriate for them in various aspects; such as the norm, tradition, culture, and skills. . <ref type="bibr">Lin and Lee [34]</ref> stated that the level of e-business adaptation was valuable and used to comprehend the issues related to the e-business system, which involved five levels:</p><p>beginning, breeding, networking, business combination, and business change, respectively.</p><p>Moreover, e-business adoption was to operate the business with an electronic system. The acceptance of e-business expanded the market to serve customers worldwide and constructed global marketing relations, which upgraded firm competitiveness and economic growth <ref type="bibr">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>.</p><p>The use of Internet applications for communication, and internal and international business management was essential to observe the diffusion of e-business from the internal and external perspectives <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. Furthermore, the use of electronic media was the procedure to buy, sell, and exchange products, services, and information through an Internet network <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref> and supply chain <ref type="bibr">[39]</ref>. The learning and knowledge management of the personnel in the organization to ebusiness adoption constructed the learning, network, and knowledge transfer to the related businesses <ref type="bibr">[34]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Ilin et al. [27]</ref> investigated the factors of e-business adaptation in the firms that used and did not use ERP and found that the results displayed statistically significant differences. In addition, they discovered that the diffusion of the electronic system in supply chain management had positive impacts on the organization's efficiency <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref>. From the review of the relevant literature on e-business adoption, the previous studies examined the following observed variables that applied to the current research. 2. Transaction refers to the activity derived from the decision to purchase followed by the purchasing step, searching for the raw material supplier, the purchasing order, and following up the purchasing order through an online system.</p><p>3. Customization referred to the activity that satisfies the customers and fulfills the customers' demands.</p><p>4. Supplier connection refers to the factors supporting the use of e-business within and outside the firm. <ref type="bibr">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">18,</ref><ref type="bibr">28,</ref><ref type="bibr">41]</ref> 2.4 BUSINESS PERFORMANCE Measuring competitiveness with financial performance might not reflect true competitiveness. Initially, the method used was a balanced scorecard (BSC), which was a managerial tool to evaluate the organization for its strategic implementation starting from the vision, mission, and strategies, which were the steps to set the important factors of success. The BSC was also used for strategic planning <ref type="bibr">[42]</ref> to develop the organization and evaluate through the perspective of a measuring and evaluation system in four main aspects, which included the Financial Perspective, Customer Perspective, Internal Perspective, and Learning and Growth <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref>. Then, the key performance indicators (KPI) were created to indicate the goal and assess the performance that was important to the strategy <ref type="bibr">[44]</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr">Wu et al. [28]</ref> proposed that the evaluation consisted of four dimensions: efficiency, sales performance, customer satisfaction, and relationship development. Moreover, <ref type="bibr">Koellinger [45]</ref> studied the link between technology, innovation, and efficiency of the firm in e-business adoption. He found that this connection was similar to the use of e-business to integrate the supply chain and evaluate it by using the BSC <ref type="bibr">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr">47]</ref>. However, the study on the diffusion of innovations showed that information technology affected the efficiency of the BSc by applying the technology to business operations <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref>. This was in line with <ref type="bibr">Tsou and Hsu [48]</ref> who discovered that there were impacts on the efficiency of technological organization openness, environment of service production, and the preparedness of the digital resource of e-business. From the review of the relevant literature to the business performance, the previous studies examined the following observed variables that were applicable to the current research. 2. Customer perspective refers to customer care and value creation to the customer to construct satisfaction in the product, which leads to the value added to the business.</p><p>3. Internal processes perspective refers to the perspective on the business showing the efficiency of the organization and the performance of the employees.</p><p>4. Innovation learning and growth perspective refers to the development of knowledge and capability of the employees, employees' satisfaction and attitude, work skills, facilities, and turnover rate. <ref type="bibr">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr">49,</ref><ref type="bibr">50,</ref><ref type="bibr">51]</ref> The literature review resulted in the following hypotheses (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">2</ref>):</p><p>Hypothesis 1 (H1): Firm characteristics affect the business performance.</p><p>Hypothesis 2 (H2): Firm characteristics affect the e-business adoption.</p><p>Hypothesis 3 (H3): Innovation characteristics affect the e-business adoption.</p><p>Hypothesis 4 (H4): E-business adoption affects the business performance.</p></div>

Then, the context validity and index of item objective congruence (IOC) was conducted by five experts. The questions with an IOC of .5 and more were selected <ref type="bibr">[53]</ref>. The reliability was tested by distributing the questionnaire to 30 samples and analyzed with the Cronbach α-coefficient. The results showed that Cronbach's Alpha was .957, which a value higher than .70 was considered to have high reliability <ref type="bibr">[54]</ref>. Therefore, the questionnaire was used to collect the data.</p></div>

The analysis on the SEM was the technique to analyze the multivariate variables, which was the combination of factor analysis and multiple regression. The relationship of the variable was immediately verified [58] using the maximum likelihood estimation (ML). The results of the goodness of fit measures used the acceptable standard criteria [57, 58] (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p></div>

Thus, it was concluded that the SEM of the variables had an impact on the performance of the retail ready-made garment business, and the e-business adoption in Thailand had a goodness of fit <ref type="bibr">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr">58,</ref><ref type="bibr">61]</ref>. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>, the standard regression weight and squared multiple correlations (R 2 ) of the business performance were .703 -.837 and .434 -.994, respectively. The standard regression weight and squared multiple correlation (R 2 ) of the innovation characteristics were .553-.933 and .306 -.870, respectively. The standard regression weight and squared multiple correlation (R 2 ) of firm characteristics were .809 -.921 and .655 -.847, respectively. The standard regression weight and squared multiple correlation (R 2 ) of e-business adoption were .842 -.879 and .709 -.772, respectively.  From the analysis results, the equation was: Business Performance = .15Firm Characteristic + .87E-business adoption, R 2 = .94.</p><p>(1)</p><p>From the equation, it was found that business performance had a positive impact from the firm characteristic and e-business with statistical significance, which the variance of the business performance was explained as 94%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">HYPOTHESIS TESTING RESULT</head><p>The hypothesis test considering the CR (t-Value) and p-Value, and the influence of each pair of variables indicated that all regression coefficients (coef.) of the relationship of each hypothesis showed a significance higher than 1.96. It could be concluded that the research results supported all hypotheses. The analysis results of the factor influence are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref>. Hypothesis 2 (H2): Firm characteristics affect the e-business adoption. The hypothesis test result showed that the regression coefficient was .114. This was true with the statistical significance.</p><p>Hypothesis 3 (H3): Innovation characteristics affect the e-business adoption. The hypothesis test result showed that the regression coefficient was .747. This was true with the statistical significance.</p><p>Hypothesis 4 (H4): E-business adoption affects the business performance. The hypothesis test result showed that the regression coefficient was .867. This was true with the statistical significance.  The research on the structural equation model (SEM) of the variables affecting the business performance of the retail ready-made garment business by e-business adoption in Thailand showed that all hypotheses supported the research with statistical significance. It was found that e-business adoption affected the business performance the most, followed by the firm characteristics. This finding was consistent with <ref type="bibr">Wu et al. [28]</ref> who examined the factors affecting business success in different businesses in terms of innovations, environment and identity creation in e-business adoption <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>. Moreover, the use of the Internet application of the business in communication and management was the diffusion of e-business [15] by using an electronic system to buy, sell or exchange products, services and information by means of an Internet network <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Wu and Chuang [40]</ref> studied the diffusion of the electronic system in supply chain management that affected the efficiency of good organization, learning, network construction, and knowledge transfer <ref type="bibr">[34]</ref>. However, the application of a balance scorecard (BSC) as the measuring tool was popular to use as the systematic tool for strategic planning <ref type="bibr">[42]</ref>. This also conformed with <ref type="bibr">Chang and Graham,</ref><ref type="bibr">[46]</ref> who discovered the relationship of technologies, innovations and efficiency of the firm in e-business adoption for the integration of the supply chain and evaluation <ref type="bibr">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr">47]</ref>. Nevertheless, the diffusion of innovation and information technology affected the efficiency of the measure and evaluation with the BSC [43] and the efficiency of the organization in using digital technology of ebusiness in production or service <ref type="bibr">[48]</ref>. Therefore, in a firm where the top management supports information technology and innovation, the personnel and relevant division would perform their functions efficiently, as well as had knowledge and capability that would result in efficiency and effectiveness <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. creates competitiveness for the industry applying technology to the business. Moreover, in a world that is being disrupted by technologies, without any adjustment or transformation, the business will not be able to grow. This disruption, thus, is an opportunity and destruction, which is a challenge for business. Therefore, the business should set the goal for sustainable development by adopting e-business as the key tool to drive the national economy. Furthermore, the use of big data or data analytics would upgrade business efficiency the same as the use of artificial intelligence (AI) that would support business operations, human resource management, and customer information management. Nevertheless, other factors affecting business growth are the use of various platforms, marketing strategies that access the customer widely, reliable services, adoption of technology to e-commerce, and skillful personnel in ecommerce, which would have sustainable positive impacts on the business operation. Due to the change in customers' behavior toward becoming online users, the government sector should set the policy and provide aid to promote the knowledge to the people for employment and careers from the online business that would maximize the value of e-business in Thailand.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>OF THE VARIABLES AFFECTING THE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OF THE RETAIL READY-MADE GARMENT BUSINESS BY E-BUSINESS ADOPTION IN THAILANDonly focus on online marketing.

Today, the implementation of e-business is very crucial because it supports the efficiency and effectiveness of a business's operations.

Perceived complexity refers to the level the acceptance of technology to simplify its use to leverage its acceptance.Trialability refers to the factors determining the quantity or the success and whether it fulfilled the demand or expectation. This was the factor affecting the perceived benefits of information technology.[10, 27, 29, 30, 35]    2.3 E-BUSINESS ADOPTION Electronic business or e-business was first used by IBM in 1997 to substitute the word E-commerce[36]. E-business was explained as a form of products and services traded on digital media. E-business involves the use of the Internet and technology to provide convenience in buying and selling through the Intranet, Extranet, and Internet. The acceptance of the consumer of the innovations and technologies (adoption and innovation theory) is called the acceptance process, which refers to the behavior of the individual in society exhibiting the acceptance to perform[37]</figDesc></figure>
