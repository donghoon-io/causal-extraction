<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The present paper examined relationships between schizotypy (measured by the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experience; O-LIFE scale brief), belief in the paranormal (assessed via the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale; RPBS) and proneness to statistical bias (i.e., perception of randomness and susceptibility to conjunction fallacy). Participants were 254 volunteers recruited via convenience sampling. Probabilistic reasoning problems appeared framed within both standard and paranormal contexts. Analysis revealed positive correlations between the Unusual Experience (UnExp) subscale of O-LIFE and paranormal belief measures [RPBS full scale, traditional paranormal beliefs (TPB) and new age philosophy]. Performance on standard problems correlated negatively with UnExp and belief in the paranormal (particularly the TPB dimension of the RPBS). Consideration of specific problem types revealed that perception of randomness associated more strongly with belief in the paranormal than conjunction; both problem types related similarly to UnExp. Structural equation modeling specified that belief in the paranormal mediated the indirect relationship between UnExp and statistical bias. For problems presented in a paranormal context a framing effect occurred. Whilst UnExp correlated positively with conjunction proneness (controlling for perception of randomness), there was no association between UnExp and perception of randomness (controlling for conjunction).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Heuristics are simple mental rules or shortcuts, which ease cognitive load and facilitate rapid formation of judgments and decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)</ref>. While heuristics typical yield reasonable judgments, they can also produce systematic deviations from logic and probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Costello and Mathison, 2014)</ref>. Recent research indicates that belief in the paranormal is associated with susceptibility to heuristic bias, particularly misrepresentation of chance <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dagnall et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dagnall et al., , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dagnall et al., , 2016) )</ref> and conjunction fallacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Rogers et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rogers et al., , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Rogers et al., , 2016))</ref>. The present paper examined the degree to which level of schizotypy influenced this relationship. This was a logical extension to previous research because schizotypy correlates with belief in the paranormal and is associated with proneness to reasoning and cognitive bias. For instance, jumping to conclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Moritz and Woodward, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Sellen et al., 2005)</ref> and tendency to discount disconfirmatory evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Buchy et al., 2007)</ref>. Schizotypy is a rich and complex psychopathology concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lenzenweger, 2015)</ref>. Researchers use schizotypy as a tool for investigating schizophrenia and psychosis associated phenomena because schizotypy measures assess non-clinical populations and thus avoid confounds associated with schizophrenic patients (i.e., symptom severity and general decline in cognitive performance) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Claridge, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Yoon et al., 2008)</ref>. The relationship between schizotypy and schizophrenia, however, is not a simple one. Different views exist on the continuum between schizotypy, mental health and mental illness (i.e., quasi-dimensional, dimensional and fully dimensional). The present paper restricts itself to the notion that schizotypy is a personality trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Claridge and Beech, 1995)</ref> assessed on a continuum, ranging from relative psychological health to schizophrenia (psychosis) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barrantes-Vidal et al., 2015)</ref>. This perspective compliments the observations that schizotypy presents within the general population and does not necessarily result in psychopathology. Indeed, non-clinical community respondents can obtain high schizotypy scores without exhibiting schizophrenia spectrum symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Dembińska-Krajewska and Rybakowski, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The inclusion of schizotypy is a logical extension to previous work for several reasons. Firstly, there is a well-documented positive correlation between schizotypy and belief in the paranormal <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hergovich et al., 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hergovich et al. (2008)</ref> found that schizotypy predicted key facets of belief in the paranormal <ref type="bibr">(i.e., precognition, psi, witchcraft and spiritualism)</ref>. This association arises in part from construct overlap. One of the Schizotypal Personality Disorder diagnostic criteria refers specifically to odd beliefs or magical thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hergovich et al., 2008)</ref>. This relationship suggests that schizotypy may also influence correlates of paranormal belief. Secondly, the directional nature of the correlation between schizotypy and paranormal belief is uncertain. Specifically, it is unclear whether belief in the paranormal produces high schizotypy scores, schizotypy promotes paranormal beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hergovich et al., 2008)</ref>, or the relationship is explained by a common third variable.</p><p>The association is complicated further because schizotypy and belief in the paranormal interact differently with related beliefs. For example, paranormal belief (vs. level of schizotypy) better predicts traditional religious contents, superstitious thoughts and belief in the existence of extraordinary life forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hergovich et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, previous work indicates that belief in the paranormal and schizotypy influence perception of causal relationships. Principally, perception of illusory causality and proneness to connectedness (the tendency to perceive co-occurring events as meaningfully associated). Perception of randomness in turn is likely to affect appreciation of chance (randomness) and susceptibility to heuristical bias. Thus, the present study tested the previously unassessed assertion that schizotypy effects susceptibility to heuristic bias.</p><p>Paranormal belief is moderately associated with probability misjudgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Blackmore and Troscianko, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bressan, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dagnall et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dagnall et al., , 2014))</ref>. A seminal example is <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blackmore and Troscianko (1985)</ref>, who reported that believers in psi (vs. non-believers) performed less well on probability judgment tasks. Psi refers to the unknown factor in extrasensory perception and psychokinesis experiences. Subsequent research produced similar findings, but focused on a limited number of reasoning problem types. Observing this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dagnall et al. (2007)</ref> conducted a study including a range of problem-solving tasks. Items evaluated four key reasoning domains: perception of randomness (judging the likelihood of obtaining strings/sequences), base rate (probability of a stated outcome in relation to presented information), conjunction fallacy (determining whether co-occurring events were more likely to occur than single, constituent events) and derivation of expected value (evaluating odds in order to maximize pay-outs). Performance on perception of randomness tasks emerged as the best predictor of level of paranormal belief. This finding supported the notion that believers in the paranormal possess a tendency to perceive random events (coincidences) as causally related (meaningful) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brugger and Taylor, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Relatedly, Rogers <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Rogers et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rogers et al., , 2011) )</ref> reported a positive correlation between susceptibility to conjunction fallacy and belief in the paranormal. Conjunction fallacy refers to instances where event co-occurrence [P(A&amp;B)] (conjunction), is rated more likely than constituent events, P(A) or P(B) <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Tversky and Kahneman, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hertwig and Chase, 1998)</ref>. The work of Rogers is important because few previous studies considered the role conjunction plays in the development and maintenance of paranormal beliefs.</p><p>Using a specially designed Scenario Judgments Questionnaire (SJQ), <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Rogers et al., 2009)</ref> found that paranormal believers (vs. non-believers) made more conjunction errors and that context effected susceptibility to conjunction; standard problems produced more errors than those presented in a paranormal framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Rogers et al., 2009)</ref>. The SJQ is a measure comprised of 16 conjunction vignettes divided into nonparanormal/conventional (e.g., queuing for airport coffee) and paranormal (e.g., alleged precognition) events. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rogers et al. (2011)</ref> reproduce the finding that believers (vs. non-believers) produced more conjunction errors, but failed to replicate the outcome that performance varied as a function of problem type (conventional vs. paranormal).</p><p>Conjunction effects are typical weak and significant outcomes reported inconsistently across the literature. Noting this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dagnall et al. (2014)</ref> investigated further the degree to which specific probabilistic biases (perception of randomness, base rate, conjunction fallacy and probability) were associated with belief in the paranormal and proneness to reality testing (RT) deficits (Inventory of Personality Organization-Reality Testing; <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lenzenweger et al., 2001)</ref>. To ensure results were not an artifact of the paranormal scale used the study employed a range of measures (Manchester Metropolitan University-New, MMU-N, <ref type="bibr">Dagnall et al., 2010a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Revised Paranormal Belief Scale, RPBS, Tobacyk and Milford, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Tobacyk, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">and Australian Sheep-Goat Scale., ASGS, Thalbourne and Delin, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Multiple regression revealed the best predictor of belief in the paranormal and proneness to RT deficits was perception of randomness. Performance on conventional conjunctions correlated only with the Tradition Paranormal Beliefs (TPB) dimension of the RPBS. Paranormal conjunctions correlated with both paranormal belief and proneness to RT deficits. Overall findings indicated that conjunction was not strongly associated with belief in the paranormal.</p><p>Considering these findings, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rogers (2014)</ref> in the context of general paranormal belief concluded that conjunction represents a particular instance of misrepresentation of chance (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dagnall et al., 2016)</ref>. This notion is consistent with the small reported effect sizes and the observation that conjunction adds no/little unique variance to regression models including perception of randomness <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dagnall et al., 2014)</ref>. Cumulatively, results suggest that susceptibility to conjunction indirectly indexes perception of randomness. Findings agree with <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bressan's (2002)</ref> general proposition that believers in the paranormal possess a lower subjective chance threshold, which inclines them to perceive unrelated events as causally related.</p><p>Schizotypy also influences perceptions of causality and connectedness. Specifically, illusory causation is associated with symptoms related to positive schizotypy, principally magical ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Rominger et al., 2011)</ref>. Within high schizotypes this manifests as a tendency to see meaning within random patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gianotti et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Farias et al., 2005)</ref>. A specific example is the propensity to view coincidences as causally related <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Diaconis and Mosteller, 1989)</ref>. More generally, susceptibility to illusory causality correlates with scores on cognitive-perceptual measures, such as delusional ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bressan, 2002)</ref>. In the context of belief in the paranormal, illusory causation may manifest as the tendency to perceive random events as causally related.</p><p>The relationship between schizotypy and illusory causation, however, is not a simple one <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fyfe et al., 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fyfe et al. (2008)</ref> examined the association between schizotypy and propensity to see connections between unrelated stimuli or events (apophenia) and found a positive association on only one of a series of tasks (triangles). Schizotypy failed to correlate significantly with performance on animated contingency and stories tasks. Consequently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fyfe et al. (2008)</ref> concluded that within healthy individuals, the tendency to perceive connectedness represents a weak effect, apparent only under certain conditions (i.e., situations where high ambiguity exists). <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rominger et al. (2011)</ref> explains illusory causation in terms of loose cognitive control. Specifically, broader or less rigid associative networks and weaker inhibition of irrelevant memory content. Poorer appreciation of chance may also be associated with allusive thinking or looseness of associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Rominger et al., 2011)</ref>. Studies report individuals high in positive schizotypal symptoms (vs. low) perceive more meaning within random patterns and generate a higher number of unusual words <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gianotti et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Farias et al., 2005)</ref>. In addition, individuals high in delusional ideation seek less information prior to reaching a decision. This expresses as the inclination to jump to conclusions, where hypotheses related to decision-making process are accepted or rejected prematurely.</p><p>Within delusional individuals, the propensity to make inaccurate judgments based on insufficient information may contribute to delusion formation and maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Garety and Freeman, 1999)</ref>. Collectively, studies indicate that schizotypy is associated with inappropriate attribution of causation and misperception of randomness (factors linked also with belief in the paranormal).</p><p>Whilst belief in the paranormal and schizotypy are both associated with misperception of chance and illusory causation, their relative contribution to heuristic bias requires exposition. A useful starting point is the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Williams and Irwin (1991)</ref>, who delineated paranormal belief systems as a rational (if deviant) attempt to achieve a metacognitive understanding of the world, is useful. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Williams and Irwin (1991)</ref> proposed that belief in the paranormal represents believers' subjective efforts to structure the world in terms of magical notions of causation. Paranormal beliefs act as a framework for structuring odd beliefs and/or magical thinking (schizotypal related cognitions). Believers perform poorly on tasks related to perception of randomness because they engage in a sophisticated form of internal reasoning founded on magical ideation. This represents an individual worldview based upon a subjective preferential thinking style, rather than a defective understanding of probability.</p><p>This rational view contrasts with the conventional interpretation, which attributes endorsement of paranormal beliefs within schizotypes to impaired psychological functioning (cognitive, perceptual and affective distortions); full-blown schizophrenic symptoms encompass the tendency to embrace paranormal attributions alongside a lack of self-awareness. Within sub-clinical populations, explanations based upon thinking style preference are more apposite, given the prosaic nature of paranormal beliefs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Study</head><p>This paper tested a series of predictions examining relationships between schizotypy, belief in the paranormal and statistical bias. Hypotheses considered the dimensional structural of schizotypy and the factorial composition of paranormal belief in order to assess which sub-measures were most strongly associated with general and specific (misrepresentation of chance and conjunction fallacy) propensity to probabilistic reasoning bias. Particularly, the study examined the degree to which belief in the paranormal mediated the relationship between schizotypy and statistical bias.</p><p>The O-LIFE assessed level of schizotypy. The O-LIFE developed from work on the personality approach to measuring schizotypy, whilst other scales, such as the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Raine and Benishay, 1995)</ref>, derive from clinical work based on clinical measurement tools. For this reason and because the target sample was normal healthy individuals the O-LIFE was considered most appropriate <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mason, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Schizotypy and Belief in the Paranormal</head><p>Acknowledging preceding work, the researchers hypothesized that the Unusual Experiences (UnExp) dimension of the O-LIFE scale would best predict belief in the paranormal. The UnExp subscale assesses positive symptoms of psychosis and contains items measuring susceptibility to perceptual aberrations, magical thinking and hallucinations. Prevalence of these characteristics is likely to foster cognitions/perceptions conducive to the formation of paranormal beliefs (i.e., proneness to experiencing strange perceptual and cognitive sensations and/or magical interpretations of occurring events) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dagnall et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Dembińska-Krajewska and Rybakowski, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Other O-LIFE dimensions [cognitive disorganization, impulsive non-conformity (ImpNon) and introverted anhedonia] relate less obviously to anomalous beliefs. Indeed, cognitive disorganization (unconventional trains of thought; disorganized thinking) and ImpNon (the failure to follow social rules non-compliance with conventional or established social roles; lack of self-control) only indirectly index elements of anomalous thinking/beliefs. Accordingly, significant but weak relationships were expected.</p><p>Regarding introverted anhedonia (blunted affect, antisocial behavior and lack of ability to feel pleasure; negative schizotypy), previous research evinces that negative aspects of schizotypy are not primarily involved with the development of paranormal beliefs. Instead, negative schizotypy plays a key role in the affective interpretation of subjectively perceived paranormal experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Irwin and Green, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Schofield and Claridge, 2007)</ref>. Hence, no significant association was anticipated between paranormal belief and introverted anhedonia <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Irwin and Green, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Williams and Irwin (1991)</ref>, the authors hypothesized that belief in the paranormal would structure cognitions and perceptions related to UnExp/magical ideation and consequently, increase the tendency to perceive noncausally events as related. Thus, whilst scores on high schizotypy (particularly, UnExp) correlate negatively with tasks assessing statistical bias, this relationship would be mediated by level of paranormal belief. Operationally, this manifests as decreased performance on tasks indexing perception of chance (particularly, those assessing perception of randomness). The notion that misrepresentation of chance is more strongly related to belief in the paranormal corresponds with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dagnall et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dagnall et al., , 2016;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rogers, 2014</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arnott's (1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Arnott's ( , 2006</ref>) taxonomy of decision biases, which arose as a response to inadequacies within previous classification systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)</ref>.</p><p>Within the taxonomy the statistical bias category, embraces chance, mistaking random events for essential process characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Wagenaar, 1988)</ref> and conjunction (the overestimation of probability in compound problems; <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Tversky and Kahneman, 1983)</ref>. The statistical bias category is central to the present paper because it provides a rationale for why propensity to conjunction fallacy is less strongly associated with belief in the paranormal. This occurs because conjunction fallacy represents a specific instance of misrepresentation of chance <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dagnall et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dagnall et al., , 2016;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rogers, 2014)</ref>. Thus, whilst misrepresentation of chance and proneness to conjunction correlate positively, conjunction contributes little unique variance. Although, predictions concerning relationships between schizotypy, belief in the paranormal, and statistical bias arose from careful consideration of previous research, no prior work has investigated the inter-relationship between these factors.</p><p>A further consideration was the fact that previous research reports that the relationship between belief in the paranormal and statistical bias varies as a function of belief type <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dagnall et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dagnall et al., , 2016))</ref>. Poorer statistical performance is more strongly associated with Traditional Paranormal Beliefs (TPB) than New Age Philosophy (NAP). These dimensions reflect the differential functioning of beliefs (individual vs. social) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lange et al., 2000)</ref>. NAP (psi, witchcraft, spiritualism and astrology) instills control over external events at the individual/personal level <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Irwin, 1992)</ref>, whilst TPBs (traditional religious beliefs, witchcraft and precognition) regulates external events at a social cultural level <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Goode, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Preceding studies note that these functional differences influence susceptibility to heuristic bias. Particularly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dagnall et al. (2014)</ref> in line with previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hergovich et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Wilson, 2013)</ref> observed that whilst perception of randomness correlated weakly with both NAP and TPBs, conjunction correlated only with TPBs. Thus, TPBs should more strongly relate to statistical bias than NAP, and the effect should be stronger for misperception of randomness than proneness to conjunction. Hence, the authors tentatively predicted that TPBs would have a stronger mediating effect than NAP.</p><p>Finally, this study included paranormal problem types alongside standard problem types. These index the degree to which participants endorse paranormal explanations in preference to optimal statistical solutions. The researchers anticipated that performance on paranormal problems would correlate negatively with schizotypy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>A sample of 254 participants (69 male, 27% and 185 female, 73%) took part in the study. Mean age 26.66, SD = 9.81, range 18-71 years. Males, M = 28.84, SD = 10.52, range 20-65 years, and females, M = 25.84, SD = 9.43, range 18-71 years. Participant recruitment was via emails to university staff and students and local stakeholders (businesses, leisure and vocational/sports classes). The sample comprised 60% enrolled undergraduate students (59% Psychology, 30% Health Care, and 11% Arts and Humanities) and 40% non-students. Prior to participation, a question asked whether participants had previously studied heuristic bias. If participants endorsed the question, participation discontinued.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probabilistic Reasoning Tasks</head><p>Four problem types derived from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dagnall et al. (2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dagnall et al. ( , 2014) )</ref> assessed probabilistic reasoning: perception of randomness, conjunction fallacy, paranormal perception of randomness and paranormal conjunction fallacy. Items were organized into five counter-balanced sections, which contained one of each problem type.</p><p>After reading each problem, participants indicated the most probable outcome from a range of alternatives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perception of Randomness</head><p>These problems evaluated participant's ability to judge the likelihood of strings/sequences (e.g., 'imagine a coin was tossed six times. Which pattern of results do you think is most likely?: (a) HHHHHH, (b) HHHTTT, (c) HTHHTT, (d) all equally likely').</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conjunction Fallacy</head><p>Participants selected the most probable outcome from presented statements. Alternatives included single and co-occurring events [e.g., 'two football teams (Team A and Team B) are playing in a local derby. What is the most likely outcome of the game?: (a) Team A scores first, (b) Team A scores first and win, (c) Team A scores first and loses, (d) Team A scores first and the game is drawn'].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Paranormal Perception of Randomness</head><p>Items possessed the same underlying structure as standard perception of randomness problems. The only differences being that judgments about the likelihood of strings/sequences occurred within a paranormal context. For example, ' A famous psychic, with renowned paranormal abilities, has successfully predicted the outcome of the last six annually held boat races between two famous English Universities' [University A and University B].

The O-LIFE measures schizotypal personality traits in non-clinical individuals. The O-LIFE brief contains 43 items divided into four sub-scales: UnExp, Cognitive Disorganization (CogDis), Introvertive Anhedonia (IntAn) and ImpNon <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Mason et al., 2005)</ref>. The UnExps scale contains 12 items phenomenologically related to the positive symptoms of psychosis and thus assesses positive schizotypy (perceptual aberrations, magical thinking and hallucinations). The CogDis sub-scale comprises 11 items reflecting thought disorder and other disorganized aspects of psychosis. Particularly, items tap poor attention/concentration, poor decision-making and social anxiety. The IntAn sub-scale is composed of 10 items measuring negative schizotypy (schizoid temperament). Items assess lack of enjoyment from social and physical sources of pleasure and avoidance of intimacy. The ImpNon scale features 10 items generically indexing lack of self-control (impulsive, anti-social, and eccentric forms of behavior). The O-LIFE following its development has become widely used. The scale possesses established psychometric qualities, particularly high internal consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Mason et al., 1995)</ref> and testretest reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Burch et al., 1998)</ref>.

The RPBS is the most widely used measure of paranormal belief <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Goulding and Parker, 2001)</ref>. Questions are presented as statements (e.g., 'There is a devil') and respondents rate items on a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Items measure seven facets: traditional religious beliefs, spiritualism, extraordinary life forms, psi, witchcraft, precognition and superstition. The RPBS globally demonstrates satisfactory reliability; subscale dimensionality, however, is uncertain <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cardena et al., 2015)</ref>. To address measurement concerns, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lange et al. (2000)</ref> performed a Rasch scaling purification of the scale. This produced two psychometrically superior factors; NAP (11items assesses belief in psi and survival of bodily death) and TPB (five-items measure belief in concepts, such as the devil, witchcraft, heaven and hell) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cardena et al., 2015)</ref>. Rasch scaling demands that responses are recoded (0-6) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lange et al., 2000)</ref>. Thus, total scores range from 0 to 156 (higher scores indicating belief in the paranormal).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Justification and General Analytical Strategy</head><p>Prior to structural equation modeling (SEM) data screening was undertaken. Then means, standard deviations and bivariate correlations for each scale were calculated. SEM characterizes hypothetical constructs as latent variables, which represent interrelated measures or observed variables. Fit indices evaluate the degree to which observed data support specified theoretical models. In the context of the present study, mediation analysis was performed to determine whether level of paranormal belief explained the relationship between schizotypy and propensity to statistical bias (misperception of randomness and conjunction error). Social science research frequently employs mediational analysis because it identifies and elucidates the process that underlies a reported relationship between observed variables. Analysis in the current study used AMOS version 22.</p><p>Prior to model evaluation, confirmatory factor analysis ensured sequential estimation of measures was appropriate <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson and Gerbing, 1988)</ref>. SEM included an analysis of general mediation; this assessed the hypothesis that schizotypy had both direct and indirect effects on statistical bias. Particularly, the notion that belief in the paranormal mediated the schizotypystatistical bias relationship. Mediation was determined by consulting bootstrapping estimates of indirect effects.</p><p>Structural equation modeling conventions necessitate a comparison of alternative models, when more than one a priori model is available (within the alternative model proposed mediator effects are restricted to zero). The degree to which the less restrictive model better fits the data provides an indication of the significance of the mediator. For comparison purposes, an additional alternative model was tested in which statistical bias was suggested to mediate the relationship between schizotypy and paranormal belief. Finally, consideration of partial correlations indicated whether level of schizotypy associated with endorsement of problems framed in a paranormal context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fit Indices</head><p>Several indices evaluated model fit (the maximum likelihood chi-square statistic, χ 2 ; the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation, RMSEA; Standardized Root Mean Square Residual, SRMR; and the Comparative Fit Index, CFI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hu and Bentler, 1999)</ref>. Traditionally, chi-square assesses absolute fit, the degree to which a priori model fits or reproduces data. Chi-square, however, is sensitive to sample size and frequently rejects structural models derived from large samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kline, 2005)</ref>. Hence, RMSEA and SRMR are also typically used. RMSEA measures the difference between the population covariance matrix and the reproduced covariance matrix, in order to control for sampling variability. Strength of the RMSEA is that it has a confidence interval (CI), which provides an indication of how precise the fit of a model is. SRMR provides the square root of the discrepancy between the model covariance matrix and the sample covariance matrix.</p><p>Relative fit considers relationship between the chi-square from the proposed model with the null/baseline model (i.e., Comparative Fit Index -CFI, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cronbach, 1990)</ref>. Specifically, CFI compares the chi-square of the hypothesized model with a model that assumes all relationships among measured variables are zero (independence model). CFI values above 0.90 indicate good fit and values above 0.95 specify very good model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hu and Bentler, 1999)</ref>. In line with previous research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bong et al., 2013)</ref>, CFI values above 0.88 can be considered to indicate marginal fit. An acceptable model requires RMSEA less than 0.10, SRMR less than 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Browne and Cudeck, 1993)</ref>, and a CFI greater than 0.88 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bong et al., 2013)</ref>.

The UnExp subscale, according to research, represents a single factor.

Further inspection revealed poor factor loadings on the UnExps subscale of items 1 and 9 (0.25 and 0.22 respectively) and so were dropped from the CFA, resulting in a good overall model fit: χ 2 (31, N = 254) = 58.91, p &lt; 0.05; CFI = 0.94; RMSEA = 0.06 (CI of 0.04-0.08); SRMR = 0.05. Comparison of AIC values supported the superior fit of the factor model following removal of items 1 and 9. The AIC value for the original model was higher (229.07 and 126.91 respectively). For the two-factor model for the RPBS, results showed that although the chi-square was significant, χ 2 (99, N = 254) = 345.29, p &lt; 0.001, the fit indices met the criteria for a marginal fit: CFI = 0.88; RMSEA = 0.10 (CI of 0.96-0.12); SRMR = 0.07.</p><p>The two-factor correlated model for standard problems reported a non-significant chi-square and the fit indices met the criteria for a good fit: χ 2 (34, N = 254) = 47.83, p &gt; 0.05; CFI = 0.92; RMSEA = 0.04 (CI of 0.01-0.07); SRMR = 0.05. However, scale scrutiny revealed a poor factor loading for problem 16 (0.12). Removing this item from the model resulted in a more parsimonious solution: χ 2 (26, N = 254) = 36.51, p &gt; 0.05; CFI = 0.94; RMSEA = 0.04 (CI of 0.01-0.07); SRMR = 0.05. Comparison of the AIC values supported the superior fit of the factor model with item 16 removed, as the AIC value of the original model is higher than for the model with item 16 removed (109.84 and 92.52 respectively). Finally, the two-factor correlated model for problems in a paranormal context indicated a significant chi-square, χ 2 (33, N = 254) = 95.63, p &lt; 0.001, yet all other fit indices met the criteria for acceptable fit: CFI = 0.90; RMSEA = 0.08 (CI of 0.06-0.11); SRMR = 0.05.</p><p>Overall, results suggest that the theoretically driven two-factor correlated models satisfactorily represent paranormal beliefs, standard problems and problems in a paranormal context; and that a single factor adequately explains UnExps.</p><p>The adequacy of the factor solutions can be also determined in relation to parameter estimates.

Fit indices indicated an acceptable data-model fit: CFI = 0.90; RMSEA = 0.04 (CI of 0.03-0.05); SRMR = 0.07. Inspection of the structural path from UnExp to TPB revealed a significant positive effect of UnExp on TPB (β = 0.31, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, TPB had a significant negative effect on both perception of randomness (β = -0.39, p &lt; 0.001) and conjunction fallacy (β = -0.25, p &lt; 0.05). UnExp and TPB accounted for 19% of the variance in perception of randomness, and accounted for 9% of the variance in conjunction fallacy. To formally test whether TPB acted as a mediator, a model was specified where the paths from TPB to UnExp and standard beliefs were constrained to zero.

Bootstrapping estimates indicated that UnExp had a lower-bounds indirect effect on PR of -0.25 and upper-bounds indirect effect of -0.07 with p &lt; 0.01. This indicated that UnExp had a significant indirect effect on PR. The absence of a significant path between UnExp and CF once TPB was constrained to zero suggests UnExp did not significantly influence CF through TPB.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>As hypothesized, the O-LIFE UnExps subscale was most strongly associated with belief in the paranormal. UnExp moderately positively correlated with paranormal measures (overall paranormal belief; TPB; and NAP). This finding supported previous work delineating a relationship between positive schizotypy (proneness to experiencing strange perceptualcognitive sensations and magical interpretations) and belief in the paranormal <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hergovich et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dagnall et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Dembińska-Krajewska and Rybakowski, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Whilst UnExp and belief in the paranormal correlated negatively with performance on problem tasks, consideration of zero-order correlations revealed that belief in the paranormal, particularly TPB, was more strongly associated with proneness to statistical bias. As expected, TPB correlated with both perception of randomness and conjunction fallacy, whilst NAP was associated only with perception of randomness. Results aligned with previous work, which reported a stronger relationship between TPB (vs. NAP) and susceptibility to heuristic bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Wilson, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dagnall et al., 2014)</ref>. Overall, findings concurred with the notion that conjunction bias (in this context) represents a specific instance of misrepresentation of chance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnott, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arnott, , 2006;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rogers, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dagnall et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Paranormal belief factors mediated the relationship between UnExp and perception of randomness, but not UnExp and conjunction fallacy. TPB (vs. NAP) demonstrated stronger relationships with UnExp and standard problems. Particularly, correlations between TPB, UnExp and perception of randomness (compared to conjunction) reflected this. Alternative models (one a constrained model and the other with statistical bias conceptualized as a mediator) were weaker in comparison with the hypothesized model. This provided support for the role of paranormal belief as a mediator.</p><p>The presence of mediation supports the postulation that belief in the paranormal acts as a framework for shaping schizotypal related cognitions (odd beliefs and/or magical thinking) <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Williams and Irwin, 1991)</ref>. This interpretation aligns with the notion of a paranormal worldview <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Zusne and Jones, 1982)</ref>. This is a broad perspective that references events to intangible mental and metaphysical processes, rather than observable/physical factors. From this viewpoint, belief in the paranormal represents a coherent, internally logical set of explanations for unusual phenomenon. Within the worldview, proneness to statistical bias is largely attributable to a subjective preferential thinking style, rather than a defective understanding of probability.</p><p>The finding that mediation occurred for misrepresentation of chance and not conjunction is with hindsight predictable because proneness to conjunction (vs. perception of randomness) relates less strongly to belief in the paranormal <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dagnall et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dagnall et al., , 2016))</ref>. Indirectly, this finding provides further support for the notion that conjunction (in this context) represents a specific instance of misrepresentation of chance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnott, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arnott, , 2006;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rogers, 2014)</ref>. Conjunction indexes less unique variance (as evidenced by weaker effect sizes and inconsistently reported findings). Misperception of randomness accounted for the majority of variance within the UnExp-statistical bias relationship. This was similar to the previously delineated model for belief in the paranormal, however, the relationship between UnExp and statistical bias was weaker (∼7% vs. 3% variance).</p><p>Within this study, a framing effect occurred; problems couched within a paranormal context proved easier to solve (standard: perception of randomness 75% and conjunction 39% vs. paranormal: perception of randomness 86% and conjunction 88%). This finding was commensurate with previous studies (see <ref type="bibr">;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Rogers et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rogers et al., , 2011;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dagnall et al., 2016)</ref>. Placing problems in a paranormal context reduces their discriminatory power because framing conflates belief in the paranormal with statistical bias. Thus, it becomes unclear whether believers endorse incorrect solutions because of their level of belief or their susceptibility to statistical error. Accordingly, whilst problems in a paranormal context are easier to solve, this advantage reduces as a function of belief in the paranormal. Indeed, performance on conjunction tasks increased markedly when the problems were located within a paranormal setting (vs. everyday situation).</p><p>Framing strengthened the association between UnExp and conjunction fallacy. This may occur because paranormal settings make conjunctions (event co-occurrence) particularly appealing to individuals scoring high on UnExp. Problem structure may suggest/infer a direct causal relationship between constituent elements. A recent paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Rogers et al. (2016)</ref> supports this notion. They found that believers in the paranormal were prone to endorsing conjunctions when a succeeding event confirmed (provided evidence for) the first. For individuals high in UnExp, the paranormal context supports ideations related to magical thinking, unusual beliefs and odd associations. Clearly, this does not apply in the context of paranormal perception of randomness problems, where participants merely estimate the probability of an event/outcome. This suggests that context may affect conjunction susceptibility, whilst perception of randomness is relatively domain general.</p><p>Clearly, more work is required in this area. Generally, assessing the degree to which susceptibility to statistical bias varies as a function of context and belief type. Whilst, belief in the paranormal is associated with misperception of randomness, other anomalous beliefs appear more strongly related to proneness to conjunction. Notably, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brotherton and French (2014)</ref> found that participants who more strongly (vs. weak) endorsed conspiracy theories made more conjunction errors.</p><p>These recent examples suggest that belief type/structure qualifies proneness to statistical bias. In the case of conspiracies, perceived co-occurrence of events is more important than estimation of probability. By their nature, conspiracies are unlikely to be true <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Grimes, 2016)</ref>. Support for conspiracies occurs, when perceived inadequacies in prevailing explanations (A) result in the endorsement of an alternative account (B) (B is dependent on A). This parallels the underlying structure of conjunction error; in order for B to be true A must be false. For example, conspiracists view inaccuracies within the official Roswell, 1947 incident as evidence that an alien spacecraft crashed <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Thomas, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Nickell, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Before concluding, the authors acknowledge that the mediation model used in this paper was cross-sectional. Therefore, findings provide only correlational evidence. Furthermore, scholars report that cross-sectional data sometimes provide biased estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Maxwell and Cole, 2007)</ref>. It is thus important for future research to carry out longitudinal assessments to demonstrate fully a causal relationship from schizotypy to statistical bias through paranormal belief. In relation to this limitation, it is noteworthy that there are theoretical arguments supporting the more primitive status of schizotypal traits over paranormal beliefs. In particular, schizotypy is a trait-like construct with a notable genetic component (see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ericson et al., 2011)</ref>, and schizotypal traits (including UnExp) are less malleable than paranormal beliefs. In addition, paranormal beliefs act as an interpretive framework, which offer structure to schizotypal traits such as UnExp <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Williams and Irwin, 1991)</ref>. From this perspective, it is logical that schizotypal traits influence statistical bias through paranormal beliefs. Weaker observed effects within the alternative model, where statistical bias was conceptualized as a mediator, provided further support for the direction of the hypothesized relationships. Accordingly, the interpretation of the current mediation models is more theoretically plausible than alternatives, which posit schizotypy or statistical bias as mediators.</p><p>There are factors, which potentially limit the generalisability of this paper's findings. These include failure to employ exclusion criteria, educational level and participant gender. With regard to exclusion criteria, paper reviewers identified variables that potentially could influence or confound results (i.e., psychiatric morbidity, substance misuse and exposure to religion). Other similar work has not identified these factors as problematic or employed exclusion criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hergovich et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Darwin et al., 2011)</ref>. Consistent with this approach, which is typical to working with general adult populations, the authors assumed that routine data screening would eliminate extreme outlying data points; control for potentially confounding scores. With regard to consideration of level of education (academic qualifications), no direct measure was necessary. Preceding work reports that statistical bias proneness is a robust phenomenon, largely unaffected by educational variables, such as level of statistical awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Tversky and Kahneman, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Fisk, 2004)</ref>. Moreover, level of education provides only an indirect index of general cognitive ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(McClelland, 1973)</ref>. Finally, there was no consideration of gender differences; prior research within the area of paranormal belief and statistical bias has failed to either test or report gender differences. Future work may wish to explore whether these factors influence relationships between belief in the paranormal, schizotypy and statistical bias.</p><p>Finally, it is important to acknowledge that potential for sample bias exists within paranormal-related studies. Particularly, individuals interested in the paranormal are more inclined to participate in associated research because of the inherent appeal of the subject matter. Subsequently, samples may under represent non-believers scoring high on schizotypy. Accordingly, paranormal believers' tendency to self-select may produce an overestimation of the relationship between belief and schizotypy. For this reason, caution is required when interpreting results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Within clinical groups, there is a well-established relationship between psychosis, cognitive bias and jumping to conclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hassanali et al., 2015)</ref>. Collectively, evidence suggests that reasoning abnormalities may correlate positively with the formation of unusual beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Lawrence and Peters, 2004)</ref>. Within the present study, relationships between schizotypy and proneness to statistical bias were weak. Indeed, as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Williams and Irwin (1991)</ref>, belief in the paranormal played an important mediating effect. Paranormal belief provided a framework for interpreting cognitive-perceptual factors of schizotypy, which resulted in increased susceptibility to misperception of randomness (schizotypy influenced statistical bias through paranormal belief).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1 | Model 1 -Mediation model depicting the relationship between unusual experiences and standard problem types, as mediated by traditional paranormal belief.
