<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Hyperuricemia poses a signi cant public health challenge on a global scale, with a concerning trend of affecting younger populations, while the rates of awareness and control remain suboptimal. The role of health literacy in in uencing health outcomes is of utmost importance, and enhancing health literacy is helpful for patients in managing risk factors.</p><p>Additionally, social support and socioeconomic position (SEP) have been identi ed as potential factors in uencing health. However, the precise relationship between these factors and hyperuricemia remains uncertain. The study aims to investigate the status of health literacy among patients with hyperuricemia and explore the relationship between health literacy, social support, SEP, and serum uric acid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>A cross-sectional study was conducted among 349 participants with asymptomatic hyperuricemia in Luzhou of China. The research instrument included the Sociodemographics characteristics questionnaire, Health Literacy Management Scale (HeLMS), and Social Support Scale (SSRS). The construction of the SEP index was achieved through the application of principal component analysis. Univariate and hierarchical regression analyses were used to measure the association of health literacy, social support, SEP, and serum uric acid. Furthermore, structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized to examine this association.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>(1) Most patients exhibited low health literacy (90.18 ± 15.11), and only 44.4% possess basic health literacy. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) SEP was positively correlated with SUA (β = 4.086, P&lt; 0.001), health literacy was negatively related to SUA level (β = -0.399, P &lt; 0.001). There was no signi cant relationship between social support and SUA (β = 0.051, P= 1.085). (3) Health literacy mediates the association between SEP and serum uric acid (β = -0.490, 95% CI: -0.620 to -0.382). The direct effect of SEP on SUA and health literacy was 0.723 and 0.696, respectively and the total effect of SEP on SUA was 0.233.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The ndings indicate a low level of health literacy among patients with AHU and suggest that health literacy may play a mediating role in the relationship between socioeconomic position (SEP) and serum uric acid (SUA) levels. Consequently, it is recommended that future initiatives prioritize health literacy and devise appropriate intervention strategies to enhance the self-management capabilities of patients with AHU.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Asymptomatic hyperuricemia (AHU) is a chronic metabolic disorder resulting from an imbalance in purine metabolism, characterized by serum uric acid (SUA) levels exceeding 420 µmol/L (7.0 mg/dL) regardless of gender with a purine diet normally <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The prevalence of hyperuricemia (HUA)was 17.4% in mainland China <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, 17.66% in the United States <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, and 16.3% in Spain <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, which had become a global public health concern and is becoming younger. Due to the absence of apparent symptoms, patients with AHU often lack awareness and proper management of the condition, resulting in low rates of attention (35.29%) and control (8.0%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>. Previous studies have proved that HUA was related to gout and uric acid nephropathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. Recent studies have also demonstrated an association between elevated SUA levels and the risk of stroke, coronary heart disease <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>, diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, and chronic kidney disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. Therefore, it is crucial to control SUA levels in patients with HUA to alleviate the burden of the disease.</p><p>The SUA level of HUA patients is not only related to disease related factors but also affected by other factors such as health literacy, social support, and socioeconomic position.</p><p>Health literacy is de ned as the "ability of person to obtain, process, and comprehend the fundamental health information and services needed to make health decisions" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. Individuals who have adequate health literacy could help one's obtain the knowledge, abilities, and con dence to improve their lifestyle and manage the disease. Evidence demonstrates that inadequate health literacy usually contribute to adverse health outcomes, such as more likely to be obese, have higher comorbidity prevalence, and is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease onset <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. Previous studies supported that chronic conditions were associated with health literacy level, and improve health literacy could become a prospective lever to help patients better self-manage their health <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. The existing literature has also shown that the main reason leading to the discontinuation of urate-lowering drugs among gout patients was poor health literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, and suggested health professionals utilize online booklets to enhance gout health literacy to control SUA level <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. However, health literacy has not been introduced into the research of HUA patients, particularly among AHU patients.</p><p>Social support is de ned as the "social resources that persons perceive to be available or that are provided to them". Studies have demonstrated that greater social support was associated with better self-rated health, and fewer health-impairing behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. Previous studies found social support has a positive relationship with health literacy, and they played a chain mediating effects on education level and medication adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, the self-management of type 1 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. For gout patients, studies have found that their self-management behavior is related to social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. Evidence suggests that social support is independent protective factors for hyperuricemia (OR = 0.944) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. Unfortunately, the relationship of health literacy and social support among patients with AHU in China has not been explored. Moreover, socioeconomic position (SEP) is another important factor in uencing individual health outcomes. Some studies found that low family SEP related to obesity and overweight in children and adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. Other studies corroborate that higher SEP persons had a lower risk of depressive disorder onset <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that providing education improvement programs to AHU patients could signi cantly reduce the SUA level <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>. In existing literature, low SEP has been identi ed as a risk factor for low-level health literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. Some studies showed that education could in uence glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) through health literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Based on the above-mentioned existing literature, health literacy, social support, SEP, and health outcomes are related and have complicated relationships. However, it is still unknown how these variables and their combined effects may affect AHU. And there has been no study exploring the mediation effect of health literacy and SEP for AHU patients using structural equation modeling (SEM). Therefore, this study aims to investigate the status of health literacy, social support, and SUA level, explore the in uencing factors of SUA level, validate the association between health literacy, SEP indicators (education, occupation, and income), and SUA level among AHU patients by constructing SEM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Materials and methods</head><p>All procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the A liated Hospital of Southwest Medical University (KY2022-175). All research participants gave their informed consent and were kept anonymous.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Study design and population</head><p>We conducted a cross-sectional study from March 2022 to September 2022 among the AHU patients in Luzhou City of Sichuan Province, China. The survey used a convenience sampling method to recruit participants from the A liated Hospital of Southwest Medical University Health Management Center and two community health service centers.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were : (1) diagnosis of hyperuricemia by Chinese guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of gout and hyperuricemia 2019; (2) &gt; 18 years of age; (3) having capacity or with the help of the investigator to understand the study and ll in the required research questionnaire; (4) conscious; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> voluntary participation in this study and sign the inform consent.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: (1) those who had a diagnosis of gout; (2) those who were occurred clinical symptoms related to gouts, such as gouty arthritis and tophus; (3) those having a psychotic disorder or disturbance of consciousness; (4) pregnant women; (5) those who combined with serious liver, kidneys and other important organ dysfunction, such as hepatic sclerosis and renal failure; (6) patients with subsequent hyperuricemia (e.g., an inborn error of metabolism, myeloproliferative disorders, malignant tumor).</p><p>The sample size was calculated according to the cross-sectional study formula,</p><p>[28], with a 95% con dence interval, 80% power, and health literacy possession rates of diabetes patients. Taking 13.9% proportion of health literacy possession rates from previous studies and an expected non-response rate of 20% <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. Finally, the sample size was set at &gt; 220.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Study measures</head><p>The questionnaire includes sociodemographic characteristics, disease-related information, and two scales selected according to the research purpose. Sociodemographic characteristics include age, gender, place of residence, living type, marital status, and the ability to pay for medical payments. Disease-related information: the number of comorbidities and hyperuricemia duration.</p><p>Socioeconomic position (SEP) SEP was measured by education, occupation, and family per capita monthly income. Education level was categorized as follows: primary school or below; junior high school; high school or Special Secondary; junior college; bachelor's degree or higher. According to the Family Socioeconomic Status Rating Scale compiled by Baoguo S and Jiliang S <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, occupation was classi ed into 5 levels: casual workers, the unemployed and agricultural laborers; manual workers and the self-employed; clerical workers; professional and technical staff; senior managers. Patients reported family per capita monthly income using 5 answer options (1 = less than RMB 2000; 2 = RMB 2001-3000; 3 = RMB 3001-4000; 4 = RMB 4001-5000; 5 = over RMB 5001). Principal component analysis was used to construct the SEP index. Bartlett's test of sphericity was signi cant (P &lt; 0.001) and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value is 0.688. The rst component explained 77.383% of the total variation. Health Literacy Management Scale (HeLMS) In this study, a health literacy scale for chronic patients was used. The HeLMS was developed by Jordan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> and translated by Sun <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. It contains 24 items and each item has ve options ranging from 1 (with great di culty or very unwilling) to 5 (with no problem or very willing). The ability to procure information, communication and interaction ability, health improvement willingness, and economic support willingness were measured respectively. The nal score ranged from 24 to 120 points with a higher score indicating a higher health literacy level, and respondents who correctly answered 80% or more of the survey content (≥ 96 points) were considered to possess basic health literacy. In this study, Cronbach's alpha of the scale is 0.930, and the KMO value is 0.915, which means relatively good reliability and validity.</p><p>Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> The SSRS includes 10 items, and has 3 dimensions: objective support, subjective support, and support utilization. The scale was developed and validated by Chinese scholar Shuiyuan Xiao and was used to evaluate the types and levels of social support received by the elderly. The total score ranged from 7-56, and the scores of &lt; 20, 20-30, 30 and above represented low, medium, and high levels of social support, respectively. Higher scores mean higher levels of social support. Cronbach's alpha of the overall scale was 0.716.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Data collection</head><p>The one-for-one, face-to-face interviews were conducted by investigators who had received adequate training before the questionnaire. During the formal survey, the purpose, signi cance, and content of the study were explained to all patients and written informed consent was obtained. If patients couldn't ll in the questionnaire by themselves, they completed it with the help of investigators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Statistical analysis</head><p>Data were entered twice independently using EpiData software (version 3.0, EpiData Association, Odense, Denmark). Data analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0 ( IBM SPSS Statistics, USA) and AMOS 24.0. The numerical variables were expressed as mean (SD) for normal distribution and as the median and interquartile range for non-normal distribution. The categorical variables are expressed as n (%) and compared by the chi-squared test. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to construct the SEP comprehensive index. The association among study variables was analyzed using the Spearman rank correlation method. Hierarchical regression models was used to analyzed the effects of SEP, social support, health literacy on SUA level. The direct and indirect relationships among variables were estimated by structural equation modeling (SEM), tting by the maximum likelihood estimation method. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered signi cant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Missing Data</head><p>Variables missing &gt; 15% of data were excluded from analyses. A total of 381 questionnaires were sent out and 349 valid questionnaires were collected; the validity rate was 91.60%. For categorical variables, missing data was replaced with mode. For continuous variables, missing data of normally distributed data were replaced with mean, and median (for non-normally distributed data).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>This study is the rst to investigate the status of health literacy in patients with AHU in China and the results show that 155 (44.4%) of the subjects possess basic health literacy. Besides, this is the rst study that, to our knowledge, constructs SEM to examine the pathway between health literacy, SEP, and SUA. The ndings show that health literacy plays a mediation role between SEP and SUA.</p><p>In this study, the mean health literacy score of AHU patients was 90.18 15.11, meaning the health literacy of the sample was inadequate. However, the health literacy level of AHU patients is higher than that of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (87. <ref type="bibr">20 17.20)</ref> and diabetes (88.83 12.57) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>. Considering that most respondents included in this study were urban residents (71.9%), and their education level was generally medium and above, which may explain the higher health literacy. Besides, the patients volunteered to participate, and we offered incentives in the survey, which could bias the results. Despite this, the majority of AHU patients lack health literacy, which may be due to the asymptomatic hyperuricemia without clinical manifestation and there is a lack of awareness and management about related disease knowledge, even primary healthcare physicians <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>. As we all know, the higher health literacy, the better self-management. Thus, it is important to further improve the health literacy level of AHU patients, strengthen the continuing education and reinforce the management of chronic diseases about AHU for primary healthcare physicians.</p><p>The results of our study revealed that health literacy was negatively related to SUA level. A Study found that enhancing health literacy has been considered a possible intervention target to improve patients' self-care behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. A study demonstrated that health literacy signi cantly and positively correlated with physical exercise, diet, and sleep <ref type="bibr">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. Individuals with higher health literacy would be more likely to perform health behaviors by using health information, pay attention to health status, and have more con dence to manage their SUA level. Possibly, other factors also contribute to the disparities in SUA. For example, a healthy lifestyle is bene cial for decreasing the level of SUA. Some studies showed that drinking alcohol, high BMI, and central obesity are risk factors for HUA <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>. Even though other factors may play a role, our study still indicated that health literacy may serve as a key predictor of self-management of SUA level among patients with AHU. Health literacy includes four core elements: knowledge, attitude, skill, and behavior, education must be transformed into individuals' cognition and attitude, and then fed back on one's skills and behaviors. Health literacy is the result of understanding and utilizing health-related information. In the case of patients with AHU, health literacy presents the ability and channels to capture knowledge to some extent, which in return act on one's behavior, efforts, and management to SUA.</p><p>Interestingly, our study evidenced that health literacy plays a mediating role in the relationship between SEP and SUA. In addition, we found that high SEP was associated with high SUA levels, which is consistent with a study in the general Korean population <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>. This may be related to the individual's diet habits and lifestyle. Patients with higher SEP have easier access to processed foods and high-energy foods, which increases the risk of metabolic disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. Meanwhile, those with high SEP may favor processed food consumption more than their peers because of lacking knowledge about nutrition and more work-related entertainment. Therefore, HUA patients with high SEP are more likely to be discovered during routine medical examinations. SEP can improve health literacy among AHU patients, thereby reducing the level of SUA. And health literacy is ± ± ± more easily modi ed than socio-economic status, thus this research suggests an intervention that may improve the SUA level of patients.</p><p>The mean score of social support was 42.15, which showed that AHU patients received medium social support, and the proportion of individuals with high-level social support was 42.7%. The reason for this phenomenon may be that the patients of our study are middle-aged and elderly people, and caring for grandchildren in uences their social participation. So, their social support is mainly from family members, lacking support from friends, organizations, and professional medical personnel. Prior research ndings showed that increased social support was related to lower SUA levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. And patients with low-level social support are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and have a higher risk of high blood pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref>. Thus, it deserves to pay attention to the insu cient social support available to AHU patients, especially elderly patients.</p><p>In our study, the zero-order correlations showed that social support was signi cantly positively correlated with SUA, but was not signi cant after controlling for numerous confounders. The results is consistent with a study's ndings, which was investigated in Mexican-origin families <ref type="bibr">[46]</ref>. Thus, this study did not include social support as a mediate variable in the SEM. But, the effectiveness of social support in improving health outcomes is increasingly obvious <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>. Additionally, that higher social support was linked to improved health literacy is consistent with a prior study <ref type="bibr">[48]</ref>. Given the modi able nature of social support, different interventions can be taken to enhance social support, such as education, physical exercise, group activities, and so on. Future research should focus on understanding how interventions might be applied to lessen health disparities.</p><p>Our study did have some limitations. Firstly, the sample of this study was selected mainly from the community using convenience sampling method, moreover, the sample is middle-aged and elderly people mostly which limits generalizability. Secondly, the SEP indicators (education, income, and occupation) were self-reported by the participants, which may be in uenced by the subjective perception of patients, overestimating or underestimating the results. Thirdly, the HeLMS used in this study measured general chronic health literacy, rather than hyperuricemia-speci c health literacy. Future research could use a larger random sample and speci cally develop a health literacy scale for HUA patients. In addition, it will be important to explore the multiple mediating roles on health outcomes among patients with HUA, such as lifestyle factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, our study indicated that the AHU patients had low health literacy and health literacy may serve as a pathway by which SEP affects SUA level. But social support was not signi cantly associated with SUA. Measures should be taken to improve health literacy to enhance patient self-management and medical staff continuing education. Next, implementing health literacy screening and tailored interventions for patients will ultimately contribute to improving health literacy and decreasing the SUA level of patients.
