<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Objectives: To explore the in uencing factors and relationships associated with decisional con ict of dialysis modality in ESKD patients.</p><p>Methods: This study was a survey-based cross-sectional investigation conducted on 150 ESKD patients in a third-class hospital in Wuhan. The general information questionnaire, decisional con ict scale, Montreal cognitive assessment, frail scale, perceived social support scale, and brief health literacy screen were used for investigation. SPSS 25.0 was used to compare the differences between the decisional and non-decisional con ict groups, and AMOS 23.0 was used to construct a structural equation model to explore the in uencing factors.</p><p>Results:The incidence of decisional con ict in 150 ESKD patients was 33.3% (50/150). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the independent risk factors for decisional con ict of dialysis modality in ESKD patients included monthly household income (OR = 0.184), cognitive function (OR = 7.0), social support (OR = 0.891), health literacy (OR = 0.608), the level of eGFR (OR = 1.488), and the level of cTnI (OR = 9.558). The constructed path analysis model had a good t (x2/df = 1.499, GFI = 0.957, AGFI = 0.911, NFI = 0.906, CFI = 0.967, RMSEA = 0.055). The path analysis showed that health literacy (0.577) had the greatest impact on the decisional con ict, with a direct effect of 0.480 and an indirect effect of 0.097 through cognitive function and monthly household income. Next was social support with an effect value of 0.434.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is associated with signi cant mortality, morbidity, and impaired quality of life <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> . Globally, the incidence of ESKD continues to rise <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> . A national epidemiological study in China showed an increasing incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with the prevalence of progression to end-stage renal disease reaching 442.13 per million <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> . The progression from chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal disease poses great challenges for patients, most of whom approaching ESKD require renal replacement therapy to sustain life. Haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) are the two primary renal replacement therapies for patients with ESKD <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> . According to the China Kidney Disease Data Network report, CKD patients are characterized by a "high prevalence and low awareness rate," with 91% of ESKD patients choosing haemodialysis and only 9% undergoing peritoneal dialysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> . Although clinical practice guidelines advocate the use of shared decision-making (SDM) in patients with end-stage kidney disease, providing treatment modality information and assisting in clarifying their values and preferences aims to facilitate informed decision-making. However, it is concerning that 40% of patients continue to make choices without certainty regarding their long-term prognosis <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> . This suggests that patient goals, values, and preferences are not su ciently considered during the decision-making process. Furthermore, medical personnel, often adhering to a paternalistic ideology, dominate decisionmaking communication, resulting in limited patient participation and a passive approach to decisionmaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> .</p><p>North American Nursing Association de nes decisional con ict as a state of uncertainty about actions to prevent risk, loss, or challenges to individual values <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref> . Different renal replacement treatment modalities have their own advantages and disadvantages. Survival comparisons between both modalities do not appreciably differ. The majority of ESKD patients are medically t for either HD or PD. Peritoneal dialysis minimally in uences patients' lifestyle; however, it requires pro cient operational skills and a suitable environment, as improper execution may result in complications such as peritonitis and catheter wound infection. Conversely, haemodialysis, administered by healthcare professionals, offers a relatively secure procedure with a high dialysis clearance rate. Nonetheless, it can restrict patients' work and life schedules, diminishing their sense of life control and overall happiness. However, due to the lack of dialysis preparation and heavy treatment burden, patients face uncertainty in choosing a dialysis modality, leading to decision-making con ict. This con ict occurs during decision-making and continues until after treatment decisions are made. Inconsistent patient decision preferences and actual decisions lead to decreased patient treatment compliance and quality of life, and even unnecessary doctor-patient con icts, ultimately negatively impacting medical outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> .</p><p>There is limited research on the determinants in uencing decision con ict in dialysis choice among ESKD patients. Several socioeconomic elements, including neighborhood poverty, employment, insurance, and educational attainment, impact ESKD patients' progression through decisional con icts. A small sample report in the US indicated that individuals with lower decision self-e cacy, no predialysis education, lower dialysis knowledge, and perceived lower professional support reported higher decisional con ict when choosing a dialysis modality <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> . Other studies have linked male gender, age (45 or older), low self-e cacy, knowledge, social support, and emotional quality of life (QOL) to higher decisional con ict <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> . Singapore scholar Zack <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref> found that the overall prevalence of severe decisional con ict was 27.5% (n = 190), with only the health literacy domains of FCCHL Communicative and HLQ Active Engagement remaining signi cant in the multivariable model.</p><p>Studies have shown that support from family, friends, or healthcare providers is crucial for patients in making decisions about dialysis modality [19]. Additional research has demonstrated a positive correlation between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and an increased susceptibility to cognitive dysfunction, with the severity of kidney disease exacerbating this association <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref> . Speci cally, investigations have revealed that cognitive dysfunction among end-stage renal disease patients can reach levels as high as 27-67% <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> . In 2018, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) conference proposed changing the term 'adequate dialysis' to 'goal-directed dialysis'. This term speci cally refers to the use of shared decision-making between the patient and the care team to set realistic care goals, enabling the patient to achieve their life goals and the clinician to provide individualized, high-quality dialysis care. Depending on the patient's cognitive function, health literacy, numeracy, socioeconomic status, and initial dialysis experience, goal-directed dialysis may need to be tailored. However, the validation of other associated factors, such as cognitive function, within the context of CKD remains unestablished. It is important to acknowledge that these factors are inevitable and can potentially impact the decision-making process regarding the choice of dialysis modality in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).</p><p>Previous studies on decision con ict of dialysis modality in ESKD patients have mainly concentrated in Southeast Asian countries and the United States. However, due to differences in nancial, cultural, educational, and health systems, the use of this modality varies considerably across countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> . Despite health literacy, cognition, frailty, and social support being associated with decisional con ict outcomes, their inter-relationships remain unclear, as prior work has only examined these factors in isolation. The objective of this study was to conduct a cross-sectional investigation into the prevalence of decisional con ict regarding dialysis modality in ESKD patients, based on the con ict theory model (CTM). We utilized path analysis modeling to analyze the factors in uencing this con ict. The aim was to develop tailored decision-making assistance plans that can serve as a reference for improving the clinical decision-making challenges faced by these patients. Additionally, these plans aim to facilitate shared decision-making among medical staff, patients, and their family members, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes for patients.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Study design and setting</head><p>This cross-sectional study recruited patients from the department of nephrology in a tertiary-level general hospital in Wuhan. The study was approved by the hospital's research ethics board (Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College,Huazhong University of Science and Technology).Results are reported following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines for cross-sectional studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Participants</head><p>The study population comprised patients admitted between May 2023 and August 2023. Inclusion criteria included: (1) diagnosis of Stage 4 or 5 CKD; (2) suitability for peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis treatment; (3) having made a dialysis mode decision within the past six months, with either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis clearly selected; and (4) informed consent provided by each patient. Exclusion criteria were: (1) kidney transplant status or a history of kidney transplant; (2) presence of obvious mental illnesses, psychological illnesses, intellectual disabilities, preventing cooperation in completing the survey questionnaire; and (3) contraindications to peritoneal dialysis, such as colostomy, nephrostomy, abdominal trauma or surgery, intestinal obstruction, or contraindications to hemodialysis, such as severe shock, heart failure, and active bleeding.</p><p>Given that sixteen independent variables were included in the logistic regression analysis, and accounting for ve to ten times the number of independent variables (while also considering 20% potentially invalid data), the minimum sample size for the structural equation model is recommended to be 15 per measurement variable. The estimated sample size ranged from 90 to 200; the nal sample consisted of 159 patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Data collection and management</head><p>The study questionnaires included questions on demographics (age, gender, body mass index, marital status, educational level, work status, monthly household income, living site, alcohol consumption history, smoking history, childbearing history) and laboratory assay values (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate, blood creatinine, hemoglobin, Cardiac troponin I), as well as the Decisional Con ict Scale (DCS), the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the FRAIL Scale, and the Brief Health Literacy Screen. Laboratory assay values were abstracted from medical records. The electronic "Questionnaire Star" tool (<ref type="url" target="https://www.wjx.cn/">https://www.wjx.cn/</ref>) was used to distribute questionnaires and collect data from participants.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1">Decisional con ict scale (DCS)</head><p>The DCS measured participants' decisional con ict in choosing dialysis modalities. This scale contained ve dimensions with a total of 16 items. Participants responded on a 5-point Likert-type scale (0 = strongly agree to 4 = strongly disagree). Total DCS scores and subscale scores were calculated according to the DCS manual. Total scores (0-64) were converted to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating higher decisional con ict. Scores below 25 were associated with the ability to implement a decision. The established cut-off of 37.5 was used to identify severe decisional con ict <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref> . The DCS has been validated in several languages, including Mandarin <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref> , a key consideration for this study, and showed good reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.91).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2">The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</head><p>The MoCA is a brief cognitive screening tool for mild cognitive impairment. The maximum total score is 30 points, with a 1-point correction for individuals with 12 years of education or less. A score of 26 or above is considered normal, while a score lower than 26 is suggested as the optimal cut-off for a diagnosis of cognitive impairment. The MoCA has excellent test-retest reliability (correlation coe cient = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001) and adequate internal consistency, with a Cronbach's α of 0.83 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.3">FRAIL Scale</head><p>Frailty was assessed using the FRAIL scale, which includes ve components: Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illness, and Weight Loss. The presence of each characteristic scores 1, and absence scores 0. The FRAIL score ranges from 0 to 5, with scores of 0 being robust, 1-2 pre-frail, and 3-5 frail <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.4">Perceived social support scale (PSSS)</head><p>The Perceived Social Support Scale measures social support with 12 items across three dimensions: family support, friend support, and other support <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> . Each item is scored from 1 to 7 (7 levels from strongly agree to strongly disagree), with a score range of 12 to 84 points. Higher scores indicate higher levels of social support. This scale is widely used nationally and internationally and has good reliability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.5">Brief Health Literacy Screen (BHLS)</head><p>Developed by Chew in the United States, the Brief Health Literacy Screen (BHLS) contains only three questions, taking 1-2 minutes to complete. It has been con rmed in the United States, France, Germany, and other countries for quickly screening people with insu cient health literacy in clinical settings. A BHLS score ≤ 9 suggests inadequate health literacy, while a score ≤ 11 indicates limited health literacy <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Statistical methods</head><p>Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive analyses were performed to present continuous variables as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median with interquartile range (IQR), and categorical variables as percentages. The factors affecting decisional con ict were analyzed using binary logistic regression and path analysis to explore the internal relationships between variables. The model was analyzed using AMOS 23.0, and the path analysis diagram was drawn. The nal path analysis model was obtained through continuous correction of the model tting degree. The t of the multivariate logistic regression models was assessed using Hosmer-Lemeshow tests, with a p-value &gt; 0.05 indicating a good t.  A binary logistic regression model was used to analyze the factors in uencing decisional con ict, with the presence or absence of decisional con ict as the binary dependent variable (no decisional con ict was coded as 0, and decisional con ict as 1). Factors with p &lt; 0.05 in the univariate analyses were included in the binary logistic regression model, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Monthly household income, MoCA score (OR = 7.0), PSSS score (OR = 0.891), the level of eGFR (OR = 1.488), and the level of cTnI (OR = 9.558) were all signi cant in uencing factors for decisional con ict in ESKD patients (p &lt; 0.05). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Path of in uencing factors for decisional con ict</head><p>The factors affecting decisional con ict were incorporated into the path analysis model. The overall tting effect of this model was as follows in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>: χ²/df = 1.499, GFI = 0.957, AGFI = 0.911, NFI = 0.906, CFI = 0.967, RMSEA = 0.055. The model parameters indicated that the tting effect of the model was acceptable. The model was continuously revised based on the model tting degree, and the nal in uencing factors for decisional con ict included in the path analysis were family monthly income, the level of eGFR, the level of cTnI, the score of FRAIL, the score of MoCA, and the score of PSSS. The total effect on decisional con ict was predominantly health literacy, with an effect value of 0.577 (direct effect 0.480, indirect effect 0.097), followed by social support, with an effect value of 0.434 (direct effect 0.434). The detailed decomposition of the effect value of each in uencing factor is presented in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.</p><p>The path analysis is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>With the increasing popularity of shared decision-making and the protection of patients' rights and interests, medical institutions encourage patients to participate in decision-making and pay attention to patients' attitudes and views on medical care decision-making. Decisional con ict is one of the problems in this process. In this study, the total score of decisional con ict was 33.0 ± 17.3, with 33.4% of patients in the high level, which is slightly higher than international results.</p><p>Many studies on decisional con ict in ESKD patients have shown that various factors affect decisional con ict, and different countries and even different regions within the same country have different in uencing factors. According to the absolute value of the path coe cient, the factors affecting decisional con ict were ranked in descending order of in uence: health literacy &gt; social support &gt; monthly family income &gt; eGFR &gt; cTnI &gt; cognitive function. The World Health Organization de nes health literacy as an individual's ability to seek, understand, and use health-related information to promote and maintain health <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref> . This literacy plays a pivotal role, both directly and indirectly, in reducing decisional con ict. The decision-making process is inherently tied to a patient's perception of their illness and their level of health literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref> . Speci c health literacy skills, such as evaluating information and interaction/communication, have shown signi cant correlations with clinical outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref> . These skills are crucial for patient engagement in care and decision-making processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> .</p><p>In this study, our results from the logistic binary regression model showed that the incidence of decisional con ict in ESKD patients with cognitive impairment was seven times higher than in those without cognitive impairment. Studies have demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[35]</ref> that CKD increases the risk of cognitive dysfunction, and it is related to the severity of kidney disease. In particular, the overall prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in ESKD patients is as high as 27-67% <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref> . Patients with cognitive impairment often cannot make choices for themselves. The decision aid used in this study facilitated the decisionmaking process for substitute decision-makers of cognitively impaired patients by decreasing decisional con ict and increasing knowledge. The importance of family involvement in medical decision-making and symptom assessment should also be recognized. This study found that health literacy affected cognitive function, consistent with other research studies. Patients with high health literacy are often more likely to have good work experience, health care awareness, etc., which are protective factors for cognitive function <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[37]</ref> . In controlled neuropsychological assessments, individuals with lower health literacy are more prone to experience negative psychological states, such as tension, which subsequently in uence test outcomes and contribute to lower scores on the MoCA assessment. To address this issue, nursing personnel can motivate patients with limited educational backgrounds to engage in activities that enhance their cognitive reserve, such as reading, listening to music, and participating in physical exercise <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref> . Additionally, it is crucial to provide comprehensive information to these patients prior to cognitive function evaluations to mitigate the impact of their emotional uctuations on test results.</p><p>The severity of nephrology conditions is primarily based on the estimated glomerular ltration rate (eGFR) of serum creatinine. A novel discovery of this study is the nding that the levels of eGFR were negatively correlated with decisional con ict in ESKD patients. The cTnI is a highly sensitive and speci c marker of myocardial injury and correlates with the severity of myocardial damage. Overall, the levels of cardiac troponin and eGFR re ect the severity of the disease. ESKD patients combined with myocardial injury tend to experience more severe disease and higher decision-making con ict. The Kidney Disease:</p><p>Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Controversies Conference <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref> recommended covering a transition care time window of at least 90 days before dialysis. Before initiating dialysis, there is a long window period to delay disease progression and adequately educate the patient. The transitional care unit (TCU) provides patient-centered medical education and psychosocial support for predialysis patients, leading to a more moderate, robust dialysis initiation process and more bene cial patient outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref> . In conclusion, efforts should be made to develop transitional care in the Chinese culture to improve patient preparedness for the transition of treatment modalities and to reduce decision con ict.</p><p>The social support of ESKD patients, especially family support, is an important in uencing factor for decisional con ict <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[41]</ref> . This study's ndings indicate a signi cant correlation between decision con ict and social support, with patients experiencing higher levels of social support reporting lower levels of decisional con ict. The presence of family and social support provides patients with additional resources and guidance during the decision-making process, ultimately reducing stress and mitigating decisional con ict. In the context of China's traditional social culture, family members are one of the main sources of social support for patients, with elderly patients' family members primarily being spouses and children. When ESKD patients are confronted with treatment recommendations from doctors, they often discuss with their family members, seeking their opinions and attitudes to alleviate the burden and uncertainty of making decisions independently and mitigating decision-making con icts. This implies that Chinese healthcare professionals should holistically consider factors pertaining to patients' families, assess the level of familial support, actively harness support from families, and promote the involvement of patients and their families in decision-making discussions, thereby facilitating the optimization of the decision-making process for patients. Notably, Rini's study highlights the bidirectional nature of family in uence on patient decision-making, suggesting that negative discouragement from family members may also contribute to decisional con ict <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[42]</ref> .</p><p>Monthly household income greatly in uences decisional con ict. The higher the monthly family income, the lower the incidence of decisional con ict; these ndings are consistent with other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[43]</ref> .</p><p>Studies have shown that economic level can affect the decision process, in uencing decision preferences and impacting values and expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[44]</ref> . The treatment cost for ESKD patients is high, and many are unable to return to society, leading to a heavy medical burden. Due to variations in individual characteristics, quantifying the risk associated with dialysis modalities becomes challenging, prompting patients to reconsider their treatment options upon realizing the considerable uncertainty surrounding treatment outcomes and economic implications. Patients with higher incomes bear a relatively lighter nancial burden during disease treatment, leading to reduced adverse emotional experiences and a greater likelihood of favorable outcomes. Consequently, healthcare departments at all levels should work to enhance the medical insurance system, decrease healthcare expenses, and address the economic concerns of patients to improve their overall well-being.</p><p>This study analyzed the factors affecting decisional con ict in ESKD patients and provided a further theoretical basis for clinical intervention. However, it has certain limitations. First, it used a crosssectional design for data collection, which brings into question the issue of causality. Second, the ndings may not be generalizable as the study was conducted at a single site with a limited sample size. Lastly, other clinical factors not included in this study might also in uence the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The situation of decisional con ict in ESKD patients is not optimistic, with issues such as decisionmaking delay and regret being prevalent. The less health literacy and social support a patient has, along with lower monthly family income, and the worse their cognitive function and kidney disease, the more severe the impairment of decisional con ict becomes. Additionally, through path analysis, the weight of each in uencing factor on decisional con ict has been identi ed. This is conducive to constructing patient decision aids and interventions suitable for China, following the Ottawa Decision Support framework. Such aids and interventions can effectively reduce the decisional con ict of patients. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figures</head><label></label><figDesc>Figures</figDesc></figure>
