<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Understanding the relationship between multiple traits is fundamental in soybean breeding programs because their primary goal is to maximize multiple traits simultaneously, either directly or indirectly. Typically, multitrait studies are conducted using a multi-trait version of a genome-wide association study (GWAS). However, this approach does not account for phenotypic interrelationships between traits. Therefore, we applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore the interrelationship between traits related to morphology (pod thickness -PT) and yield traits (number of pods -NP, number of grains -NG, and hundred grains weight -HGW). We used a dataset containing 96 soybean individuals genotyped with 4,070 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The phenotypic network was modeled using the hill-climbing algorithm, and the structural coefficients were estimated using the SEM approach. According to the sign of the structural coefficient, we identified positive or negative phenotypic interrelationships. We found negative interrelationships between NG and HGW, positive interrelationships between NP and NG, and between HGW and PT. Among these traits, NG, HGW and PT showed indirect SNP effects. In the SEM-GWAS study, we found quantitative trait loci that jointly controlled some and all of the traits. We identified nine candidate genes (i. serine-threonine kinase; ii. protein DA1-related 2; iii. β-1,3-glucanase-like; iv. MYB-like DNA-binding; v. amino acid transporter; vi. Leucine-rich repeat; vii. squamosa promoter-binding-like; viii. monothiol glutaredoxin-s14, and ix. dynamin) that simultaneously acted in the traits. In summary, the SEM-GWAS approach revealed novel relationships among soybean traits, such as PT, thus contributing to soybean breeding programs. * 𝐲 𝐏𝐓 * ] 𝒕 is the vector of adjusted phenotypes for t traits (t = 4), 𝐗 𝐍𝐏 , 𝐗 𝐍𝐆 , 𝐗 𝐇𝐆𝐖 and 𝐗 𝐏𝐓 are the incidence matrices (only including the intercepts) for t traits; [𝐛 𝐍𝐏 𝐛 𝐍𝐆 𝐛 𝐇𝐆𝐖 𝐛 𝐏𝐓 ] 𝑡 is the vector of the mean effects for t traits; 𝐙 𝐍𝐏 , 𝐙 𝐍𝐆 , 𝐙 𝐇𝐆𝐖 and 𝐙 𝐏𝐓 are the incidence matrices associating 𝐠 𝐍𝐏 , 𝐠 𝐍𝐆 , 𝐠 𝐇𝐆𝐖 and 𝐠 𝐏𝐓 with 𝐲 𝐍𝐏 * , 𝐲 𝐍𝐆 * , 𝐲 𝐇𝐆𝐖 * and 𝐲 𝐏𝐓 * ; [ 𝐠 𝐍𝐏 𝐠 𝐍𝐆 𝐠 𝐇𝐆𝐖 𝐠 𝐏𝐓] 𝑡 is the vector of additive genetic effect for t traits, and [ 𝐞 𝐍𝐏 𝐞 𝐍𝐆 𝐞 𝐇𝐆𝐖 𝐞 𝐏𝐓] 𝑡 is the vector of model residuals for t traits.

Although the univariate GWAS methodology is the most commonly used in a breeding program, multiple correlated traits are often studied simultaneously. Another approach that allows the detection of genomic regions involved in linkage or pleiotropy is multivariate GWAS (MTM -GWAS). However, both univariate and multivariate GWAS approaches do not allow us to study the interrelationship between traits.</p><p>Given these limitations, some multivariate GWAS approaches have been developed to assess the association between traits. Shim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> proposed a methodology based on Bayes factor (mvBIMBAM). Gianola and Sorensen <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> , Momen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> , and Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> used structural equation in the context of GWAS (SEM-GWAS).</p><p>The SEM-GWAS approach can account for trait interactions and partition single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects into effects from the trait itself (direct) and from other related traits (indirect). Thus, the objectives of this study were to: (1) estimate genetic components for important traits in soybean, (2) use Bayesian network approaches to estimate a phenotypic network reflecting the interrelationship among traits, and (3) use SEM-GWAS approaches to estimate direct and indirect SNP effects.</p></div>

The narrow sense heritabilities were 0.89 (0.73, 1.00), 0.79 (0.44, 1.00), 0.39 (0.14, 0.67), and 0.45 (0.24, 0.66) for NP, NG, HGW, and PT, respectively. The genomic correlations were 0.96 (0.82, 1.00), -0.84 (-0.99, -0.55), -0.54 (-0.78, -0.28), -0.88 (-0.99, -0. </p></div>

Thus, NP was not influenced by any upstream traits, while NG was directly influenced by NP, HGW was directly influenced by NG and indirectly by NP through NG, and PT was directly influenced by HGW and indirectly by NP and NG.  </p></div>

The magnitude of the estimated structural coefficient values was small, suggesting that the role of upstream traits in mediating SNP effects of downstream traits was marginal.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genetic parameters</head><p>All genomic correlations were significant, whereas only the residual correlation between HGW and PT was significant according to HPD. The narrow sense heritability estimates were moderate to high for NP (0.89±0.09), NG (0.79±0.18), HGW (0.39±0.14), and PT (0.45±0.11).</p><p>The heritability estimates for NP and NG were similar to those found in the literature. Our heritability estimate for HGW differed from the literature, possibly because we used a different estimation method. No heritability results were found in the literature for PT. According to Aditya et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> , using a database of 31 genotypes of G. max (L.) Merrill, a heritability estimate of 0.81 was found for NP. Ghiday et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> , using 22 promising genotypes from IITA/Nigeria, found a heritability estimate of 0.93 for NP. Del Conte et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> , using 34 𝐹 1 soybean populations in a path analysis, found a heritability for NP of 0.83. For NG, Ghiday et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> reported a heritability of 0.98. Similarly, Del Conte et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> and de Albuquerque et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> reported heritability estimates of 0.70 and 0.59, respectively. For HGW, Bisinotto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> , reported a heritability estimate of 0.77 using 31 lines from a breeding program.</p><p>The genomic correlation estimates were consistent with those found in the literature. According to Del Conte et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> and Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> , the genetic correlation estimates between NP and NG were 0.87 and 0.88, respectively.</p><p>Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> reported genetic correlations of -0.25 and -0.29 between NP and HGW, and NG and HGW, respectively.</p><p>Silva et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> found a correlation of -0.95 between NG and HGW. The signs of the correlations were identical to those found in this work. However, their estimates differed in magnitude, which could be due to the population and environmental differences from the data in this work. No study was found that showed a correlation with PT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural equation modeling associated to genome-wide association study</head><p>Currently, the opening of immature pods (opening of still green pods and grains in the filling stage) causes production losses in a large area of Brazil and the world. Palharini <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> reported that such an event is related to the genotypes used and water deficit. In view of this finding, a Bayesian network was modeled, showing the links between the phenotypes (NP, NG, and HGW) favorable and unfavorable to PT, related to the susceptibility to pod opening. The structure of the phenotypic network was incorporated into the SEM-based GWAS model to decompose SNP effects into direct effects on the trait and trait-mediated effects upstream in the phenotypic network.</p><p>The effects of the markers partitioned into direct and indirect effects were obtained using SEM-GWAS.</p><p>Our results showed that there was a positive direct effect from NP to NG and HGW to PT, and the indirect from NP to HGW and PT, NG to HGW and NG to PT. The positive interrelationships indicate that the greater the number of pods, the greater the number of grains Also, the greater the weight of a thousand grains, the greater the thickness of the pod. In contrast, the negative interrelationships indicate that the greater the number of grains, the lower the weight of a thousand grains.</p><p>In general, our results suggested that the direct effects of SNPs were greater than the indirect effects for NG and PT. However, we observed that HGW showed a large indirect effect coming from NG (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>), indicating that the total effects of SNPs associated with HGW were moderately influenced by the indirect effect coming from NG. We also observed that some QTLs controlled more than one trait, which is indicative of multiple functionality (Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>). Other studies in the literature also identified QTLs controlling more than one trait in soybean <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and rice <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> , however, other works did not identify such multifunctionality of QTLs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> .</p><p>The functions of 46 candidate genes for NP, NG and HGW were investigated. Among these, some candidate genes control the traits simultaneously. The candidate's genes were highlighted below with their identification, functional annotation and related characteristics (Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>): i. Glyma.01G052600 -serine-threonine protein kinase (NP, NG and HGW); ii. Glyma.02G251800 -protein DA1-related 2 (NP); iii. Glyma.02G253800β-1,3-glucanase-like protein (NP); iv. Glyma.03G183900 -MYB-like DNA-binding protein MYB (NG and HGW); v. Glyma.04G086600 -amino acid transporter (NP); vi. Glyma.04G239000 -leucine rich repeat (lrr_1) // protein tyrosine kinase (pkinase_tyr) // leucine rich repeat n-terminal domain (lrrnt_2) // leucine rich repeat (lrr_8) (NP, NG and HGW); vii. Glyma.05G019000 -squamosa promoter-binding-like protein 15-related (NP); viii.</p><p>Glyma.09G252200 -monothiol glutaredoxin-s14, chloroplastic (NG and HGW) and ix. Glyma.12G242300dynamin (NP and NG). According to Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> , serine-threonine protein kinase is involved in the plant response to a variety of abiotic stresses. Thus, the production efficiency of plants under stress is increased. For protein DA1related 2, Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> reported that the candidate gene is functionally associated with the adaptive radiation of soybeans. Using Arabidopsis, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> characterized DA1 as a ubiquitin receptor, having features such as a wide range of cellular processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> and biological processes, such as abnormal protein degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44</ref> , hormonal signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46</ref> , resistance to disease and abiotic stresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48</ref> , and cell cycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref> . According to Balasubramanianet al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref> , β -1,3-glucanases group of proteins is expressed in plants to withstand abiotic stresses, generally with respect to their expression during pathogen infection and their broadspectrum antimicrobial activity. Callose, a 1,3-βglucan which is a common substrate of 1,3-β-glucanase, is reversibly and transiently deposited in plant cell walls as part of the hypersensitive response to fungi, viruses, and abiotic stresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52</ref> . For MYB-like DNA-binding protein MYB, Du et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53</ref> reported that members of this large gene family may be involved in different plant biological processes, some of which may be potentially involved in legume-specific nodulation. Another function of a listed candidate gene was the amino acid transporter. Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54</ref> , using soybean, identified that this transporter plays an important role in transporting amino acids across cellular membranes and is essential for plant growth and development. In genome-wide analysis using soybean, Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55</ref> found that leucine rich repeat constitutes the largest subfamily of receptor-like kinases in the plant. A number of reports have demonstrated that plant LRR-RLKs play important roles in growth, development, differentiation, and stress responses. Squamosa promoter-binding-like protein was reported by several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62]</ref> . In these studies, the authors identified a broad range of plant biological processes, such as the timing of vegetative phase changes and floral induction, the rate of leaf initiation, shoot regeneration and branching, anthocyanin and trichome production, stress responses, carotenoid biosynthesis, and lateral root development. Monothiol glutaredoxin is known to catalyze the reversible reduction of disulfide bonds utilizing the reducing power of glutathione (GSH) and NADPH-dependent glutathione reductase (GR) and have a role in maintaining and regulating cellular redox homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63</ref> . Finally, regarding the last candidate gene that presents dynamin function, Diers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64</ref> found the same candidate gene (GLYMA.12G242300), which is related to growth and development <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">65</ref> .</p><p>This study used SEM-GWAS to show that most of the genetic effects are the result of the direct effect of the SNP. However, for HGW, we observed a moderate contribution of genetic effects from the SNP influencing NG. Our approach allowed us to better understand the complexity in terms of the interrelationship between the traits. Associating the results to a breeding program scenario, we can see that understanding the existing interrelationships in the trait network makes it possible to outline selection strategies more efficiently, which may result in increases in the gain from selection. In the case of a large direct effect and low correlation between traits, there is an indication that simultaneous selection is the best strategy to use. Also, when there is a large direct effect and a high correlation between traits, there is an indication that indirect selection should be advocated, because most variation in the other trait is determined by the trait in question.</p><p>In conclusion, this was the first work showing an application and the potential of SEM-GWAS in soybean, where it was possible to partition the effects of SNP markers for NP, NG, HGW and PT, and also to identify QTLs with their respective functionalities.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phenotypic data and SNP genotyping</head><p>The phenotypic and genotypic data were collected from the soybean breeding program of the Federal University of Viçosa (in Portuguese, Universidade Federal de Viçosa -UFV). Two experiments were conducted in a greenhouse located in the city of Viçosa -MG (Brazil) (lat. 20°45′17" S lat; long. 42°52′57" W long). The experiment was planted from January to May 2018. The design used was randomized blocks, with 96 soybean genotypes evaluated in 3 blocks. The genotypes evaluated were from different soybean genetic improvement companies with a wide variation in their traits, including different transgenic events (conventional, Roundup Ready, and Intacta RR2BT), growth types (determinate, semi-determinate, and indeterminate), and maturity groups (five to nine). The percentage of open immature pods per plant was evaluated at the R6 development stage (green pods with full kernels) based on the total number of pods. Four traits were evaluated in this work: NPnumber of pods (pods. plant -1 ), NG -number of grains (grains. plant -1 ), HGW -hundred grains weight (g), and</p><p>PTpod thickness (mm). The SNP quality control parameters used were call rate (≥ 95%) and minor allele frequency (&lt; 5%). Genotyping data of the genotypes were provided by GDM Seeds. Eighty-one and eighteen genotypes were genotyped via genotyping by sequencing at the Institute for Genome Diversity at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) and the Biotechnology Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Wisconsin, USA), respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">66</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phenotypic data analysis</head><p>Prior to GWAS, the phenotypic values were adjusted for systematic effects according to the following statistical model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝐲 = 𝐗𝐮 + 𝐙𝐠 + 𝐖𝐫 + 𝐞,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where 𝐲 is the vector of observed phenotypes, 𝐮 and 𝐫 are the vectors of overall mean (fixed effect) and between block effect (fixed effect), respectively, 𝐠 and 𝐞 are the vectors of genotypic effects (random effect) and model residuals (random effect), respectively. 𝐗, 𝐙 and 𝐖 are the incidence matrices relating 𝐮, g and r, respectively.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S3</ref>) and Geweke tests (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bayesian networks</head><p>The Bayesian Network (BN) was used to assess the relationships between the traits. A Bayesian network can be viewed as a graphical model based on a directed acyclic graph, where nodes (or vertices) represent random variables and arcs (or edges) represent probabilistic dependencies between them <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">70</ref> . In general, a directed acyclic graph is formed by nodes connected by directed edges, where the probability that an edge exists between nodes (strength) and the probability that the edge has a particular direction (direction) can be estimated.</p><p>The Hill Climbing (HC) algorithm, implemented in the bnlearn R package <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">71</ref> was used to estimate a phenotypic network. The HC algorithm finds the best structure of the network by removing arcs and changing their directions. For each edge removal, the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) was computed to infer its relative contribution to the overall BIC of the network. A total of 50,000 bootstrap samples were used to define the strength and direction of each arc. We used the criteria of direction &gt; 50% and strength ≥ 80% to select high-confidence relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multi-trait association analysis (MTM-GWAS)</head><p>MTM-GWAS modeling was performed using the SNP Snappy strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">72</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">74</ref> . The SNP dosage matrix has also been corrected for the population structure, where 23 principal components were used, resulting in approximately 80% of the genetic variability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural equations modeling GWAS (SEM-GWAS)</head><p>SEM-GWAS partitions the total SNP effect into direct and indirect effects using an inferred phenotypic network structure.
