<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose: This study aims to critically investigate the structural relationships between total quality management (TQM), service innovation, and sustainability performance in the public service sector of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Design/methodology/approach: The study employed an online survey to collect data from 400 employees working in eight selected UAE public service sector organisations located in Abu Dhabi. The collected data were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM) to empirically examine whether TQM practices improve service innovation and, subsequently, sustainability performance in the UAE's public service sector. Findings: The results show that TQM has a significant impact on service innovation and sustainability performance in the UAE's public service sector. Additionally, service innovation partially mediates the relationship between TQM and sustainability performance. Practical implications: The public service sector's TQM practices and service innovation in the UAE have a much greater impact on social and environmental sustainability than on economic sustainability performance. Adopting five dimensions of TQM [following the Abu Dhabi Award for Excellence in Government Performance (ADAEP) model] across the UAE's public organisations will enable government departments to deliver innovative services to its beneficiaries. Originality: This study provides a substantial contribution by addressing the gaps in the literature. Very few studies have empirically investigated the possible association between TQM, service innovation, and sustainability performance in public sector organisations, particularly in developing countries such as the UAE, where the increasing efforts in TQM practices are still in their emerging stages, mainly targeting innovative service offerings and sustainable performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Over the last few decades, organisations in the public sector have encountered unprecedented challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Burke and Martin, 2016)</ref>. Issues such as budgetary pressures, the rising demand for financial accountability, and the lack of resources, combined with the dynamic and changing public expectations for services provided by the public sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mättö, 2019)</ref>, as well as sustainability issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abbas, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tasleem et al., 2019)</ref>, require new, high-quality solutions that are different and innovative in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mättö, 2019)</ref>. Sustainability involves suitable response paradigms in respect to economic, social, and environmental responsibilities concerning products, services, processes, and organisational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abbas, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Adams et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Calabrese et al., 2018)</ref>. Improving sustainability performance has, however, been an area of concern for most organisations, including those in the public service sector, as their long-term sustainability has been threatened by various factors, encompassing economic, social, and environmental concerns. These include growing carbon footprints, waste generation, environmental pollution, diminishing water resources, and human rights issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(UAE Government, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Although both the public and private sectors are seeking to outsmart each other by undertaking various quality management initiatives, the private sector is considered to still be ahead in terms of total quality management (TQM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Krishnan, 2016)</ref>. Several studies have indicated the possible association between TQM and sustainability performance in the private sector. For example, the effective execution of TQM influences firms' green innovation significantly <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Li et al., 2018)</ref>, which is a vital dimension of sustainability performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Yu and Huo, 2019)</ref>. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Xie et al. (2019)</ref> stated that firms can introduce environmentally friendly products and services by focusing on processes, which is one of the important components of TQM. In contrast, very few studies have shown the possible impact of TQM practices on sustainability performance in the public sector. Even though some studies in the public sector have been conducted in the felid of TQM and green practices, they have not scrutinised their potential effects on sustainability performance in the public sector. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Wynen et al. (2016)</ref> examined the determinants for the use of TQM techniques in the public sector and found that organisational autonomy and control of results lead to negative results. Further, <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Xie et al. (2019)</ref> recommended that the government sector effectively implement green technology innovation to improve financial performance. However, in line with experiences in private sector organisations, the result of these studies can be generalised to public-sector-related literature in terms of hypothesising that the efficient adoption of TQM and green environmental practices are crucial for improved public service delivery and sustainability performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Wynen et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Xie et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>However, most empirical papers in the field of TQM and sustainability performance have only emphasised a single dimension of sustainable performance, namely the economic dimension. In this context, several empirical studies have examined the connection between TQM practices and financial performance or organisational performance <ref type="bibr">(Dahlgaard et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Nawelwa et al., 2015)</ref>. In contrast, regarding the social dimension of sustainability, relatively few studies have examined the relationship between TQM applications and stakeholder benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abbas, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Lo and Chai, 2012)</ref>. Concerning environmental performance, some empirical studies have found TQM's contribution toward environmental performance, such as green innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Li et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Zhu et al., 2013)</ref>. However, very few studies have empirically investigated the association of TQM and sustainability performance dimensions, such as economic, social, and environmental sustainability in public sector organisations, which reveals a gap that requires further study.</p><p>On the other hand, many quality management techniques are required to enhance existing services <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mättö, 2019)</ref>, implying that TQM could be a better mechanism to produce service innovations. Service innovation is referred to as an innovation that can be seen in numerous scenarios within the service sector that are either developing completely new types of services or enhancing existing services <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Tsai and Wang, 2017)</ref>. As highlighted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Ng (2009)</ref>, innovations and quality management are expected to be interrelated, although empirical studies on service innovation and TQM in both the private and public sectors are still lacking in the existing literature.</p><p>Regarding the above three constructs (TQM, service innovation, and sustainability performance), very few studies have empirically examined the possible impact of TQM and service innovation on sustainability performance in the public sector, either in developed or developing countries such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Extant TQM and innovation literature has highlighted the need to investigate methods for delivery enhancement in organisational efficiency in the public sector that synthesises quality improvement and a path towards innovation generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mättö, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tasleem et al., 2019)</ref>. One promising alternative could hence be a TQM method, accompanied by service innovation creation, which highlights the necessity of empirically investigating both applications in relation to sustainability in the public sector.</p><p>In the context of the UAE, the considerable substantiality issues (UAE Government, 2020) have raised the question of whether the country's public sector organisations are effectively improving their sustainability performance. However, alongside TQM efforts and service innovations in administrative development, the UAE government is also engaged in changing the organisational culture, ethos, and mindsets of public sector employees to prepare organisational environments for the adoption of quality management, innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Mansour and Jakka, 2013)</ref>, and sustainability performance (UAE Government, 2020), both now and in the future. All these efforts in the UAE public sector are, however, in their emerging stages, thus requiring empirical investigation of how their TQM practices can lead to public service innovation and, subsequently, sustainability performance. The lack of empirical evidence in the extant literature also implies the necessity of conducting novel studies to simultaneously investigate the relationships between TQM, service innovation, and sustainability. The above discussions lead to questioning whether the UAE's public service sector organisations' efforts regarding the adoption of TQM practices actually improve their sustainability performance through service innovation. Hence, the present study seeks to answer the following three research questions: RQ1: Do TQM applications within the UAE's public sector significantly and positively affect sustainability performance? RQ2: Is TQM in the UAE's public sector a source of service innovation within the UAE's public sector organisations? RQ3: Does service innovation in the UAE's public sector mediate the relationship between TQM and sustainability performance?</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 details the relevant literature on TQM, service innovation, and sustainability performance, followed by theoretical and hypothesis development. Section 3 discusses the methodology, while the results are presented, analysed, and discussed in Section 4. Section 5 elaborates the contributions of the study, with theoretical and managerial implications provided in Section 6, and limitations and scope for further research discussed in Section 7.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">TQM and sustainability performance</head><p>TQM as a management strategy aims to enhance customer satisfaction and organisational performance by providing high-quality products and services through the participation and collaboration of all stakeholders, teamwork, customer-driven quality, and continuously improving the performance of inputs and processes by applying quality management techniques and tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kristianto et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kuei and Lu, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Isaksson, 2006)</ref>. Sustainability, on the other hand, is defined as the long-term maintenance of systems in accordance with economic, environmental, and social considerations [corporate social responsibilities (CSR)] <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abbas, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Adams et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Partalidou et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Sangwan et al., 2019)</ref>. Theoretical foundations, such as the resource-based view (RBV), can be used to explain the association between TQM and sustainability performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kearney and Berman, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>RBV asserts that an organisation's competitive advantage is derived from the internal resources and capabilities at its disposal. It argues that competitive advantages can be attained provided a firm's resources are valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable (VRIN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Nair and Markowski, 2016)</ref>. RBV has become prevalent as a theoretical view of sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Johnsen et al., 2017)</ref>. TQM, being a resource and a strategy, tends to enhance a firm's performance by encouraging the development of specific assets that are entrenched in the firm's culture by generating both knowledge and a socially multifaceted relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Maravilhas and Martins, 2019)</ref>. Moreover, the ability to effectively respond to economic, social, and environmental responsibilities can be a resource or capability that can lead to a sustained competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hart, 1995)</ref> and, ultimately, sustainable performance. CSR practices embody the greatest opportunities presently available to organisations to achieve greater success through new products, services, and new technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(McWilliams et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Xie et al., 2019)</ref>. Studies have shown that organisations with greater environmental performance also have improved financial performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Russo and Fouts, 1997)</ref>. Hence, these characteristics seem to be related to the fact that firms can achieve sustainability performance through TQM practices that are aligned with CSR.</p><p>As previously stated, most previous empirical papers in the field of TQM and sustainability performance have only emphasised a single dimension of sustainable performance (the economic dimension). Many empirical studies have examined the connection between TQM practices and financial performance or organisational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kassem et al., 2019)</ref>. For example, several authors have theorised the possible impact of TQM on organisational performance in various ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hussain et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Mosadeghrad 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Nawelwa et al., 2015)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Nawelwa et al. (2015)</ref> argued that TQM represents a firm's strategy to enhance organisational performance by delivering high-quality products, services, and processes. They found that TQM practices can help an organisation to improve its performance through teamwork, continuous improvement and training, commitment from management, and employee empowerment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hussain et al. (2019)</ref> revealed that TQM practices are significantly connected with innovation and operational performance. Some studies have asserted that total productive management and TQM practices together can lead to operational performance and, therefore, organisational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Modgil and Sharma, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Sharma and Modgil, 2019)</ref>. By exploring the critical success factors for TQM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Mosadeghrad (2014)</ref> found that sufficient education and training, consistent top management support, supportive leadership, employee involvement, process management, customer focus, and the continuous improvement of processes are the key determinants of successful TQM implementation, thereby enhancing operational and organisational performance. These findings thus show that a high level of organisational performance is expected to be achieved through TQM by improving customerdriven quality and focus, inputs and processes, teamwork, education and training, management support, and leadership. Suárez-Barraza and Alanedo-Rosas (2014) argued that, to preserve a quality environment within an organisation, amongst other aspects, benefits ought to be discovered at the levels of productivity improvement, quality improvement, and cost reductions. Accordingly, it can be argued that these characteristics relate to the conditions that enable firms to achieve sustainable development and competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abbas, 2020)</ref>, and hence economic sustainability and TQM.</p><p>Although very few studies have empirically investigated the association between TQM and sustainability performance in relation to the economic, social, and environmental dimensions, the relationship between TQM and organisational performance has been widely investigated. However, while some studies have revealed a significant effect on organisational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Al-Dhaafri et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dahlgaard-Park et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gomes et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hussain et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Mateos-Ronco and Mezquida, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Mosadeghrad 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Nawelwa et al., 2015)</ref>, other studies have not found any such effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Berman, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dahlgaard et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kearney and Berman, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Melkers and Willoughby, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Wynen et al., 2016)</ref>. Further, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Soltani et al. (2006)</ref> found that most organisations have not achieved any tangible results through TQM. Moreover, the existing literature also elucidates that only one-third of TQM programmes are successful, with the remainder failing owing mainly to the lack of an appropriate organisational culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gimenez-Espin et al., 2013)</ref>, thereby decreasing organisational performance. Previous studies have also found that the lack of organisational culture and organisational structure are the two major reasons for TQM failures <ref type="bibr">(Talapatra and Uddin, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Talapatra et al., 2019)</ref>. Some authors have also stressed that the lack of service innovation can also lead to TQM failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mättö, 2019)</ref>. These studies suggest that organisational performance can be achieved through effective TQM practices.</p><p>On the other hand, regarding the social dimension of sustainability, many empirical studies have examined the relationship between TQM practices and various stakeholder-benefit aspects, including performance relating to customers, employees, and societies (e.g. customer support and service, customer satisfaction, employee relation, peoples' health and safety, etc.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lo and Chai, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mohanty and Lakhe, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Pimentel and Major, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Talapatra et al., 2018)</ref>. For example, by reviewing the core themes in TQM research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Lo and Chai (2012)</ref> argued that the main success factors for TQM implementation are customer satisfaction and service quality measurement, highlighting the implications for TQM on customer performance. Furthermore, to achieve business excellence and performance, organisations must establish top management and leadership support, following four key TQM principles [delighting the customer, people-based management, continuous improvement, and fact-based decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Pimentel and Major, 2016)</ref>], indicating that successful TQM implementation can provide customers and employees with social benefits. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mohanty and Lakhe (2011)</ref> recognised four primary reasons for promoting TQM related to improving: market share and profitability; customer satisfaction; the quality of work (and reducing costs); and employee relations. Here, the first reason is related to economic sustainability and TQM, while the other three reasons are related to TQM and social sustainability in relation of customers and employees. Further, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Talapatra et al. (2018)</ref> explained that integrated TQM systems, complying with ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS 180001, and SA 8000, meet the demands of all stakeholders (including customers, employees, and wider society) by embedding quality, employees' health and safety, social accountability, and environmental processes in a culture of continuous improvement.</p><p>Concerning environmental performance, some empirical studies have found that TQM contributes to environmental performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Wiengarten and Pagell, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Zhu et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Li et al. (2018)</ref> found that the effective TQM implementation affects firms' green innovation significantly. Empirical evidence shows that firms with TQM implementation in line with ISO 9001, linked with the ISO 14001environmental management system, obtain greater advantages compared to their competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Heras-Saizarbitoria and Boiral, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, TQM is also considered as a way to employ all the potential capabilities of employees and managers in performing their jobs and managing an organisation <ref type="bibr">(Marefat and Faridfathi, 2015)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Androwis et al. (2018)</ref>, TQM practices represent the best way to improve organisational performance via competitive advantage dimensions, such as innovation, delivery and time to market, cost, and price. Thus, such improved competitive advantages can lead to optimal sustainability performance. <ref type="bibr">Tasleem et al. (2019)</ref>, on the other hand, asserted that TQM requires a new working culture to be created so that people can learn and share knowledge and provide contributions to sustainability performance. Despite some inconsistent results on the effect of TQM's critical success factors in relation to organisational performance and the lack of research concerning TQM and sustainability performance, existing literature indicates that the adoption of TQM applications can positively influence sustainability performance in the private sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abbas, 2020)</ref>. Based on the above discussion regarding TQM and sustainability performance, the following hypothesis is posited:</p><p>H1: TQM has a significant impact on sustainability performance in the public sector.</p><p>Regarding the elements of TQM, the Abu Dhabi Award for Excellence in Government Performance (ADAEP) model is applied in the current study to identify the effects of TQM on sustainability performance (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The key reason for using this model is that the ADAEP model is identical to the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) excellence model as both models describe leadership, people, policy and strategy, partnership and resources, and process as the key enablers of TQM in relation to organisational performance <ref type="bibr">(Shafiq et al., 2019)</ref>. The EFQM model enabler dimensions are considered as the TQM framework, which have been empirically confirmed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bou-Llusar et al. (2009)</ref>. Another motivation for using this model is that it is the most widely used TQM model in the UAE's public/government sector (Public Sector Excellence, 2016), which highlights the importance of investigating how these elements can influence sustainability performance in the UAE's public sector. As a TQM model, the ADAEP model consists of nine elements: five criteria facilitating the implementation of quality in Abu Dhabi's public sector organisations (leadership, people, policy and strategy, partnership and resources, process); and four measurement criteria assessing the results of TQM implementation (people results, society results, customer results, key performance results).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">TQM and service innovation</head><p>Organisations should synthesise the enhancement of existing services with innovation to use ambidextrous capacity <ref type="bibr">(Gieske et al., 2016)</ref> as this subsequently increases organisational innovation capacity. Many quality management techniques are inevitably linked to enhancing existing services <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mättö, 2019)</ref>. Service process innovations can be defined as: supporting the administrative core; expanding and supporting customer-interfacing processes; supporting functional processes; and supporting inter-organisational processes and operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Lyytinen and Rose, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Manohar et al., 2019)</ref>. Service innovations also include four dimensions: new service concepts (e.g. new types of public sector services, such as smart government services and smart transportation that increase residents' satisfaction); new client interfaces (e.g. more self-service options for customers/residents visiting various government departments, including, for example, water and electricity, the municipality, the road and transportation authority, and the health authority); new service-delivery systems; and new technological options (e.g. public transportation services and their associated metro cards facilitating transactions) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hertog, 2000)</ref>. Several empirical studies have investigated the association between TQM and service innovation, revealing that quality practices can improve service innovation (Khan and Naeem, 2018). However, very few studies have examined the links to the aspects of service innovation.</p><p>According to RBV theory, by implementing TQM practices, a firm can develop distinct resources (TQM as a corporate asset embedded in the organisational culture of the firm, TQM as product-design capability, and TQM as process-improvement capability), which are necessary to develop innovative services to overcome problems that the firm may encounter <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Silva et al., 2014)</ref>. Hence, it is argued that TQM recognises the quality-related problems existing in the organisational execution of quality-improvement methods and processes in the public sector as a way to generate ideas on how to address such problems via service innovations. Therefore, these ideas for improvement, developed by managers or employees, are considered in this study to be a potential type of service innovation that can cross intraorganisational boundaries through the involvement of employees from various professional domains.</p><p>A common denominator can also be recognised by investigating the underlying objectives for innovation and quality management <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gambi et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Georgiev and Ohtaki, 2019)</ref>. Both can then be understood as strategies aiming to deliver superior customer value. Innovation concerns the creation of new values, whereas quality management concerns the constant delivery of these values. Quality assurance, as well as quality improvement, are the key aspects of quality management, whereas innovation denotes the creation of new services, processes, or products <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Ng, 2009)</ref>. Accordingly, we hypothesise: H2: TQM positively affects service innovation within public sector organisations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Service innovation and sustainability performance</head><p>Various studies have investigated the issues related to services themselves, as well as newservice-development processes, such as customer participation and the importance of idea generation, screening, development, and initiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chen et al., 2011)</ref>. Overall, contemporary service firms, such as public sector organisations, are required to implement relevant serviceinnovation strategies and practices to develop scalar business models, monitor staff performance, manage customer experience, provide managerial process innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Tsai and Wang, 2017)</ref>, and ultimately improve sustainability performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Toivonen, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>From the RBV perspective, innovation is regarded as playing a vital role in generating value and sustainable competitive advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Baregheh et al., 2009)</ref>. This study thus argues that a firm's service innovation, along with its CSR capabilities, can enhance its sustainability performance. Several direct impacts of service innovation can be seen at the organisational level. Service innovation can change internal organisational business processes, for example by enhancing service-delivery capacity (Aas and Pedersenb, 2010), thereby also enhancing economic (operational performance) and social sustainability (e.g. customer satisfaction resulting from swift service delivery). Service innovation has the ability to improve the financial performance of an organisation (e.g. improved operating results, reduced operational costs, improved productivity, and increased profitability), reflecting the economic dimension of sustainability <ref type="bibr">(Aas and Pedersenb, 2010)</ref>. It can also change innovative organisational internal capabilities. Moreover, the relationship between other stakeholders can be changed to positively affect customer value and employee relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Lyons et al., 2007</ref>) (e.g. customer satisfaction, customer focus, employee performance, and inventive mechanism), thereby improving social sustainability performance. Service innovation, on the other hand, could have an external impact, such as environmental effects (e.g. environmental thinking, environmental services), in improving environmental performance (environmental sustainability) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Horng et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Løvlie et al., 2008)</ref>. Nonetheless, studies specifically focusing on service innovation and sustainability performance are still scarce <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Calabrese et al., 2018)</ref>. Based on the above discussion, we hypothesise: H3: Service innovation positively drives sustainability performance in the public sector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">TQM, service innovation, and sustainability performance</head><p>In this study, we argue that TQM applications in public sector organisations play a critical role in service innovativeness, and subsequently sustainability performance, through the promotion of new service concepts, new service-delivery systems, new client interfaces, and new technological solutions, which are considered the foremost types of service innovation within the public sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hertog, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>According to the TQM and innovation literature, there is a need to investigate the methods for delivering enhancements in organisational efficiency in the public sector that synthesise quality improvement and a path for innovation generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mättö, 2019)</ref>. One potentially effective approach to achieving this could hence be TQM accompanied by creating service innovation.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Akgün et al. (2014)</ref>, the application of TQM has been related to increased business innovativeness and, ultimately, better financial performance (the economic dimension of sustainability). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Androwis et al. (2018)</ref> stated that TQM practices are the most effective way to improve organisational performance via competitive advantage dimensions, such as innovation. A significant positive relationship between TQM and organisational innovation outcomes was found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Abu-Salim et al. (2019)</ref> in their survey of the UAE's manufacturing and service industries, although the study was limited to the private sector and ignored the service-innovation concept. Some authors have also stressed that the lack of service innovation can also lead to TQM failure, thereby decreasing organisational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mättö, 2019)</ref> and sustainability performance.</p><p>Furthermore, TQM practices and applications help public sector organisations to understand the needs of their stakeholders (such as residents and government and non-governmental institutions), develop new market/network relationships, and benchmark customer and business solutions against customer-or stakeholder-related problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Akgün et al., 2014)</ref>. These activities underpin the public sector's efforts to transform their organisational practices, substitute existing strategies with innovative strategies, and attain improved forms of sustainability in public sector organisations, thereby achieving improved sustainability performance. Accordingly, this study seeks to examine the effectiveness of TQM in the UAE's public sector as a potential source of service innovation, specifically aimed at enhancing its sustainability performance and mitigating problems related to organisational processes. The present study supports the notion that service innovations based on a quality-improvement method (TQM tools) can be further adapted to process improvements and sustainability, specifically in the public sector, which leads to the following hypothesis: H4: Service innovation mediates the relationship between the public sector's TQM applications and sustainability performance.</p><p>The proposed research framework is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Sample and data collection</head><p>The population of the study is the UAE's service-based public organisations. Regarding public service organisations, there are currently 17 ministries and 32 independent government authorities in the UAE (Sarker and Al Athmay, 2017), which represent the population of the study. The study employed a random sampling technique for data collection. Since there are many governmental organisations across the seven emirates of the UAE, the employees of eight public sector service organisations located in Abu Dhabi were randomly selected for the online survey. The eight chosen public sector organisations operate in fields including the municipality, digital government, economics, tourism, finance, transport, police, and land and real estate. Using SurveyMonkey, an online questionnaire was delivered to the employees of the eight chosen public sector organisations until more than 400 responses were gathered. As a result, 430 responses were collected during April-May 2020. The sample size of 430 employees was determined as adequate for structural equation modelling (SEM) as 150-400 is the recommended sample size for SEM <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Measurement and scales</head><p>A five-point Likert scale, ranging from "1" (strongly disagree) to "5" (strongly agree), was used to measure all the study constructs, pertaining to TQM, service innovation, and sustainability performance. Five constructs for TQM (leadership, people, process, strategy and policy, and partnership and resources) were adapted from Abbas (2020), ADAEP (2007), <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Androwis et al. (2018)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Berman (2015)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fatima and Mahaboob, (2018</ref><ref type="bibr">), Ooi (2014</ref><ref type="bibr">), and Shafiq et al. (2017)</ref>. Each of these constructs contained five items. Service innovation was measured through two constructs (product and process innovation, and organisational innovation) adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aasa and Pedersen (2010)</ref>. The three constructs for sustainability performance (environmental, social, economic sustainability performance) were adapted from Abbas  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Data analysis</head><p>Various statistical methods were used for data analysis. First, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed to produce the factor structure relating to the collected data reflecting the items for TQM, service innovation, and sustainability performance. Second, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to test whether the measurement models agreed with both the theoretical and empirical data. Finally, SEM was used to analyse the structural relationships between the constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>, i.e. TQM, service innovation, and sustainability performance (and their subconstructs). For EFA, IBM SPSS 23.0 was used, while for the CFA and SEM testing IBM AMOS 23.0 was employed. The data structuration process is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Exploratory factor analysis</head><p>Initially, the data collected were tested for common method bias and non-response bias. Harman's one-factor test showed that the one-factor solution of the study accounted for less than 50% (38.79%) of the total variation, indicating that common method bias is not an issue in the study. Also, non-response bias concerning the collected data was not observed, as the expected responses from the survey were received during the study's expected timeframe (April-May 2020).</p><p>EFA was then performed to produce the factor structure relating to the collected data reflecting the items of TQM, service innovation, and sustainability performance (and their subconstructs). With 48 questionnaire items, a ten-factor solution with a total variance of 66.95% was generated (see Appendix A). According to <ref type="bibr">Nunnally and Bernstein (1994)</ref>, if an item's factor loading is lower than 0.40 and the absolute difference among its cross-loadings is below 20%, this represents a poor and unclean loading. In view of this, four items (SCL1, SCL5, ECN5, and PDR1) were removed from the study as their loadings are lower than 0.40.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Measurement model</head><p>Reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity were tested to confirm construct reliability and validity. Reliability refers to the internal consistency of the scales, which can be determined through Cronbach's alpha. A Cronbach's alpha value in the excess of 0.70 can be regarded as statistically reliable <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> shows that the Cronbach's alpha values of all constructs exceeded 0.70, indicating that they are statistically reliable. Convergent validity is the degree to which multiple items adopted to measure the same construct are in agreement. Composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE) were used to test the convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hair et al., 2010)</ref>. A CR value in the excess of 0.70 can be considered as statistically significant, while the AVE should exceed 0.50 to be considered statistically significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Zaiţ and Bertea, 2011)</ref>. The results of the measurement model (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>) show that only two factors, SCL and ECN, had an AVE value below 0.50, violating the rule of thumb (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> for the definition of the factors and their acronyms). However, this was considered acceptable since <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref> have argued that, if the value of AVE is lower than 0.50 while the CR exceeds 0.6, then the convergent validity can be deemed acceptable. Hence, the findings show that the measures adopted by this study are reliable and valid. Note: See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> for the definition of constructs.</p><p>Discriminant validity testing was confirmed following the criterion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref> that the square root of the AVE should be more than the squared correlation amongst the dimensions. Discriminant validity is the extent to which items vary between distinct concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. The results show that the values of each construct support discriminant validity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>); the square root of the AVE for each construct is higher than the squared inter-construct correlations. The comparison of the cross-loadings provided in Appendix B also indicates that each factor loading is higher than its respective cross-loadings for other constructs, thus establishing adequate discriminant validity.</p><p>In this study, the TQM, service innovation (SI), and sustainability performance (SP) constructs were conceptualised as second-order constructs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Byrne (2010)</ref> stated that first-order constructs should be explained adequately by the hypothesised second-order constructs while being distinct. Analysis of the squared multiple correlations (SMC), also known as R 2 , revealed that all the first-order constructs range from 0.6 to 1, indicating that first-order constructs explain their respective second-order construct. Appendix B also shows that each construct is different from other constructs. Hence, the analysis confirmed that that first-order constructs (LED, PPL, PRS, SGP, and PDR) are adequately explained by the second-order construct, TQM. Similarly, other first-order constructs (ENV, SCL, and ECN for SP; and INN and PPR for SI) were also adequately explained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Structural model and hypotheses testing</head><p>AMOS v.23 was used to test the structural models and hypotheses.

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">IV</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref> show the structural model analysis.</p><p>The results show that the direct relationship between TQM and sustainability performance (SP) was significantly positive (β=0.566; p&lt;0.05), thus supporting H1. Concerning the dimensions of sustainability performance, social (β=0.767; p&lt;0.05) and environmental (β=0.780; p&lt;0.05) performance were the significant dimensions relating to the UAE public service sector's sustainability performance. This finding is line with those of Abbas (2020), <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Li et al. (2018), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Zhu et al. (2013)</ref>, who found a strong impact of TQM on the social and environmental performance of private sector firms. The economic dimension of sustainability performance in the public sector was, however, revealed to be insignificant (β=0.882; p&gt;0.05). This finding is consistent with those of <ref type="bibr">Dahlgaard et al. (2019)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kearney and Berman (2018)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">(2019)</ref>. However, the above studies, which are compared and contrasted in the current study, were conducted in the setting of the private sector, thus not providing empirical insights into the public sector's sustainability performance.  Concerning the elements of TQM, the study found that leadership (β=0.798; p&lt;0.05), people (β=0.810; p&lt;0.05), process (β=0.850; p&lt;0.05), and partnership and resources (β=0.834; p&lt;0.05) were the most significant elements of the ADAEP quality management model affecting the UAE's public sector's sustainability performance, while strategy and policy (β=0.846; p&gt;0.05) was revealed to be insignificant.</p><p>The results further revealed that the association between TQM and service innovation is significantly positive (β=0.619; p&lt;0.05), thus supporting H2. A similar relationship between TQM and innovation outcomes was found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Abu-Salim et al. (2019)</ref> in the UAE's private manufacturing and service firms. However, the current study's finding contributes to addressing the lack of studies relating to how TQM can affect service innovation in the public sector.</p><p>Additionally, the results revealed that service innovation significantly and positively impacts sustainability performance in the UAE's public sector (β=0.325; p&lt;0.05), hence supporting H3. This finding is consistent with those of studies conducted in the context of the private sector. For example, Aas and Pedersenb (2010) found that innovation can improve financial performance (economic sustainability performance), <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Lyons et al. (2007)</ref> stated that innovation improves customer value (social sustainability performance), and <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Løvlie et al. (2008)</ref> found that innovation has positive environmental effects (environmental sustainability performance).</p><p>To examine the mediating effect of SI on the relationship between TQM and SP, the direct and indirect effect was explored using SEM with the bootstrapping method for 1,000 re-samples. The results show that SI partially mediates (β=0.350; p&lt;0.05) the association between TQM and SP (Table <ref type="table">V</ref>), thus supporting H4. Hence, this study concludes that TQM applications in the UAE's public sector organisations play a partial role in improving sustainability performance through the promotion of service innovation. Therefore, organisational innovation, as well as product and process innovation, are equally critical for service innovation in the public sector.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">TQM practices</head><p>This paper makes several contributions regarding the lack of extant TQM and sustainability performance literature by examining the impact of TQM practices on service innovation and sustainability performance, specifically in the context of the public sector organisations in the UAE. First, this paper provides empirical evidence explaining the association between TQM and three facets of the sustainability performance of the public sector. Although several studies have shown the significant impact of a single aspect of sustainability performance (economic, social, or environmental), they have been in the private sector context <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abbas 2020</ref><ref type="bibr">, Dahlgaard et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kearney and</ref><ref type="bibr">Berman, 2018, Li et al., 2018)</ref>. The present paper's findings confirm that the social and environmental dimensions are highly significant for the public sector's sustainability performance in relation to TQM and service innovation, whereas the economic dimension was found to be insignificant. The public sector's prioritisation of social and environmental performance over economic performance is thus implied. This theoretical implication could be based on the difference between the private (profit-oriented) and public (public-service-oriented) sector in relation to setting and achieving their goals.</p><p>Further, empirical analysis showed that five of the TQM practices included in the model (leadership, people, process, and partnership, and resources) play a substantial role in enhancing sustainability performance in the public sector. Further, the results revealed the above TQM elements as a latent construct consisting of these four dimensions, which clearly demonstrates that TQM is a robust construct to measure the public sector's effectiveness in relation to quality management.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Service innovation</head><p>The findings also reveal the relationship between TQM and service innovation performance in the public sector, which has not yet been significantly studied in the extant literature. Some studies regarding the association between quality improvements and innovation do exist; Matto (2019) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gambi et al. (2020)</ref>, for example, stressed that the lack of service innovation can lead to TQM failure. A similar relationship between TQM and innovation outcomes was found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Abu-Salim et al. (2019)</ref> in the UAE's private manufacturing and service firms. However, the current paper's finding contribute to addressing the lack of studies relating to how TQM can affect service innovation in the public sector. The present paper's findings imply that successful TQM implementation could lead to successful service innovation in the UAE's public sector. Organisational innovation, as well as product and process innovation, are equally critical for service innovation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Sustainability performance</head><p>This paper also addresses the gap in the literature regarding how service innovation can mediate the relationship between TQM and sustainability performance in the public sector. It provides empirical evidence suggesting that service innovation partially mediates the above-mentioned relationship. Our findings thus extend current understanding regarding how TQM influences sustainability performance and further explains the mechanism by which TQM can encourage service innovation which, in turn, enhances the public sector's sustainability performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Theoretical implications</head><p>This paper contributes to the lack of extant TQM and sustainability performance literature by examining the impact of TQM practices, which are being practised in the UAE's public sector (following the ADAEP model), on service innovation and sustainability performance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Practical implications</head><p>The findings suggest that the public service sector's TQM practices and service innovation in the UAE have a profound impact on social and environmental sustainability rather than economic sustainability. This implies that the public sector in the UAE sees quality as a fundamental goal for the public services provided by the government <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Wynen et al., 2016)</ref>. Unlike the private sector, the main goal of any public sector organisation is to meet the needs of its societies/users within the constraints of available budget and abilities. Moreover, drawing on the concept of TQM elements, this study both supports policymakers and the managers of public sector organisations, particularly in developing Middle Eastern countries, such as the UAE, in making their strategic decisions in relation to TQM. Adopting the five dimensions of TQM (ADAEP model) across the UAE's public organisations will enable government departments to deliver innovative services to their beneficiaries, thereby enhancing environmental, social, and economic sustainability dimensions.</p><p>Given the current uncertainties regarding supply chains, TQM will have a critical role to play, while innovative ideas should facilitate sustainable strategies <ref type="bibr">(Jiménez-Jiménez et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Unforeseeable disruptions (such as COVID-19) in the market may call for technical innovations regarding the development and distribution of new services to maintain quality and sustainability in the market <ref type="bibr">(Volberda et al., 2013)</ref>. Moreover, TQM practices may lead to various innovative changes in terms of organisational structure, marketing strategies, and information management <ref type="bibr">(Walker et al., 2015)</ref>. Although this paper's findings predominantly reflect the public sector, organisations in the private sector also need constant support from the authorities to survive in today's competitive market.</p><p>In this context, this paper makes the following contributions to the extant literature:</p><p>• Based on RBV, this paper develops an empirical model to relate TQM practices to service innovation and sustainability performance in the public sector.</p><p>• With the help of the latest literature on the subject, a measurement instrument is developed to support the empirical model. • The findings signify the priority of social and environmental performance over economic performance in the public sector. • The analysis highlights how successful TQM efforts facilitate service innovations in achieving sustainability performance. • The findings help quality managers in making strategic decision pertaining to service innovations and sustainability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Limitations and future research</head><p>Undoubtedly, this study has some limitations. For example, the study sample was limited to 430 employees from eight public sector organisations located in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in the UAE. Public sector organisations more representative of those existing across the entire country could be further examined to improve the generalisability of the findings.</p><p>Further, more dimensions of TQM practices could be integrated into the current measurement model (ADAEP model) used in this study. For instance, the ADAEP model does not comprise other vital facets reflecting effective TQM practices, such as customer focus, knowledge management, and culture, which can enhance the sustainability performance of organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Elshaer and Augustyn, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fatima and Mahaboob, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lau et al., 2004)</ref>. Hence, researchers and scholars are encouraged to conduct further empirical investigations into the association between TQM, service innovation, and sustainability performance in the public sector by increasing the number of samples from among public organisations in the UAE and other developing countries and by integrating other elements into the current study's TQM construct, such as customer focus, culture, and knowledge management.
