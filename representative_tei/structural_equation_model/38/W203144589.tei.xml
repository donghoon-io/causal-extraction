<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Orientation:</head><p>The predominant theme of this research attends to the role of perceived positive leadership behaviour in relation to employee outcomes (psychological empowerment, work engagement, and satisfaction with life).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research purpose:</head><p>The objective of this study was to investigate whether perceived positive leadership behaviour could predict psychological empowerment, work engagement, and satisfaction with life of employees in a chemical organisation in South Africa and whether positive leadership behaviour has an indirect effect on employees work engagement and satisfaction with life by means of psychological empowerment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivation for the study:</head><p>The motivation for this study arose from the evident gap in academic literature as well as in terms of practical implications for the chemical industry regarding positive leadership behaviour, psychological empowerment, work engagement and satisfaction with life of employees.</p><p>Research design, approach and method: A cross-sectional survey design was used with a convenience sample (n = 322). Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to examine the structural relationships between the constructs.</p><p>Main findings: Statistically significant relationships were found between positive leadership behaviour, psychological empowerment, work engagement and satisfaction with life of employees. Positive leadership has an indirect effect on work engagement and satisfaction with life via psychological empowerment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical/managerial implications:</head><p>This study adds to the lack of literature in terms of positive leadership, psychological empowerment, work engagement and satisfaction with life within a chemical industry. It can also assist managers and personnel within the chemical industry to understand and perhaps further investigate relationships that exist between the above mentioned concepts.</p><p>Contribution/value-add: It is recommended that leadership discussions, short training programs and individual coaching about positive leadership and particularly psychological empowerment take place.</p></div>

Organisational leaders find today's business environment depressing and in an uncontrollable negative spiral <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Youssef-Morgan &amp; Luthans, 2013)</ref>. Kim Cameron, a leading positive organisational scholar, has said, 'Business leaders give more attention to the negative than to the positive, especially in trying times' <ref type="bibr">(Cameron, 2010, p. 45)</ref>. Trying times are not the exception anymore, but the norm. The world economy is still struggling, as seen from recent reports on the United States of America and the European economies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Appelbaum, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Brittain, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Inman, 2013)</ref>. The economic growth in South Africa was slower since 2012 due to the sustained weakness in the global economy and domestic structural constraints <ref type="bibr">(African Economic Outlook, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">McKinsey, 2015)</ref>. The South African economy currently appears quite vulnerable following a deterioration in domestic socioeconomic and political conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Smit, Grobler &amp; Nel, 2014)</ref>. The South African economy has slowed down dramatically, job creation has been disappointing, unemployment is high, while the country experience enduring poverty <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(McKinsey, 2015)</ref>. These factors, linked with energy challenges, lengthy strikes in the mining industry and pressures on manufacturing organisations led to growing pessimism among people. In addition, the economic downturn in China and thereby lower Chinese demand for commodities has impacted negatively on the South African economy. In tough times, when organisations are forced to weather change, recession and downsizing, leaders are called to take responsibility for clear, effective and principled leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Blackie, 2012)</ref>. They have a special responsibility to provide as much stability, safety, hope and meaning as possible for their employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Cone, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Rodriguez &amp; Rodriguez, 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Purnell and Johnson (2008)</ref> emphasise that keeping employees well and employed has obvious advantages for both the organisation and its employees. For the organisation it means productive employees, profits and greater competitiveness and for the employee it means a safeguard against financial suffering, promoting a better quality of life and allowing them to make the most of their potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Purnell &amp; Johnson, 2008)</ref>. The question arises whether a leader's positive approach to managing employees will have an impact on the employee's wellbeing? The objective of this study is to investigate if a positive approach to leadership can impact on individual outcomes such as psychological empowerment, work engagement and satisfaction with life in an uncertain and negative business environment. Currently a lack of research exists in this area, specifically within South Africa.</p><p>Youssef-Morgan and <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Luthans (2013)</ref> postulate that it is becoming more and more difficult for leaders to be positive, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Rodriguez and Rodriguez, (2015)</ref> state that 'leadership is going to be a matter of discovering the positive energy in every person <ref type="bibr">' (p. 862)</ref>. A decade ago researchers began to investigate the impact of the positive energy on individuals and organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Spreitzer &amp; Cameron, 2012)</ref>. Quality of life is the domain of positive psychology and, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Donaldson and Ko (2010)</ref>, this field of psychology has blossomed since its introduction at the 1998 American Psychological Association convention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi (2000)</ref> set forth the focus areas of positive psychology: On an individual level, it is about positive traits and its aim is to study what is right with people, what they do right and how they manage to do it right <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Compton, 2005)</ref>. In an organisational context, components can include positive leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arakawa &amp; Greenberg, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Avolio &amp; Gardner, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Avolio, Gardner, Walumbwa, Luthans, &amp; May, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bass, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cameron, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Conger &amp; Kanungo, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Dutton &amp; Spreitzer, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Glynn &amp; Dowd, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Kelloway, Weigand, McKee, &amp; Das, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">: Van Dierendonck, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Zbierowski &amp; Góra, 2014)</ref>, psychological empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Menon, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Mishra &amp; Spreitzer, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Quinn &amp; Spreitzer, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Spreitzer, 1995)</ref>, work engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kahn, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">May, Gilson, &amp; Harter, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Schaufeli, Salanova, Gonzalez-Romá, &amp; Bakker, 2002)</ref>, satisfaction with life <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Lucas, Diener, &amp; Suh, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Pavot &amp; Diener, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Rojas, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Sirgy &amp; Wu, 2009)</ref> and positive business <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Spreitzer &amp; Cameron, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Positive organisational psychology focuses on individual experiences and characteristics in the workplace and it is used to expand the efficacy and quality of life in organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Donaldson &amp; Ko, 2010)</ref>. Positive organisational behaviour (POB) focuses on positive psychological capacities (PsyCap) that can be measured, developed and managed, as well as on the study and application of positive human resources strengths <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Luthans, 2000)</ref>. Positive organisational scholarship (POS) on the other hand focuses on positive results, methods and qualities of organisations and their employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cameron, Dutton, &amp; Quinn, 2003)</ref>. It is in this field of research wherein the concept of positive forms of leadership is settled. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Laschinger, Wong, Cummings, and Grau, (2014)</ref> found that positive leadership improves employees satisfaction, commitment, intention to stay with the organisation and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Salmi, Perttula, &amp; Syväjärvi, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>De <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Villiers and Stander (2011)</ref> found that a leader's approach towards direct reports influence how employees perceive their roles and expectations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995)</ref> state that leadership is built on how the relationship between the leaders and subordinate is formed (leader-memberexchange).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Positive leadership</head><p>Youssef-Morgan and <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Luthans (2013)</ref> are of the opinion that positivity is crucial for leaders in challenging times. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Arakawa and Greenberg (2007)</ref> see positive leaders as those that influence their followers positively and therefore increase their engagement and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Krueger &amp; Killham, 2005)</ref>. They expound that a positive leader has an optimistic explanatory style, which is linked to a wide range of positive performance results in the work domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Nolan-Hoeksema, Girgus, &amp; Seligman, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Peterson &amp; Barrett, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Peterson &amp; Seligman, 1984)</ref>, as well as better involvement, commitment, motivation and satisfaction of employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Furnham, Brewin, &amp; O'Kelly, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Furnham, Sadka, &amp; Brewin, 1992)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Dasborough and Ashkanasy (2002)</ref> contend that leaders who show positive emotions and have a positive attribution style result in followers that have more favourable emotional reactions towards leadership. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Fredrickson's (2001)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cameron, 2008)</ref>. This is supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Rodriguez &amp; Rodriguez, (2015)</ref> as what will be 'a leader for the coming future' (p.862). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Arakawa and Greenberg (2007)</ref> positive leadership consist of a strengths-based approach, positive perspective and giving recognition.</p><p>Positive leadership theories that form part of the positiveorientated leadership genre include: authentic <ref type="bibr">(Avolio &amp; Gardner, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Gardner, Avolio, Luthans, May, &amp; Walumbwa, 2005)</ref>; transformational <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bass, 1999)</ref>; charismatic <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Conger &amp; Kanungo, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Glynn &amp; Dowd, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Haney, 2012)</ref>; empowering <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Albrecht &amp; Andreetta, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Arnold, Arad, Rhoades, &amp; Drasgow, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Hakimi, Van Knippenberg, &amp; Griessner, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Konczak, Stelly, &amp; Trusty, 2000)</ref> servant Original Research <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Russell &amp; Stone, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Van Dierendonck, 2011)</ref> as well as ethical and spiritual leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Youssef-Morgan &amp; Luthans, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Gardner et al. (2005)</ref>, on the one hand, conceptualise authentic leadership as part of POB and posit that these leaders draw from PsyCap, which accompanies optimal self-esteem and psychological well-being to model and stimulate the development of these states in others, thereby supporting <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Arakawa and Greenberg's (2007)</ref> positive perspective. Transformational leaders on the other hand arouse followers through idealised influence and inspirational motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bass, 1999)</ref>. They intellectually stimulate their followers by managing them as individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bass, 1999)</ref>, which supports <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Arakawa and Greenberg's (2007)</ref> view of focusing on individuals strengths and recognising their efforts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Brun and Dugas (2008)</ref> describe recognition as a constructive response by a leader that takes into consideration not just works performance, but also commitment and engagement. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Luthans (2000)</ref>, effective leadership depends on strengthening, encouraging and rewarding value enhancing behaviours in order to gain greater performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Dolezalek (2008)</ref> emphasises that the recognition a leader gives to employees, should be customised, meaningful and timely. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Grawitch, Gottschalk, and Munz (2006)</ref> found that employee recognition is the key to protecting and building the uniqueness of individuals, giving their work meaning, supporting their development and contributing to their health and well-being. Employees tend to display more feelings of satisfaction towards their jobs when their efforts are recognised <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Henryhand, 2009)</ref>. Empowering leaders lead by example, provide employees with accountability, development, autonomy, decision latitude, discretion and power, concern, coaching and information <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Albrecht &amp; Andreetta, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Arnold et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Konczak et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Pearce &amp; Sims, 2002)</ref>. These behaviours strongly correlate with <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Arakawa and Greenberg's (2007)</ref> focus on a strength-based and developmental approach. Several studies indicate that greater strengths use by employees is related to well-being, optimism, vitality, selfesteem, positive affect and lower perceived stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Diener, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Proctor, Maltby, &amp; Linley, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Wood, Linley, Maltby, Kashdan, &amp; Hurling, 2011)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Rath and Conchie (2008)</ref>, leaders who focus on follower's strengths, build a well-rounded team of followers. In an attempt to further clarify the concept of positive leadership, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Arakawa and Greenberg (2007)</ref> endeavoured to operationalise the positive (optimistic) leadership role of managers in an organisation by developing a reliable and valid questionnaire, which measures perceived behavioural attributes. Based on Youssef-Morgan and <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Luthans (2013)</ref>, conceptualisation that positive leadership is unique because of the focus on strengths and development and <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Kelloway, et al. (2013)</ref> focus on recognition this study's focus will be on a strength-based approach and giving recognition. Together this will form a positive perspective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological empowerment</head><p>To empower, means to give power to someone <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Thomas &amp; Velthouse, 1990)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Conger and Kanungo (1988)</ref> see empowerment as the process of enhancing feelings of self-efficacy through management, using empowerment strategies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Thomas and Velthouse (1990)</ref> conceptualise psychological empowerment as a cognitive model, including meaning, competence, choice and impact. Other theories regarding psychological empowerment include <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Menon's (2001)</ref> conceptualisation of psychological empowerment, which is characterised by perceptions of control, competence and goal internalisation.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Spreitzer (1995)</ref> psychological empowerment is a motivational construct consisting of four cognitions that reveal an energetic rather than a lifeless orientation to a work role, meaning that the employee feels able and wishes to form their work role and situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Spreitzer, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Thomas &amp; Velthouse, 1990)</ref>. Meaning reflects that an employee feels their work is essential and they care about what they are doing <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Quinn &amp; Spreitzer, 1997)</ref>, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Mishra and Spreitzer (1998)</ref> describe meaning as dedication or personal association to work. Competence means that employees feel that they can perform <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Quinn &amp; Spreitzer, 1997)</ref> and they believe that they have the skills and ability to do their work well <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Mishra &amp; Spreitzer, 1998)</ref>. Perceived self-determination is when employees experience freedom to choose how they do their work <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Quinn &amp; Spreitzer, 1997)</ref>. Finally, impact means that employees believe that they influence the system in their organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Mishra &amp; Spreitzer, 1998)</ref>, have influence and others listen to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Quinn &amp; Spreitzer, 1997)</ref>. The research of <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Laschinger et al. (2014)</ref> proved that when employees perceive their leaders behaviours as positive, employees will feel empowered: H1: Perceived positive leadership behaviour is a significant predictor of employee psychological empowerment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Erickson (2005)</ref> describes engagement as commitment and compassion while other authors describe engagement as the degree to which employees are involved in their work <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kahn, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Roberts &amp; Davenport, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Rothmann &amp; Jordaan, 2006)</ref>, or as <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Erickson (2005)</ref> puts it, the willingness to invest oneself to help the employer be successful. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Schaufeli et al. (2002)</ref> describe another view of engagement, defining work engagement as 'a positive, fulfilling work-related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption' (p. 74). Vigor expresses itself through high energy and mental resilience, dedication shows a high level of both cognitive and affective involvement and absorption indicates a passing of time fully immersed in one's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Schaufeli et al., 2002)</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Kahn's (1990)</ref> research, he induced three psychological conditions that influence employees to personally engage or disengage, namely, meaningfulness, safety and availability <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kahn, 1990</ref>). An employee experiences psychological meaningfulness if they feel that they obtain a return on their cognitive, emotional and physical investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kahn, 1990)</ref>. Psychological safety is experienced if the employee feels able to safely engage themselves in a work role without fearing undesirable consequences to their status, self-image or career <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kahn, 1990)</ref>. Lastly, when employees experience psychological availability, they feel that they have the cognitive, emotional and physical resources to engage personally in a work role <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kahn, 1990)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Kelloway, et al. (2013)</ref> state that a leader's positive behaviour results in employees experiencing positive emotions. We therefore propose the following:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Satisfaction with life</head><p>The satisfaction with life construct is a component of the subjective well-being (SWB) construct, together with positive and negative affect (Arthaud-Day, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Rode, Mooney, &amp; Near, 2005)</ref>. Conscious cognitive satisfaction with life judgements are done by individuals by assessing the overall quality of their lives based on their own distinct set of measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Pavot &amp; Diener, 1993)</ref>. From the life domains literature it can be understood that life satisfaction is the result of satisfaction from various domains of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Meadow, Mentzer, Rahtz, &amp; Sirgy, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Rampichini &amp; D'Andrea, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Salvatore &amp; Munoz-Sastre, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Veenhoven, 1996)</ref>.

A randomised, cross-sectional convenience survey design, which entails standardised questionnaires, was used to collect the data. A formal letter from the University, which explains the purpose of the research and a consent letter were attached to the questionnaires. The formal letter and the letter of consent were given to the participants to outline the purpose of the research, why the research is important and beneficial for the individual, business and the university. The confidentiality and anonymity of the participants was ensured. After consent was given, data were collected from a convenience sample in a specific operations business unit (N = 700) of a chemical organisation. Of the 700 questionnaires that were distributed 322 (46%) were returned. The study population consisted of 92.5% male participants with females representing 7.5% of the sample. The white participants comprised of 53.7% and the African participants 42.2% of the survey. Most of the participants were between the ages of 26-35 years (32%), while 29.5% reported a grade 12 qualification and 31.7% of the population reported NQF 4 level.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between positive leadership behaviour, psychological empowerment, work engagement and employees' satisfaction with life in a chemical organisation. The results indicated that statistically significant correlations exist between the constructs of positive leadership, psychological empowerment, work engagement and employees' satisfaction with life. Perceived positive leader behaviour had direct effects on psychological empowerment and satisfaction with life.</p><p>Positive leadership was significantly positively related to psychological empowerment and this result is supported in other research on positive leadership practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Barroso Castro et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kark et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Seibert et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Stander &amp; Rothmann, 2010)</ref>. A positive leader's ability to match an employee's strengths and talents to their tasks and their regular recognition of accomplishments increases an employee's feelings of meaning towards their work, their awareness of their competence to do their work, the perception of their impact over what happens in their workplace and their ability to decide how their work is done <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Quinn &amp; Spreitzer, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Spreitzer, 1995)</ref>. In practice, this means that employees who have gone through difficult organisational circumstances (as in this study) will benefit from a leader who focuses on the positive and empowers them to do well regardless of their circumstances. The results show a significant correlation (large effect) between positive leadership and the self-determination aspect of psychological empowerment. This may indicate that a positive leadership approach enhances employees' perception that they can freely choose how they do their work without being micromanaged. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Bono and Judge (2003)</ref> found that followers have a greater ability to adopt autonomous goals and are more satisfied when their leaders support their followers' need for self-direction.</p><p>The path coefficient between positive leadership and work engagement was not significant. This is supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Arakawa and Greenberg (2007)</ref> who could not establish a correlation between positive leadership and engagement, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Stander and Mostert (2013)</ref> found individual strengths used a strong predictor of work engagement. Positive leadership and psychological empowerment explains 53% of the variance in work engagement. This suggests that when leaders focus on strengths, recognition and employees' psychological empowerment (meaning, competence, impact and self-determination) work engagement will increase.</p><p>Employees will be more cognitively alert, emotionally available and have physical energy to perform in their job <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kahn, 1990)</ref>. Psychologically empowered employees are more likely to experience increased levels of work engagement with simultaneous decreased levels of burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bhatnagar, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">De Villiers &amp; Stander, 2011)</ref>. Practically this implies that employees who experience trying times at work will be positively affected by a positive leadership approach.</p><p>A work environment where employee's experience that their strengths are optimised and they receive recognition for their contribution, will lead to feelings of being in control and experiencing meaning. As an end result they will be more energised to do their job. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Forest et al. (2012)</ref> are of the opinion that strengths should energise and motivate people towards optimising their potential and being action-driven <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Elston &amp; Boniwell, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Stander and Mostert (2013)</ref> postulate that it is crucial for management to focus on strengths as a way of achieving organisational objectives. For the organisation, strengths use has been shown to increase the levels of engagement (Biswas-Diener, Kashdan, &amp; Minhas, 2011) which are ultimately linked to improved satisfaction levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cameron, Mora, Leutscher, &amp; Calarco, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>This study found that satisfaction with life is impacted positively by psychological empowerment. Furthermore, positive leadership had a moderate indirect effect on satisfaction with life through psychological empowerment, indicating that the combination of positive leadership practices and higher psychological empowerment increases employees' overall satisfaction with life <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Aryee &amp; Chen 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Dewettinck &amp; Van Ameijde, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Durand, 2007)</ref>. This indicates that employees may feel more satisfied with their life in general when their leaders are positive and they feel more empowered while experiencing tough times at work. There is a strong relationship between the recognition This could indicate that when a leader gives recognition to an employee it carries over to their general satisfaction with life. Work engagement contributed significantly to satisfaction with life. This may indicate that employees, who become absorbed in their jobs, are passionate and enthusiastic about their job and feel physically alive and vital at work, may be more satisfied with their lives in general.</p><p>Finally, the findings indicate an interesting outcome, in that positive leadership, psychological empowerment and work engagement have a combined positive effect on satisfaction with life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Spreitzer (2007)</ref> postulates that there could be a spill over effect between work domains and life domains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Purnell and Johnson (2008)</ref> encourage organisations to look after their employees' well-being in trying times. The combined effect of the work related variables of positive leadership behaviour (strengths-based and recognition), high employee psychological empowerment (meaning, competence, selfdetermination and impact) and high work engagement (cognitive, emotional and physical) has a positive influence on the non-work related variable of satisfaction with life (explaining 25% of the variance in satisfaction with life). The results support the opinion by <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Rodriguez &amp; Rodriguez, (2015)</ref> that leadership must discover positive energy, stimulate the best in each employee and develop the potential. From a wellness approach it is encouraging that organisational interventions, in this case leadership development, can contribute to the overall wellness of employees. By developing a positive approach by leaders, organisations can contribute to positive organisational as well as individual outcomes.</p><p>The resultant practical implications of this study are numerous. It seems that leaders who add to their leadership style, a strengths-based approach and who make a point of giving recognition to their employees, influence positive outcomes regarding their employees' psychological empowerment, work engagement and satisfaction with life. This may increase an employee's feelings of empowerment, their attitude towards work and their positive perception of their life as a whole. Organisations should do more to develop managers as people developers, focusing on identifying and optimising employees potential. By developing their people, managers will know how to help those employees who report to them to create meaning in their jobs, and take control of their circumstances. This will lead to energised employees that experience satisfaction in life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations and limitations</head><p>Based on the results, positive leaders have a positive influence on employees' psychological empowerment, work engagement and satisfaction with life. It is recommended that organisations focus on the training and coaching of leaders on how to identify and harness employees' strengths. Leaders should also be encouraged to give genuine recognition to employees and their accomplishments. It was also seen that psychological empowerment enhances the effect that positive leadership has on work engagement and satisfaction with life. Firstly, the organisation should focus on increasing the leaders' psychological empowerment through leadership discussions and coaching. Interventions focused on improving the psychological empowerment of employees are encouraged. Specific focus should be on the self-determination aspect of psychological empowerment through group discussion, role-play and individual coaching.</p><p>From the findings, it was shown that the work related aspect of positive leadership, psychological empowerment and work engagement has a significant effect on satisfaction with life, which is a non-work related aspect. By focusing on the above interventions, satisfaction with life will be positively affected.</p><p>Limitations include, among others, that the data was retrieved from a cross-sectional research design, thus inferences about causal relationships were excluded and the participants' feelings, attitudes and beliefs are representative of only one point in time.
