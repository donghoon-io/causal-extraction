<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Mental disorders like depression and anxiety are more prevalent in people living with HIV (PLHIV) than in the general population. Improved understanding of the relationship between mental disorders and HIV is important for designing interventions for this group. However, the relationship between mental disorders and HIV is complex and bidirectional. This paper explores the interrelationships between the psychological distress as measured by depression and anxiety symptoms, HIV status and other exogenous variables such as demographic, HIV and health-related variables using structural equation modelling.</p><p>Methods: This secondary data analysis used the 2012 South African population-based household survey on HIV collected using a multi-stage strati ed cluster sampling design.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The comorbidity of HIV and mental disorders has become an increasing major public health challenge and is a substantial burden to society <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Common mental disorders are recognized as frequent psychiatric comorbid conditions among PLHIV <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Depression is found to be more common in people living with HIV compared with prevalence estimates in the general population <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, directly impacting their quality of life and impeding their enrolment and retention in treatment <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. Research studies have shown that the causes of mental disorders are multi factorial and include among others biological, social, and economic factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>There is considerable evidence that common mental disorders are distributed according to economic gradient across society and that the poor and disadvantaged suffer disproportionately from common mental disorders and their adverse consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Moreover, <ref type="bibr">Knifton and</ref> Inglis argue that the mental health of individuals is shaped by the social, environmental and economic conditions in which they are born, grow, work and age <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. In addition, there is consistent evidence that experience of socioeconomic disadvantage, including unemployment, low income, poverty, debt and poor housing, is associated with poorer mental health <ref type="bibr">[7; 8]</ref>. A systematic review of social determinants of mental disorders by <ref type="bibr">Lund and</ref> colleagues highlighted that these determinants of mental disorders are the social and economic conditions that have a direct in uence on the prevalence and severity of mental disorders in men and women <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>PLHIV are additionally affected due to lack of social support, poor self-esteem, stigma, and discrimination <ref type="bibr">[10; 11]</ref>. This, in turn, predisposes them to psychological problems like depression and anxiety at greater rates than the general population <ref type="bibr">[12; 13]</ref>. In addition, HIV-related stigma has been recognised as a fundamental cause of health inequalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. HIV-related stigma has been observed as a contributing factor to mental health and substance use problems among people living with HIV <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In addition, HIV testing, and awareness of HIV positive status affects mental capacity to cope especially because of social stigma associated with living with HIV <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. Since HIV stigma and discrimination affect the emotional well-being and mental health, these feelings can keep people from getting tested and treated for HIV <ref type="bibr">[16; 17]</ref>.</p><p>Reducing the burden of comorbid mental disorders is key to achieving the UNAIDS care cascade goals of 95-95-95 <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. Furthermore, mental disorders have been recognized as a risk factor for HIV transmission, through their effects on various aspects of sexual behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Moreover, both mental disorders and substance use disorders are known predictors of poor HIV disease management including suboptimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and faster disease progression <ref type="bibr">[20; 21]</ref>. Mental disorders can increase risk of HIV acquisition through both direct and indirect pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Several studies have shown that sexually active people with mental disorders have higher risk sexual behavior, including inconsistent condom use, having multiple sexual partners, trading sex, and drinking alcohol before sex <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Previous research studies have shown that the relationship between mental disorders and HIV/AIDS is complex and bidirectional. Mental disorders are found to play a critical role in HIV acquisition across populations, while on the other hand, the stress of living with HIV can negatively affect one's mental health. The underlying factors remain poorly understood. Many factors contribute to the high comorbidity of HIV and mental health conditions. Studies have used structural equation model (SEM) to understand this complex relationship by investigating a conceptual model of the pathways linking wellbeing including mental health, social support, self-rated health and HIV-related stigma <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>. SEM has been utilized to develop psychological model to predict antiretroviral therapy medication adherence behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Others have used SEM to investigate factors associated with HIV risk behaviors and mental health and examine the role of intersecting stigmas <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. However, there is paucity of large population-based studies of complex interactions between psychological distress, HIV status and predisposing factors. This paper therefore explores the relationships between psychological distress, HIV status and exogenous variables using the structural equation modelling in South Africa using the 2012 national householdbased population survey on HIIV. Structural equation modelling was used to test hypothesized pathways between psychological distress, HIV status and associated socio-demographic, health and HIV related factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology Data source</head><p>This secondary data analysis used the 2012 South African population-based household survey on HIV <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The data was collected using a multi-stage strati ed cluster sampling design. A total of 1 000 census enumeration areas (EAs) from the 2001 population census in South Africa were randomly selected using probability proportional to size and strati ed by province, locality type and race in urban areas from a database of 86,000 EAs. In each sampled EA a total of 15 visiting points (VPs) or households were used as secondary sampling units. Persons of all ages living in South African households and hostels were eligible to participate and formed the ultimate sampling unit.</p><p>Four questionnaires were administered in the survey to solicit information including among other sociodemographic characteristics, HIV knowledge, self-received risk of being infected with HIV and HIV related stigma and discrimination against PLHIV. In addition, blood specimens were collected from consenting individuals for HIV testing. The current study is based on a sub-sample of youth and adult individuals 15 years and older who responded to the questions on psychological distress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures Endogenous variables</head><p>Psychological distress was the observed endogenous variable based on the respondent's experience of depressive and anxiety disorders measured using the Kessler 10 scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, which consists of the following 10 items that describe how they felt during the previous 30 days: How often did you feel: Tired out for no good reason? So nervous that nothing could calm you down? Hopeless; Restless or dgety: So restless that you could not sit still; Depressed? That everything was an effort? So sad that nothing could cheer you up? Worthless?' Responses to these items were recorded using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = some of the time, 4 = most of the time, 5 = all of the time). The scores from these responses were then summed to calculate a total score indicating whether the respondents were likely to experience psychological distress. The scores were then dichotomized into a binary outcome those who scored &lt;19 absence of psychological distress = 0) and those who scored ≥20 (presence of psychological distress =1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exogenous variables</head><p>The selected exogenous variables included a set of demographic variables such as age <ref type="bibr">(15-24, 25-34, 35-49</ref>, 50 years and older), sex (male and female), race (black African and other races), educational level (primary/ no education, secondary, tertiary), employment status (unemployed and employed), locality type (urban formal, urban informal, rural informal/ tribal areas, rural formal/ farm areas) and asset based socio-economic status (low and high). This also included HIV-related variables such as self-perceived risk of HIV infection (no and yes), HIV knowledge and myth rejection (no and yes), ever tested for HIV (no and yes), awareness of HIV status based on the question "Have you been told/informed of the result of your most recent test? (no and yes), external HIV-related stigma (high and low), and self-rated health (fair/poor and good/excellent).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mediator variable</head><p>HIV status was included as a mediator in the relationship between the endogenous and exogenous variables. Although HIV testing was anonymous and returning of the results optional and dependent on study participant, it is assumed that the majority of study participants were aware of their HIV status, and this is hypothesized that HIV status mediates the effects of demographic, health and HIV-related variables on psychological distress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual model and analysis</head><p>Generalized structural equation modelling (G-SEM)-path analysis was used to explore the direct and indirect relationships of key variables with psychological distress using HIV status as a mediator variable (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The conceptual model follows the Fundamental Causes Theory which suggests that individuals' health condition is in uenced by contextual factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> such as demographics (age, gender, race, locality), socio-economic status (educational level, employment), social contexts (social support), and persistent health disparities (self-rated health, HIV related stigma). This model also includes health and HIV-related factors such alcohol use AUDUT score, self-rated health, HIV testing history (ever had an HIV test), awareness of HIV status, self-perceived risk of HIV, and experiences of externalised HIV-related stigma.</p><p>G-SEM was used to measure linear and non-linear causal relationships among selected variables, while simultaneously accounting for measurement error. G-SEM is a combination of three statistical techniques: multiple regression, path analysis, and factor analysis. Its purpose was to determine the extent to which a proposed theoretical model, expressed by a set of relations among different constructs, is supported by the collected data. Mediation analysis for each variable was performed and a nal path analysis including the goodness of t was conducted. Goodness-of-t chi square test, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), Tucker-Lewis's index (TLI), and comparative t index (CFI) were used to assess the model t. All variables with p&lt;0.05 were considered statistically signi cant and statistical analyses were performed using Stata (V.16, Stata Corp, College Station, Texas, USA) statistical software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample characteristics and psychological distress</head><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows the characteristics of the study sample and psychological distress. Out of the 20 083 participants, 22.6% had psychological distress, of whom (12.6%) were HIV positive. Psychological distress was signi cantly higher among those aged 25-49 years (44.6%), among females (57.7%), those not married (66.8%), African (71.2%), those with secondary level education (67.5%), those from formal urban areas (51.5%), those who abstained from alcohol (66.6%), those who reported good/excellent selfrated health (64.1%), those who ever tested for HIV (66.6%), those not aware of their HIV status (58.1%), those who perceived themselves as being at risk of HIV (74.3%).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> shows how the independent variables in uence psychological distress (Step 1 in establishing mediation). Most independent variables signi cantly in uenced psychological distress. Those aged 25 to 45 years, 50 years and older, females and those residing in rural formal and rural informal areas were signi cantly more likely to develop psychological distress compared to their counterparts. Those who drink alcohol (low risk drinker, high risk drinker and hazardous drinkers), and those who ever tested for HIV, were also signi cantly more likely to develop psychological distress compared to their counterparts. In addition, those married, other race groups, those with secondary and tertiary level education, the employed, and those from rural formal and rural informal areas were signi cantly less likely to develop psychological distress compared to their counterparts.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">3</ref> shows how the independent variables in uence the mediator variable HIV status (Step 2 in establishing mediation). Those aged 25 to 45 years, 50 years and older, females, and those residing in rural formal and rural informal areas were signi cantly more likely to be HIV positive compared to their counterparts. Those who ever tested for HIV were also signi cantly more to HIV positive compared to their counterparts. Furthermore, those married, other race groups, those with tertiary level education, the employed and those residing in rural formal and rural informal areas were signi cantly less likely to develop psychological distress compared to their counterparts. Those who rated their health as excellent/good were also signi cantly less likely to be HIV positive compared to their counterparts.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows how the mediator variable in uences psychological distress (Step 3 in establishing mediation). The nal model shows that HIV signi cantly in uenced psychological distress levels in the third equation. The independent variables and HIV status entered into the model as predictors, were signi cantly related to the independent variables, hence the rst condition satis ed. A strong association between most of the independent variables and psychological distress was observed, thus second condition satis ed. HIV status was a strong predictor of psychological distress therefore third condition satis ed.</p><p>In the nal model those aged 25 to 45 years and 50 years and older, females and those residing in rural areas were signi cantly more likely to develop psychological distress compared to their counterparts.</p><p>Those who ever tested for HIV and those with experiences of internalised stigma were also signi cantly more likely to develop psychological distress compared to their counterparts. Furthermore, those married, other race groups, the employed, those with tertiary level education, those who rated their health as excellent/good, and those who were aware of their HIV status were signi cantly less likely to develop psychological distress compared to their counterparts.</p><p>Introduction of HIV status into the model weakened the effect of some independent variables thus fourth condition satis ed. This con rms that HIV status mediates the effect of independent variables towards psychological distress. The likelihood ratio test shows that the p-value is less than 0.05 suggesting that model 2 is better than the previous model, and that our model is a good t (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). RMSEA assessed the population error, and it was very small close to zero suggesting a good t of our model. The same idea was supported by the p-close of 1. TLI value greater than 0.95 provide evidence of the acceptance of model t.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we examined the interrelationships between psychological distress, HIV status and associated factors among youth and adults 15 years and older using data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey. This is the rst study that explored the complex and bidirectional relationship between psychological distress and HIV status and associated predisposing factors to both conditions. The prevalence of psychological distress among the study population was 21.7%, and of these 12.6% were HIV positive.</p><p>The nal model with HIV status as a mediator variable showed that other than HIV infection, psychological distress was signi cantly associated with older age group than youth (15-24 years and female. There is lack of consistent results about how age affects depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Contrary to current ndings, other studies found lower level of distress in older age groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. In South Africa, HIV is a major problem among the youth especially among females <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Other studies have also found a higher prevalence of psychological distress among women living with HIV compared to men <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. It is likely therefore that differential patterns of exposure to HIV predispose these population groups to psychological distress. These observations emphasize the need for differentiated care and targeted interventions to support these vulnerable groups. Furthermore, the model showed that heavy alcohol intake was associated with psychological distress.</p><p>Other studies have also found that harmful lifestyle factors such as excessive drinking in PLHIV increased risk for anxiety and depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref>. This suggests that interventions should mitigate the effects of adverse lifestyle factors such as alcohol abuse in preventing psychological distress especially among PLHIV. The current ndings therefore highlight the importance of screening for alcohol abuse in this group.</p><p>In agreement with current ndings, other studies found that HIV-infected individuals with psychological distress were more likely to have had an HIV test, partly due to worry arising from the knowledge of potentially being infected <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Evidence shows that the impact of being diagnosed with HIV infection, associated stigma, social isolation, and discrimination may all lead to depressive disorders among PLHIV. However, others argue that symptoms of depression and distress are common among persons seeking HIV testing and are therefore not a consequence of an HIV-positive test result <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Nevertheless, the ndings of this study support proposals for greater integration of mental health services with HIV testing services especially in populations suffering from high levels of psychological distress.</p><p>The nding that marriage is protective of psychological distress is consistent with other studies indicating a bene t of marriage for mental health partly due to family/social support since marriage protects against feelings of loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Other studies also found that those in marriage suffer less psychological distress and have higher levels of emotional and psychological well-being than those who are single, divorced, or cohabiting <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. The observed positive in uence of marriage on psychological distress highlights the importance of improving marital quality to promote mental health.</p><p>Differences in psychological distress were also observed across race groups. The observed differences in psychological distress between Black Africans and other race groups in the context of HIV can be attributed to the racial disparities rooted in structural and contextual inequalities that sustain the HIV epidemic among Black Africans <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Other studies also observed that socio-economic resources help explain differences in psychological distress between Africans and other race groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. This suggest that addressing social and resource inequality such as access to basic services, education, and employment will in a way address social stressors and mitigate psychological distress especially among PLHIV.</p><p>The nding of protective effects of socio-economic status indicators such as education attainment and employment against psychological distress is partly because educational achievement has a positive effect on outlook in life and increase self-e cacy, which in turn helps people cope with life's problems and stresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. On the other hand, employment promotes positive emotions due to social security since jobs provide resources that can mitigate stress, support healthy lifestyles and thereby promote mental health <ref type="bibr">[46]</ref>. Therefore, policies promoting access to education and reducing unemployment may be important for mitigating the impact of psychological distress especially among PLHIV.</p><p>The ndings also suggest that the relationship between HIV and psychological distress differs across urban and rural settings. The currents results suggest that residing in rural areas is protective of psychological distress while other studies have observed that people in rural areas present with higher levels of symptoms of psychological distress than their urban counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. In South Africa, the high levels of psychological distress may be linked to the persistently high level of HIV prevalence in urban settings <ref type="bibr">[29; 34]</ref>. This highlights the importance of integrating mental health care in HIV-related care in areas where most of the population live with HIV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>While SEM remains a powerful tool for exploratory analysis and for the hypothesis-generating process, the analysis may be limited by the di culty to describe the relationship between HIV and co-occurring mental disorders that may be present prior to HIV diagnosis. The analysis may also be limited by the possibility that other unmeasured variables may have affected the observed relationship between endogenous and exogenous variables and between endogenous variables. In addition, social desirability response bias due to self-report may have in uenced some of the results. The cross-sectional nature of the study prevents causal inference limiting our understandings of the exact nature of the relationship between HIV status and psychological distress. Causal pathways could be better clari ed with a longitudinal study design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>HIV status was found to be an in uencing factor that had a direct effect on psychological distress. We therefore conclude that HIV status mediates the relationship between psychological distress and the exogenous factors such as age, sex, race, education and employment. It is important to buffer the impact of these interrelations through effective psychological distress interventions to improve the health and wellbeing of PLHIV in South Africa. Avenues of intervention may include provision of social support, selfesteem enhancement, and improving coping skills. The format and content of such interventions should be context speci c. Finally, integration of mental health and HIV services is needed. </p></div>
