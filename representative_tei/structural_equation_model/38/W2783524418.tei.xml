<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>To compete in today's volatile environment, firms are increasingly attempting to generate, collect and transform their data into actionable knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Delen &amp; Demirkan, 2013)</ref>. In response, business intelligence (BI) is designed to resolve special problems business and managerial decision-making issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Martins, Oliveira, &amp; Popovič, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Petrini &amp; Pozzebon, 2009)</ref>. Put simply, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Vukšić, Bach, and Popovič (2013)</ref> believed that BI is targeted to analyze the available information and turned them into valuable knowledge to abate informational needs.</p><p>Previous studies have completely shown the importance of using BI as one of the main concerns of most chief information officers (CIO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Howson, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Işık, Jones, &amp; Sidorova, 2012)</ref>. Alongside all benefits discussed in previous research, it should be noticed that BI implementation may impose significant costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Rasmussen, Goldy, &amp; Solli, 2002)</ref>. The outcome of <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ramamurthy, Sen, and Sinha (2008)</ref> study, also revelead the fact that attempting to adopt and implement BI within an organization environment require a tremendous cost which should be considered precisely. Thus, given to the remarkable costs, it is better for organizations to focus on different aspect of this issue, as well as consider influential factors associated with adoption process <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Ravasan &amp; Savoji, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Previously, several studies have been conducted to explore different factors which may affect the information systems adoption decision such as e-procurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Teo, Lin, &amp; Lai, 2009</ref>), e-commerce <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Al-Qirim, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Grandon &amp; Pearson, 2004</ref>), e-business <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Zhu &amp; Kraemer, 2005)</ref>, data warehouse <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hwang, Ku, Yen, &amp; Cheng, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ramamurthy et al., 2008)</ref>, customer relationship management (CRM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hung, Hung, Tsai, &amp; Jiang, 2010)</ref>, knowledge management (KM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Xu &amp; Quaddus, 2012)</ref>, electronic data interchange (EDI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kuan &amp; Chau, 2001)</ref>. However, relatively few attempts have been conducted to determine the influencing factors associated with the adoption of BI systems. Thus, in considering the rapid increase in the amount of data throughout the organization and also with regard to the importance of managerial decision making, it is obvious that determining the most appropriate factors in terms of BI adoption have a deep impact on the decision to employ it <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hou, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hou, , 2014))</ref>. Further, it will be necessary for organizations as a strategic, broad map to take the proper action in the way of BI adoption.</p><p>As a result, the main objective of this study is to examine the adoption factors which affect on BI implementations in the financial industry in the context of Iran. Specifically, the paper seeks to address the following research question.</p><p>RQ1: What are the key tailored factors related to the adoption of BI systems regarding technology, organization, and environment (TOE) framework? RQ2: What are the major differences between adopters and non-adopters groups in the relationship with BI adoptive construct?</p><p>In response to the above research questions, this study attempts to identify the critical factors influencing the adoption of BI in the financial sector from the different perspective through survey data. Finally, there are several important contributions to IT adoption literature as follows:</p><p>• It offers a model incorporating a set of technological, organizational, and environmental in BI adoption that is validated using partial least squares (PLS).</p><p>• It provides an insightful understanding for enterprises to the forefront importance of perceived tangible and intangible benefits in BI adoption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>We target a large number of financial services include banking and insurance enterprises to validate the research model and hypotheses, which had been spotted not so obviously in the past.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. First, a literature review related to BI concept, the role of BI in particular in the financial services sector, and pertaining framework from an information systems adoption perspective is presented. Second, the proposed research model and hypotheses for investigating the adoption of BI is outlined, followed by the research method, data analysis, and results. For the next part, the discussion of main findings, limitations, and implications for both associated researchers and practitioners is provided. Finally, this paper concludes with a brief overview of the whole paper and proposes further possible directions for future research. According to prior literature, various definitions and approaches of BI have been appeared</p><p>by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ghazanfari, Jafari, &amp; Rouhani (2011)</ref>. In managerial perspective, BI is introduced to prepare a decision support context for decision-makers to make better understanding and managing organizational processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bose (2009)</ref> believed that BI intends to prepare the right information to the right people at the right time to improve decision making, further improve managerial proceeding and enterprise performance. In general, this approach sheds light on data gathering from different sources and use the achieved results in decision-making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ghazanfari et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Petrini &amp; Pozzebon, 2009)</ref>. Technological perspective introduced BI as set of analysis tools such as data mining and On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP), to provide automated decision making around business conditions, sales, customer demand, product preference, and so on. This perspective highly focused on technological tools used in managerial decision making to make the most acceptable results <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ghazanfari et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Petrini &amp; Pozzebon, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ghazanfari et al. (2011)</ref> introduced a new approach called system enabler in which the value added features on supporting information is on the focal point. In this regard, some researchers have benefited this approach in their studies that can be seen as a proof of the claim (W. W. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Eckerson, 2010)</ref>. In light of the above discussion, we adopt a balanced perspective and define BI as "…a strategic decision aid for organizations to collect, and analyze data sources using diverse technological tools to support organizational decision making and finally increasing organizational performance…" Nowadays, the financial industry is seen as one of the most important industries with great scope of information demands insofar as organizations struggle for achieving valuable insights from their data. To this end, enterprises attempt to make benefit from BI as a momentous tool to improve both information and service quality. Using BI help decision-makers to inform overall aspects of the organizations by analyzing the required information in detail and lead them toward desirable goals. Prior studies have completely stated about the key benefits of BI to firms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Howson, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Işık et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Turban, Sharda, Aronson, &amp; King, 2008)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lin, Tsai, Shiang, Kuo, and Tsai (2009)</ref> found that "…BI systems assist in understanding a business condition, improve stakeholder satisfaction, create beneficial opportunities, and measure organizational performance…" Castellanos, Gupta, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Wang, Dayal, and Durazo (2012)</ref> declared that BI adopters gain competitive advantage by increasing situational awareness which can influence operational decisions. The outcome of previous research shows that using BI systems have positive and significant influence on profit margin, revenue, and also internal process. In this area, BI systems attempts to improve the state and the performance of the organization at four following items: (1) the ability to obtain customer insights, (2) information delivery as fast as possible, (3) performance delivery in more efficient mode, and (4) risk management <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kerensky, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>However, BI systems are widely used in various industries in response to meet their business needs from a simple query and reporting function to advanced analytics such as data mining and dashboards <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Petrini &amp; Pozzebon, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Popovič, Hackney, Coelho, &amp; Jaklič, 2012)</ref>, but rarely mentioned the attributes influencing the adoption decision of BI by firms. In this regard, we propose a conceptual model by employing TOE framework which is described in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">IT/IS Adoption Theories</head><p>Reviewing earlier research clearly shows the fact that adoption models are increasingly applied from different angles to investigate factors influencing technology's intention to use <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lee &amp; Xia, 2006)</ref>. In terms of innovation adoption/diffusion, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Premkumar and Roberts (1999)</ref> proposed several factors that influence the decision to adopt an innovation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kwon and Zmud (1987)</ref> claimed that the foremost factors influence IT implementation stages classified into five groups, namely user/individual characteristics (e.g., education, job tenure, resistance to change), organizational characteristics (e.g., centralization, formalization, specialization), technological characteristics (e.g., complexity), task related characteristics (e.g., task autonomy, variety, and uncertainty), and environmental characteristics (e.g., uncertainty, interdependence). In general, a significant amount of IT adoption research has been conducted at both individual and organizational levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hameed, Counsell, &amp; Swift, 2012)</ref>. In individual perspective, research has focused on the individuals and what influences their decisions to use a particular technology. In turn, organization perspective has focused on factors considered to influence IT on firm-level adoption and its impact on the overall performance of the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Yang, Kankanhalli, Ng, &amp; Lim, 2013)</ref>. In general, the diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Rogers, 1995)</ref>, technology acceptance model (TAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Davis, 1989)</ref>, and the technology-organizationenvironment (TOE) perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Tornatzky &amp; Klein, 1982)</ref> are the most important theoretical lens which has been used in earlier IS research.</p><p>The DOI theory has been widely applied as a theoretical foundation in IT adoption field <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Premkumar &amp; Roberts, 1999)</ref>. This theory depicts five attributes of innovation such as relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Rogers 1995)</ref>. Further, the TAM model is proposed to predict user acceptance of IT and behavior of individuals in this term. In this theory, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Davis (1989)</ref> assumed that IT adoption by users has two perceived attributes, namely "perceived ease of use" and "perceived usefulness". Both mentioned theories have been used extensively in the innovation literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Park &amp; Kim, 2014)</ref>. However, these approaches are from the individual perspective and take no account about the influence of organizational and environmental attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hameed et al., 2012)</ref>. By the same token, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brancheau and Wetherbe (1990)</ref> believed that the DOI theory is unable to explain IT adoption at an organizational level.</p><p>TOE model approaches IT adoption issue from three separate dimensions, i.e., technology, organization, and an environment. Considerable scholarly research has focused on examining the impact of such framework and validated in influencing IT adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gu, Cao, &amp; Duan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Lu, Lin, &amp; Tzeng, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Premkumar &amp; Roberts, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Teo et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Yang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Zhu &amp; Kraemer, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Zhu, Kraemer, &amp; Xu, 2006)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Tornatzky, Fleischer, &amp; Chakrabarti (1990)</ref>, technological dimension consider both internal and external relevant technologies to the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Tornatzky and Klein (1982)</ref> indicated that the aim behind research in terms of innovation characteristics is to explore the relationships between the attributes of an innovation and the adoption decision. In this regard, they have found the top 10 technology-related attributes entail relative advantage, complexity, communicability, divisibility, cost, profitability, compatibility, social approval, trial ability, and observability. However, their findings expressed this issue that just three of them, namely relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity have a significant influence on adoption. The factors associated with organizational dimension are those that directly related to the organization which aims to adopt an innovation. These include several factors such as top management support, firm size, centralization, formalization, and presence of a champion. Finally, the environmental dimension explains the industrial settings in which an organization conducts its business. For the environmental dimension, there are fewer factors than other dimensions include factors like degree of competition, the level of uncertainty, industry type, and regulations.</p><p>As a result, unlike the DOI and TAM theories just focus on the adoption process in a standpoint of the individual, it is apparent which the TOE perspective shed light on adoption decisionas a unified framework in firm level by encompassing all required and effective aspects.</p><p>Hence, we find it consistent for this study as a starting point in our proposed framework and case analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">TOE Perspective</head><p>Based on prior studies, the lists of potential salient factors which have taken place under these three perspectives are lengthy. Hence, we have chosen to highlight those that have been suggested by prior research, are more important and clearly related to the adoption of BI. In light of the above arguments, it will be significant to have an accurate understanding of the key factors to ensure the successful adoption of BI technology. However, it was not feasible to comprise all potential factors affecting the adoption of BI, the election of the theoretical constructs in our model was determined through a widespread literature review as well as an informal interview with several BI specialists. Hence, this study examines the effect of various factors on the decision to adopt BI. As the research framework in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>  competition and rival's absorptive capacity that somewhat was applied in similar studies. In the next section, we will discuss our research model and hypotheses based on the three mentioned dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Technological Attributes and BI Systems Adoption</head><p>Technological attributes indicate the perceived characteristics of the innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Teo, Tan, &amp; Buk, 1998)</ref>. Several studies have been accomplished around the main drivers of IS adoption.</p><p>Among all factors, benefits, costs, and complexity of IS adoption are known as the most cited attributes in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Al-Qirim, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Premkumar &amp; Roberts, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ramamurthy et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>As <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Premkumar &amp; Roberts (1999)</ref> note, perceived benefits are the major stimulus in adopting new technologies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Tornatzky and Klein (1982)</ref> believed perceived benefits of an innovation directly and positively affect the adoption decision. Perceived benefits stem from BI systems are expected benefits that can be provided to the organization. BI can bring several benefits include cost reduction, increase revenue, real-time data, and time reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Turban et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>These benefits can be divided into two main sections including tangible and intangible (W. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Eckerson, 2003)</ref>. Tangible benefits are those directly related to gain dollar figure in organizations. Tangible benefits include time savings, cost savings, ROI, new revenues, the total cost of ownership, and shareholder value. In addition, intangible benefits are those difficult or sometimes impossible to quantify <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gibson, Arnott, Jagielska, &amp; Melbourne, 2004)</ref>. Intangible benefits include single version of the truth, better strategies and plans, better tactics and decisions, more efficient processes, greater customer/supplier satisfaction, greater employee satisfaction. Both tangible and intangible benefits affect the decision to adopt BI and can be utilized in this context. Given these potential stated benefits, we posit the following hypotheses:</p><p>H1: Perceived tangible benefits are positively related to the adoption of BIS.</p><p>H2: Perceived intangible benefits are positively related to the adoption of BIS.</p><p>From innovations costs perspective, the advantages of each new innovation should be higher than the costs of adopting it <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Premkumar &amp; Roberts, 1999)</ref>. In this respect, BI technology is no exception. For any organization, the adoption of BI systems accompanied with a very high cost of ownership. For example, the potential administrative and implementation costs which will get companies into trouble by developing BI. Furthermore, the relatively high cost of maintaining and implementing a BI system is a major factor which affects the adoption of BI. In this regard, the costs of a new technology have a major bearing on the decision to its adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lu et al., 2013)</ref>. In general, firms would like to hold the balance between both benefits and costs associated with the adoption of innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Teo et al., 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Tornatzky and Klein (1982)</ref> believed that technologies with lower perceived costs are more likely to be adopted. In other words, perceived cost of an innovation can be seen as an inhibitor in the adoption of new innovation (LaValle, Hopkins, Lesser, Shockley, &amp; Kruschwitz, 2010). Considering the above discussion, we posit the following hypothesis:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3:</head><p>The lower perceived costs the BIS have, the more positive the impact on the adoption of BIS.</p><p>Previous studies have been cited complexity as one of the major innovations-related attributes influencing the willingness of enterprises to adopt or not to adopt a new technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Damanpour &amp; Schneider, 2009)</ref>. Complexity refers to the degree to which an innovation is perceived as difficult to use and understand in the business environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Thong, 1999)</ref>. Put simply, complexity shows the difficulty in adopting an innovation, which may be presumed as the inverse of perceived ease of use in technology adoption research <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Davis, 1989)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Tornatzky and Klein (1982)</ref> found a significant and negative relationship between the complexity of an innovation and its adoption. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Rogers (1995)</ref>   <ref type="bibr">et al., 2010)</ref>. Hence, it is reasonable to expect that there is a negative relationship between perceived complexity and the decision to adopt BI systems in the financial sector. Therefore, we have the following hypothesis:</p><p>H4: The lower perceived complexity the BIS have, the more positive the impact on the adoption of BIS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Organizational Attributes and BI Systems Adoption</head><p>Based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Teo et al., (1998)</ref> definition, organizational attributes are those variables affecting the organizational structure that the organization could adjust or change to adapt its changing environment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Orlikowski (1993)</ref> believed that there is a meaningful relationship between the characteristics of the organization and the decision to employ a new technology. Organizational attributes, in turn, include business size <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Damanpour, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Teo et al., 2009)</ref>, organizational readiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Grandon &amp; Pearson, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Tsai, Lai, &amp; Hsu, 2013)</ref>, and organization strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Naranjo-Gil, 2009)</ref>. Particularly, the size of the business has been defined in terms of organization's resources, transaction volumes, or workforce size <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lee &amp; Xia, 2006)</ref>. Former studies have been widely focused on the relationship between the size of the organization and the decision to adopt an innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kuan &amp; Chau, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Sawang &amp; Unsworth, 2011)</ref>. Based on prior research, the greater the size of organizations is more likely to invest in new technologies and absorb the related risk because of having further financial and technology resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Grover &amp; Goslar, 1993)</ref>. Conversely, small organizations encounter suffering condition, include resource poverty arising from various condition include financial constraints, lack of professional expertise and so on <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Thong, 1999)</ref>. Because small organizations have more difficulty in IS adoption, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Sawang &amp; Unsworth (2011)</ref> noted that these orgamization are less likely to adopt. Hence, the size of the business is positively associated with the adoption of BIS. Thus, we proposed a hypothesis for the adoption of BI in the financial sector as follows:</p><p>H5: The larger the size is, the more positive the impact of the adoption of BIS.</p><p>Organizational readiness as a specific firm-related factor plays an important role in the decision to adopt an innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Grandon &amp; Pearson, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Tsai &amp; Tang, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Iacovou, Benbasat, and Dexter (1995)</ref> suggested that readiness is the main driver for organizations behind the adoption of technological innovation with respect to two aspects including financial and technological resources. Financial readiness refers to the organization capability to invest on new technologies, whilst technological readiness is focused on expertise and the level of technology sophistication. By the same token, given the several well-known characteristics related to BI containing require thousands of dollars and also high degree of technological expertise to use outcome analytics, it is not surprising to expect there is a positive relationship between organizational readiness and the adoption of innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wang &amp; Ahmed, 2009)</ref>. Hence, we proposed the following hypothesis for the adoption of BI:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H6:</head><p>The greater readiness the organization has, the more positive the impact of the adoption of BIS.</p><p>The strategy can be defined as an effective management tool which affects the competitive position of the firm. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Miles &amp; Snow, 1978)</ref> point of view, strategy inferred as the patterns of both major and minor decisions in terms of possible future whenever it is implemented within the organization structure and process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Miles and Snow (1978)</ref> established a well-known business strategy typology in three viable types including prospector, analyzer, and defender. In this paper, we use this typology to differentiate between two opposite strategies: defender vs.</p><p>prospector. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Miles &amp; Snow (1978)</ref>, prospectors are those that are more dynamic than the other organizations in the same industry. They are continually striving to become a first in the marketplace by focusing on new opportunities and responding to a wide range of services and products quickly. Although, organizations with prospector strategy, invest heavily for product/services R&amp;D and environmental scanning, but this emphasis leads firms to a lack of controls as well as reducing operational efficiency. In contrast, defenders refer to organizations which pursue a stable position with a focus on a narrow segment of a market. Within this limited domain, organizations tend to ignore developments and offer a relatively small range of services and products rather than becoming a pioneer <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Miles &amp; Snow, 1978)</ref>. In other words, they do not stress on new opportunities through searching in the outside domain, and most of their efforts are around the process improvement instead of product innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Sabherwal &amp; Chan, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Between the two mentioned strategic types which resides at the opposite ends of the continuum, there is one other type of organization called analyzer <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Miles &amp; Snow, 1978)</ref>. In fact, the analyzer is a combination of prospector and defender, which attempts to simultaneously achieve the following:</p><p>(1) minimizing the risks, and (2) maximizing the profits. In the simplest sense, analyzers are seeking to combine the strengths of prospectors and defenders into a single one. In this regard, they are interested in employing dual-core technologies mean simultaneously have both stable and flexible components. In sum, they do not eschew changes unlike defenders; additionally, they do not classify into initiator category to adopt new changes. Indeed, they will plan to follow the pioneers in response to the related changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Miles &amp; Snow, 1978)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr">Li and Tan (2013)</ref> represent that due to the hybrid nature of analyzers approach, both strategic and managerial features are not clearly articulated as like as defenders and prospectors.</p><p>Prior researchers widely used business strategy in a different context, such as organization performance <ref type="bibr">(Li &amp; Tan, 2013)</ref>, innovation success <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Ritter &amp; Gemünden, 2004)</ref>, and organizational innovativeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Yu, Dong, Shen, Khalifa, &amp; Hao, 2013)</ref>. However, few studies focus on the impact of business strategy on the adoption of innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bruque &amp; Moyano, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>For instance, Naranjo-Gil (2009) argued that hospitals with prospector strategy were more apt to adopt an innovation than those with using defender strategy. Furthermore, Bayo-Moriones &amp; Lera-López (2007) viewed strategy as an important factor which influences the diffusion of an innovation process. Consequently, we posit that the adoption issue can be better understood by taking into account the prospector strategy of the organizations. Therefore, we have the following hypothesis:</p><p>H7: The prospector strategy is positively related to the adoption of BI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Environmental Attributes and BI Systems Adoption</head><p>Environmental attributes are defined as changes in the business environment that create both threats and opportunities for an organization, also are usually beyond the control of management <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Teo et al., 1998)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Orlikowski (1993)</ref> states, an external environment has a significant role in an organization's decision to adopt new technology. In here, we adopt two factors, namely competition throughout the industry and rival's absorptive capacity as an environmental attribute which naturally affects the decision to adopt BI by enterprises. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barney (1991)</ref> stated, competitive advantage can be realized in strategies that increase effectiveness or efficiency, and is valuable, rare, and difficult to imitate. Both types of innovation comprise radical and incremental, are following this aim for organizations to provide better competitive situation and also differentiate itself from its competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gu et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hung et al., 2010)</ref>. As</p><p>Ramakrishnan, Jones, and Sidorova (2012) note, competitors are known as one of the key stimulus for organizations to use BI for reaching better insights. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cokins (2013)</ref> claimed that BI is the only way in making better decisions and gaining sustainable competitive advantage. Innovation and IS, in particular, are well recognized as a key driver of economic development and a basic source of competitiveness in the global marketplace. By the same token, <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Zhu et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hwang et al. (2004)</ref> believed that competition as environmental context can drive firms to employ new innovation to preserve competitive advantage. In addition, previous studies discussed that businesses with a higher competitive environment are more likely to turn to IT to achieve a competitive advantage. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the higher level of competition in industry environment will result to employ BI by enterprises. Based on the above arguments, we proposed the following hypothesis:</p><p>H8: Industry competition is positively related to the adoption of BIS. Now, organizations extremely rely on external sources of information to enhance innovative actions to stay ahead of the competitors. Nevertheless, firms confront several difficulties in profiting from the external source of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kostopoulos, Papalexandris, Papachroni, &amp; Ioannou, 2011)</ref>. Therefore, firms require developing their capabilities in exploiting the external domain knowledge through a term "absorptive capacity". An organizations' absorptive capacity represents the ability to exploit outside knowledge, recognize the value of new information, assimilate, and apply it more effectively to gain productive ends <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cohen &amp; Levinthal, 1990)</ref>. Based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cohen and Levinthal (1990)</ref> definition, absorptive capacity within organization attempts to identify and apply external knowledge from certain areas. In other words, it brings value to organizations by extracting new knowledge from external sources such as customers, suppliers, or competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Liu, Ke, Wei, &amp; Hua, 2013)</ref>. In this regard, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hollenstein (2004)</ref> believed that there are two main aspects of a firm's absorptive capacity for new technologies: First, the ability to assess technological opportunities in the context of new products and production techniques which primarily depends on the firm's endowment with human and knowledge capital.</p><p>Second, learning effects that may happen from former use of a technology with an antecedent of a specific technology containing constituent elements of later applied more advanced outputs. Likewise, to help innovative activities, organizations with a higher level of capacity to absorb new knowledge are more talented in harnessing new knowledge from the others. The main aim of this capacity is to absorb inputs, then generate outputs. Thus, without such capacity, different sectors cannot learn and consequently transfer knowledge from one to another <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lane, Salk, &amp; Lyles, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Tsai, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Recently, scholars characterized it as a crucial capability associated with knowledge creation and utilization in knowledge-based competition, which can assist firms to gain competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Liu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ramamurthy et al., 2008)</ref>. Particularly, it has been used in the diverse areas such as knowledge management, IT governance, IT business value, and IT innovation (Roberts, Galluch, Dinger, &amp; Grover, 2012). Although previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Vowles, Thirkell, &amp; Sinha, 2011)</ref> emphasized on the importance of this capability with respect to awareness about what it can provide, and how it can be prepared through it for organizations; but it has rarely been criticized from competitor capability and examining the relationship between this capability and the decision to adopt an innovation.</p><p>In competitive environment, this capability reacts in two ways. On one hand, it seems to</p><p>have a pulling roll from innovative activities when around rivals equipped with a greater absorption capacity. In such situation, an organization will not be able to cope with around competitors in terms of knowledge acquisition and utilization. On the other hand, it might provide additional efforts to be ahead of the competitors by innovating continuously. In here, this capacity between rivals plays a role in pushing the enterprise to focus on applying innovation in a business environment.</p><p>With such knowledge-intensive case, the competitive position of the firms is increasingly relying on their ability to use external sources of information to not only enhance organizational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kostopoulos et al., 2011)</ref>, but also remaining in the competitive environment and marketplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Sahay &amp; Ranjan, 2008)</ref>. Although, enterprises with greater ability to absorb both internal and external knowledge into their operations are more talented in adopting an IT innovation; however, other enterprises are forced to be in a similar vein for two main reasons encompass: retaining both customers and competitive position. To this aim, regardless of the capability of other competitors, organizations will likely to increase the ability required to absorb external information, create valuable knowledge, and finally apply it to commercial ends <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cohen &amp; Levinthal, 1990)</ref>. In sum, we assumed that there is a positive relationship between the capability to absorb external sources of information by competitors and the decision to adopt an innovation within the organizations. Hence, we pose our final hypothesis:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Dependent Variable</head><p>BI is known as a new IT issue in Iran market, specifically financial industry. In parallel, in research target population, due to growing necessity of analytics on environmental information to achieve the required knowledge to take a higher competitive position, organizations are increasingly attempting to employ different types of analytics and BI systems to obviate disabilities in terms of using a wide range of information. As above, the measurement items for the decision to adopt construct were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hung et al., (2010)</ref>. Five items covering (1) Our firm have not adopted, (2) Our firm was already planning to adopt BIS, (3) Our firm have partially adopted BIS, (4) Our firm have adopted BIS and promotion is in progress, and (5) Our firm have fully adopted BIS with profits, attempts to measure the decision to adopt BI systems throughout the industry (see Table <ref type="table">8</ref> in Appendix A).

In our case, it can be analyzed that enterprises tend to focus on long-term benefits with more strategic importance. Although, tangible benefits such as time saving, cost saving, and gaining new revenues for stakeholders are known as the main benefits. However, intangible ones represent a broader scope of benefits such as preparing better strategies and plans, developing more efficient processes, and increasing in employee satisfaction which focused on strategic positioning and long run instead of immediate benefits. As a result, in terms of such decision aid adoption focusing on longterm benefits are much more important for organizations and have a higher effect on the perception of senior executives.</p><p>Contrary to our prediction, the data analysis did not support the hypothesis perceived cost. Furthermore, as Wilk's lambda test shows, our logical reasoning approved about there is no differences between adopters and non-adopters in terms of perceived cost. One plausible reason is that although using the BI system may be costly, but it will be acceptable compared to a vast range of benefits prepared for organizations in strategic decision making and environmental awareness. Moreover, fostering the amount of internal and external data has forced enterprises to operate competitive tools with more capabilities in analytics rather than the others. Hence, it seems that the importance of utilizing IS with great analytical capabilities and long run benefits are higher than the perceived cost in the perception of senior executives in our cases.</p><p>Regarding with previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ramamurthy et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Yang et al., 2013)</ref>, it is also not surprising that the negative relationship between perceived complexity and the Furthermore, as shown in Wilk's lambda test, the perceived complexity is known as one of the discriminating factors among the others. With attention to this fact that most of BI technology adopters in our case have an IT department with more than 50 IT staff (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>-Sample characteristics), it can be inferred that with a greater size of IT staff, the required knowledge and technical capability of organizations in the adoption process will improve intensely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Organizational Attributes (Hypotheses 5-7)</head><p>Consistent with prior research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lee &amp; Xia, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">H.-F. Lin, 2013)</ref>, we found that the size of a business has positively influenced the decision to adopt BIS. In this relationship, larger firms tend to use BIS extensively compared to their smaller counterparts in their business processes. In addition, larger firms equipped with more technological and financial resources to adopt IT innovation, which significantly proposed before <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hung et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Teo et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>One plausible explanation for this finding about business size is that enterprises with more employees in IT department may have upper capabilities and expertise in applying IT-related changes. Also, it can infer that enterprises with higher annual revenues have more capacity to assign adequate budget in order to employ an IT innovation. In addition, another reason which could be considered for this result is that due to the existence of more hierarchical and multiple levels of decision making within larger organizations, those are more intended to use this capability to gain the specific benefits such as faster decision-making process (H.-F. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Lin, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>This study shows that the readiness of organizations has significant positive influence on the decision to adopt BIS. In line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Tsai et al. (2013)</ref>, our finding implies that the organizations with more readiness level are more likely to adopt BIS. One reasonable explanation for this phenomena is that firms with the greater level of financial and technological capacity to have more ability and chance to employ BI technology. Furthermore, it can be argued that the existence of top management support affects the perception of senior executives profoundly.</p><p>For the final attribute of organization dimension, we found that the strategy of the business has profoundly affected on the dependent construct. In this vein, enterprises with prospectororiented strategy takes more efforts to be in a competitive posture by using continuing innovation to make more progressive decisions in their business environment. In response to this plea, BIS with a capability to excavate environmental data and create new useful knowledge seems to be an appropriate innovation. In addition, firms with prospector strategy focus further on the main benefits derived from this kind of innovation. On this basis, one possible reason is that due to a wide and specific range of BIS benefits, prospector organizations trying to adopt this technology. Another explanation for this finding is that with respect to intensive competition throughout the industry, prospector organizations requires day to day innovative activities to keep their competitive position.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Environmental Attributes (Hypotheses 8-9)</head><p>We found the high industry competition makes BIS adoption more likely in Iranian financial industry. Financial institutes compete in rapid policy making, products development and novel services presentation and their managers usually prefer to use the BIS and real-time information for decision making. Therefore, with an increasing degree of competition throughout the industry and market, BIS adoption would be more likely.</p><p>In line with our prediction, the data analysis results showed that there is a positive relationship between the absorptive capacity of competitors and the decision to adopt BIS. One possible reason for this significant relationship is that although there are several internal factors can influence the decision to adopt an innovation by enterprises, but continually growing in environmental information forced enterprises to act more appropriately to this issue. In this vein, firms with higher capacity to absorb and utilize new knowledge in their business processes are more successful instead of lower firms. On this basis, we argued that enterprises within the same industry, in which competitors have more capacity to absorb environmental information throughout the business processes, have more tendency to adopt BIS. It is due to the fact that they want to increase their capacity in order to prevent from falling behind the competitors or even to surpassing them. Furthermore, with respect to the growing competition level in this area, the need to take an appropriate and real-time course of action using special analytics tools leads enterprises to employ such decision aid systems.</p><p>6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH ANd PRACTICE</head><p>Since, there are few studies assessing the main determinants of BIS adoption specifically in the context of the financial industry, our findings could provide several insightful implications for both academicians and practitioners as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Managerial Implications</head><p>With regard to technological attributes, we hypothesized that BI systems prepare relative advantages in here divided into tangible and intangible for an enterprise. The positive relationship between intangible benefits and BIS adoption suggests that BI is considered as a sophisticated approach by organizations to enhance decision-making ability and process the higher amount of information into the helpful pattern which enable the firms to achieve greater advantages in a long term. Surprisingly, our finding shows that intangible benefits from using BIS are more important in comparison with tangible benefits. For managers and decision makers, it suggests that excluding the obvious benefits, applying this new technology at work have an upper level of benefits which will appear during a time. Hence, it could be seen as an idealistic system for enterprises that have capacity in improving daily practices, besides taking greater attention on the strategic perspective to be competitive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1.">Technology Related Attributes</head><p>Given that IT adoption is accompanied with spending higher cost and time, it is related to the view of the organization which considers the initiative costs as a long term investment.</p><p>So, financial managers are recommended to see the long run benefits of using BI and consider the first costs of adoption as an investment which can return it two or three times greater by analyzing the required information and create a new way to be innovative at work. The outcome of this research uncovers that the perceived complexity of BI adoption should be considered as a crucial element by managers. For successful adoption, they must precisely expect the complex level of technology to deploy it in a specific environment. In this regard, it is preferred for firms to pay more attention of both required technological platform and knowledge and compare with the current status of firms' internal skills in order to find the gap. As a result, this finding prepares a chance for firms to decrease the distance between current and required state before any activity in line with adoption. Put simply, we can conclude that finding the best set of technological attributes including higher relative advantages as a facilitator and lower level of complexity; by taking cost as a long run investment into account will prepare the firm to adopt BI in the context of technological attributes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2.">Organizational Related Attributes</head><p>Besides the significant role of technological attributes, managers should also note internal environment. in this regard, the paper results suggest that firm size influence the decision to adopt BI. In here, we conducted the firm size measurement based on three items including a number of employees, number of IT staff, and finally annual revenue. The adoption of BI is not limited to large organizations. However, as well as earlier research, larger firms are more appropriate for using BI solutions. In this regard, it is recommended to financial managers to consider this reality that having an IT engineer's team into the firm could be desired in the face with IT-related changes. Also, managers should consider that using BI and analytics at workplace requires a high amount of the budget for the whole process of adoption and must plan before to apply it efficiently. In terms of strategic orientation, our finding claims that firms with prospector strategy tend more heavily to use this kind of analytical systems to achieve required gains. Put simply, the results steers the financial managers to see BIS as a competitive tool which can enhance their abilities in analyzing environmental data and brings a sustainable competitive advantage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3.">Environment Related Attributes</head><p>The final results shows that there is a positive relationship between the rivals absorptive capacity and decision to adopt BI. This issue clearly prepare an insightful fact that financial industry must pay more attention than before for utilizing analytical tools in order to cope with a large volume of the dataset and improve their capacity in using external sources of data. In other words, managers need to a higher amount of information to process and reach a realistic view from the surrounding environment. So, the growing trend of external information must be considered by managers for gaining the desired goal. Hence, this issue could act as an important guidline for firms within the industry to evaluate their current situation and evaluate with the leading firms in the same category. The results could be beneficial to not only preserve but also improve the competitive position in specific industry. In here, managers should consider that competition in the financial industry is based on raw data. Hence, they need to use highly sophisticated and complex systems in their firms to process the achieved information and generate high-value knowledge for increasing firm performance.</p><p>Furthermore, because of the great importance of adoption-related factors for adopting a new technology within the firms, the related decision-makers must completely evaluate the mentioned attributes in their own organizations before any acting in line with the adoption of BIS. Finally, we can mention the issues like policy making for suitable derivers and mechanisms to deploy business intelligence in banking and financial organizations based on discussed factors of this research; knowledge about the diversity of BIS and its adoption requirements for IT managers and discovering best combinations of organization size, type, market and strategy to facilitate BIS adoption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Implications for Research</head><p>First of all, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first research which theoretically argued about the decision to adopt BIS in the context of the technology-organization-environment framework and empirically tested the attributes influencing BIS adoption in the context of the financial industry. This study extended the knowledge of IT adoption in the financial business profile. Considering the growing interest in using advanced analytics, our funding has a remarkable value for enterprises in the financial area to obtain the promised benefits of BI systems at work. In this sense, the current study strengthens our understanding about the related, influencing factors which prepared the financial company to adopt BI.</p><p>In this research, we use the TOE model as one of the most popular organizational models in terms of adoption issues. Moreover, we divided the relative advantages of technology into tangible and intangible that has no study empirically validated it on BI adoption. It argues that intangible benefits from using BI have more addressed than tangible ones which shows us firms using BI as a competitive weapon to increase their knowledge processing and applicant it in their environment and gain competitive advantage. Further, the current study is among the first to examine the role of firms' strategic orientation on the adoption and validate it by an empirical investigation into the financial industry environment. In a similar vein, our study reaches this fact that firms with strategy orientation have more interest to use BI to preserve competitive position in industry area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Limitations and Future Research</head><p>There are several limitations in our study. First, we conducted our research model and hypotheses based on the TOE framework to test the key variables associated with the adoption of BI systems. For future research, adoption decision could be examined by other theoretical perspectives such as an institutional theory or expanding TOE framework by adding more dimensions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gu et al., 2012)</ref> to achieve full understanding for making the best decision on BI adoption. Second, we restricted ourselves to sampling based on merely financial industry. It means that we are not confident about the extent of achieving results are similar to other industries. Hence, we suggest in order prove and generalizing the results of this study, it must be exercised in an overall lens by validating within different industries. Third, the results of this study reflect the Iranian perspective. Put simply, cultural differences may have significant influence and create different results. Hence, it is recommended for future research to focus on cultural issues besides the other spects of BI adoption map it appropriately in their own business environment. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>believed that due to lack of required skills and knowledge, perceived complexity leads to resistance to employ new technology. Because, organizations are attempting to get ahead from their competitors through an appropriate response to three principal questions: (1) what is happening now, (2) what is likely to happen next, (3) what actions should be taken to obtain competitive results. Thus, lack of understanding of how to use BI and analytic have been found as the most important obstacle in adopting BI (LaValle</figDesc></figure>

Similarly, LaValle et al., (2010) research report released by MIT Sloan Management Review focused on the adoption barriers of BIS through a survey of 3000 executives. In their research paper, existing low understanding in terms of how to use analytics in business processes and lack of required knowledge to excavate environmental information are known as the most important inhibitors in organizations to adopt BIS. In this line, migration from the former systems to new technology and change in IT infrastructure of the organization in order to replicate it efficiently, surely face with several difficulties which deviant organizations in adopting new types of technology.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, factors influencing BI adoption were empirically investigated in banking and financial industry. A conceptual model based on TOE framework was proposed and tested with surveyed data and PLS technique. Highlighted achieved contributions are: (1) offering the comprehensive model incorporating a coherent set of technological, organizational, and environmental in the adoption of BIS (2) resulting that factors perceived tangible benefits, perceived intangible benefits, complexity, business size, organizational readiness, strategy, industry competition and competitors absorptive capacity affect on BIS adoption in surveyed industry (3) consequent it was not proved that perceived cost affects on BIS adoption. Helping in policy making for suitable drivers to deploy business intelligence and supply knowledge about the diversity of BIS and its adoption requirements and proposing important adoption factors to facilitate business intelligence systems and tools are among the insights and outcomes of this study.</figDesc></figure>

Therefore, the Wilk's lambda value for this aim is achieved 0.76 (Chi-square=12.63, significance=0.01). The results showed us, there are the significant differences between two groups which are adopters and non-adopters of BI systems. All required information such as discriminant loading, discriminant coefficient, mean and variance of each group are presented in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hair, Anderson, Tatham, and Black (1995)</ref>, we only considered variables with discriminant loading value greater than 0.3 as the main discriminators. In our case, the factors which have discriminant loadings greater than the significant threshold are perceived tangible benefits, perceived intangible benefits, complexity, the size of the organization, strategy, organization readiness, industry competition, and competitors' absorptive capacity.</p><p>5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>This study aims to empirically investigate the factors influencing the decision to adopt BI systems in the context of the financial services industry. In this study, we propose a conceptual model based on a well-known framework, namely TOE in which the decision to adopt an IT innovation influenced by three main attributes including technological, organizational, and also environmental. By reviewing prior research, we found four factors linked to technological attributes, namely perceived tangible benefits, perceived intangible benefits, perceived cost, and perceived complexity. In the organizational context, we used business size, organizational readiness, and strategy as the main organizational drivers which influence the decision to adopt or not to adopt an IT innovation. As final dimension, we examined the impact of industry competition and absorptive capacity from the competitors side as environmental attributes. In the following section, we argue about factors that have been considered in the proposed model in detail.</p></div>
