<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The purpose of the current study was to assess local residents' psychological support prior to hosting a mega-sporting event and to report preliminary results as to which factors of support affect local residents' attitudes toward hosting future mega-sporting events, using the case of the 2012 Super Bowl in Indianapolis. This study provides a theoretical model to examine local residents' psychological support factors using structural equation modeling, which helps the understanding of local residents in the process of supporting the hosting of mega-sporting events in the future. The results of this study indicate that the perceptions of positive outcomes from the event have the strongest relationship to feelings toward hosting future events. Therefore, governing bodies of the host community and the event should rely most heavily on the positive outcomes. While the negative factors were not as strongly related, they were still significant indicators of feelings toward future events. The part of the plans pertaining to growing community support should include ways that the negative impacts might be mitigated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The Super Bowl is one of the biggest 1-day competitive televised sporting events in the world. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Nielsen (2010)</ref>, more than 106 million people watched the 2010 Super Bowl XLIV on television in the US, which made it the most watched television program in history. Owing to heavy public attention on mega-sporting events, civic boosters and community residents often discuss hosting a Super Bowl or other mega-sporting events like the Olympic Games and the FIFA Soccer World Cup. Given this public attention on a host city, it is important to address the impacts hosting mega-sporting events has upon the local residents.</p><p>One such impact that is often discussed is that of economic impact. however, some of this discussion focuses on controversial issues involved with many applications of economic impact methodology including inaccurate estimating methods, legitimizing political positions, and mischievous procedures of economic modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berrett, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cornelissen, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Crompton, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Desbordes, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gratton, Shibli, &amp; Coleman, 2006)</ref>. Many economic impact studies focus on hosting mega-sporting events and are commissioned by political organizations that seek to support the planning and development of the event. These studies favor results that support the anticipated outcomes of the organization. While these economic impact studies are often conducted to support political perspectives of the planning and development of mega-sporting events <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gursoy &amp; Kendall, 2006)</ref>, relatively limited research has been carried out to discuss residents' psychological support.</p><p>While psychological impact is defined as perceived benefits (i.e., positive externalities) and/ or costs (i.e., negative externalities) after sporting events, psychological support is defined as local residents' psychological or financial willingness to host sporting events with expectation of benefits prior to hosting the events. Therefore, psychological support from local residents plays an important role in providing tangible and/or intangible justifications when planning for sustainability for developing mega-sporting events in the future. Not only does the success of sporting events depend heavily on the goodwill of the local residents but also the longevity of the positive impacts is likely to be determined by the level of local residents' support for the sporting event <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Deccio &amp; Baloglu, 2002)</ref>. Local residents' psychological support by implementing more democratic planning approach for hosting mega-sporting events, such as Toronto's bid for the 1996 Summer Olympic Games and Calgary Olympics, provided that community involvement and support may transform such event host experiences to become significant urban experiences for host and guests <ref type="bibr">(hiller, 1990)</ref>.</p><p>Although many sporting event impact studies tend to focus on only economic impacts, noneconomic impacts like psychosocial perceptions should be considered as an important part of the total impacts for hosting sporting events <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bob &amp; Swart, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Crompton, 2004)</ref>. Psychological impacts include increased awareness and visibility for the host community, enhanced image, and emotional and psychological benefits that residents perceive, whether or not they attend sporting events or are involved in host organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bob &amp; Swart, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Crompton, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Turco, 1995)</ref>. Mega-sporting events such as the Super Bowl, Olympics, FIFA Soccer World Cup, or Tour de France provide an opportunity for building community consciousness and social bonding. hosting mega-sporting events is increasingly used as a part of strategies for developing a sense of community <ref type="bibr">(hall, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Morgan, 1997)</ref>. When a city hosts a sporting event, not only are direct participants affected but also a broad segment of the population becomes excited and identifies with the event. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Crompton (2004)</ref> suggests, a sporting event is an investment in emotional infrastructure and provides benefits to communities in addition to economic impacts. It is also suggested that conducting psychological impact studies would be an effective way to influence local residents positively and provide more legitimate underpinning for public support of hosting mega-sporting events <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gursoy &amp; Kendall, 2006)</ref>. hosting mega-sporting events require considerable investment of human, financial, and physical resources from host communities; thus, a lack of coordination and support from host city residents may cause problems in planning and preparing for hosting a sporting event <ref type="bibr">(haxton, 1999)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Fredline and</ref><ref type="bibr">Faulkner (2001), hiller (1990)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gursoy and Kendall (2006)</ref> have suggested that there are several important reasons why it is necessary to conduct background research so that an understanding of psychological support from local residents can be gained. First, local residents are often asked to vote for increasing tax to financially support for constructing or renovating infrastructure and facilities. Second, local residents are critical in transforming a mega-event into an urban festival to provide a significant experience for themselves and event guests. Third, local residents' support and involvement are likely to increase the longevity of positive impacts on the local community. Fourth, understanding that local residents' support is related to residents' reaction to an event, efforts could be made to minimize negative impacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fredline &amp; Faulkner, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">hiller, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gursoy &amp; Kendall, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The purpose of this article is to build on the existing body of knowledge by further developing and testing a model to aid in the understanding of local residents' psychological support for hosting mega-sporting events. First, there will be a review of literature pertaining to psychological impacts, specifically positive and negative externalities. Second, a review of social exchange theory will guide the future development and refinement of a model presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lee, Shin, and Park (2009)</ref>.</p><p>Next, the article will discuss the structural equation model used to identify and test components of psychological support and present the results from this analysis. Implications and suggestions for future directions targeted toward marketing and management of mega-sporting events are provided.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Positive Externalities</head><p>Externalities are defined as economic or social effects, which are benefits or costs that occur from an economic activity that affects people other than those directly involved in a market transaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Santo, 2010)</ref>. Positive externalities are referred to as the benefits on third parties by hosting megasporting events <ref type="bibr">(Leed &amp; Allemen, 2005)</ref>. For example, mega-sporting events can generate positive outcomes and consequences for the hosting communities that include image and awareness enhancement, leisure resource development, positive economic impacts, and infrastructure development <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Burns, hatch, &amp; Mules, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Crompton, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lee et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Morgan, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Preuss, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Turco, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>One positive externality that mega-sporting events generate is the significant amount of media exposure for the hosting communities before, during, and after their occurrence <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Crompton, 2004)</ref>. Favorable and concentrated publicity for hosting communities from national and international media is considered as one of the biggest benefits for hosting the sporting events. Since the spread of television during the late 1950s, hosting mega-sporting events has become one of the most effective ways to improve positive image and be shown as a successful community <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Whitson &amp; Macintosh, 1996)</ref>. Because sporting events may enhance the positive tourism image of an area, there is the potential for future economic benefit by attracting new visitors, resulting from this increased community visibility and image <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Lee et al., 2009)</ref>. The pervasive popularity of sporting events has convinced communities that hosting sporting events may be a useful vehicle to enhance their images. The enhanced image can have long-term positive effects on tourism and tourism investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Preuss, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>hosting mega-sporting events, many times, provides an opportunity to develop or renovate leisure and recreational sport resources. For instance, a significant increase in physical activity participation using the renovated World Cup facilities was recorded as a result of the 2006 Soccer World Cup in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Buss, 2007)</ref>. For the 2010 World Cup, an estimated over $1 billion was spent in building and renovating 10 stadiums, training of volunteers, multisport code festivals, and recreation events and grass roots development projects, which add to capacity and resource provisions that are earmarked for providing more opportunities and quality experiences in sport and recreation across the country <ref type="bibr">(Wikipedia, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>hosting sporting events can also stimulate the growth of existing businesses and establishment of new ones. Constructing or renovating sport facilities fosters surrounding development because they are physically interwoven with components of local businesses. New sport facilities are likely to capture much of the spending that used to occur in nearby businesses like restaurants, bars, hotels, and merchandise stores <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Seigfried &amp; Zimbalist, 2000)</ref>. Visibility of the hosting community and the resulting prosperous image from appearing on national and international media may induce more opportunities to attract other future mega-sporting events, conventions, and businesses. These mega-sporting events may generate other business development opportunities for local businesses in supplying products and services and making export opportunities for some manufactured products, which also result in additional spending by nonresidents associated with the events <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Lee et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>There is evidence that mega-sporting events like the Super Bowl or Olympic Games have a beneficial effect on urban economies through direct economic impact. For example, hotchkiss, Moore, and Zobay (2003) examined certain counties in Georgia for evidence of effects from hosting the 1996 Summer Olympic Games. They found that employment rates rose by 17% more than they did in non-Olympic venue counties. J. M. humphreys (1994) also examined the effect on Georgia in hosting the 1994 Super Bowl. he estimated that the economic impacts of hosting the Super Bowl were $166 million in spending, $56 million in additional earnings, and 2,736 jobs created. Another study, conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Blake (2005)</ref>, analyzed the impact on gross domestic product (GDP) "with" and "without" the Olympics for the 2012 Olympics in London using a computable general equilibrium model (CGEM). The study found that positive economic impacts from the London Olympics will be distributed into expenditures on infrastructure enhancements. Between 11% and 12% of the effect on GDP is attributable to expenditure on infrastructure development for the UK and more specifically London <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Blake, 2005)</ref>. Impacts from mega-sporting events can be widely distributed through infrastructure development as the host city prepares for these events. While research has found evidence of direct economic impact, it is important to consider the residents' perceptions of impact when examining community support for hosting megasporting events.</p><p>There are some examples where events were considered a catalyst for urban restructuring and embodied general trends in urban development and planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baade &amp;Matheson, 2004)</ref>. For example, the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games were the best example of how hosting a mega-sporting event with public support can provide development of infrastructure for improved quality of life for local residents. This event provided an important incentive and target date to complete long-held visions to develop road and transportation system infrastructure, housing, office and commercial developments, and hotel facilities. The Olympic Games left a comprehensive physical legacy that provided the basis for Barcelona's subsequent economic regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Carriere &amp; Demaziere, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>A mega-sporting event increases the opportunity that a host community will use the event as a basis for wide-scale redevelopment as Beijing did for the 2008 Olympic Games <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Broudehoux, 2007)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Magdalinski and Nauright (2004)</ref> proposed that one of the most common and successful strategies for civic boosters to obtain public subsidies in developing infrastructure was hosting mega-sporting events.</p><p>Although hosting mega-sporting events is extremely costly for host sites, previous studies suggested that one of the most significant perceived benefits of sporting events by residents was lasting facilities created for the event and used by locals after the event <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Crompton, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gratton, Dobson, &amp; Shibli, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Goldman, &amp; Nakazawa, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Preuss, 2005)</ref>. Financial support from local residents for sporting events becomes greater if the locals perceive infrastructure development for sporting events as something that will improve the facilities that the locals can enjoy or that would increase the opportunities of sport activities for the communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Noll &amp; Zimbalist, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Steiner &amp; Thöni, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Turco, 1995)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Negative Externalities</head><p>Although most civic and sport boosters likely focus only on the positive economic and psychosocial impacts, there have been several negative externalities, which are defined as the costs that are imposed on third parties by hosting sporting events. The negative externalities perceived by local residents in hosting mega-sporting events are well recognized by the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Crompton, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Dwyer, Mellor, Mistilis, &amp; Mules, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Getz, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">haynes, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">higham, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">J. M. humphreys &amp; Plummer, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Preuss &amp; Solberg, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">rascher, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Tosun, 2002)</ref>. roche (1994) also stated that mega-events were short-term events but had long-term consequences with negative aspects for the host cities in many cases. For example, hosting mega-sporting events is likely to cause some negative externalities including negative economic impacts, traffic problems and crowding, and societal and cultural problems.</p><p>Economic impact studies of mega-sporting events are often exaggerated by overestimating the economic gains and underestimating the costs involved for preparing the events <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barclay, 2009)</ref>. Although mega-sporting events will receive heavy attention from the public and media, a simple cost benefit analysis often indicates that the costs of hosting the event exceed the positive and direct economic impacts related to increased tourist spending by a wide margin, and the presence of positive benefits depends on factors like improvements of infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(B. humphreys &amp; Prokopowicz, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>For example, based on a study of six Super Bowls that dated back to 1979, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Porter (1999)</ref> found "no measurable impact on spending associated with the event. The projected spending and spillover benefits of regional impact models never materialize" (p. 61). he also found that hotel occupancy rate and retail sales in a host city are not statistically increased during the Super Bowl compared to similar dates in non-Super Bowl years <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Porter, 1999)</ref>. Other studies indicate little evidence that hosting sporting events for the sake of community development with public subsidies provided significant positive economic impacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(hamilton &amp; Kahn, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">rosentraub, 1994)</ref>. Instead of economic gains, many cities that have hosted mega-sporting events have experienced a deficit after the events. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Preuss (2004)</ref> estimated that the Sydney Olympics Organizing Committee for the 2000 Summer Olympics Games experienced losses of more than $45 million. A more recent example estimated that the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Organizing Committee also spent more than it made to prepare for the games and ran a deficit of C$48.1 million in 2008, compared to the C$60.9 million surplus it had in <ref type="bibr">2006</ref><ref type="bibr">-2007</ref><ref type="bibr">("Olympics," 2008))</ref>. Upcoming host cities like London for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games and Sochi for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games are already reportedly facing financial difficulties to prepare for the Games <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andranovich, Burbank, &amp; heying, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The costs of hosting mega-sporting events have increased significantly in recent years from the investment not only for constructing venues and developing all the infrastructures but also for the heightened security issue. Mega-events have reportedly become attractive targets for potential terror attacks after the event of September 11, 2001, causing physical protection programs in the sport facilities to become a critical infrastructure issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Appelbaum, Adeland, &amp; harris, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Atkinson &amp; Young, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Viuker, 2002)</ref>. It may be difficult to collect these costs through sponsorship, media contracts, and ticket sales, possibly leading to higher taxes being levied from the local residents.</p><p>Sporting events are also likely to create some noneconomic cost problems such as traffic congestion, increasing crime rate, and law enforcement strain (haynes, 2001; J. M. humphreys &amp; Plummer, 1995). <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Coates and humphreys (2002)</ref> found that some local residents felt the additional traffic, noise, and increased garbage were too high a price to pay for whatever benefits they may obtain by living near an arena or stadium. In addition, some previous studies discussed other societal and cultural problems including the negative influences on traditional family values <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Mihalik &amp; Cummings, 1995)</ref>, cultural commercialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Witt, 1988)</ref>, unfair relocation of local residents <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Sweeney, 2009)</ref>, and conflicts and antagonism between visitors and local residents because of different standards of living, economic welfare, and purchasing power gaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Tosun, 2002)</ref>. Local residents are often excluded from participation in the event due to high costs for consumption in mega-sporting events <ref type="bibr">(higham, 1999)</ref>. For example, on the official fan-to-fan resale site run by the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VOC), seats for the gold medal hockey game between the US and Canada were offered for several thousand dollars apiece <ref type="bibr">(Vancouver Olympics, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Mega-sporting events may also damage the image of the host city as a result of inadequate facilities or improper procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dwyer et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Getz, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Tosun, 2002)</ref>. In other words, host cities may lose more than they gain in terms of destination image. Capacity constraints, financial costs, displacement of local residents, and political activism have the potential of causing negative publicity. Displacement or removal of local residents takes place where cities are eager to capitalize on the destination image <ref type="bibr">(higham, 1999)</ref>. For example, in advance of the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games, 720,000 local residents were forcibly and unfairly removed, thousands of low-income tenants and small businesses were forced out of Barcelona before the Olympic Games, and more than 9,000 homeless were arrested in the lead-up to the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Olds, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Shapcott, 1998)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Sweeney (2009)</ref> indicated that 1.5 million people were relocated and unfairly compensated as a part of infrastructure development programs of the Beijing Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games (BOCOG) for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games in China.</p><p>Destruction of the physical and natural environment is another critical concern. hosting megasporting events with the construction of sport facilities and development of infrastructure possibly causes environmental damage due to the use of nonrenewable resources, emission of toxic substances, and production and disposal of sport equipment <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Jagemann, 2003)</ref>. These negative physical and environmental impacts include changes in land use, pollution, and deterioration of cultural or historical resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dwyer et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">rascher, 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bess (1999)</ref> also demonstrated that architectural designs for megasize sport facilities forced a change in the locations of sport facilities from greenfield sites to brownfield sites created by demolishing other buildings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose of the Study</head><p>The purpose of this study was to build on existing knowledge by developing and testing a structural equation model to assess local residents' psychological support factors of mega-sporting events and how the psychological factors affect local residents' attitudes toward hosting future mega-sporting events. This study was conducted using the case of the 2012 Super Bowl that will be hosted in Indianapolis. This study sought to provide a theoretical model to examine local residents' psychological support factors using a structural equation model, which presents the understanding of local residents for supporting hosting mega-sporting events in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Proposed Model</head><p>The proposed model in this study has its conceptual and theoretical basis in social exchange theory and is developed from previous studies that focus on measuring psychological impacts for a hosting mega-sporting event <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Delamere, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Delamere, Wankel, &amp; hinch, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fredline &amp; Faulkner, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Fredline, Jago, &amp; Deery, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gursoy &amp; Kendall, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Jurowski, Uysal, &amp; Williams, 1997)</ref> Specifically, these studies implied social exchange theory to explain the perceptions of possible direct or indirect impacts through mega-sporting events, which may depend on how local residents evaluate the exchanges in which they are involved.</p><p>Social exchange theory suggests social change and stability as a process of negotiated exchanges between parties <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Emerson, 1976)</ref>. This theory posits that all human relationships are formed by the use of a subjective cost-benefit analysis and the comparison of alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Lee et al., 2009)</ref>. For example, social exchange theory indicates that local residents are likely to support mega-sporting events as long as they can expect benefits of any development, and these expected benefits will exceed the expected costs. Although political leaders and event organizers frequently tend to ignore the possible negative externalities or impacts and glorify the expected positive externalities, hosting mega-sporting events are likely to stimulate both positive and negative externalities in several spheres, such as economic, tourism and related business, physical, sociocultural, psychological, and political impacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Delamere, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Fredline et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">ritchie, 1984)</ref>.</p><p>Social exchange theory has been utilized as an appropriate and effective foundation to study residents' perceptions for hosting mega-sporting events <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ap, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bryant &amp; Napier, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gursoy, Jurowski, &amp; Uysal, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Jurowski et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Perdue, Long, &amp; Kang, 1999)</ref>. It is supported that this theory may explain residents' motivations for entering into an exchange or their lack of support for such an exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Deccio &amp; Baloglu, 2002)</ref>. This theory suggests that the primary motivation for initiating exchange from the residents' perspectives is to improve the community's possible development by hosting a mega-sporting event. Kim, Gursoy, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lee (2006)</ref> found that residents in South Korea believed that the 2002 FIFA World Cup would generate a high volume of economic and cultural benefits for the community before the event, but realized that the benefits, especially the economic gains, were lower than they had expected after the event. On the other hand, several previous studies have confirmed that there is likely to be a direct relationship between the positive evaluation of social and cultural impacts received by hosting sporting events and support for future events <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Besculides, Lee, &amp; McCormick, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Brunt &amp; Courtney, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lankford &amp; howard, 1994)</ref>. Positive evaluations of the results arising from the social exchange may reinforce the desire for future participation in the relationship. If the perceived benefits from events outweigh the costs, residents in the local community are likely to support and participate in future exchange relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ap, 1992)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instrument Development</head><p>The purpose of this study was to assess local residents' psychological support of mega-sporting events and identify which factors of support affect local residents' attitudes toward hosting future mega-sporting events. This main data collection method of this study was a self-administered paper survey that consisted of three pages and a total of 41 items. To develop the survey, there were two pilot data collections to test specific aspects of the questionnaire. The primary basis for the initial item pool came from a similar study of perceptions of a women's professional golf event <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Lee et al., 2009)</ref> as well as additional items from other studies of residents' perceptions of mega-events <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Delamere, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Delamere et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Fredline &amp; Faulkner, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Fredline et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gursoy et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Gursoy &amp; Kendall, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Milnthorp, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Winters, 2004)</ref>. The items developed from this literature review were measured on a 7-point Likert-type scale to assess the level of agreement to statements pertaining to perceived impact of a mega-sporting event. For example, respondents were asked to rate the level of agreement with the statement "I believe hosting a mega-event in my city will bring positive economic impact" from "strongly disagree" (1 on the scale) to "strongly agree" (7 on the scale). Each of the items followed the same pattern.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pilot Tests</head><p>Following the generation of the initial item pool, further development of the questionnaire entailed several steps. To determine the reliability of the proposed factors, an initial pilot study was conducted to test the items and function of the survey. This sample consisted of faculty and undergraduate students from a large Midwestern university (n = 73). Since the questionnaires used in this study were modified from different economic and social impact contexts, content validity was a concern.</p><p>The content validity of the questionnaires was verified using a panel of experts comprised of faculty and practitioners in sport management. Five panel members were asked to review each of the questionnaires carefully to determine whether the individual items adequately represented the domains of the constructs. All of the experts agreed that the original questionnaires selected and modified by the researchers were acceptable for use in data collection.</p><p>The primary objective from the first pilot was to examine the function and consistency of the proposed items and factor structure. Each proposed factor and corresponding list of items were examined for reliability independently of the other factors and their corresponding items. Cronbach's α was calculated for each factor, and the factor loadings for each item were also determined. The results from the first pilot study are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> Once the consistency within each factor was determined, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted in a second pilot study with additional respondents from the same Midwestern university (n = 170). The objective of this pilot test was to go beyond factor reliability and further test the proposed model structure to examine if the factors correlated to each other as expected. Utilizing the software program EQS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bentler, 2005)</ref>, the level of fit between the proposed model and the collected data was determined using the indices recommended by hu and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Bentler (1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Bentler ( , 1999))</ref>, comparative fit index (CFI), normed fit index (NFI), root mean square error of approximation (rMSEA), and standardized root mean square residual (SrMr). The Satorra-Bentler chi-square (SBx 2 ) was used in the analysis due to its ability to minimize the effects of multivariate kurtosis found in the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Satorra &amp; Bentler, 1994)</ref>. To test construct validity, item factor loadings were investigated for appropriate strength as well as tested for appropriate structure. Adjustments to the model were made after careful consideration of the item and the Lagrange multiplier (LM) test <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Byrne, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kline, 2005)</ref>. The initial results from the second pilot test revealed a moderately weak fit [SBx 2 (384) = 724.60, CFI = 0.789, NFI = 0.695, SrMr = 0.086, rMSEA = 0.093]. The factor loadings from this first analysis are included in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Examination of the LM test reveals several items that share common error variance with items associated with different factors. After several iterative steps, the model was adjusted slightly to reflect these covariances. Several items were found to relate closely to other factors, for example, the items in the factor "infrastructure development" were closely related to the items in the "sport resource development," indicating that the respondents view these types of development as closely related when considering the benefits of a mega-sporting event such as the Super Bowl. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> displays the changes in the model and the adjusted factor loadings. These changes increase the fit to a moderate level [SBx 2 (356) = 584.03, CFI = 0.849, NFI = 0.774, SrMr = 0.080, rMSEA = 0.071].</p><p>Another important consideration when examining a model is discriminant validity. Factors should correlate with each other but not so strongly that they represent the same construct (i.e., &lt;0.85; Kline, 2005). It was assumed to this point that these factors are all related to each other as representative of a single higher psychological notion of the impacts of the Super Bowl in the respondents' community. An examination of the correlations shows moderate relationships in two categories. These categories represent the positive impacts as slightly different from the negative impacts. These correlations between factors are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and Procedure</head><p>The primary data were collected for 5 days in a shopping mall in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, during the month of April 2010. Subjects were selected using a systemic sampling technique and restricted to only adults 18 years of age and older. The collectors intercepted every 10th person entering at the front of the main gate of the shopping mall and asked them to complete a paper survey. Upon agreement, they were handed a clipboard with the survey and a writing tool. The collected data were analyzed using the Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences (SPSS 17.0) program and EQS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bentler, 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analyses</head><p>A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to assess the consistency between the hypothesized structure and the structure found in the data. This analysis was conducted using the procedures outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Byrne (2006) and</ref><ref type="bibr">hatcher (1994)</ref>. To assess the level of Indianapolis residents' psychological support for hosting the Super Bowl, structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed structure as found in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. residents' attitudes toward future development and sport events was measured using three statements on a 7-point Likert-type agreement scale: "I believe the city and/or state should host more mega-sized sporting events," "I believe the city and/or state should invest more for constructing or renovating sport infrastructures," and "I support hosting the Super Bowl in 2012." results Descriptive statistics were calculated for each of the continuous sociodemographic variables that are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. The total number of subjects used for the research was 413, comprised of 195 males (47.2%) and 218 females (52.8%), and most reported were at the age of <ref type="bibr">18-30 (n = 195, 47.2%)</ref>. Specifically, the age of the subject ranged from 18 to 74 years old (M = 37.97, SD = 13.07). More than 93% of the respondents were between 21 and 50 years old. For the status of ethnicity, the majority of survey respondents were Caucasian (n = 313, 75.8%), followed by African American (n = 44, 10.7%), hispanic (n = 16, 3.9%), Asian (n = 8, 1.9%), Native American (n = 4, 1.0%), and others (n = 28, 6.8%). Based on US census data from 2010, gender and age were representative of the population. When examining the responses for ethnicity, it appears that there was an oversampling of Caucasian compared to Marion County (63%) but in line with estimates for the greater Indianapolis area (73%) (Marion and contagious counties). Zip codes were collected and analyzed, revealing that 52.3% were from Indianapolis and 83.1% were from the greater Indianapolis area. Only 3.5% were from out of state and were excluded from the analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model</head><p>The first step in the data analysis was to conduct the CFA, comparing the model refined through the pilot tests with the structure of the collected data. The results from the initial analysis show a moderate fit similar to that of the second pilot study  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Construct validity was again checked, and the correlations between latent factors are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Further evidence was shown in the correlations that there are two factors, positive and negative structures, to residents' perceptions of outcomes in hosting a Super Bowl.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final Structural Model</head><p>In order to test the second part of the study objective, to determine which factors of support affect feelings toward future development, a structural equation model was tested. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>   relatively well on the latent variable of residents' feelings toward future events. Two of the three latent variables that influence negative perceptions of outcomes loaded well, with only perceptions of negative economic impact not loading strongly (0.677) on residents' feelings toward future events. Support for hosting the Super Bowl and support for hosting more mega-sporting events loaded well, while investing more in sport infrastructure was not quite as well.</p><p>Overall, positive perceptions have a strong relationship with feelings toward future events, while negative perceptions do not necessarily lead to a decrease in feelings toward the future; however, it was still a significant relationship in the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and Conclusions</head><p>Communities are increasingly drawn to host mega-sporting events due to promises of positive impacts including economic, resource development, infrastructure development, and others. Although economic impact studies are often used as a monetary justification for hosting events, these methods are often criticized for their controversial methodologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berrett, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cornelissen, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Crompton, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Desbordes, 2007)</ref>. It has been suggested that studies of the impacts of mega-sporting events should include psychosocial impacts to gauge the level of acceptance by the local community <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bob &amp; Swart, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Crompton, 2004)</ref>. The purpose of this study was to assess local residents' psychological support of mega-sporting events and identify which factors of support affect local residents' attitudes toward hosting future mega-sporting events.</p><p>The model presented supports the impact of residents' perceptions of the event on feelings toward hosting future events. These impacts were demonstrated through perceptions of image and awareness, resource development, economic impact, business development, societal concerns, and traffic and crowding. The model also supports the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lee et al. (2009)</ref> of a seven-factor model with four positive and three negative components. The final list of items used for this study captures the psychological relationships within the study sample. The refinement of this scale using two pilot studies provides a stable inventory that is theoretically and empirically sound. One interesting adjustment to the proposed model was the psychological relationship between infrastructure development and business development. New businesses, new jobs, and infrastructure redevelopment were closely related (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), but separate from leisure resource development (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). This result is slightly different from the relationship of perceptions of infrastructure and sport facility availability as suggested previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Noll &amp; Zimbalist, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Turco, 1995)</ref>. Sport and leisure development is psychologically different than infrastructure development for the study sample. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows that the relationship between leisure development and future support is the weakest of the four positive factors. residents are somewhat more willing to support jobs and businesses than to support leisure and sport development.</p><p>This study was conducted 18 months prior to hosting the 2012 Super Bowl in Indianapolis, which may impact the perceptions of the event. residents have not had any experience with any of the preparations for the event, so they may not have accurate perceptions of the negative impacts such as traffic, crowding, or societal concerns. The SEM model shows that positive perceptions were highly related to feelings toward future events, while negative perceptions had little relationship to these feelings. Future studies would benefit looking at feelings both just prior to the event, just following the event, and again after an extended time. These changes in perception can go a long way to helping find additional support in hosting sporting events and identifying ways to better plan and present future events.</p><p>When examining the SEM results (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>), it can be seen that the four positive factors (image and awareness, leisure resource development, positive economic impact, and business development) were highly and fairly equally related through the perceptions of positive outcomes latent factor. however, when looking at the negative items, traffic and societal concerns are highly related, but negative economic impact was not. This result might reveal the higher concern about immediate negative actions rather than dealing with long-term changes in the economic situation, that is, traffic during the event or increased crime due to the number of people in town for the event. Similarly, residents are proud to host a Super Bowl and support future sporting events but feel less strongly about investing more in the sport infrastructure for future events. This perhaps signifies a slight indifference toward future investment, which can have an impact on organizers looking to garner resident support for investing in sport facilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications and Future research</head><p>The current study has clarified positive and negative externalities on a host community's perceptions to support hosting a mega-sporting event, and its assessment of the model has demonstrated how positive externalities affect the residents' willingness to support hosting a mega-sporting event. Since residents' involvement and support have become more important to bid and prepare for a sporting event such as the Olympic Games <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gursoy &amp; Kendall, 2006)</ref>, event governing bodies and administration should focus more on positive externalities to increase the level of residents' support. As it is widely accepted, the host community governing bodies should develop plans for fostering positive externalities and feelings toward the sporting event, and accordingly, they should rely most heavily on the positive outcomes. Although the negative factors were not as strongly related based on the results of the current study, they were still significant indicators of residents' perceptions toward future sporting events. The part of the plans pertaining to growing community support should include ways that the negative impacts might be mitigated.</p><p>host governing bodies should focus on these positive and psychological externalities to stimulate the economic benefits of hosting an event to the residents. Presentation of information concerning both psychological and economic benefits to the local residents may enhance residents' perception levels toward hosting more future sporting events with possible developments of local business and infrastructure systems. It is also important to identify the potential impact of negative perceptions and include messages to minimize these impacts. Efforts to communicate to the residents in the host community(s) should be targeted to highlight the factors that have the strongest impact on positive perceptions while educating the residents about efforts to minimize potential negative impacts.</p><p>As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lee et al. (2009)</ref>, the results of this study also confirm the social exchange theory, which explains that local residents who perceived positive externalities (i.e., new business, new job, and infrastructure development) from hosting the event are supportive of future sporting events. This result emphasized that sporting event host governing bodies should clearly identify and provide possible positive and negative externalities to the residents and induce their willingness to support hosting future mega-sporting events.</p><p>While this study does have implications for hosts and managers of mega-events, there are some limitations in this study. In many ways, this is a case study involving the location and specific event of Superbowl XLVI. The model proposed and analyzed here would need to be further tested and validated in other locations and for other events. Additionally, the data for this study were collected in a public retail space, which limits the true generalizability of the findings.</p><p>A couple of recommendations for future studies have been drawn from the current study. As mentioned, a comparative study before and after the event is recommended to assess the changes in perception of residents for hosting sporting events. The results of local residents' perception differences before and after the event with their expected and perceived impacts may have an influence on hosting future sporting events. This study has a limited sample in choosing only residents in the Super Bowl host city. Expanding the sample to a wider variety of other cities' residents around the US is necessary for future studies, which would provide different levels of interest in hosting mega-sporting events. references</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>.
