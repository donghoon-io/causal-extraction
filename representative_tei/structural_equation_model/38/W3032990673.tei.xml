<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The main purpose of this quantitative relational research is to test the theoretical framework within the structural equation model that if the perceived supervisor support affects the perception of school effectiveness, engagement to work, job satisfaction, and organizational cynical attitude. The sub-purpose of the study is to examine the relationship between teachers' perceptions of these variables. Within the scope of the research, a structural equation model was established by using the AMOS-25 package program with the data collected from 438 teachers. Before constructing the structural equation model, confirmatory factor analysis was performed and the measurement models for the scales used were verified. Fit index values of the measurement models were found to be acceptable, therefore total score was taken for each scale. "Perceived supervisor support" was determined as independent variable and "perceived school effectiveness, engagement to work, job satisfaction and organizational cynical attitude" were determined as dependent variables and direct effect values of independent variable on dependent variables were examined. Before establishing the structural equation model, multiple normal distributions of the scales were examined and "maximum likelihood" was chosen as the parameter estimation method in order to ensure the normal distribution assumption. The established structural equation model is verified and it was concluded that perceived supervisor support significantly predicted school effectiveness perception, work engagement, job satisfaction and organizational cynical attitude. It was also found that there were negative levels of negative relationships between teachers' organizational cynical attitude and perceived supervisor support, school effectiveness perception, work engagement and job satisfaction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>There are several variables that affect the quality of education. It can be said that supervisor support and teachers' perceptions about this support is a very important variable impacting the quality of education. It is of great importance that school principals consider teachers they work with as a valuable resource, support their development efforts, and prepare appropriate conditions for this to happen <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Can, 2004)</ref>. As a matter of fact, some studies reveal that management activities are the main factors that shape an employee's behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Guchiat, Paşamehmetoğlu &amp; Dawson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Román Calderón, Battistelli &amp; Odoardi, 2013)</ref>. It is thereupon possible to say that teachers' perception that they are supported by the school principal will have many positive effects on them. According to social change theory, when employees feel supported by their managers, they tend to respond by showing good job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Melián-González, 2016)</ref>. There are plentiful studies showing the relationship between perceived supervisor support and job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Park, Kang &amp; Kim, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Paterson, Luthans &amp; Jeung, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Talukder, Vickers &amp; Khan, 2018)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chiang and Hsieh (2012)</ref>, perceived supervisor support has positive effects on job performance as well as job satisfaction. There are other studies showing the positive effects on job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ingersoll, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Littrell, Billingsley &amp; Cross, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Sahin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Sahin &amp; Dursun, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Tillman &amp; Tillman, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Argon (2014)</ref> found that perceived supervisor support would enable teachers to develop emotionally and behaviorally. It can be argued that this emotional and behavioral development of teachers will support teachers' engagement in their work, achieving job satisfaction and believing that their schools are effective. A bulk of studies in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ada, Akan, Ayik, Yildirim &amp;Yalcin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Afzal, Arshad, Saleem &amp; Farooq, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Eisenberger, Stinglhamber, Vandenberghe, Sucharski &amp; Rhoades, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Emhan, Kula &amp; Tongur, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Erturk, Keskinkilic Kara &amp; Zafer Gunes, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Li, Castaño &amp; Li, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ozdemir, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Ozdemir Demirel, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Sahin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Sahin &amp; Dursun, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Tan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yasar, Emhan &amp; Ebere, 2014)</ref> support this claim through the findings and results they share.</p><p>It can also be argued that the perception of supervisor support will reduce or prevent the impact of low performance on organizational cynical attitude, which is seen as one of the most important reasons for not being able to connect to the organization. Supervisor support is indeed a key factor that enriches the working environment by reducing stress in the employee <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Sloan, 2012)</ref>. Employees naturally assume responsibility for the organization since they believe that their managers are empowered by the senior supervisors of the organization, and therefore that the supervisor's support and benefits are actually from the senior management, and that this support comes from the senior management <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Neves, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Rhoades, Eisenberger &amp; Armeli, 2001)</ref>. Thence, supervisor support strengthens the employee's emotional ties with the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Stinglhamber &amp; Vandenberghe, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Teachers who perceive that they work in effective schools engage in their jobs, get satisfaction from their jobs and have positive attitudes towards their schools. This will result in an increase in their performance, productivity, and commitment to National Education Ministry and to the schools they work. In this direction, the professional and individual development efforts of these teachers will enhance and hence the relevant results will be attained. It can be uttered that there will be an improvement in the overall quality of teachers. These results will also improve the quality of education and the instruction given in schools. Quality education and instruction in schools will be positively reflected in the education system. Therefore, in this study, it is aimed to test the theoretical framework that the perceived supervisor support of teachers affects the perception of school effectiveness, work engagement, job satisfaction and organizational cynic attitude within the framework of structural equality model. For this purpose, the following hypothesis were developed for the structural relationships between variables: H: Perceived supervisor support in teachers has an effect on the perception of school effectiveness, engagement in work, job satisfaction and organizational cynic attitude.  Considering the main purpose of the research, it is understood that studying this is of crucial importance in particular for the practitioners viz. school principals and teachers. In the available literature, there are studies about the aforementioned variables in terms of certain demographic characteristics or about the relationship of these variables with some other related ones (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ada, Akan, Ayik, Yildirim &amp;Yalcin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Afzal, Arshad, Saleem &amp; Farooq, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Alanoglu, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Amasrali &amp; Aslan, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Argon, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Atik, Demirtas &amp; Aksoy, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bilgic, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Emhan, Kula &amp;Tongur, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ercek, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Erturk, Keskinkilic Kara &amp; Zafer Gunes, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kilic &amp; Burgaz, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Li, Castaño &amp; Li, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ozdemir, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Ozdemir Demirel, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Ozkuk, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sarikaya, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Tan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Yildirim, 2015)</ref>. However, no study investigating the relationship between teachers' perceptions of supervisor support, perceptions of school effectiveness, engagement to work, job satisfaction, and organizational cynical attitudes analysed in a unified fashion was encountered. That said no study in which the relationship between these variables was investigated via putting forward a model was detected. These are believed to add onto the importance of the present study as to researchers' work whilst situating it amongst the others in the literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical framework</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supervisor support</head><p>It goes without saying that the most important goal of today's organizations is continuous development. Organizations can achieve this, as long as they can improve their employees and thusly achieve maximum efficiency. The high performance of employees, their desire to improve themselves and their efforts to realize this have a positive influence in the institution they work for. It would be fair to pronounce here that supervisor support is a fundamental variable that increases employee performance, job motivation as it encourages and improves them. Supervisor support is most commonly defined as the support provided by the employee's primary manager <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Yoon &amp; Lim, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>To that end it can be voiced that it is vital for the employee to feel high levels of supervisor support and thus it would be meaningful to determine the level of supervisor support perception. The concept of perceived supervisor support was referred to by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Babin and Boles (1996)</ref> with a view to describing the level of perceived support of the employees' managers and is defined as the extent to which the employee feels the support the manager gives. Perceived supervisor support includes the dimensions of providing support to employees in their endeavour to achieve career goals, solve work-related problems, and balance private and business life <ref type="bibr">(Cakmak &amp; Otluoglu, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Turgut, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>It might be speculated that the perception of supervisor support is also a significant factor for teachers. Teachers want support from school principals in different areas. Supervisor support appears in four sub-dimensions as "emotional support, valuation support, auxiliary support and informative support" <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Makela, 2014)</ref>. Accordingly, emotional support means that teachers are valued and appreciated by the school principal, their ideas are evaluated, and that the school principal offers them open communication opportunities. Auxiliary support means that the school administrator assists teachers in teaching and non-teaching activities and provides the necessary materials and resources for teaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Makela, 2014)</ref>. Valuation support is that the school principal empowers teachers with frequent and constructive feedback and gives clear information about what is required for effective teaching. Informative support means that the school principal provides teachers with practical information about effective teaching practices and informs them about how to improve classroom management <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Littrell, Billingsley &amp; Cross, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Quality in education is influenced by countless parameters. With that being said the quality of teacher is the foremost among the factors that come into play for quality in education. A qualified teacher can be defined as a teacher who fulfills the responsibilities of effective teaching, guiding students, developing their schools, professional development, and collaboration with colleagues. Teachers' attitudes towards development is in fact a prominent variable regarding teacher quality. With this in mind it can be articulated that the teachers who are supported are successful in developing themselves and their schools. Teachers wish to witness that their efforts to develop the school are supported especially by the school principal. Such support makes it easier for teachers to draw conclusions about improving themselves and their schools.</p><p>Teachers may encounter several problems while performing their profession. These problems can negatively affect teachers' motivation, performance and engagement to work. The problems they face in their school can cause teachers to take a negative attitude towards their school. Some teachers can overcome professional problems on their own. Nevertheless, there are some who need support in doing so. Bearing in mind this school principal support becomes essential at this point.</p><p>At times due to the problems experienced by teachers in their private lives, issues like low performance, reluctance and absenteeism can be observed. These reasons actually decrease the efficiency of teaching. The school principal should also be able to help teachers solve their private life problems when/if necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effective school</head><p>Organizations should make high efforts to reach their goals and meet expectations and try to develop themselves in achieving desired outcomes in both of these areas. Failure of an organization in doing this may result in negative perception in employees as well as those benefiting from the products and services provided i.e. stakeholders. An effective organization can herein be identified as one with a high level of achievement of its objectives, ensuring a high level of satisfaction of those benefiting from its services or products, and one that is successful in meeting expectations. In a similar vein an effective school can be pinpointed as an institution that wholly fulfills the objectives and assumed functions, assures the development of students in all aspects and prepares them for their future roles, provides appropriate learning environments for this purpose and meets the expectations of all stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Balci, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Sisman &amp; Turan, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ozdemir (2000)</ref>, an effective school is a school where all the stakeholders 'happiness and development are based on, where students, teachers and the environment can form a whole, where students' cognitive, affective, psychomotor, social and aesthetic developments are provided, and an optimum learning environment is created'. In order to talk about the effectiveness of a school, apparently it is necessary to diagnose that students experience a high level of learning and develop their behaviors as desired <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dos, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>It is well known that school principals possess a big role in creating effective schools. In this context, it is important that they also carry the role of leadership and more specifically instructional leadership. Instructional leadership requires school heads to fulfill their roles in providing the necessary school resources, preparing the ground for effective learning and teaching at school, and predicting high levels of success for all students <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Sisman, 2012)</ref>. As a result of the review of the literature, it was determined that school principals in effective schools display a determined and goal oriented leadership behavior, a participatory approach and take the stance of a professional leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Sammons, Hillman &amp; Mortimore, 1995)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Work engagement</head><p>Burnout is a negative mental process that is critical for the efficiency of the organization. The concept of burnout, which represents a social problem related to the business environment, is also a negative situation for the organization. Over time, the interest of researchers has shifted from burnout to work engagement with the opposite of this notion <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bal, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Mosadeghrad &amp; Ferdosi, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ravikumar, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Schaufeli, 2015)</ref>. In later studies, it was understood that burnout and work engagement were not different from each other but very different concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bal, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Work engagement may be explained in general terms as the dedication of employees to their roles in their jobs physically, cognitively and emotionally; their commitment to work, their positive emotions and enthusiasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(May, Gilson &amp; Harter, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Roberts &amp; Davenport, 2002)</ref>. When the definition is scrutinized, it is understandable that CEOs see inability to engage work as one of the five most important problems of the management process <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Sarkisian, Bhate &amp; Lee, 2011)</ref>. Again, based on the above definition it can be thought that work engagement is a highly significant concept in terms of employee performance and productivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Job satisfaction</head><p>It is possible to define job satisfaction as the sum of the emotional reactions of the employee to the organization and the job he / she is doing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Acar, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yapicikardesler, 2007)</ref>. An employee with a job that does not suit their interests and abilities may not be satisfied with their job. Owing to dissatisfaction with work, perception of worthlessness, boredom, relaxation and tension in life ties may also occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ada, 2014)</ref>. Low job satisfaction affects and weakens not only the individual but also the organization itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Handsome, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>It is plausible to divide the factors affecting the level of satisfaction obtained from work into two; being individual and organizational factors. Gender, age, educational background, professional seniority, expectations from the future and perception of competence can be enlisted as individual factors. The quality of work, working conditions and colleagues, salary, promotion, reward system, social possibilities, managers and management's approach are among the organizational factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bogler, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Dugguh &amp; Ayaga, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ma &amp; Mcmillan, 1999)</ref>. Through some studies on teachers, it was figured out that the support given by the manager is also influential in job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ingersoll, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Littrell, Billingsley &amp; Cross, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Tillman &amp; Tillman, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Research results on teachers' job satisfaction reveal that the frequency of continuing work increases as job satisfaction increases. According to the results of these studies, as the job satisfaction decreases, the perception of wearing out, the desire to quit and the frequency of absenteeism increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Makela, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Miles, 2010)</ref>. It is believed that teachers with high level of job satisfaction provide more quality education and instruction, and whence their students are relatively more successful <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Demirtas, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organizational cynicism</head><p>Organizational cynicism, which prevents employees from being connected to their institutions, causes them to perform poorly. It is associated with negative attitude towards individuals, belief in the lack of honesty principles in their organizations, humiliating and brutal criticism of their organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dean, Brandes &amp; Dharwadker, 1998)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Andersson (1996)</ref> describes organizational cynicism as negative attitudes and behaviors such as skepticism, distrust, frustration, anger, and hopelessness towards individuals, groups, ideologies, social skills or institutions. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abraham (2000)</ref>, organizational cynicism stems from the negative attitudes of individuals toward the organization they work at. These attitudes cause employees to develop negative feelings towards their organizations and to criticize their organizations mercilessly. In light of the information provided, it is tenable to state that organizational cynical attitude has a negative relationship with variables that positively affect the performance and productivity of employees. Considering teachers, it can be claimed that organizational cynical attitude is a factor that can decrease the quality of education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research design</head><p>The main purpose of this quantitative relational research is to test the theoretical framework within the structural equation model that whether the perceived supervisor support affects the perception of school effectiveness, engagement to work, job satisfaction, and organizational cynical attitude. The sub-purpose of the study is to examine the relationship between teachers' perceptions of these variables. The structural equation model is a comprehensive statistical method used to test models with hypotheses for causal and correlational relationships between observed and latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hoyle, 1995)</ref>. The purpose of structural equation modelling studies is to reveal whether the predetermined relationship patterns are verified by the obtained data. Prior to testing with data, the theoretical basis of the model should be established precisely <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Simsek, 2007)</ref>.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The working universe of the current study consists of 1186 teachers working in high schools in Kirsehir in the academic year 2019-2020. In the research, simple random sampling method was used as sampling method. In accordance with that, the sample consists of 438 teachers in the research universe. Of these teachers, 243 (55.5%) are women and 195 (44.5) are men. The distribution of teachers by gender is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments</head><p>Perceived supervisor support scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kottke and Sharafinski (1988)</ref> developed the abovementioned scale. Ozdemir (2010) translated it into Turkish and adapted it to the educational environment. The scale consists of one dimension and 14 items. In the reliability study conducted for the scale, it was found that 14 items were collected under one factor, total variance was ,71, and Cronbach Alpha coefficient of the items ranged between ,96 and that factor loads are between ,58 and ,90.Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> indictaes the fit index values for the measurement model established to verify the structure of the scale developed previously with the data collected in this research.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Byrne, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Schermelleh-Engel, Moosbrugger &amp; Müller, 2003)</ref>. It appears that the model has been verified.</p><p>Perceived school effectiveness scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Mott (1972)</ref> developed this very scale so as to measure the effectiveness of hospitals. First, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Miskel et al. (1979)</ref> and then by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hoy et al. (1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">1996)</ref> adapted the scale to schools. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Yildirim (2015)</ref> adapted it to Turkish. It consists of one factor and 8 items. The last version of the scale used in this study was created by <ref type="bibr">Hoy (2014)</ref>. It was calculated that the load values of the items ranged from ,629 to ,772. In the correlation analysis conducted to reveal the language equivalence of the scale, the correlation coefficient between the total scores of the English and Turkish scales was found to be significant at a significance level of 0.01 as ,708.Cronbach Alpha internal consistency coefficient of the scale is ,866. The test-retest reliability coefficient of the scale is ,847. Findings obtained from the analyses indicated that the adapted scale demonstrated psychometric properties that could be used easily in Turkey. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> points to the fit index values for the measurement model established to verify the structure of the scale developed previously with the data collected in this research.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Byrne, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Schermelleh-Engel, Moosbrugger &amp; Müller, 2003</ref>). It appears that the model has been verified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Engagement to work scale</head><p>The scale was developed in 2003 by Schaufeli and Bakker. According to the factor analysis, it was found that the scale could be explained by two factors. These two factors explain 58.91% of the total variance of the scale. The values obtained indicate that the scale has a high validity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ozkalp and Meydan (2015)</ref> adapted it to Turkish. This version consists of 9 items in a 5-point Likert type and of a single factor. In order to measure the reliability of the scale, Cronbach Alpha coefficient was found to be ,844. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> shows the fit index values for the measurement model established to verify the structure of the scale developed previously with the data collected in this research.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organizational cynicism scale</head><p>Brandes et al. (1999) developed the scale mentioned above. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kalagan (2009)</ref> adapted it to Turkish. The scale consists of 13 items and is a 5-point Likert-type scale consisting of 3 subdimensions. According to the exploratory factor analysis, the factor loadings of the items in the "cognitive cynicism" dimension consisting of five items varied between ,763 and ,819, and the variance ratio explained by the dimension was 29.09%. In the "affective cynicism" dimension consisting of four items, it was computed that the factor loads of the items varied between ,737 and ,885 and the variance ratio explained by the dimension was 27.177%. It was spotted that factor loadings of "behavioral cynicism" items consisting of four items ranged between ,668 and ,895, and the variance ratio explained by the dimension was 22.398%. The Cronbach Alpha internal consistency coefficients of the scale were specified as ,913 the cognitive dimension, ,948 for the affective dimension, ,866 for the behavioral dimension ,and,931 for the whole scale.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>The data were processed in the SPSS-25 statistics program. The extreme values were examined by examining the box plot chart of the data. The lost data were also checked, and then the mahalonobis distances of the data distribution were looked into. Accordingly, no inappropriate data was found. AMOS-25 package program was resorted to to be able to analyze the data collected from 438 teachers, and structural equation modeling analyses were carried out. Goodness of fit indices related to structural model and measurement model were measured. The criteria for the "RMSEA, TLI, CFI, NFI, AGFI, GFI" fit indices considered for this assessment were determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Schermelleh-Engel, Moosbrugger and Müller (2003)</ref> and the criterion for the "χ2" fit index was determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Byrne (2013)</ref>. Good fit criteria are as follows: "0≤χ2≤3", "0≤RMSEA≤0,05", "0,97≤TLI≤1,00", "0,97≤CFI≤1,00", "0, 95≤NFI≤1,00 "," 0,90≤AGFI≤1,00 "and" 0,95≤GFI≤1,00 ". Acceptable fit criteria are as follows: "3 &lt;χ2≤5", "0.05 &lt;RMSEA≤0.08", "0.95≤TLI &lt;0.97", "0.95≤CFI &lt;0.97 "Is" 0,90≤NFI &lt;0,95 "," 0,85≤AGFI &lt;0,90 "and" 0,90≤GFI &lt;0,95 ". Direct effect and indirect effect paths related to structural equation model are defined and the level of regression effects are delved into. The relationship between the scores obtained from the scales used within the scope of the research and the scores obtained from the overall and sub-factors of the Organizational Cynicism Scale was dwelled upon using Pearson correlation analysis, which is a parametric test for the skewness and kurtosis values of the points are between -1 and +1 and Levene homogeneity test is meaningless compared to p &lt;, 05, that is, it is homogeneously distributed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Depending on the validation of the model, it is rightful to declare that perceiving supervisor support will improve work engagement and job satisfaction among teachers, wherefore increasing teachers' performances, job motivations, and teachers will make more efforts to develop and improve them. As a matter of fact, there are studies showing the positive relationship between perceived supervisor support and job performance and job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chiang &amp; Hsieh, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ingersoll, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Littrell, Billingsley &amp; Cross, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Park, Kang &amp; Kim, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Paterson, Luthans &amp; Jeung, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Sahin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Sahin &amp; Dursun, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Talukder, Vickers &amp; Khan, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Tillman &amp; Tillman, 2008)</ref>. Teachers who feel supervisor support will be able to contribute more to the development of their schools since they will be more committed to their organizations. This result will have a positive effect on the effectiveness level of the school and teachers' perceptions about it. When the literature was examined, it was found that school principals in effective schools had determined and goal-oriented leadership skills, participatory approach and professional leadership characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Sammons, Hillman &amp; Mortimore, 1995)</ref>. It can be theorized that if teachers perceive that their school is an effective organization, they will engage in their work and achieve job satisfaction and they will have a positive attitude towards their schools, in other words, organizational cynic attitude in teachers will be prevented.</p><p>Quality in education is influenced by plenty of variables. Nonethless, it can be put forward that the quality of teachers is the most powerful and determining factor among the factors affecting quality in education. School administrators are also responsible for the professional development and learning of teachers <ref type="bibr">(Evers &amp; Eacott, 2016)</ref>. It can be contemplated that teachers who perceive their support from the school principal will be successful in developing themselves and their schools. It can also be envisioned that this perception will enable teachers to solve the problems they face in their work and personal lives more easily.</p><p>In the study, it was concluded that teachers' perceived supervisor support significantly predicted school effectiveness perception, engagement to work, job satisfaction and organizational cynic attitude. In the literature, studies with concordant results were identified. When related studies were reviewed, the following results were reached: Perceived supervisor support predicts emotional commitment to the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Eisenberger, Stinglhamber, Vandenberghe, Sucharski &amp; Rhoades, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yasar, Emhan &amp; Ebere, 2014)</ref>, motivates the employee and acts as an intermediary for career development of the employee <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Tan, 2008)</ref>, increases the frequency of organizational behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Ozdemir, 2010)</ref>, is a mediating variable between school principals' use of power resources and corporate citizenship behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Ozdemir Demirel, 2012)</ref>, mediates the relationship between organizational commitment and organizational performance <ref type="bibr">(Emhan, Kula &amp; Tongur, 2013)</ref>, affects job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ingersoll, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Littrell, Billingsley &amp; Cross, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Sahin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Sahin &amp; Dursun, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Tillman and Tillman, 2008)</ref>, is important for teachers to be motivated and successful in their studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ada, Akan, Ayik, Yildirim &amp;Yalcin, 2013)</ref> fosters emotional and behavioral development of teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Argon, 2014)</ref>, predicts the psychological well-being of teachers at a low level <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Erturk, Keskinkilic Kara &amp; Zafer Gunes, 2016)</ref>, partially mediates the positive relationship between organizational justice perception and emotional commitment to the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Li, Castaño &amp; Li, 2018)</ref>, has a negative impact on intention to leave job through self-efficacy and has a positive direct effect on performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Afzal, Arshad, Saleem &amp; Farooq, 2019)</ref>, directly affects the school principal's perception of trust in teachers and organizational justice and also indirectly impacts the perception of organizational justice through the school principal's perception of trust in teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Atik, Demirtas &amp; Aksoy, 2019)</ref>. The results of this study and the related studies underpin that perceived supervisor support is a variable with positive effects on the quality of teachers and the quality of education and henceforward the quality of the education system.</p><p>The result that there are negatively different levels of relationship between teachers' organizational cynic attitudes and their perceptions of supervisor support and school effectiveness, and their engagement with work and job satisfaction is an expected result and can be interpreted as follows: As teachers' organizational cynic attitudes increase, their perceptions of executive support and school effectiveness decrease and so do their levels of engagement and job satisfaction. In the literature, there are studies with similar results to those of this study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kilic and Burgaz (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Yildiz (2013)</ref> underlined that there is a negative relationship between organizational cynicism and organizational commitment among teachers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This study gives a different dimension to the literature in terms of revealing the proposed model and the analysis of the relationship between these variables with the structural equation model.</p><p>In the study, high fit goodness values were reached for the structural equation model and the model was verified accordingly. It was unearthed that the model which was formed as a result of these fit indexes had good and acceptable fit. When the significance of the relationships between the variables in the model was dissected, significant relationships were uncovered between perceived supervisor support and perception of school effectiveness, work engagement, job satisfaction, and organizational cynic attitude. As a result of the validation of the model, it was deduced that the perceived supervisor support of teachers significantly predicted school effectiveness perception, engagement to work, job satisfaction and organizational cynic attitude. When the levels of effects in the form of direct effects are examined, it is disclosed that the perceived supervisor support among teachers is positive on school effectiveness perception, engagement to work and job satisfaction; and negative on organizational cynic attitude. In the model, it was monitored that the strongest direct effect of perceived executive support was on perceived school effectiveness, and the least positive direct effect was on job satisfaction.</p><p>Another finding of the study is that there are negatively different levels of relationship between teachers' organizational cynic attitudes and their perceptions of supervisor support and school effectiveness, and their engagement with work and job satisfaction. In line with the results obtained from this study, practitioners may be recommended the following:</p><p>• School principals should support teachers in their professional work and in solving their work or private life problems. Because through the findings in this study it was decided that the perceived supervisor support of teachers significantly predicted school effectiveness perception, engagement to work, job satisfaction and organizational cynic attitude.</p><p>• The factors that cause organizational cynical attitude should be determined in teachers and ways to eliminate these should be considered because in this study, it appeared that there are negatively different levels of relationship between teachers' organizational cynic attitudes and teachers' perceptions of supervisor support and school effectiveness, and their engagement with work and job satisfaction. The researchers are recommended the following:</p><p>• Structural equation modeling studies can be made on the models to be proposed by considering the other variables related to teachers' perceived administrator support may affect.</p><p>• In this study, data was collected from 664 teachers. The study can be repeated with a larger sample group.</p><p>• Although the scales used in the research are scales with high reliability and validity, the research can be repeated using different scales and the results obtained can be compared.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The structural equation model established in accordance with the hypothesis of the research is visualized through the graph in Figure1below.</figDesc></figure>
