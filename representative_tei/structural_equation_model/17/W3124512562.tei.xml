<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This article addresses two unsolved measurement issues in dynamic problem solving (DPS) research: (a) unsystematic construction of DPS tests making a comparison of results obtained in different studies difficult and (b) use of time-intensive single tasks leading to severe reliability problems.</p><p>To solve these issues, the MicroDYN approach is presented, which combines (a) the formal framework of linear structural equation models as a systematic way to construct tasks with (b) multiple and independent tasks to increase reliability. Results indicated that the assumed measurement model that comprised three dimensions, information retrieval, model building, and forecasting, fitted the data well (n = 114 students) and could be replicated in another sample (n = 140), showing excellent reliability estimates for all dimensions. Predictive validity of school grades was excellent for model building but nonexistent for the other two MicroDYN dimensions and for an additional measure of DPS. Implications are discussed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>On virtually a daily basis, the electronic market is overstocked with new technical devices such as mobile phones, offering supposedly much-needed and more convenient applications. At the same time, their handling might be different from previous devices. You-as a user-have to find out how to switch off the keyboard lock, how to toggle between different menus, or how to surf the Internet with such a new device. In the 21st century, it is taken for granted that anybody can handle unfamiliar technologies and use them to master daily life. One has to get along with technical artifacts at work (e.g., handling new computer systems), while traveling (e.g., buying tickets from a ticket vending machine), or at home (e.g., regulating an air conditioner). These skills display a newly arisen demand almost unknown to people living 30 years ago but necessary in today's world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Background</head><p>In psychology, dealing with such unfamiliar systems or situations is subsumed within the construct of problem solving. Problem solving in general is defined as cognitive processing directed at transforming a given situation into a goal situation when no obvious method of solution is available <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mayer &amp; Wittrock, 2006)</ref>. However, problems may differ in what is needed to bridge this gap. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Funke (2001)</ref> distinguished dynamic problems and static problems. Whereas in static problems, all information necessary to solve the problem is available at the outset, in dynamic problems, a problem solver has to gather information by directly interacting with the problem before solving it. Depending on the underlying theoretical understanding, definitions of problem solving in general and dynamic problem solving (DPS) in particular vary greatly <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Funke, 2003)</ref>. The authors focus on the definition of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Buchner (1995)</ref>, who emphasized the dynamic aspect of users' interactions with a problem as an essential part of DPS: psychometric perspective, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Funke (2001)</ref> criticized the unsystematic construction of these <ref type="bibr">measures (e.g., in Lohhausen;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Do ¨rner, 1986)</ref> because they varied considerably in their underlying system structure rendering it impossible to compare empirical results of different studies. Thus, Funke suggested constructing tasks based on formal frameworks to allow a systematic description of a task's structure enabling researchers to construct similar tasks as well as to compare problem solvers' performance across different studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Funke (2001)</ref> introduced the two formal frameworks of linear structural equations (LSEs) and finite state automata (FSA). These frameworks were widely received and contributed greatly to the development of many well-established DPS tasks. The majority of these tasks is based on LSE systems and consists of quantitative connections between elements of a system, labeled as input and output variables. That is, increasing an input variable might in turn decrease or increase one or more output variables (e.g., ColorSIM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kluge, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">MultiFlux, Kro ¨ner, Plass, &amp; Leutner, 2005)</ref>. Some other tasks are based on FSA (e.g., Space Shuttle, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Klieme, Funke, Leutner, Reimann, &amp; Wirth, 2001)</ref> and are composed of a number of states that differ in their quality. That is, changing the state of one element (e.g., by pressing a button on a mobile phone) might in turn change the state of another element or of the entire device (e.g., the directory is opened). In fact, any dynamic task can be formally described by either LSE, FSA, or a combination of both, independent of the semantics it is embedded into.</p><p>In the context of LSE systems (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), input variables (in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: X 1 , X 2 , X 3 ) influence output variables (in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Y 1 , Y 2, Y 3 ) where only the former can be actively manipulated by the problem solver <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Greiff &amp; Funke, 2010)</ref>. However, output variables may also be related to each other, labeled side effect (in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Y 2 to Y 3 ). An output variable that is related to itself with a weight different to 1 is labeled eigendynamic (first-order autoregressive process; in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Y 1 to Y 1 ). An eigendynamic with a weight smaller than 1 describes a shrinkage effect, whereas an eigendynamic with a weight larger than 1 describes a growth effect. Relations from input to output variables are labeled direct effects (e.g., relations from X n to Y n ), whereas relations between output variables (i.e., side effects, eigendynamics) are labeled indirect effects.</p><p>Any LSE system is fully described by linear equations. The number of equations necessary is equal to the number of output variables, which are denoted by a Y, while input variables are denoted by an X. For the particular example in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, Equations 1 to 3 are needed:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y 1 t + 1 ð Þ= a 1 3X 1 t ð Þ + a 2 3Y 1 t ð Þ,<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y 2 t + 1 ð Þ= a 3 3X 2 t ð Þ + Y 2 t ð Þ,<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">Y 3 t + 1 ð Þ= a 4 3X 2 t ð Þ + a 5 3X 3 t ð Þ + a 6 3Y 2 t ð Þ;<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>where t = discrete time steps, a i = arbitrary path coefficients, a i 6 ¼ 0, and a 2 6 ¼ 1. When using LSE systems, three different dimensions of DPS can be measured that are related to Do ¨rner's (1986) theory of operational intelligence. According to Do ¨rner, a successful problem solver should be able to (1) collect information (i.e., dimension of information retrieval), (2) integrate and structure information (i.e., model building), and (3) make prognoses (i.e., forecasting). Within LSE systems, these three aspects of problem-solving ability are allocated to three different phases <ref type="bibr">(compare Kro ¨ner et al., 2005)</ref>. First, (1) participants have some time to explore the system. At this stage, only input and output variables are presented to participants and the relations between them as displayed in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> are not visible. While exploring, participants have to use adequate strategies to derive information about the system structure. This process of using strategies assesses the ability of (1) information retrieval. Either simultaneously or subsequently, (2) participants are instructed to identify the relations between variables based on their observations. This is done either by drawing the assumed interconnections between variables into a model (e.g., Bu ¨hner, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kro ¨ner, &amp; Ziegler, 2008)</ref> or by asking questions about the underlying system's structure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kluge, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kro ¨ner et al., 2005)</ref>. Thereby, (2) model building is assessed. In a final stage, (3) participants are asked to achieve given target values in the output variables by entering correct values into the input variables within a given number of steps, indicating performance in (3) forecasting.</p><p>Even though the overarching procedure and the specified design principles inherent in the LSE formalism are considered essential in DPS research, one of its major advantages has been overlooked until now: LSE systems allow for the employment of a sufficient number of comparable tasks presented successively as a test composed of several tasks. From a psychometric point of view, having independent tasks subsumed as a test is a necessary prerequisite of a reliable and valid assessment. However, problem-solving research has yet failed to do so because only single tasks have been used (e.g., <ref type="bibr">MultiFlux, Kro ¨ner et al., 2005)</ref>. Within these single tasks, just one performance indicator can be derived, which informs about how appropriate this task was solved (e.g., in a dichotomous scoring, task solved or not). If examinees' DPS score is based on no more than one task, only little information about their ability is gained. Consequently, this one-task testing is likely to reduce reliability. In contrast, using several independent tasks allows the reliable measurement of DPS as sufficient information about examinees' ability is gathered.</p><p>Multiple Tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kluge (2008)</ref> was among the first who administered more than one task with different underlying structures to participants. Although her study was based on an experimental between-subject Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Example of the structure of a typical MicroDYN system displaying three input (X 1 , X 2 , X 3 ) and three output (Y 1 , Y 2 , Y 3 ) variables design and not intended to measure individual DPS performance with a psychometric test, it emphasized the importance of using tasks of varying difficulty when evaluating performance in DPS. More specifically, Kluge used three different versions of the LSE task ColorSIM either with low, medium, or high difficulty to allow for a direct check of the relation between participants' individual DPS performances and task difficulty. Difficulty was varied by changing the number of relations between input and output variables. As expected, participants' performance in ColorSIM, as well as the correlation between DPS performance and general mental ability decreased with higher task difficulty (easy, r = .45; medium, r = .37; difficult, r = .30). Kluge concluded that developers of DPS tasks should carefully investigate difficulty when studying predictive validity:</p><p>But studying the predictive validity of MWs [i.e., microworlds, a synonym for DPS tasks], for example, will not prove informative until there is careful investigation of such factors as difficulty, which confounds performance and distorts individual scores. <ref type="bibr">(p. 178)</ref> By this, she rightly emphasized the importance of investigating difficulty. However, the conclusion about difficulty confounding performance does not seem appropriate. The high predictive validity in the easy condition is likely to be due to the fact that this version of ColorSIM was on average targeted best at participants' competency levels. That is, the correlation between test performance and general mental ability probably decreased with higher task difficulty because variance of participants' problem-solving performance was restricted in the more difficult tasks (i.e., a majority of participants performed low). Does this mean that only tasks with appropriate difficulty should be used to assess DPS? No, it does not. Confronting examinees with tasks ranging from easy to difficult is a principle at the very heart of testing in psychology, as it allows them to display their individual level of performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Embretson &amp; Reise, 2000)</ref>. Therefore, the authors conclude that a valid and fair test of DPS requires multiple tasks with a broad range of difficulty allowing each participant to display his or her individual level of performance. This also enhances the diagnostic information about participants' ability, which leads to an increased reliability of the measures used. Thus, in addition to the prerequisite introduced by Funke (2001) of (a) using tasks based on a formal framework to guarantee comparability, the authors add a second prerequisite of (b) using multiple, independent tasks of varying difficulty targeted at examinees' DPS ability to increase reliability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The MicroDYN Approach</head><p>The MicroDYN approach incorporates both aspects by using multiple tasks that are embedded in the formal framework of LSE systems to assess individual DPS performance in a sound manner. In doing so, it overcomes the fundamental psychometric shortcomings of (a) constructing tasks unsystematically and (b) using only single tasks to assess DPS ability. The concept of presenting only single tasks was partially motivated by the implicit idea that time on task had to be sufficiently long when dealing with complex situations. For instance, ColorSIM, MultiFlux, and Space Shuttle all lasted between 30 and 60 min, which clearly limited the number of employable tasks to one with regard to testing time. In the MicroDYN approach, the presumption that DPS requires a substantial amount of testing time for each task was abandoned to present a sufficient number of less time-consuming tasks lasting only 5 min each. The principle of using several tasks with a short time on task is ecologically valid because successful interaction with unknown task environments in real life seldom lasts longer than a few minutes (e.g., buying a ticket at a new vending machine).</p><p>Similar to other tasks within the LSE framework (e.g., ColorSIM, MultiFlux), MicroDYN tasks are embedded into fictitious semantics (e.g., imaginary animals that have to be fed with different sort of food) and variables are labeled without deep semantic meaning (e.g., a chemical laboratory with Substances A, B, C, D related to Elements W, X, Y, Z; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) yielding the advantage of largely avoiding the activation of prior knowledge. Thus, only knowledge that participants acquire during test employment is relevant, whereas specific knowledge gathered beforehand is negligible and does not influence performance supporting the domain-unspecific nature of the construct measured in the MicroDYN approach.</p><p>A specific MicroDYN test within the MicroDYN approach is composed of a set of multiple tasks based on the LSE formalism without deep semantic meaning. Such a typical MicroDYN test would include approximately 10 independent tasks, each lasting about 5 min summing to an overall testing time of approximately 1 hour. Different exemplars of MicroDYN tests are easily constructed by varying task difficulty and/or semantic embedding of the tasks.</p><p>As an example, the authors describe the specific procedure of a task within the MicroDYN approach by a virtual chemical laboratory as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, although MicroDYN tasks can include a broad variety of different semantic embeddings (e.g., feeding pets, advertising products, etc.). The chemical laboratory cover story was also part of the study reported in the present article. There, different kinds of substances (input variables labeled A, B, C, D) influence four substances (output variables labeled W, X, Y, Z) in a complex manner invisible to the problem solver.</p><p>The procedure within a MicroDYN task is the same that is generally applied in LSE systems <ref type="bibr">(compare Kro ¨ner et al., 2005)</ref>. Thus, three dimensions of DPS are directly connected to three phases: Participants have to (a) apply adequate strategies to explore an unknown task (Phase 1: information retrieval), (b) generate knowledge about the relations between input and output variables (Phase 2: model building), and (c) apply this knowledge to reach target values (Phase 3: forecasting).</p><p>During Phase 1, information retrieval, participants explore the laboratory and the connections between variables. Relations between input and output variables are to be discovered by manipulating input variables on the left side of the display in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> and by observing the resulting changes on the right side. The laboratory works in discrete steps and participants can forward to the next step by pressing the ''next step'' button. In addition, a timer in the upper right corner displays the time remaining for exploration. By pressing the ''reset'' or ''undo'' buttons, participants can either transfer the laboratory into its original state or undo their last manipulation. In addition, the current step and the assignment (''Explore the laboratory'' in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) are displayed.</p><p>Phase 2, model building, takes place simultaneously to Phase 1. Participants are instructed to generate hypotheses about the relations between substances and elements and to represent their conclusions in a causal diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Funke, 2001)</ref>, which is depicted in the lower right part of the screen (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). They do so by first clicking on the assumed origin of an effect (e.g., Substance A) and then on its target (e.g., Element X). Once drawn, a path is easily deleted by double clicking on it. In Phase 1 and 2, participants are told explicitly that they are not required to achieve certain values at this stage but that they will be asked to do so later.</p><p>During Phase 3, forecasting, participants have to achieve given target values within a maximum of four control steps. Target values are displayed in brackets next to each output variable. The limitation of only four control steps is introduced to allow for dynamic effects (i.e., side effects and eigendynamics) to unfold in a way that participants have to counteract them and to maintain standardized control over testing, which is easily disturbed by system dynamics. In this phase, participants are faced with the task to transfer declarative and explicit knowledge into procedural actions and, at the same time, to respond to dynamic changes of the system. By evaluating participants' performance, the ability to use knowledge, to plan actions, and to react to dynamic changes is assessed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Questions</head><p>The MicroDYN approach is based (a) on the formal framework of LSE systems and additionally incorporates (b) the use of multiple, independent tasks to increase reliability. Combining aspects (a) and (b) enables us to test the internal structure of MicroDYN and its convergent and predictive validity empirically.</p><p>To do so, the authors report results of two studies. The main study deals with both research questions, internal structure and construct validity, and uses a specific set of tasks, the MicroDYN test Laboratory, in which all tasks used were semantically embedded in the context of a chemical laboratory (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). Study 2 is used to cross-validate the results on the internal structure from the main study and to show that different exemplars of MicroDYN tests constructed within the overarching MicroDYN approach yield comparable results. Thus, in Study 2, the MicroDYN test Aquarium is used, which has a different semantic embedding (i.e., aquarium instead of laboratory) and different LSEs (see the 'Method' section and Appendix), thereby varying both semantic embedding and task difficulty. Showing that MicroDYN tests based on different semantics and system structures were psychometrically comparable emphasizes the variety of the MicroDYN approach. Study 2 is only shortly outlined, whereas procedure and results of the main study are presented in detail.</p><p>With regard to the internal structure of the MicroDYN test, the authors suggest that a multidimensional model with the theoretically derived dimensions information retrieval, model building, and forecasting fits the data best. In a second model, the authors test a more parsimonious g-factor model, which implies that a single latent variable is sufficient to account for the covariation between all indicators. To explore the second research question, construct validity, latent connections to Space Shuttle, (a DPS task based on FSA), and to school grades are evaluated. The authors are not aware of any other attempt to test scalability of DPS and its validity on a latent level within the approach of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>Testing took place at the University of Heidelberg. Data of 114 German university students majoring in psychology (87 female, 27 male) were available for analysis. 1 Their mean age was 22.36 (SD = 4.72). Students were mostly in their 2nd year of study and received partial course credit for participation and an additional 5 e (approximately US$7) when they worked conscientious. Missing data occurred only due to software problems (e.g., data were not saved properly) and were missing completely at random (MCAR).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>Test execution was divided into two sessions, each lasting approximately 90 min. Time between the sessions varied between 2 and 5 days. At the first session, participants worked on MicroDYN and provided demographic data. At the second session, participants processed the DPS measure Space Shuttle and provided school grades in self-report. In addition, participants answered several questionnaires (e.g., on metacognition and personality) that are not discussed in this article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Material</head><p>Besides demographic data and school grades, data on two DPS measures were collected: on the MicroDYN test Laboratory within the MicroDYN approach and on the FSA Space Shuttle to validate the former.</p><p>MicroDYN test laboratory. Claiming to measure individual DPS ability, the MicroDYN test Laboratory was administered entirely computer based, and all participants' actions were automatically logged. It was composed of 11 independent tasks and 2 trial tasks. Each of these tasks was embedded in the context of a virtual chemical laboratory (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). This background was chosen to provide a realistic and motivating setup on one hand and to guarantee only minimal activation of prior knowledge on the other hand. To provide tasks with a broad range of difficulty, the underlying structure was changed with regard to the number of connections between substances and elements (e.g., 3, 4, or 5), the type of interconnection (e.g., indirect effects are more difficult than direct effects; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Funke, 2001)</ref>, and their path strength (e.g., .2 or .5). The specific set of tasks and their underlying equations are reported in the appendix. The procedure for each task was identical: 3.5 min of unguided exploration (information retrieval) with simultaneous model drawing (model building) was followed by 1.5 min of controlling (forecasting), in which participants applied their acquired knowledge (i.e., their structural model). The overall testing time took approximately 70 min for 11 tasks each lasting 5 min and for about 12 min of instruction. The test started with elaborate instructions on how to handle the program (i.e., how to operate the surface) and on how the three phases were separated to familiarize participants with the new task format. During these instructions, participants were walked through two trial laboratory tasks in which they encountered all relations between substances and elements they had to deal with during testing. At no point during the instructions any information was given on how to best explore, understand, or control the tasks. The trial tasks were not included in the statistical analyses.</p><p>In summary, the MicroDYN test Laboratory was composed of 11 different tasks with 33 items yielding 33 performance indicators: 11 on information retrieval, model building, and forecasting, respectively. The three phases were repeated for all 11 tasks in exactly the same way. Performance in one task was independent of performance in any other task.</p><p>Space Shuttle. The computer simulation Space Shuttle <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wirth &amp; Klieme, 2003)</ref> required participants to understand and control two subsystems that were constructed analogously: a space shuttle and a space vessel. Space Shuttle was used for the first time in the German national extension of PISA 2000 to capture students' DPS abilities and therefore served as a reference point for validating the MicroDYN approach against a measurement device already used in large-scale assessments. Space Shuttle started with 15 min of unguided exploration followed by 16 knowledge items (equivalent of model building) and 22 control items (equivalent of forecasting), summing to approximately 45 min of testing time. The general limitations of measuring DPS with single tasks outlined earlier also apply to Space Shuttle.</p><p>School grades. Students were asked to report their final mathematics and German grades from high school. These two grades were used as indicators for a latent school grade factor. Other grades were not available for study purposes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Trost (2000)</ref> showed that the correlation between self-reported and actual school grades is close to 1 for German participants.</p><p>Demographic data. Demographic variables (e.g., gender, age, year of study) were collected for control purposes only. There was no significant impact of these on any of the performance measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dependent Variables and Scoring</head><p>automatically by computer-based algorithms and nonambiguous, as scores for the three dimensions were directly computed from the actions participants provided while interacting with the tasks.</p><p>1. (1) Use of strategy, information retrieval, was scored based on how systematically participants explored a system. To retrieve complete information on a system and to derive correct knowledge about it, participants had to make use of the VOTAT strategy (vary one thing at a time; <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Vollmeyer &amp; Rheinberg, 1999)</ref>. VOTAT allows for the direct observation of isolated effects on output variables by manipulating only one input variable at a time (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). Participants were assumed to have mastered VOTAT when they applied it to each input variable during exploration. In addition to VOTAT, participants had to apply idle rounds, in which they set all input variables to 0 to discover dynamics inherent in the system (i.e., side effects and eigendynamics). If participants left this active nonintervention out, effects due to their own manipulations could not be separated from effects due to system dynamics. These steps with all input variables set to 0 were labeled idle rounds. If participants used VOTAT consistently and applied at least one idle round, they were scored in the highest category (i.e., Category 2). Applying VOTAT consistently without using idle rounds was scored in the medium category (i.e., Category 1) and no or an inconsistent use of VOTAT was specified in the lowest category (i.e., Category 0). An example of such an inefficient exploration strategy would be to manipulate two or three input variables simultaneously. Then, changes in the output variables could not be attributed to specific input variables. Both (2) model building and (3) forecasting were scored dichotomously as right (i.e., Category 1) or wrong (i.e., Category 0). A full score in model building (i.e., Category 1) was given if participants included all existing relations and correct weights between variables into their causal model but did not include any nonexistent relations or incorrect weights. A full score (i.e., Category 1) in forecasting was given if target values of all output variables were reached after no more than four steps. In summary, each task was scored with respect to its three phases, yielding 33 items overall within the 11 tasks of the MicroDYN test Laboratory.</p><p>Space Shuttle. All 16 knowledge items and 22 control items were scored dichotomously right or wrong as suggested in the manual.</p><p>School grades. School grades ranged from 1 (excellent) to 6 (poor) as usual in German schools. However, when calculating relations to other variables, grades were reversed so that higher numerical values reflected better performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>The authors analyzed data by using the structural equation modeling (SEM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bollen, 1989)</ref> approach. Compared with other methods such as cluster analysis or multidimensional scaling, which are mostly used to discover similarity or proximity of a given number of stimuli (Dunn-Rankin, Knezek, Wallace, &amp; Zhang, 2004), in SEM, researchers can posit relations among specific latent variables, for instance, by testing the usefulness of three theoretically derived dimensions of DPS compared with alternative models with fewer dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Raykov &amp; Marcoulides, 2006)</ref>. Within SEM, the authors used CFA to test the assumed three-dimensional internal structure, and they used latent structural regression models to investigate its construct validity. Whereas in CFA, it is only assumed that the dimensions are correlated, in structural regression models, hypothesized relations among constructs (i.e., latent regressions between the MicroDYN test Laboratory, Space Shuttle, and school grades, respectively) can be postulated and tested <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Raykov &amp; Marcoulides, 2006)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Daniel (2000)</ref>, CFA is one of the most powerful tools for exploring the ability dimensions underlying cognitive tests.</p><p>The variables within all analyses were ordinal item scores based on independent tasks. That is, in each task, three ordinal scores were derived. The authors applied the weighted least squares means and variance adjusted (WLSMV) estimator (L. Muthe ´n &amp; Muthe ´n, 2007) that uses polychoric correlations between manifest ordinal variables to estimate parameters of latent variables. WLSMV, the method of choice for ordinal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Beauducel &amp; Herzberg, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">B. Muthe ´n, 1993)</ref>, is a robust weighted least squares estimator using a diagonal weight matrix that does not maximize the likelihood function (L. Muthe ´n &amp; Muthe ´n, 2007). Thus, only non-likelihood-based fit statistics, such as the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Tucker Lewis Index (TLI), and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), were available, whereas the likelihoodbased ones, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were not. SEM calculations were conducted in MPlus 5.0 (L. Muthe ´n &amp; Muthe ´n, 2007).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Descriptive Statistics</head><p>Frequencies for all three dimensions are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Obviously, item difficulties varied considerably for model building and forecasting even in this highly capable sample. Whereas some systems were easy to understand and control, systems incorporating indirect effects were much more difficult. Interestingly, easy to understand tasks were not necessarily easy to control and vice versa. Information retrieval, which reflects the use of appropriate strategies, appeared to be the least challenging competency. More than 95% of the students tested used the VOTAT strategy systematically, and the vast majority considered idle rounds as important aspect of exploring an unknown system. Differences in mean levels and variation between the dimensions are shown in the task statistics (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) and suggest that model building and forecasting performance depended strongly on system structure (SD = 0.21 and 0.27) whereas information retrieval was constant throughout testing (SD = 0.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internal Structure</head><p>Hypothesis 1a: The three-dimensional model with information retrieval, model building, and forecasting is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. Each of these dimensions was measured by 11 items. The residuals of the three items within a task were not allowed to correlate. The model showed a good fit (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) according to the criteria by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hu and Bentler (1999)</ref>: CFI and TLI both exceeded .95 and RMSEA was just within the recommended .06 limit <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1995)</ref> not considering that RMSEA is too conservative in small samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Yu, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>When evaluating model fit in SEM, contrary to conventional inference testing, beta error level is relevant, and thus, power needs to be evaluated carefully <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Ullman, 2007)</ref>. MacCallum, Browne, and Sugawara (1996) derived a practical method for RMSEA power calculation and  suggested testing the empirical RMSEA against prescribed values. To evaluate power, the authors tested the empirical RMSEAs against poor fit (i.e., RMSEA .10) and exact fit (RMSEA = .00). Calculated power is displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. The power of rejecting a poor model fit was marginally sufficient (1 2 b = .67), whereas an exact fit could not be rejected (1 2 b = .35) for the three-dimensional model. These calculations did not take into account that RMSEA might be too conservative in this analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Yu, 2002)</ref>. Procedures for other fit indices are not available <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(MacCallum et al., 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Correlations between the dimensions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) were strong and did not differ from each other (p . .05). Their size was comparable with correlations of first-order factors for other constructs and allowed an empirical distinction between dimensions even though they shared a large amount of variance. Factor loadings and communalities h 2 are displayed in more detail in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. Generally, communalities were above the recommended level of .40 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hair, Anderson, Tatham, &amp; Black, 1998)</ref>. Only Task 10 showed a low factor loading on forecasting, most likely due to its high difficulty and its skewed distribution. Cronbach's a is displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and showed excellent reliability estimates for every dimension. Thus, Hypothesis 1a was supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 1b:</head><p>The authors tested a model including a g-factor with one general problemsolving ability factor (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Power calculations (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>) showed no separation from a poor fit and a secure rejection of an exact fit for RMSEA. A x 2 -difference test adjusted for the WLSMV estimator (L. Muthe ´n &amp; Muthe ´n, 2007) indicated that the g-factor model fitted the data significantly worse than the three-dimensional model (x 2 = 33.40; df = 2; p \ .0001). In addition, communalities were lower for almost all items than in the threedimensional model. Generally, modeling the MicroDYN test Laboratory on three dimensions appeared much more appropriate than modeling it on one dimension. Thus, Hypothesis 1b was supported. However, sample size was small, making results on internal structure preliminary. Therefore, results were cross-validated using the MicroDYN test Aquarium, including a different set of tasks within the MicroDYN approach in Study 2, which is reported in the following sections after results on Hypothesis 2 from the main study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prior Analysis to Construct Validity: Measurement Model of Space Shuttle and School Grades</head><p>Space Shuttle. Contrary to the PISA results <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Klieme et al., 2001)</ref>, Space Shuttle initially showed no two-factor solution (knowledge and control) in CFA: Model fit and factor loadings were unacceptable. Thus, items showing either low factor loadings (r if \ .30) or cross loadings (r if . .50 on both factors) were successively excluded from further analyses. The remaining eight knowledge (M = 0.56; SD = 0.20) and eight control items (M = 0.77; SD = 0.16) showed   School grades. Despite the highly selective sample, mathematics and German grades showed considerable variation. The average grade was 1.79 (SD = 1.03) for mathematics and 1.58 (SD = 0.72) for German on a grade scale from 1 = excellent to 6 = poor. The factor loadings on a common factor were .81 for mathematics and .69 for German, respectively (both ps \ .01).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construct Validity</head><p>Hypotheses on construct validity were evaluated within a structural model relating the MicroDYN test Laboratory to Space Shuttle and school grades. The structural part of the model without the observed variables is displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> and showed a good fit (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). In this structural model, factor loadings of the observed variables changed only marginally (on the  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Greiff et al. 203</head><p>2nd decimal) compared with the measurement model within CFA (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). The power to detect misfit through RMSEA was sufficient (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</p><p>Hypothesis 2a: Model building significantly predicted knowledge in Space Shuttle (path coefficient = .40; p \ .05). The relation was moderate and supported Hypothesis 2a. Hypothesis 2b: Forecasting significantly predicted control in Space Shuttle (path coefficient = .39; p \ .05). The relation was moderate and supported Hypothesis 2b. Hypothesis 2c: Model building significantly predicted school grades (path coefficient = .71; p \ .01). This relation was strong whereas forecasting and information retrieval did not predict school grades. To show the additional benefit in prediction when assessing three dimensions in comparison with a general factor, the authors tested a model in which all dimensions were subsumed under a second-order factor of DPS. This factor as well as the residual of model building (i.e., aspects in model building not captured by the secondorder factor) predicted school grades. The path coefficient of the residual of model building (path coefficient = .29; p \ .05) was comparable with the path coefficient of the second-order factor (path coefficient = .31; p \ .01) indicating that model building significantly contributed to the predictive validity of DPS beyond the second-order factor. Path coefficients of the residuals of information retrieval and forecasting on school grades were still nonsignificant. The global model fit in this model was acceptable (x 2 = 63.97; 204</p><p>Applied Psychological Measurement 36(3) df = 38; p = .005; CFI = .96; TLI = .97; RMSEA = .07). Hypothesis 2c was partially supported. Hypothesis 2d: In the overall model as well as in any bivariate model (i.e., school grades and one predictor), only model building predicted school grades significantly. Space Shuttle did not predict school grades and neither did the procedural dimensions forecasting and information retrieval, supporting Hypothesis 2d. Thus, Hypothesis 2d was partially supported.</p><p>In addition, forecasting predicted knowledge (path coefficient = .49; p \ .05) and information retrieval predicted control in Space Shuttle (path coefficient = .68; p \ .01). Both relations were not hypothesized beforehand.</p><p>Results on Hypothesis 2 did not exhibit any significant changes when the MicroDYN test Laboratory was parceled to reduce the amount of estimated parameters. In this analysis, relations between variables and significance levels remained unchanged. The parceling procedure was comparable with the one reported in Kro ¨ner et al. ( <ref type="formula">2005</ref>) and the 11 items of each dimension were subsumed under three parcels. Two out of these three parcels contained four items, whereas one parcel contained only three items. Parcels did not differ significantly in mean difficulty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2: Replication of the Internal Structure With the MicroDYN Test Aquarium</head><p>The authors cross-validated the three-dimensional structure found in the main study in a second sample to show that the MicroDYN approach neither depended on a specific semantic embedding nor on specific task difficulties realized in a MicroDYN test but provided an overarching measurement framework. Furthermore, by including this second study, the authors tried to strengthen their results on internal structure, which were based on an arguably small sample size (n = 114). The sample of the second study 2 (n = 140) consisted of German university students majoring in different fields with less restrictive selection procedures than in the main sample, which majored largely in psychology involving highly competitive selection processes. Therefore, the tasks used in the second sample were designed to be less difficult (e.g., tasks had less relations between variables). In addition, as a different semantic embedding, the MicroDYN test Aquarium was chosen. Within this specific test, fictitious fish food were used as input variables, whereas different fictitious fish species were used as output variables. Instructions, scoring, and test employment remained completely unaltered. The authors expected that results on internal structure in this second study were comparable with the results of the main study. In fact, also in Study 2, a three-dimensional model with the dimensions information retrieval, model building, and forecasting showed a good fit (x 2 = 86.47; df = 55; p \ .001; CFI = .99; TLI = .99; RMSEA = .06). Cronbach's a was .93 for information retrieval, .87 for model building, and .86 for forecasting, respectively. The scale intercorrelations in the three-dimensional model were .62 (information retrieval with forecasting), .73 (information retrieval with model building), and .88 (model building with forecasting; all ps \ .01). Power calculations, factor loadings, and communalities were comparable with the ones reported for the main sample and well within the range of satisfactory values. The fit for the threedimensional model was significantly better (x 2 difference test: x 2 = 48.37; df = 2; p \ .0001) than the not acceptable fit of the one-dimensional model with a general first-order DPS factor (x 2 = 154.27; df = 52; p \ .001; CFI = .95; TLI = .95; RMSEA = .12). Thus, the threedimensional structure found in the MicroDYN test Laboratory was replicated in a second sample using the MicroDYN Test Aquarium, exhibiting comparable results and speaking well for the MicroDYN approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The authors criticized shortcomings of DPS research from a psychometric point of view and claimed to overcome them by integrating (a) the LSE formalism <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Funke, 2001)</ref> and (b) multiple tasks into the MicroDYN approach to test internal structure, reliability, and construct validity. Essentially supporting their hypotheses, the assumed measurement model comprising the three dimensions, information retrieval, model building, and forecasting, fit the data well, whereas a one-dimensional model led to a significant deterioration in fit. This internal structure was observed in the main sample of n = 114 and cross-validated in an additional sample of n = 140 tested with a different test exemplar based on the MicroDYN approach. Reliability estimates were excellent for all dimensions and in both samples. Thus, the MicroDYN approach proved its value by showing comparable results in two studies that included different MicroDYN tests based on different semantic covers and composed of tasks with varying difficulty.</p><p>When relating the MicroDYN test Laboratory to Space Shuttle, a traditional DPS test, latent correlations were substantial indicating convergent validity between the two measures and supporting the concept of less time-consuming and independent tasks in the MicroDYN approach. More specifically, the corresponding dimensions model building and knowledge (Space Shuttle), as well as forecasting and control (Space Shuttle), were related to each other. Although not hypothesized a priori, there was a significant prediction of control in Space Shuttle by information retrieval. As information retrieval assesses the quality of input strategies, it slightly resembles control items in Space Shuttle both requiring procedural interventions into a dynamic system. Furthermore, forecasting predicted knowledge (Space Shuttle). This might be due to the kind of knowledge items used in Space Shuttle. There, a specific initial state and an intervention were given, and participants were asked to identify the subsequent state. This could be considered a one-step control item similar to forecasting. Apparently, distinguishing the concepts of knowledge and control in Space Shuttle was not sufficiently explicit within the task. Regarding predictive validity of school performance as another aspect of construct validity, the MicroDYN dimension model building was strongly related to school grades, but there was no substantial prediction for the other MicroDYN dimensions or for Space Shuttle as additional measure of DPS. The overall pattern indicated that introducing multiple tasks indeed led to a gain in validity (likely mediated by higher reliability), higher order cognitive reasoning, which is necessary for developing representations of a system (i.e., model building), reflected cognitive processes needed for successful performance in school, and procedural aspects of cognitive capacity as measured in information retrieval and forecasting were not mirrored in school grades. Some other results were remarkable due to their practical implications. (a) Mean performance on information retrieval (i.e., use of adequate strategies) was considerably higher than mean performance on the two remaining dimensions. Even though excellent in exploring unknown systems, transferring information into a correct model or into accurate control performance proved to be considerably more difficult. This provides a starting point when fostering DPS ability: Training efforts should aim both at how to generate information and at how to use that information when deriving viable models. This is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen and Klahr (1999)</ref>, who trained participants in conducting experiments that allow for causal inferences (i.e., the VOTAT strategy). They report that knowledge gathered during training was successfully transferred to different contexts. That is, the experimental group performed better than the control group in</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>206</head><p>Applied Psychological Measurement 36(3) tasks comparable with the original one but also in generalizing the knowledge gained across various tasks. Contrary to research on strategic learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Vollmeyer &amp; Rheinberg, 1999)</ref>, in this study, participants either applied VOTAT or did not. Changing strategies was almost nonexistent. This is probably due to the graphical layout of MicroDYN tasks suggesting the use of VOTAT and due to the highly capable samples. This interpretation can be related to (b) the slightly lower correlations between dimensions in the second sample: The higher the general cognitive ability of a population, the better the insights gathered during one phase are transferred to another as indicated by a higher correlation in the first sample of information retrieval with model building and forecasting, respectively. (c) Furthermore, explicit knowledge assessed in model building explained performance in school grades even beyond the general DPS factor. Thus, it is highly advisable to design DPS tasks in a way that would allow the measurement of several dimensions of DPS ability.</p><p>Results presented here are not yet sufficient to establish DPS as distinct from other constructs. Former research has questioned the mere existence of DPS. Su ¨ß (1999), for instance, claimed it to be only a jumble of intelligence and prior knowledge, and supported this assumption empirically. However, one point not considered by Su ¨ß is that when solutions for a problem are routinely available and thus rely on prior knowledge and specific content, important characteristics of a problem are lost. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Funke (2003)</ref> denoted these situations a routine task. The authors claim that the dynamic interaction with an unknown environment is at the heart of DPS, and in the tasks chosen by Su ¨ß, prior knowledge concealed genuine features of a problem situation. As a consequence, DPS did not come fully into play. The MicroDYN approach, on the contrary, enables a pure measurement of general DPS, activating only minimal prior knowledge.</p><p>How DPS and intelligence relate to each other has also been extensively disputed <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kro ¨ner et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Putz-Osterloh, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Su ¨ß, 1999)</ref>. This dispute has remained inconclusive largely due to continuing measurement issues in DPS. In fact, contradictory results might well have descended from different operationalizations and poor psychometric features of DPS tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Su ¨ß, 1999)</ref>. Conceptually, the definition of DPS underlying <ref type="bibr">MicroDYN (Buchner, 1995)</ref> and the definition of general intelligence are easily separated, whereas this is not necessarily true empirically. Tentative results from another study not reported here showed medium to high correlations between the three dimensions of MicroDYN and general intelligence (measured by the Advanced Progressive Matrices; <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Raven, 1962)</ref> with model building explaining approximately 10% of the variance in school grades beyond intelligence. This is not surprising considering the frequency with which unknown situations have to be mastered in daily school life <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beckmann &amp; Guthke, 1995)</ref>. Apparently, it was only the psychometric link that had been missing thus far to properly separate DPS and intelligence. But does the MicroDYN approach as an advance in measuring DPS truly lead to an improved understanding of the construct under study? The authors argue that inconclusive evidence in DPS research has been largely due to a neglect of measurement issues. A reliable and valid measurement instrument incorporating advantages of formal frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Funke, 2001</ref>) and using multiple independent tasks is a precondition for discovering the significance of DPS in cognitive research. At the same time, fundamental questions still remain unanswered, and further research is needed to elaborate on the relations between DPS and other cognitive constructs.</p><p>Three particular shortcomings in this study need consideration. (a) The samples drawn were not representative and generalizability was therefore reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brennan, 1983)</ref> even though variance on all measures was sufficient and the reliabilities of the MicroDYN dimensions were excellent. The authors can only speculate about how internal structure and construct validity might change in a representative sample, but it is likely that predictive power </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">t + 1 = 1 3 W t 2 0.5 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t X t + 1 = 1.2 3 X t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Y t + 1 = 1 3 Y t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0.2 3 C t + 0 3 D t Z t + 1 = 1 3 Z t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0.2 3 C t + 0 3 D t W t + 1 = 1 3 W t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t X t + 1 = 1 3 X t + 0 3 A t + 0.5 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Y t + 1 = 1 3 Y t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Z t + 1 = 1 3 Z t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0.2 3 D t Task 2 W t + 1 = 1 3 W t + 0.2 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t X t + 1 = 1 3 X t + 0.2 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Y t + 1 = 1 3 Y t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0.2 3 C t + 0.2 3 D t Z t + 1 = 1.5 3 Z t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t W t + 1 = 1 3 W t + 0.5 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t X t + 1 = 1 3 X t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Y t + 1 = 1 3 Y t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0.2 3 C t + 0.2 3 D t Z t + 1 = 1 3 Z t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Task 3 W t + 1 = 1 3 W t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t X t + 1 = 0.5 3 X t + 0 3 A t + 0.5 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Y t + 1 = 1 3 Y t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0.2 3 C t + 0 3 D t Z t + 1 = 1 3 Z t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0.2 3 C t + 0 3 D t W t + 1 = 1 3 W t + 0.5 3 A t + 0.5 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t X t + 1 = 1 3 X t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Y t + 1 = 1 3 Y t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Z t + 1 = 1 3 Z t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0.2 3 D t Task 4 W t + 1 = 1 3 W t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t X t + 1 = 1.5 3 X t + 0 3 A t + 0.5 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Y t + 1 = 1 3 Y t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0.2 3 C t + 0 3 D t Z t + 1 = 1 3 Z t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0.2 3 C t + 0 3 D t W t + 1 = 1 3 W t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t X t + 1 = 1 3 X t + 0 3 A t + 0.2 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Y t + 1 = 1 3 Y t + 0 3 A t + 0.2 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Z t + 1 = 1.5 3 Z t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Task 5 W t + 1 = 1 3 W t + 0.5 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t X t + 1 = 1 3 X t + 0 3 A t + 0.5 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Y t + 1 = 1 3 Y t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0.2 3 C t + 0 3 D t Z t + 1 = 1 3 Z t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0.2 3 C t + 0 3 D t W t + 1 = 1.2 3 W t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t X t + 1 = 1 3 X t + 0 3 A t + 0.5 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Y t + 1 = 1 3 Y t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Z t + 1 = 1 3 Z t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Task 6 W t + 1 = 1 3 W t 2 0.5 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t X t + 1 = 1 3 X t + 0 3 A t + 0.5 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Y t + 1 = 1 3 Y t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0.2 3 C t + 0 3 D t Z t + 1 = 1 3 Z t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0.2 3 C t + 0 3 D t W t + 1 = 1 3 W t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t X t + 1 = 1 3 X t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t + 0.5 3 W t Y t + 1 = 1 3 Y t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0.2 3 C t + 0 3 D t Z t + 1 = 1 3 Z t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Task 7 W t + 1 = 1 3 W t 2 0.5 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t X t + 1 = 1.2 3 X t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Y t + 1 = 1 3 Y t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0.2 3 C t + 0.2 3 D t Z t + 1 = 1 3 Z t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t W t + 1 = 1 3 W t + 0.2 3 A t + 0.2 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t X t + 1 = 1 3 X t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Y t + 1 = 1 3 Y t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Z t + 1 = 1 3 Z t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t + 0.5 3 Y t Task 8 W t + 1 = 1 3 W t 2 0.5 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t X t + 1 = 1.2 3 X t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Y t + 1 = 1 3 Y t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0.2 3 C t + 0.2 3 D t Z t + 1 = 1 3 Z t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t W t + 1 = 1 3 W t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t X t + 1 = 1.5 3 X t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Y t + 1 = 1 3 Y t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t Z t + 1 = 1 3 Z t + 0 3 A t + 0 3 B t + 0 3 C t + 0 3 D t + 0.2 3 Y t (continued)</formula></div>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" xml:id="foot_1"><p>MicroDYN test laboratory. Valid performance indicators for each of the three dimensions, information retrieval, model building, and forecasting, had to be derived. DPS research has mainly used continuous indicators (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Funke, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kluge, 2008)</ref> trying to disentangle performance attributable to participants' competency, to system characteristics, or to guessing. For instance,<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Funke (1985)</ref> decided to weight the number of relations, which were correctly or incorrectly identified by participants, in a way that punished guessing. Similarly,<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kluge (2008)</ref> took in her assessment of forecasting into account that in some tasks, even random actions by the participant may result in drawing closer to given target values and assigned weighted corrections to performance scores considering that in some systems, random inputs might be more helpful than in others. In summary, all these indicators include weights computed by specific algorithms, which influence the derived performance indicators to an unknown extent. Thus, the authors decided to choose a conservative approach by using clearly defined and ordinalscaled categories, although results remained largely unchanged when the authors used weighted indicators such as the ones proposed by Funke or Kluge. Differences were only observed as slight reductions in factor loadings and in reliability estimates, suggesting an increase in error variance in comparison to the ordinal scoring chosen in this study. Scoring was doneGreiff et al.  </p></note>

In addition, the sample size was arguably small at n = 114 and usually would not be considered sufficient for latent analyses. However, the internal structure was replicated in a second sample (n = 140) with a different MicroDYN test version supporting its empirical stability. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hu and Bentler (1999)</ref> showed that also in small samples, stable models can be derived and power analyses to detect misfit were satisfactory with regard to RMSEA yielding sufficient probabilities to identify incorrectly specified models. (b) Distinguishing general intelligence (e.g., as measured by the Advanced Progressive Matrices; <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Raven, 1962)</ref> and DPS empirically was not the focus of this study, but the first results mentioned earlier indicate differential validity. Whereas intelligence tests aim to assess basic cognitive skills, DPS taps into higher order cognitive reasoning involving declarative and procedural aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Funke, 2003)</ref>. Theoretical and empirical separation of these constructs, however, still needs further attention. (c) The operationalization chosen in MicroDYN is narrow and does not fully acknowledge the concept of DPS in its entire width, although this is also the case for other constructs such as intelligence: Whereas the concept of intelligence is broad and overarching, this is not true for its accompanying tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Sternberg, 2000)</ref>. Consequently, the widespread use of intelligence tests is argued for because of their high predictive validity and their practical use and not because of their theoretical value <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Sternberg, 2000)</ref>. In line with this argument, the authors propose to view MicroDYN as one feasible operationalization of DPS that does not claim to capture all relevant dimensions suggested in the literature. The authors are aware that the MicroDYN approach could be broadened regarding the nature of the tasks (e.g., by including FSA) and the theoretical approach (e.g., by incorporating other theoretical approaches such as multiple space models; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Klahr &amp; Dunbar, 1988)</ref>, but the authors suggest to evaluate the MicroDYN approach with regard to its measurement characteristics and its construct validity, which have proved useful in this study.</p><p>The authors agree with <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kluge's (2008)</ref> bottom line that ''it is useful to apply well-known measurement standards to MWs (Microworlds). Otherwise, the performance of test takers is contaminated . . . unknown to, or ignored by, the test developer or practitioner in personnel standard'' (p. 178). When assessing DPS in personnel or student selection, in evaluation of teaching, or in prediction of professional performance, sticking to established standards of measurement is indisputable. The price paid for this is the loss of large tasks with a confusing number of variables and a long time on task. Instead, the use of less time-consuming tasks becomes necessary to achieve item independency and to check scalability. Is it truly a loss to waive tasks that are so well established in the research area? The authors do not think so. Results of this study encourage this point of view.</p><p>We encounter problem solving every single day-at school, at work, and at home. Without our ability to become familiar with new systems, to understand them, and finally, to influence them as we desire, we would be utterly lost. This is why DPS research has been around for a long time. But without a reliable and valid measurement device, all its assets are only tentative and inconclusive. This cannot be the desire of any research field. It is the authors' wish that more researchers get involved in the proper measurement of DPS in an attempt to tame this monstrous beast by mapping it on a scale and not allowing it to run around loosely in different disguises.</p></div>
