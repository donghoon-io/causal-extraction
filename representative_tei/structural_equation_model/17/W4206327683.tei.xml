<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Sociopsychological theorizing and research on collective action (e.g., social protests) has mushroomed over the last decade, studying a wide variety of groups, contexts, and cultures. Through a quantitative research synthesis of four motivations for collective action (1,235 effects from 403 samples; total N = 123,707), we summarize and synthesize this body of research into the dual chamber model, a comprehensive and potentially cross-cultural model of collective action. We aim to replicate previous meta-analytic conclusions (about identity, injustice, and efficacy) and break new theoretical ground by (a) integrating a fourth motivation (morality) into the very heart of the psychology of collective action, (b) extending these four motivations to advantaged group members acting in solidarity with the disadvantaged, and (c) integrating theoretically relevant structural (i.e., cultural and other contextual) constraints. Results substantiated the dual chamber model as all four motivations yielded unique, positive, medium-sized effects and interrelationships were positive (particularly among morality and identity, conceptualized as the dual chambers of the protester's beating heart). Meta-analytic structural equation modeling supported the added value of including morality. Moreover, findings confirmed that the strongest specific motivations were emotional injustice and politicized identification, while newly adding moral conviction to that list. Finally, the four motivations extended to advantaged group members acting in solidarity with the disadvantaged, while only the identity motivation was constrained by theoretically relevant cultural dimensions and values (e.g., collectivism and hierarchy). We discuss the implications and limitations of the dual chamber model for integrative theorizing, innovative research, and the practice of collective action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Public Significance Statement</head><p>This broad research synthesis finds that individuals' engagement in collective action (e.g., protests, demonstrations) is uniquely predicted by their identity, moral, injustice, and efficacy motivations. Despite small cultural constraints, the four motivations predicted collective action across the globe and applied to disadvantaged group members as well as advantaged group members acting in solidarity with them. Our findings offer specific recommendations for practitioners toward targeting these four motivations for collective action.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Why do people around the globe participate in social protests and demonstrations? The psychological literature on such manifestations of collective action often defines such actions as those enacted by psychological group members who seek to improve the conditions of their disadvantaged group <ref type="bibr" target="#b369">(Wright et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 995)</ref>, with recent work extending this definition to include members from other groups acting in solidarity with the disadvantaged (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b333">van Zomeren, 2013)</ref>. 1 As such, collective action occurs based on a psychologically relevant social identity, defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b303">Tajfel (1978)</ref> as the knowledge that one is a member of a particular group, together with the emotional and value significance attached to this group membership. This definition paints a portrait of the protester in which their social identity reflects the protester's beating heart, suggesting a common psychology behind collective action, be it whether people act for Black Lives Matter or the climate, protest against war or COVID restrictions, or seek to collectively change laws or see their government toppled.</p><p>We move beyond this portrait of the protester by formulating and testing a more comprehensive and potentially cross-cultural model of collective action. This model integrates moral motivations for collective action (i.e., those based on values, moral principles, or ideology; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b328">Van Stekelenburg et al., 2009)</ref> with established motivations for collective action <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">(van Zomeren et al., 2008)</ref>, and with theoretically relevant cultural constraints 2 on these motivations (e.g., collectivism, hierarchy; <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Hofstede, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b261">Schwartz, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Oyserman et al., 2002)</ref>. The dual chamber model of collective action (visualized in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) portrays the protester's beating heart as reflecting the dual chambers of social identity and morality, which, to continue this metaphor, collaborate to oxygenate the blood pumped around the body to foster the emotional experience of group-based injustice (e.g., anger) and the belief in the efficacy of the group, both of which help individuals understand and deal with the group's situation and motivate collective action.</p><p>Conceptually, the integration of morality 3 into the very heart of the psychology of collective action is both fundamental and formative. This is because although the theoretical focus in this literature has been on social identity as binding individuals into groups that obligate individuals to act on its behalf (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b290">Stürmer &amp; Simon, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b333">van Zomeren, 2013)</ref>, morality often serves these very same functions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Ellemers, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Haidt, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b236">Rai &amp; Fiske, 2011)</ref>. For instance, strong individual moral beliefs can define and create emerging group identities that bring people together (e.g., Fridays for Future), just as strong existing group identities can push specific group norms into the moral domain (e.g., Greenpeace seeking to ban whale hunting by framing it as immoral). The dual chamber model conceptualizes these motivations as dual chambers of the protester's beating heart, with morality and identity both binding and mutually obligating individuals to act in concert. 4  Against this backdrop, this research synthesis 5 moves beyond previous meta-analytic <ref type="bibr">findings (van Zomeren et al., 2008)</ref> by testing four (rather than three) unique motivations for collective action <ref type="bibr">(identity, morality, injustice, and efficacy)</ref>. This nuance enables us to replicate and extend previous conclusions about why people engage in collective action, as well as break new theoretical ground by integrating morality into a more comprehensive and potentially cross-cultural model of collective action. Moreover, the larger and culturally more diverse database of studies allows us to test whether these four motivations extend to advantaged group members acting in solidarity with the disadvantaged and integrates structural constraints (including theoretically relevant cultural constraints) to these four motivations.</p><p>Such a research synthesis is both timely and urgent. Scientifically, the psychological literature on collective action has mushroomed over the last decade, 6 resembling the proverbial runaway horse that may be just about to escape us. A new research synthesis can serve to reign in our runaway horse to cover its tracks back to where it came from, to better chart the way forward-especially because this period also witnessed the emergence of moral psychology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Ellemers et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Haidt, 2007)</ref>. Moreover, the popularity of the topic seems to have increased: The current database is very diverse, about seven times larger than the one from a previous meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">(van Zomeren et al., 2008)</ref>, and includes studies of collective action among different groups (e.g., not just disadvantaged groups but also advantaged groups acting in solidarity with disadvantaged groups), different contexts (e.g., different types of disadvantage), and different cultures (e.g., with study origins ranging from China and Japan to Indonesia and New Zealand, from Chile and Mexico to the United States and Canada, and across a variety of European countries 7 ). The latter affords a unique opportunity to connect and integrate the psychology of collective action with cultural psychology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Hofstede, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b261">Schwartz, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Oyserman et al., 2002)</ref>. 2 We use the terminology of "constraints" because we know less about when motivations for collective action become less powerful. Nonetheless, structural factors can also afford motivations for collective action, which is also what we will test in this quantitative research synthesis. 3 We use umbrella terms such as "morality" and "identity" to specifically refer to moral and social identity motivations for collective action. 4 We borrow this terminology from <ref type="bibr">Oyserman et al. (2002, p. 5)</ref>, who conceptualized the cultural notion of collectivism in precisely these terms.</p><p>The notions of binding and obligating generate a conceptual bridge that allows for connecting the psychology of collective action to moral and cultural psychology (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Oyserman &amp; Lauffer, 2002</ref>, for an application to social movements). This functional view of morality and identity also accommodates that individuals can act together to preserve, rather than challenge, the status quo, for instance when individuals act to protect the system (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Osborne et al., 2019)</ref>. 5 Many qualitative reviews of this literature are available (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Becker &amp; Tausch, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Kelly &amp; Breinlinger, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Klandermans, 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Klandermans, , 2004;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Marx &amp; Wood, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">McPhail, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Stekelenburg &amp; Klandermans, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b337">van Zomeren, 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b338">van Zomeren, , 2019))</ref>, but a quantitative research synthesis uniquely enables us to quantify both the size, direction, and interrelationship(s) of the effect(s) of interest. 6 This is also indicated by a variety of special and virtual issues of Furthermore, this research synthesis is societally relevant given the diversity of the many collective action events and movements occurring in the very same decade, including but not limited to the Arab Spring protests and the emergence of movements like Black Lives Matter, MeToo, and Fridays for Future. These recent events and movements raise the question of how generalizable studies from more than 12 years ago may be to inform the practice of contemporary collective action (e.g., the mass protests in the United States after the death of George Floyd in 2020). Indeed, by timing alone the previous meta-analysis could not include studies about the economic crisis in 2008 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Grasso &amp; Giugni, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b232">Poeschl et al., 2015)</ref>; the 2011 Arab Spring protests that spread across countries such as Egypt and Tunesia (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ayanian &amp; Tausch, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b318">Thyen &amp; Gerschewski, 2018)</ref>; the sudden viral emergence of different online movements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Kende et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b315">Thomas et al., 2015</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Bennett &amp; Segerberg, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Castells, 2015)</ref>; the proand anti-immigrant movements in Europe (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b266">Shepherd et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b316">Thomas et al., 2019)</ref>; the ascent of Black Lives Matter in response to events involving police brutality in 2013 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Leach &amp; Allen, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Klavina &amp; van Zomeren, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b263">Selvanathan et al., 2018)</ref>; and the emergence of many forms of climate change strikes around 2015 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Fritsche et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Kutlaca et al., 2019)</ref>. 8 As such, the specific time period since the previous meta-analysis <ref type="bibr">(from 2008 to 2019</ref>) is of particular interest, both scientifically and societally, and for both theoretical and applied reasons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goals and Approach</head><p>Our research synthesis enables replication and extension of current knowledge about motivations for collective action. Indeed, our main goals of replication and breaking new theoretical ground fit with various trends in the literature over the last decade. The replication goal fits, for instance, with a trend of increased productivity in the field. As such, there is unprecedented scope for replicating the insights from the previous meta-analysis on a much larger and thus more comprehensive database. 9 The replication goal also fits with another trend of focusing on multiple motivations for collective action. Rather than studies focusing on a single motivation derived from a single perspective (e.g., social identity, as based in social identity theory), researchers now more routinely include multiple motivations for collective action within their studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Cakal et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Jost et al., 2017)</ref>. There is thus much more data available on the interrelationships between different motivations for collective action.</p><p>Breaking new theoretical ground fits with a recent trend of focusing on morality as a different motivation for collective action, with studies focusing on moral conviction (defined as attitudes on a specific issue that are grounded in core values; <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">Skitka, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b340">van Zomeren et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b343">van Zomeren et al., , 2012</ref>) but also on system justification (reflecting an ideological preference for societal stability; <ref type="bibr">Jost et al., 2017)</ref>. This research synthesis is therefore the first to metaanalytically evaluate whether there is a sound and solid basis for integrating moral motivations into the heart of the psychology of collective action. If so, this research has at least two important theoretical implications: First, the beating heart of the protester may not only reflect identity but also moral motivations (i.e., it may not only reflect who "we" are but also what "we" stand for; van <ref type="bibr">Zomeren et al., 2018)</ref>. Second, this research enables a more comprehensive explanation of why members of other groups, such as advantaged group members, can act in solidarity with a disadvantaged group <ref type="bibr" target="#b333">(van Zomeren, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The goal to break new theoretical ground also fits with a trend of globalization of (the study of) collective action. Indeed, studies use contexts, groups, and samples (i.e., research participants) from all over the globe-which, if only for logistic reasons, was very difficult or even unimaginable not so long ago (e.g., before the advent of the Internet, social media, and research methods to collect international data). In line with critiques that too much psychological knowledge is inferred from a culturally narrow database (e.g., by relying on samples from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic contexts; <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Henrich et al., 2010</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Henry, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b262">Sears, 1986)</ref>, this rich diversity offers an unprecedented opportunity to identify and test theoretically relevant cultural constraints to the four motivations for collective action-a focus not at all common in the psychology of collective action (for exceptions see <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Fischer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b344">van Zomeren &amp; Louis, 2017)</ref>. As such, we connect the psychology of collective action with insights from cultural psychology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hofstede, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">Oyserman et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b259">Schwartz, 1992)</ref> to answer the question of whether the protester's heart beats the same across the globe.</p><p>To this end, we conducted four meta-analyses, each on a different motivation for collective action: Identity, injustice, efficacy, and, for the first time, morality. We expected to replicate previous meta-analytic <ref type="bibr">findings (van Zomeren et al., 2008</ref>) that identity, injustice, and efficacy show unique and positive medium-sized effects; and to newly find that morality is a fourth unique and positive motivation. We also meta-analyzed the interrelationships between the four motivations, expecting positive relationships between the three established motivations and, newly, also between morality and the other motivations for collective action-in particular, between morality and identity, which reflect the dual chambers of the protester's beating heart. We further tested previous conclusions that the strongest motivations for collective action are politicized identity (e.g., identification with a movement rather than with the broader disadvantaged group) and emotional injustice (e.g., group-based anger rather than perceptions of unfairness). Moreover, we tested new motivational and structural moderator variables. For example, based on indications from the literature we examined whether moral conviction is as strong a motivation for collective action as politicized identity and emotional injustice. Furthermore, we identified and tested theoretically relevant cultural constraints (such as collectivism and hierarchy values) and contextual constraints (e.g., disadvantaged or advantaged group members as actors) to the four motivations for collective action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toward a Comprehensive and Potentially Cross-Cultural Model of Collective Action</head><p>The history of the sociopsychological literature on collective action is sometimes described as the coming together of different theoretical approaches to motivation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">van Zomeren et al., 2008)</ref>. Scholars from this literature already made some progress in synthesizing, at most, three motivations for collective action among members of disadvantaged groups (often based in social identity theory; <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Duncan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Mummendey et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b290">Stürmer &amp; Simon, 2004</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b368">Wright, 2009)</ref> yet made less progress on conceptualizing structural constraints (van Zomeren, 2016c; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Corcoran et al., 2011)</ref>. The dual chamber model we propose continues this trend by integrating four motivations for collective action with theoretically relevant structural constraints.</p><p>Specifically, previous work integrated three perspectives on motivation: Social identity theory focuses on social identity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Brown, 2019)</ref>; relative deprivation theory focuses on perceived and felt injustice as a key motivation for collective action (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b278">Smith et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b279">Smith et al., , 2018))</ref>, and self-efficacy theory on self-efficacy beliefs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bandura, 2001)</ref>. From the 1990s onward, integrative proposals were developed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Kawakami &amp; Dion, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Simon et al., 1998)</ref>, inspiring theory and research to combine two or even three of these motivations for collective action (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Mummendey et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b290">Stürmer &amp; Simon, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b346">van Zomeren et al., 2008)</ref>. 10  Over the last decade, this development toward integration culminated in the formulation of several integrative models that wielded social identity as its integrative tool.</p><p>For example, the Social Identity model of Collective Action (SIMCA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">van Zomeren et al., 2008)</ref> was developed based on a meta-analysis of the identity, injustice, and efficacy motivations for collective action. It suggested a key role for disadvantaged group members' identification with that group to not only directly predict collective action (because it makes the group more self-relevant and increases conformity to group norms; <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">van Zomeren et al., 2008)</ref> but also indirectly (through the injustice and efficacy motivations). The assumption was thus that collective action requires a relevant social identity on which to act (i.e., a sense of who "we" are) and on which basis to understand and deal with the group's situation (in terms of perceived/felt group-based injustice and efficacy beliefs). In this theoretical universe, collective action would in fact not be possible without a psychologically relevant social identity-a view directly reflected in <ref type="bibr" target="#b369">Wright et al. (1990)</ref> often-used definition of collective action: Any action undertaken by an individual as a psychological representative of the group to improve the conditions of his or her group as a whole (emphasis added). Put differently, the protester's beating heart was to be found in his or her social identity. 11  The dual chamber model offers a next theoretical advance, which is based on recent theoretical developments in the collective action literature that we seek to include in our synthesis. For one, moral motivations emerged over the last decade as powerful predictors of collective action, which begs the question of which place it should have in the psychology of collective action. The advent of moral psychology over the last decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Ellemers et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Haidt, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Haidt, , 2012) )</ref> offers two reasons for why its place should be a central one. First, morality binds: It often serves as a strong glue that holds social groups together <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Ellemers et al., 2019)</ref>. Indeed, different groups may prioritize different morals that evoke intergroup conflict and an active protection of each group <ref type="bibr">'s morals (e.g., between liberals and conservatives;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Haidt, 2012)</ref>. This process of intergroup value protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">(Leal et al., 2020</ref>) is often at the core of conflicts between social movements (van <ref type="bibr">Stekelenburg et al., 2009</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr">van Stekelenburg &amp; Klandermans, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2017)</ref> and governments or other groups (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">Simon &amp; Klandermans, 2001)</ref> and thus between those who fight for and against change (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Jost et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Osborne et al., 2019)</ref>. Second, morality obligates: Holding a moral conviction, for example, motivates collective action but also makes people conform to norms about what is the right thing to do or be (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Sabucedo et al., 2018</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Ellemers, 2017)</ref>. In the context of collective action at least, morality thus seems to function much like social identity; therefore, the dual chamber model conceptualizes them as the dual chambers of the protester's beating heart. We use this conceptualization as a basis for (a) integrating the other motivations for collective action and (b) identifying theoretically relevant structural constraints to these motivations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrating Four Motivations for Collective Action</head><p>The dual chamber model integrates four motivations for collective action by painting a portrait of the protester as having a beating heart with morality and identity chambers, on which basis individuals can understand and deal with the group's situation in terms of collective action (that is, through the injustice and efficacy motivations). In essence, the model thus assumes the protester to be an identity manager as much as a value protector <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">(Skitka, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b310">Tetlock, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Zomeren et al., 2018)</ref>. 12 This assumption means that although moral and identity motivations both serve to bind and obligate individuals to act in concert, the two rely on different psychological processes and hence should have unique motivational power. Specifically, collective action may then not only be the result of an identity management process to cope with self-evaluative concerns about one's group's low status (i.e., about "who we are") but also include the active defense 13  of what "we" stand for <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">(Skitka, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b310">Tetlock, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Zomeren et al., 2018)</ref>. Indeed, research found a strong positive relationship between moral conviction and a relevant social identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b340">(van Zomeren et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b343">van Zomeren et al., 2012)</ref>, which connects who "we" are with what "we" stand for (i.e., identity content; <ref type="bibr" target="#b321">Turner-Zwinkels et al., 2017)</ref>. A key implication of this line of thought is that the same motivations for collective action may extend to members from other groups, such as advantaged groups, 10 In all these approaches, the causal direction implied (from motivation to action) is strongly assumed. Few studies focus on the consequences of collective action on those motivations (e.g., Tausch &amp; Becker, 2013).  11 This portrayal is also visible in other models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abrams &amp; Grant, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Becker &amp; Tausch, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Drury &amp; Reicher, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b314">Thomas et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b343">van Zomeren et al., 2012)</ref>, but none of these models include and integrate morality as a fourth unique motivation for collective action, and identify and integrate structural constraints to these motivations. 12 van Zomeren et al. ( <ref type="formula">2018</ref>) reviewed research on politicized identity and different moral motivations for collective action, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Osborne et al. (2019)</ref> combined social identity and system justification motivations in their research (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">De Cristofaro et al., 2021)</ref>. The dual chamber model, as outlined and tested in this article, offers a broader integrative model that reflects all these developments in the literature. 13 Although this specific literature has focused most on value protection rather than promotion, value promotion processes are also important.</p><p>acting in solidarity with the disadvantaged <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Curtin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b239">Reimer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b248">Saab et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b293">Subaši c et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b317">Thomas et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b333">van Zomeren, 2013)</ref>, precisely because they may also be defending or promoting core values.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> Below, we outline how the dual chamber model integrates four perspectives on collective action.</p><p>The Social Identity Perspective. Social identity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b303">(Tajfel, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b304">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979)</ref> conceptualizes collective action as an identity management strategy (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Ellemers, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Mummendey et al., 1999)</ref> and hence a protester as an "identity manager." SIT assumes that people generally strive for positive social identities, and hence identities that confer low group status, stigma, discrimination, or other types of collective disadvantaged should require an identity management response to maintain a positive self-evaluation. Only under specific perceived sociostructural conditions (that is, when people perceive hope and scope for social change, and when they perceive boundaries between the low-and the high-status group as impermeable), SIT predicts that individuals become motivated to engage in collective action to turn their negative identity into a more positive one (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Becker, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Bettencourt et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b256">Scheepers et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b319">Turner &amp; Brown, 1978)</ref>. Individuals' identification with their disadvantaged group should therefore motivate collective action <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Ellemers, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Kelly &amp; Breinlinger, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Mummendey et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b303">Tajfel, 1978)</ref>. In line with surveys and experiments demonstrating such a positive relationship (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Simon et al., 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b346">), van Zomeren et al. (2008)</ref> meta-analytically obtained a positive, medium-sized effect for this relationship.</p><p>Furthermore, in line with studies among social movement members (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b290">Stürmer &amp; Simon, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b346">), van Zomeren et al. (2008)</ref> found that politicized identification (i.e., identification with a social movement or activist group) motivated collective action more strongly than nonpoliticized identification. This finding emerged because identification with a group that has clearer goals and stricter norms about acting for the group (as in the case of movements or activist groups) increases a stronger "inner obligation" to act for the group <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Blackwood &amp; Louis, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b290">Stürmer &amp; Simon, 2004)</ref>. As such, this perspective emphasizes the importance of individuals' social identity in binding and mutually obligating individuals to act in concert, and in particular their politicized identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Alberici &amp; Milesi, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Blackwood &amp; Louis, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Klandermans, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b272">Simon &amp; Klandermans, 2001)</ref>. The protester's beating heart, then, indeed may be his or her social identity-particularly when this identity is politicized. The current research synthesis seeks to replicate these findings.</p><p>Nevertheless, this line of thought cannot explain why members of other groups, such as advantaged groups, would act in solidarity with the disadvantaged (e.g., men acting for gender equality). SIT's analysis implies that members of high-status groups would not experience a need to manage a negative identity and hence would not need to manage it through collective action <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Ellemers, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b303">Tajfel, 1978)</ref>. If anything, one might expect high-status group members to defend their high status-the very opposite of acting in solidarity with the disadvantaged <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(Leach et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b333">van Zomeren, 2013)</ref>. Nevertheless, the dual chamber model suggests that collective action is not the monopoly of disadvantaged group members (e.g., van Zomeren, 2013)-individuals from other groups, such as advantaged groups, can act in solidarity with the disadvantaged (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Curtin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b239">Reimer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b248">Saab et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b293">Subaši c et al., 2011)</ref>. For this reason, the current research synthesis evaluates whether the same motivations for collective action extend to advantaged group members.</p><p>The Morality Perspective. The emergence of moral psychology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Ellemers, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Haidt, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Haidt, , 2012;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b274">Skitka, 2010)</ref> inspired scientific interest in moral motivations for collective action (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Jost et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Milesi &amp; Alberici, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sabucedo et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b328">van Stekelenburg et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Stekelenburg &amp; Klandermans, 2009)</ref>, which includes motivations based in values, moral principles or beliefs, or ideology. In particular, collective action research has recently emphasized the concepts of moral conviction and system justification. Based on value protection models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b310">Tetlock, 2002)</ref>; if people hold moral convictions on an issue (e.g., education as a universal human right) and these convictions are threatened (e.g., when a government proposes to implement tuition fees), then the perceived violation of these moral beliefs and principles, and the resulting emotional experience (e.g., anger), motivate them to engage in action to defend core values from attack through collective action (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Kutlaca et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Leal et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Mazzoni et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b270">Shuman et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b274">Skitka, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b333">van Zomeren, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">van Zomeren, , 2011;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b343">van Zomeren et al., 2012)</ref>. This form of morality reflects a deontological view that is conceptually indicative of a more general value protection process that the dual chamber model puts at the heart of the psychology of collective action. The current research synthesis tests this idea.</p><p>Moreover, collective action researchers recently focused on system justification,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> an ideological motive to justify and uphold the system in which one is embedded (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Jost et al., 2004)</ref>. In this view, individuals have individual motives (e.g., self-interest) and group motives (e.g., group esteem), but also system motives that may explain, for example, why people from disadvantaged groups do not protest (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">Owuamalam et al., 2018</ref> for a critique). For example, system justification dampens individuals' willingness to engage in collective action for progressive causes as it makes them less angry and decreases their identification with their group <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Jost et al., 2017)</ref>. Yet system justification can also motivate collective action to protect the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">(Osborne et al., 2019)</ref>. For this reason, this research synthesis also includes system justification as a type of moral motivation for collective action.</p><p>The Injustice Perspective. The dual chamber model conceptualizes the injustice and efficacy motivations as unique motivations for collective action, as these help individuals to understand and deal with the group's situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b343">(van Zomeren et al., 2012)</ref>. Given that the protester's sense of who "we" are and what "we" stand for affects such understandings, the model views the injustice and efficacy motivations as downstream motivational consequences of the protester's heart. With respect to injustice, relative deprivation theory conceptualizes the protester as a "passionate responder" to perceived injustices <ref type="bibr" target="#b278">(Smith et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b343">van Zomeren et al., 2012)</ref>. This motivation is based on the perception and feeling of relative deprivation-to perceive or feel as being worse off compared with others (e.g., to feel deprived, disadvantaged, and/or discriminated against; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abrams &amp; Grant, 2012)</ref>. The theory further specifies how social comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Crosby, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Grant et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b246">Runciman, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b276">Smith &amp; Ortiz, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b288">Stouffer et al., 1949)</ref> with those who are unfairly better-off will yield the perception of relative deprivation. Importantly, experiencing relative deprivation as group-based, for example, because one compares the situation of one's group with another group that is unfairly better-off, is more strongly related to collective action than experiencing it as individual-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Dubé-Simard &amp; Guimond, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b246">Runciman, 1966)</ref>. 16 In line with the findings of primary studies, <ref type="bibr">Van Zomeren et al.'s (2008)</ref> meta-analysis found a unique, positive, medium-sized relationship between perceived injustice and collective action. The current research synthesis seeks to replicate this finding.</p><p>Furthermore, the emotional experience of group-based relative deprivation is more strongly related to collective action than its perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b278">(Smith et al., 2012)</ref>. This association is because the emotional experience of injustice (e.g., anger) strengthens the motivation to act <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Frijda, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Lazarus, 1991</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Guimond &amp; Dubé-Simard, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b351">van Zomeren et al., 2004)</ref>, and the perception of injustice is central to emotions like anger <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Carver &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Lazarus, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b257">Scherer et al., 2001)</ref>. Consistent with the findings of primary studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Li et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Shi et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b365">Wlodarczyk et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b346">), van Zomeren et al. (2008)</ref> found in their meta-analysis that felt injustice produced higher effect sizes than perceived injustice. The current research synthesis seeks to replicate this finding.</p><p>The Efficacy Perspective. The notion of efficacy has been guided by two different perspectives that each help individuals understand their group's situation in a different way. The first perspective conceptualizes efficacy as a proxy for the perceived effectiveness of collective action, which derives from approaches such as the theory of planned behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref> and psychological forms of resource mobilization theory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Klandermans, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Olson, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Simon et al., 1998)</ref>. The portrait of the protester is a rather "cold calculator" of the costs and benefits of joining such action. This individualistic and instrumental (i.e., outcome-oriented) portrait is strikingly different from the other portrayals of the protester (i.e., as an identity manager, value protector, and passionate responder to group-based injustice), which may be why scholars tended to consider this view on efficacy as reflecting a rather different and individualistic motivation for collective action (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Hornsey et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Klandermans, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b209">Opp, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b343">van Zomeren et al., 2012)</ref>. 17  A second perspective on efficacy is more closely aligned with these portrayals, as it identifies self-efficacy beliefs as a core manifestation of human agency (based on the human faculty of forethought; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bandura, 1997)</ref>. Self-efficacy beliefs indicate that one can achieve relevant goals through personal effort, and because such goals can be group goals, the notion of self-efficacy applies to groups and collective action as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bandura, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Mummendey et al., 1999)</ref>. Indeed, the notion of group efficacy beliefs is conceptualized as the belief that the group can achieve group goals through joint effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Mummendey et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b324">Ufkes et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b323">Ufkes et al., , 2016;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b351">van Zomeren et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b343">van Zomeren et al., , 2012))</ref>; which motivates collective action. Group efficacy beliefs can also be specified to include individuals' own contribution to these group efforts to achieve group goals (i.e., participative efficacy beliefs), which may increase its motivational power <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bamberg et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Zomeren et al., 2013)</ref>. The portrait of the protester in this perspective is not a "cold calculator" but an "agentic team player." As such, the dual chamber model assumes that both types of efficacy motivate collective action for different reasons.</p><p>Indeed, <ref type="bibr">Van Zomeren et al.'s (2008)</ref> previous meta-analysis did not make this distinction and found, in line with the findings from surveys and experiments, a positive and medium-sized effect of efficacy on collective action. Because it is unclear to what extent this estimate conflates self-efficacy with perceived effectiveness, the current research synthesis seeks to replicate this finding while newly testing which type of efficacy may yield stronger effect sizes.</p><p>New Predictions From an Integrative Perspective. The dual chamber model generates at least three new sets of predictions regarding motivations for collective action. First, it predicts a strong and positive relationship between morality and identity. This relationship is likely because moral convictions can powerfully define the content of people's social identity, such as when moralizing abortion fits with one's identity as a feminist, or when one's student identity fits with the belief that education should be free to all <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Kutlaca et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b321">Turner-Zwinkels et al., 2017</ref>). Yet stronger identification with a group can also strengthen specific moral convictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">(Leal et al., 2020)</ref>, which may be why such convictions are particularly strongly related to politicized group identities (as these often have a clear and normative content; <ref type="bibr" target="#b333">van Zomeren, 2013)</ref>. This idea suggests that moral convictions should therefore not just be positively related but may also reflect as strong a motivation for collective action as politicized identity. 18  Second, we hypothesize a positive relationship between moral conviction and perceived/felt injustice because the underlying value protection process is highly emotive and hence is likely to foster strong perceptions of injustice and strong emotions such as anger (e.g., van Zomeren, <ref type="bibr" target="#b341">Kutlaca, et al., 2018)</ref>. As for the relationship between morality and efficacy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b340">van Zomeren et al. (2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b343">van Zomeren et al. ( , 2012) )</ref> reported a mixture of positive and null correlations but 16 In fact, the perception and experience of individual-based relative deprivation has negative effects on individuals' mental and physical health (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Mishra &amp; Carleton, 2015)</ref>. 17 This approach dates back to <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Olson (1968)</ref>, of which some have suggested it might actually paint a better portrait of the non-protester than of the protester (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b335">van Zomeren, 2016b)</ref>. This is because such an approach assumes that perceived effectiveness holds a multiplicative relationship with "value," thus implying that perceived effectiveness may be particularly relevant for individuals who do not value the group and are likely to look for opportunities to free-ride. 18 A relatively new concept in the literature is opinion-based group identity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">McGarty et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b313">Thomas et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b314">Thomas et al., , 2012))</ref>-the idea that individuals can identify with groups grounded in a shared opinion. We note clear similarities here with the notions of politicized identity, as this often refers to social movements, which are often groups with a very clear opinion; and moral conviction, which reflects a clear opinion as well. We will therefore explore the motivational power of opinion-based group identification in the current research synthesis.</p><p>concluded that a positive relationship can be expected because holding a moral conviction may imply an almost self-evident belief that achieving one's moral goals is possible-or in fact has to be possible, particularly when others violate one's convictions.</p><p>We thus also hypothesize a positive relationship between moral conviction and efficacy. Third, such predictions should be the opposite for system justification (in the context of collective action aiming for progressive change). Indeed, system justification should generally demotivate such collective action as it indicates that people ideologically prioritize maintaining the status quo (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Jost et al., 2017)</ref>. Because system justification also relates to the motivated legitimization of existing disadvantages in society and disidentification with the disadvantaged, we expect it to be negatively related to the identity, injustice, and efficacy motivations for collective action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrating Structural Constraints to Motivations for Collective Action</head><p>The dual chamber model integrates theoretically relevant structural constraints to the four motivations for collective action. This consideration is important because we do not know whether the dual chamber model is potentially cross-culturally and because neither current theory nor research offers clear pointers toward potential other contextual constraints (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Corcoran et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b344">van Zomeren &amp; Louis, 2017)</ref>. Our research synthesis thus both generates and tests new predictions about structural constraints.</p><p>Contextual Constraints. There are conceptual and empirical reasons for why we currently know little about structural constraints to motivations for collective action. Conceptually, only social identity theory has something to say about (perceived) structural constraints. This theory predicts that collective action will not be a viable option in the absence of perceived hope and scope for social change <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Cohen-Chen &amp; Van Zomeren, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b338">van Zomeren et al., 2019)</ref> and when boundaries between the groups are perceived as permeable (which invites low-status group members to leave their group; <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Ellemers, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b303">Tajfel, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b369">Wright et al., 1990)</ref>. Unfortunately, there is hardly any research on these structural conditions and collective action, and in the few available cases (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Mummendey et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Zomeren et al., 2016)</ref> results were not quite in line with predictions. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">19</ref>Furthermore, empirically, there may also be little variance in structural conditions across collective action studies and hence any constraints will be difficult to detect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">McAdam &amp; Boudet, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b335">van Zomeren, 2016b)</ref>. Researchers typically select contexts in which collective action is already likely or ongoing and hence there already is hope and scope for social change (van Zomeren, 2016b). Put differently, researchers seem to be interested in why people engage in collective action when the opportunity is there, rather than that they are interested in how this opportunity arises <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">(McAdam &amp; Boudet, 2012)</ref>. The lack of interest in this area raises an important boundary to the interpretation of the effect sizes synthesized from these studies-namely, that most findings of why people engage in collective action are embedded in conditions already favorable to collective action. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">20</ref>Against this backdrop, we identified and tested theoretically relevant contextual constraints. First, we examined whether the four motivations extend to members of other groups, such as advantaged groups, who act in solidarity with the disadvantaged (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Curtin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b239">Reimer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b248">Saab et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b293">Subaši c et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b317">Thomas et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b333">van Zomeren, 2013)</ref>. Whereas social identity theory, in its basic logic, views low group status as a boundary condition (and high group status as a clear structural constraint), the dual chamber model does not as it integrates moral motivations that foster acting in solidarity with the disadvantaged, which may lead them to identify with the disadvantaged (or with opinion-based groups devoted to fighting for the disadvantaged; <ref type="bibr" target="#b317">Thomas et al., 2020)</ref>. The current research synthesis uniquely included studies of collective action among advantaged group members, which affords the opportunity to test whether the four motivations are constrained by, or extend to, the advantaged.</p><p>Second, we examined type of disadvantage, characterized as ranging from incidental to structural disadvantage. Whereas structural disadvantage is often indicated by discrimination based on negative stereotypes (e.g., discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity, or sexuality) with severely negative implications for social identity, incidental disadvantage reflects more of a single problem that the group needs to solve without clear cues to negative social identity (e.g., students wanting to stop the increase of tuition fees). <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">van Zomeren et al. (2008)</ref> found that the injustice and efficacy mean effect sizes were weaker for collective action against structural than against incidental disadvantages, while there was no difference for the identity mean effect size. This finding implies that structural disadvantage may act as a contextual constraint on these motivations, and thus the current research synthesis seeks to replicate these findings.</p><p>Cultural Constraints. Identifying and testing theoretically relevant cultural constraints is important for three reasons. First, this research fits with a recent trend in the collective action literature to consider cross-cultural differences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Fischer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b344">van Zomeren &amp; Louis, 2017)</ref> enabled by the increased cultural diversity of research samples, and questions about the crosscultural validity of models of collective action. Second, identifying cultural constraints stimulates theoretical integration. Specifically, the dual chamber model's assumption that the moral and identity motivations serve similar bind-and-obligate functions offers a conceptual zone of convergence between the protester's beating heart and the broader cultural values in which he or she is embedded (e.g., in terms of collectivism and hierarchy values). Indeed, as cultural beings, individuals seek to understand and deal with (group) situations they face based on broader shared understandings <ref type="bibr">(Oyserman et al., 2002</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Oyserman &amp; Lauffer, 2002)</ref>. Such shared norms about what is valued within a culture may therefore affect the protester's beating heart, both in terms of who "we" are and what "we" stand for.</p><p>Third, the emergence of cultural psychology since the 1980s (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Bond, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Kagitcibasi &amp; Berry, 1989)</ref> increased concerns in psychology about the potential relativity of Western findings and ideas, and hence about the need for theories that identify key cross-cultural differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b280">(Smith et al., 2013)</ref>. For example, Henrich and colleagues (2010) argued against the dominant use of Western samples for research, as it leads to Western theories suggesting a healthy caution in generalizing findings from such research to non-Western samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b336">(van Zomeren, 2016c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b344">van Zomeren &amp; Louis, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Henrich et al. (2010)</ref> indeed found considerable cross-cultural differences in core psychological domains relevant to collective action, including fairness, moral reasoning, self-concepts, and related motivations. This finding may warrant caution in applying a too Western portrait of the protester to non-Western cultural settings and samples. 21  At the same time, cultural psychology offers broad and influential models of cultural dimensions and values that reflect meaningful cross-cultural variance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hofstede, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Oyserman et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b259">Schwartz, 1992)</ref>, despite disagreements about their precise number, meaning, and measurement (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b359">Vignoles et al., 2016)</ref>. We identified theoretically relevant cultural dimensions and values based on two considerations. First, if morality and identity serve to bind and obligate individuals, then theoretically relevant cultural dimensions and values should reflect cultural variance related to such motivations (e.g., collectivism). Second, theoretically relevant cultural dimensions and values needed to be available as country-level data (e.g., scores on collectivism) so that we could use them in our research synthesis. We therefore chose to use the cultural dimensions and values derived from <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Hofstede (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">Schwartz (2008)</ref> as analytical tools, which reflect cross-cultural variance in what is valued within cultures, and offer theoretically relevant (e.g., collectivism, hierarchy, egalitarianism) cultural dimensions and values. 22  We generated hypotheses only for theoretically relevant dimensions and values while taking an explorative approach to others. 23  Specifically, from the Hofstede cultural dimensions we identified collectivism (the degree to which individuals are integrated into groups) as a potential cultural constraint, and from the Schwartz cultural values, we identified hierarchy values (the degree to which people are socialized to take hierarchical distribution of roles for granted) and egalitarian values (the degree to which people recognize one another as moral equals, and are socialized to internalize a commitment to cooperate and to feel concerned for everyone's welfare) as potential cultural constraints to the protester's beating heart.</p><p>We then generated testable hypotheses. First, collectivism speaks directly to the protester's beating heart at the cultural level-that is, collectivism binds and mutually obligates individuals into groups <ref type="bibr">(Oyserman et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 5</ref>) and hence should reflect meaningful cross-cultural variance. Collectivism may reflect, on average, a stronger psychological self-relevance of the group and its goals to the individual, and hence stronger collectivism may afford the identity and morality motivations for collective action. At the same time, however, collectivism may constrain these motivations because individuals also feel bound to the broader system in which one's group is embedded <ref type="bibr">(van Zomeren et al., 2016)</ref>. Our research synthesis will test both possibilities.</p><p>Second, Schwartz's hierarchy and egalitarian values are theoretically relevant because cultures that fall more on the hierarchy side of the egalitarian-hierarchy continuum are socialized to take hierarchical distribution of roles for granted <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">(Schwartz, 2008)</ref>, which implies a focus on acceptance and justification of power differences. Hierarchy may even be valued to such an extent that justifying the system is not just a cultural norm but part of a conservative ideology <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Jost et al., 2017)</ref>. Against this backdrop, cultural hierarchy values may constrain the morality and identity motivations for collective action. Conversely, cultures that value egalitarianism imply a focus on recognizing one another as moral equals and being concerned with everyone's welfare <ref type="bibr" target="#b260">(Schwartz, 2004)</ref>. This concept implies a focus on social justice, equality, and responsibility, all of which may make the protester's heart grow fonder. As such, we hypothesize that hierarchy values act as a cultural constraint and egalitarian values as a cultural affordance. 24   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Questions and Predictions</head><p>Our quantitative research synthesis seeks to answer several sets of specific research questions. Key sets of questions are: Do identity, injustice, and efficacy yield positive, medium-sized effects? Does morality yield a positive, medium-sized effect? Furthermore, do all four motivations have unique effects on collective action (i.e., when controlling for the others)? If these questions are answered affirmatively, the psychology of collective action should be based on four, rather than three, motivations for collective action.</p><p>Second, we ask whether all four motivations for collective action are positively interrelated. We thus seek to replicate previous meta-analytic findings that identity, injustice, and efficacy are positively related, and newly expect to find that morality relates positively to all three other motivations (and in particular to identity). If confirmed, this finding would support a need for theoretical integration as proposed in the dual chamber model.</p><p>Third, we turn to questions about specific moderators on the side of motivation. Does politicized identification yield stronger 21 "Cross-cultural" does not imply "universal," as the latter can be understood as having evolutionary or other nondescriptive connotations. We remain agnostic about such connotations here and use "cross-cultural" as a descriptive term.</p><p>22 Individualism and collectivism are not necessarily related <ref type="bibr">(Oyserman et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b240">Reis et al., 2013)</ref>. Because we relied here on Hofstede's and Schwartz's indicators and country-level data, our collectivism indicator assumes a negative relationship between individualism and collectivism. 23 We assume that variance in country-level dimensions (e.g., on collectivism) reflects variance in cultural norms that percolate into the samples of studies on collective action, and hence can be used to meaningfully test predictions about potential cultural constraints (e.g., does identity have a weaker relationship with collective action in more collectivist countries?). To this end, we also included in our database, where available, the reported means and standard deviations for any motivation for collective action. This information allows interpretation of cultural differences in terms of how self-relevant the different motivations are (i.e., higher or lower means) or in terms of constraints to their motivational power (i.e., stronger or weaker effects). 24 We expected power distance (the degree to which power differences between groups are accepted) to act as a cultural constraint for the same reason as for hierarchy values. Furthermore, we reasoned that harmony values would act as cultural constraints because valuing harmony <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Fischer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b305">Taras et al., 2010)</ref> implies avoiding conflictual identity management strategies such as collective action <ref type="bibr">(van Zomeren et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>effects than nonpoliticized identification? Does the emotional experience of injustice yield stronger effects than perceived injustice? Moving beyond previous work, does moral conviction yield similarly strong effects as politicized identity? And do group and participative efficacy beliefs (reflecting the agentic team player) yield similarly strong effects as perceived effectiveness (reflecting the cold calculator of costs and benefits)? Answering these questions will identify the strongest motivations for collective action. Fourth, on the side of structural constraints, we test for moderating effects of the cultural and other contextual factors we identified as relevant to the protester's beating heart. For cultural factors, we test whether collectivism and hierarchy values constrain the identity and moral motivations for collective action (whereas egalitarian values should afford them). For contextual factors, we test whether the four motivations are constrained by, or can be extended to, members of other groups, such as advantaged groups, acting in solidarity with the disadvantaged, and by or to structural and incidental types of disadvantage. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">25</ref> Answering these questions will tell us whether the protester's heart beats the same across the globe and also extends to others who seek to act in solidarity with the disadvantaged.</p><p>Fifth and finally, we use meta-analytic structural equation modeling to directly evaluate the added value of integrating morality into the psychology of collective action, compared with the integrative model derived from the previous meta-analysis (that did not include morality; <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">van Zomeren et al., 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>We used a meta-analytic approach because a meta-analysis can assess the strength of the relationship between a predictor and a criterion variable across different measures, methods, groups, contexts, and cultures; answer the question of how different predictors are related to one another; test for moderator variables pertaining to types of motivation as well as types of structural constraints; and test different models through meta-analytic structural equation modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Criteria for Inclusion and Operational Definitions</head><p>Our main criteria for inclusion were that studies had to report primary data quantifying the association between one or more motivations and collective action, embedded within a group context that allowed for inferences about its presumed goal (see the PRISMA document, particularly Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> in online supplemental materials, for detailed information regarding article exclusion). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">26</ref>Such criteria already exclude, for example, studies using secondary data, qualitative studies of collective action, and studies that relied on objective rather than subjective measures of identity, morality, injustice, and/or efficacy. We also included studies only when we had sufficient statistical information available (either from the article or from contacting the authors) to calculate the relevant effect size. Furthermore, studies had to include variables that conformed to our operational definitions, which we outline below. Across the board, these criteria for inclusion brought down our initial potential pool of articles from 8,567 to 231. Unsurprisingly, most articles included in our database were part of the specific psychological collective action literature this research seeks to synthesize.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Collective Action</head><p>Operationally, most studies of collective action operationalized the concept through specific means of social protest, such as when participants are asked about their participation in a movement, or their willingness to sign a petition or participate in a demonstration. In line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">van Zomeren et al. (2008)</ref>, we included behavioral measures, but also proxies of such behavior (e.g., attitudinal support or intentions). Typical examples of such measures are: "signing a petition to improve the current situation of Blacks in South Africa" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Cakal et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 611)</ref>, and "participating in a demonstration" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Cohen-Chen &amp; Van Zomeren, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 52)</ref>.</p><p>Other measures of collective action had to fit with the conceptual definition we used (van Zomeren, 2013); which acknowledged and extended <ref type="bibr" target="#b369">Wright et al.'s (1990)</ref> definition to include disadvantaged and other group members' actions as a representative of a group, and where the action was directed at improving the conditions of the disadvantaged group. This definition emphasizes that individuals can act on behalf of their group and that such actions psychologically constitute collective action. It follows that such action needed to be embedded in a group context, in which we could at least make a reasonable assumption that the action on behalf of the group was aimed at improving the conditions of a group as a whole. Thus, we excluded studies when there was no clear collective disadvantage and hence no context in which action could be aimed at improving the conditions of the group, or when studies measured action in individual or interpersonal contexts (e.g., the willingness to use violence to further one's own goals; <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Doosje et al., 2012</ref>; bringing up feminist issues in a personal conversation; <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Redford et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, and in line with developments in the literature (van Zomeren, 2013), we included studies that focused on solidarity-based action of members from other groups, such as advantaged groups acting in solidarity with the disadvantaged group. As such, we were open to the collective actions of different actors but kept the presumed goal (i.e., improving the conditions of the disadvantaged group) and the context of collective action (i.e., a group context) constant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identity</head><p>Conceptually, we included studies that measured social identity motivations for collective action. Operationally, most studies employed measures of group identification, which often include items such as "I identify with [group X]" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b320">Turner-Zwinkels et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 150)</ref>. Studies included used measures of politicized identity (i.e., identification with a social movement, or as an activist), measures of nonpoliticized identity (i.e., identification with context of collective disadvantage within which collective action acquires its psychological meaning (typically a group context within which individuals may act to improve the position of the relevant disadvantaged group). In most cases we could reasonably assume a subjectively perceived collective disadvantage because of empirical indications (e.g., measures of such disadvantage, or unfairness or anger pointing at the subjective perception of such disadvantage), whereas in other cases we could reasonably assume such a perception given the specific context (e.g., for Black Lives Matter supporters, we felt we could safely assume that they would perceive Blacks to be collectively disadvantaged). the disadvantaged group; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b326">van Breen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 3;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b343">van Zomeren et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 58)</ref>, as well as measures of opinion-based group identity (i.e., identification with groups characterized by a shared opinion such as being against poverty; e.g., <ref type="bibr">Thomas &amp; McGarty, 2009, p. 124)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Morality</head><p>Conceptually, we included studies that measured the moral motivations of collective action. Operationally, we included measures of moral conviction, perceived violation of moral beliefs or principles, and system justification. Moral convictions were typically measured with items such as "My opinion on climate change is part of my core moral norms and values" <ref type="bibr" target="#b338">(van Zomeren et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 58)</ref>, whereas perceived violation of moral principles would be measured with items such as "The decision to cut the budget for higher education is against universal moral values" <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Kutlaca et al., 2016)</ref>. System justification was typically measured with items such as "Most policies . . . serve the greater good" <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Cichocka et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 7)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Injustice</head><p>Conceptually, we included studies that measured injustice motivations for collective action. The operational definition of injustice included measures of perceptions and/or feelings of unfairness as well as relative deprivation. Typical examples of measures of injustice are: "People like me are treated unfairly" (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Becker, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 652)</ref>, "I think the introduction of tuition fees is unfair" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b307">Tausch et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 133)</ref>, and "I feel angry/frustrated because of the way we are treated" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Grant et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 459;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Iyer &amp; Ryan, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 800)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy</head><p>Conceptually, we included studies that measured efficacy motivations for collective action. Operationally, we included measures of group and participative efficacy, and measures of perceived effectiveness and instrumentality. Typical examples of measures of group and participative efficacy beliefs are: "To what extent do you think that [group] will be able to achieve their goals together?" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b252">Saeri et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 5)</ref>, "I think that together we can change [the group-related problem]" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b283">Stewart &amp; Tran, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 304)</ref>, and "As an individual, I think I can meaningfully contribute to achieving [the group-related problem] through unified effort" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Mazzoni et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 319;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Zomeren et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 621)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Search</head><p>We conducted a broad/top-down literature search via multiple databases (e.g., the PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases, from June 2007 to September 2018), using combinations of keywords, with examples being collective action, protest, injustice, unfairness, deprivation, agency, efficacy, effectiveness, identity, identification, morality, system justification, and violated principles (see the OSF repository for all details, code book, and PRISMA flowchart for exclusion examples as well as a detailed explanation of the articles, samples, and effect sizes that were included/excluded; full data for the full 8,567 articles is available on OSF). In addition, in a narrow/bottom-up fashion, we systematically searched the reference sections of review articles to identify potentially yet uncovered relevant studies and contacted researchers known to have conducted published or unpublished studies on the topic. Furthermore, we sent requests for relevant studies and unpublished data via the mailing lists of different European (EASP) and American (SPSSI, ISPP) professional organizations. Together, this combined top-down/broad and bottom-up/ narrow search approach resulted in 2.7% of the pool of potentially relevant articles to be included.</p><p>We stopped adding new entries to the database in April 2019. A total of 231 articles fulfilled the above-mentioned criteria with 403 samples (264 for identity, 81 for morality, 259 samples for injustice, and 216 for efficacy). From the samples, we extracted in total 1,235 effect sizes (390 for identity, 121 for morality, 409 for injustice, and 315 for efficacy). In terms of participant numbers, the total sample size for identity was N = 77,315; for morality was N = 24,708; for injustice was N = 82,346; and for efficacy was N = 56,784. In addition, a considerable subset of the samples in the database (n = 101) included effect size estimates from multiple predictors (n = 65 had identity, injustice, and efficacy; n = 36 had all four motivations). In total, there are k = 101 correlations for identity-injustice, k = 36 for identity-morality, k = 101 for identity-efficacy, k = 36 for injusticemorality, k = 101 for injustice-efficacy and k = 36 for morality- efficacy). The OSF repository lists all included samples, effect sizes extracted, and sample sizes on which they are based, together with the coding information for each coded variable (doi.org/10.17605/ OSF.IO/V7BWK). We also provide all the R-code and output there.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coding of Moderators</head><p>Based in part on van Zomeren et al. ( <ref type="formula">2008</ref>), we developed a coding book (see OSF repository). We coded for nonsubstantive moderator variables, such as mean age, gender composition, type of collective action, and type of method. We also coded and differentiated between motivational and structural moderators, which refer to moderators about motivation as identified in the previous meta-analysis (e.g., politicized vs. nonpoliticized identification, emotional vs. perceived injustice), moderators about motivation as derived from more recent theory and research (moral conviction vs. system justification, group and participative efficacy vs. perceived effectiveness), and structural constraints, including cultural moderators (e.g., collectivism, hierarchy values) and other contextual moderators (type of group, type of disadvantage).</p><p>Two coders independently read the articles and rated characteristics and moderator variables (some categorical, some at interval level). For the categorical moderator variables, the overall intercoder agreement was good (Cohen's j = .96). The largest discrepancies were still in an acceptable range (i.e., type efficacy coding, Cohen's j = .84; for full information, see header 2 in the OSF repository HTML file). Disagreements were solved through discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderators About Motivation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type of Identity</head><p>We coded for politicized and nonpoliticized group identities. Politicized groups often corresponded to social movements or activist groups, whereas nonpoliticized groups often referred to the broader disadvantaged group (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b326">van Breen et al., 2017)</ref>. In line with developments in the last decade, we also coded for opinionbased group identities (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Thomas &amp; McGarty, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">27</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type of Morality</head><p>We coded for moral conviction (i.e., beliefs on an issue that reflect perceived absolute right/wrongs), violated beliefs or principles (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">Sabucedo et al., 2018)</ref>, and for system justification (when referred to as such; <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Jost et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type of Injustice</head><p>We coded for emotional and perceived injustice (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Livingstone et al., 2009</ref>, for a differentiation). Typical measures of emotional measures are feelings of group-based anger or affective relative deprivation. Typical examples of perceptual measures are perceptions/appraisals of unfairness, illegitimacy, injustice, and cognitive relative deprivation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type of Efficacy</head><p>We coded for type of efficacy by assessing whether group and participative efficacy beliefs (e.g., <ref type="bibr">van Zomeren et al., 2013)</ref> or perceived effectiveness (or instrumentality) were used (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Hornsey et al., 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Constraints</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type of Group</head><p>We coded for whether the sample in question was a disadvantaged group (directly affected by the circumstances of the collective action context, or at least perceived as such), or an advantaged group that acted in solidarity with the disadvantaged group (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Iyer &amp; Ryan, 2009</ref>; for a differentiation). In a few cases, we also coded for so-called third groups, who are not disadvantaged themselves, as advantaged groups. We further coded how the group could be characterized within <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Deaux et al. (1995)</ref> typology (i.e., based in vocation, stigma, political affiliation, or nationality/ ethnicity), or whether the group was solidarity-based.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type of Disadvantage</head><p>We coded for structural or incidental disadvantage through a dichotomous and continuous rating (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">van Zomeren et al., 2008)</ref>. Structural disadvantage was related to discrimination based on ethnicity, gender, sexuality, nationality. Incidental disadvantage was related to an external problem that, once solved, leaves the group to be no longer disadvantaged (e.g., students facing tuition cuts).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type of Culture</head><p>We coded cultural dimensions and values in two ways. First, we used a somewhat crude coding indicating whether the sample's country background was Western or non-Western (see the online supplemental materials for more details and a table of all countries). Second, we matched the country-level coding of the sample with country-level data about the Hofstede (2010) dimensions and <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">Schwartz's (2008)</ref> values. We standardized these scales to be able to compare them with each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nonsubstantive and Explorative Moderators</head><p>Because studies may differ on nontheoretical dimensions as well, we coded for several variables. For one, we recorded the mean age of the sample, when reported. When data were missing, we made an informed guess (e.g., students are likely to be around 20). We also recorded the gender composition of the sample, when reported; categories were female, male, or mixed. Furthermore, we coded whether a nonbehavioral measure of collective action was used (intentions to engage in or attitudinal support for collective action) or a behavioral measure (behavior or self-reported past behavior); whether the research used survey or experimental methods; and whether the effect in question could be interpreted causally (e.g., experimental manipulation, or longitudinal design with time lag), or not. Exploratively, we also coded for whether the type of collective action was violent or not, and whether it was an online or offline form of action. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">28</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Approach</head><p>We used the correlation coefficient r as our effect size measure because a large proportion of research in the sample was correlational. When we speak of "effects," we thus refer empirically to correlations, although conceptually we assume that "motivations" predict "collective action." When needed, we converted other effect sizes reported to r using the formulas provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Rosenthal (1979)</ref>. We used <ref type="bibr">Cohen's (1992)</ref> interpretation of effect sizes of .10 as small, .30 as medium, and .50 as large. We used a randomeffects model analysis because of the large diversity in contexts, groups, and cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Rosenthal, 1979)</ref>. We computed weighted averages of the effect sizes based on Fisher's (1921) to z-transformed correlations (Zr; <ref type="bibr" target="#b357">Viechtbauer, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 8)</ref>.</p><p>Each independent sample was treated as an independent data point. When multiple effect sizes could be computed for one sample, we aggregated these effect sizes to one average r to avoid statistical interdependence. Yet when multiple effect sizes were available that corresponded to different levels of moderator variables (e.g., type of identity, type of injustice), we separated these effects out for those particular analyses. As such, the total number of effect sizes is larger than the number of effect sizes for independent samples. This method ensures that each statistical test was conducted on statistically independent data. 29  We used the R packages metafor <ref type="bibr" target="#b357">(Viechtbauer, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b358">(Viechtbauer, , 2017</ref>) and metaSEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Cheung, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Cheung, , 2015;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Jak &amp; Cheung, 2019)</ref> for moderation tests and meta-analytic structural equation modeling. All analyses were run in R (R Core Team, 2019) and RStudio (RStudio Team, 2019). Variation in effect sizes was examined with the Q E -statistic (i.e., an index of residual heterogeneity presented on OSF) as well as the s 2 statistic (i.e., an absolute value of residual heterogeneity presented in the accompanying tables; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Borenstein et al., 2017)</ref>. Effects of potential moderator variables were examined by computing analyses of variance providing estimates of between-group variance (Q M ). Each individual effect was estimated with regression analyses. For categorical moderator variables, we used dummy coding while continuous variables were centered or standardized. Regression analysis thereby provided us with estimates of the strength of the relationship between the predictor (e.g., injustice) and collective action, potentially moderated by other variables (e.g., perceptions of injustice vs. emotional experience). All reported correlations were transformed back from z to r. 30   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Four Motivations for Collective Action</head><p>Table 1 (first row) shows, in line with expectations, positive medium-sized effects for all four motivations for collective action. Extending these findings, the morality meta-analysis, showed a similar medium-sized effect. 31  Effect sizes were heterogeneous, reflecting in part the presumed diversity of cultures, contexts, and groups. For identity, effect sizes ranged from r = À.13 to r = .86; for morality, from r = .01 to r = .76; for injustice, from r = À.12 to r = .87, and for efficacy from r = À.46 to r = .85. The overall test for heterogeneity was significant for identity (Q E = 3783.30, df = 263, p , .0001; T 2 = .05 [.005]), morality (Q E = 997.58, df = 80, p , .0001; T 2 = .04 [.007]), injustice (Q E = 2836.44, df = 258, p , .0001; T 2 = .04 [.004]), and efficacy (Q E = 2893.33, df = 215, p , .0001; T 2 = .05 [.005]), which supports the use of random-effects models and suggests plenty of variance to be potentially explained by moderator variables.</p><p>We found little indication for a file-drawer problem. Three-parameter selection models, illustrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1 lower rows, were  based on Vevea</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Woods (2005; Table 1</ref>) and represented moderate one-tailed, severe one-tailed, moderate two-tailed, and severe two-tailed weight functions. Even under most extreme conditions (severe one-tailed selection models), average effects only dropped by r = .07. These sensitivity analyses suggest little movement of estimates when different weight functions are applied (also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Carter et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b198">McShane et al., 2016)</ref>.

Yet as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a-2d</ref>, these missing studies were in areas of large positive effect sizes (Fisher's z transformed correlation coefficients larger than .5). Adding different types of regression lines to the data confirmed these analyses: We found a slight bias indicating that larger effects may have been missing from the database. 32 That being said, even when using the most conservative estimate of publication bias (adding a simple regression line), the mean effects all remained within the medium-sized range. As a final step, we tested a mixed-effects metaregression model which again showed some evidence that we were 29 This means that the number of effects differed per moderator analysis. For example, a study may have measured two different types of injustice: perceptions and feelings of unfairness. The study may have also included two different types of groups: a disadvantaged and an advantaged group acting in solidarity with the disadvantaged. This would mean that within one study we could code for four relevant correlations/effects. Depending on the research question we would average the effects differently. For example, for the overall effect of injustice on collective action, we would average all four correlations. If we were interested in moderation by type of injustice, we would average across the types of groups.</p><p>30 Prediction intervals can be computed with the R-Markdown output on OSF <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Borenstein et al., 2017)</ref>. 31 Note that we reversed the sign of the system justification effects as to make them comparable in meaning with the other moral motivations. 32 We also tested whether publication status (published yes or no) would influence the relationship between the four motivations and collective action. We did find indications that this was mostly the case (Identity: Q M = 13.327, p , .001, Morality: Q M = 1.791, p = .18, Injustice: Q M = 8.165, p = .004, Efficacy: observing slight publication bias, yet again in favor of larger effect studies (test for funnel plot asymmetry: Injustice: z = 2.16, p = .031; Injustice: z = 2.16, p = .03; Identity: z = 1.99, p = .046; Identity: z = 1.65, p = .099). Taken together, and considering our results in terms of three-parameter selection methods, p curve analyses, regression tests, the trim and fill, and the contour enhanced plots, we conclude that the literature we seek to synthesize seems quite healthy and robust.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Q M = 3</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluating the Added Value of Morality in the Psychology of Collective Action</head><p>We used the subset of studies that reported all three or four predictors to fit meta-analytic structural equation models. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_11">39</ref> Because the input for these analyses is correlations, we model causal direction based on theoretical assumptions. Owing to strong heterogeneity indices in Stage I (.84-.93), we used a random-effects model (REM). We did not constrain diagonals and used 95% likelihoodbased CIs for the parameter estimates. We built up models stepby-step, testing whether assumptions for simpler models held when complexity (i.e., mediators or a new predictor) was added to the model. Full models are visualized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a</ref>-3c, whereas the simpler models are visualized in figures in the online supplemental materials (together with statistics for direct and indirect effects as well as more detailed comparison to the full models). Unstandardized direct, indirect effects, and 95% CIs can be found in the respective figures.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a</ref> shows support for the dual chamber model. We observed all hypothesized paths, and model fit was adequate, v 2 (1, N = 30186) = 84.55, p , .001; RMSEA = .053 [.044, .062], SRMR = .048 (both smaller than the recommended .08); CFI = .97 (above the .90 rule of thumb), TLI = .68 (which may be due to the TLI adjusting for the number of parameters fitted). Explained variance for collective action was 27%, for efficacy 28%, and for injustice 21%.</p><p>We then tested the original SIMCA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3b</ref>), which lacks morality. Replicating van <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">Zomeren et al. (2008)</ref>, findings supported this model, as we observed all hypothesized paths and model fit was adequate: v 2 (1, N = 30186) = 134.03, p , .001 (RMSEA = .066 [.057, .076]; SRMR = .084; CFI = .94, TLI = .63). Explained variance in collective action was 27%. We concluded that the dual chamber model fit the data somewhat better and also explained more variance across motivations and collective action  than the original SIMCA. As such, the integration of morality into the model indeed adds value.</p><p>For the extended SIMCA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3c</ref>), which adds morality to the original SIMCA, we came to the same conclusion. We again observed all hypothesized paths and model fit was adequate: v 2 (2, N = 30186) = 97.39, p , .001 (RMSEA = .040 [.033, .047]; SRMR = .059; CFI = .96, TLI = .82). Explained variance in collective action was 27%, and the model also explained variance within identity (9%), efficacy (28%), and injustice (21%). As such, it outperforms the original SIMCA but does not outperform the dual chamber model. Indeed, the latter comparison is admittedly a very close call, given that they either add or integrate (and thus in either way include) morality: Both models have adequate fit and explain variance in collective action as well as its motivations. Although we do not want to attach too much weight to this, a statistical argument for favoring the dual chamber model is that, in terms of fit, v 2 = 84.55 (df = 1), this model fit the data slightly yet significantly better than the extended SIMCA, v 2 = 97.39 (df = 2), v 2 Diff = 12.84 (df = 1), p , .001. This statistical argument adds to our conceptual argument for a more integrative, rather than additive, approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This quantitative research synthesis replicates previous work and breaks new theoretical ground by developing and testing an integrative, comprehensive, and potentially cross-cultural dual chamber model of collective action. Replicating previous meta-analytic <ref type="bibr">conclusions (van Zomeren et al., 2008)</ref>,we found that identity, injustice, and efficacy each showed unique and positive medium-sized relationships with collective action; that these motivations were all positively interrelated; and that the strongest motivations for collective action were politicized identification and the emotional experience of injustice (anger). Extending previous work, we found that morality, as a fourth motivation for collective action, showed a unique and positive medium-sized effect, as well as positive interrelationships with the other motivations (and in particular with identity); furthermore, we found that moral conviction ranked among the strongest motivations for collective action. Finally, meta-analytic structural equation modeling supported the dual chamber model. These findings support the proposed need for the integration of moral motivations into the psychology of collective action (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Klandermans, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Osborne et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Stekelenburg &amp; Klandermans, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b346">van Zomeren et al., 2008)</ref> and confirm the centrality of morality in the protester's beating heart (e.g., <ref type="bibr">van Zomeren et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>This research synthesis further uncovered small but theoretically meaningful structural constraints (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hofstede, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b259">Schwartz, 1992</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Corcoran et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b335">van Zomeren, 2016b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b344">van Zomeren &amp; Louis, 2017)</ref>. In terms of cultural constraints, we found that only the identity motivation was constrained in non-Western, more collectivistic countries, and in countries that value hierarchy more and egalitarianism less. We found little evidence for other contextual constraints: The four motivations extended to members of advantaged groups wanting to act in solidarity with disadvantaged groups and to structural as well as incidental disadvantages. Across the board, then, the protester's heart seems to beat rather similarly across the globe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>We discuss four broad implications for the field of collective action and also discuss more specific implications for theory and research on (a) the protester's beating heart (i.e., identity and morality in the context of collective action), (b) injustice and efficacy as important downstream motivations for collective action, and (c) structural constraints to motivations for collective action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Four Broad Implications</head><p>First, it seems the field was and still is on the right track, because we were able to replicate key findings from a previous meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">(van Zomeren et al., 2008)</ref> with an independent, larger, and more diverse database. Moreover, we were able to rule out common concerns such as file-drawer problems and a strong overestimation of reported effect sizes. As such, the last decade of collective action research, despite its huge diversity in terms of contexts, groups, and  cultures, confirms and strengthens previous conclusions. In an era of concerns about reproducibility (e.g., Open Science Collaboration, 2015) and generalizability <ref type="bibr" target="#b372">(Yarkoni, 2019)</ref>, this is a positive and welcome observation. The runaway horse seems healthy and alive and is still within our reigns. We suggest letting it run. Second, our research synthesis confirms and encourages the integration of insights from moral psychology with the psychology of collective action. Our findings confirm that (a) different moral variables can motivate collective action (e.g., moral conviction, perceived violation of moral beliefs or principles; <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">Skitka, 2010)</ref> but also demotivate it (e.g., system justification; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Jost et al., 2017)</ref>; (b) moral conviction relates positively to the other motivations for collective action (in particular to identity; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b333">van Zomeren, 2013)</ref>; and (c) this may explain why the four motivations can extend to members of other groups, such as advantaged groups, who act in solidarity with the disadvantaged (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">van Zomeren et al., 2018)</ref>. Indeed, the dual chamber model's conceptualization of the protester's beating heart signifies how central moral motivation is to the psychology of collective action.</p><p>Third, the cultural constraints we identified for the identity chamber of the protester's beating heart were small yet theoretically meaningful. Based on the notion that morality and identity both serve to bind and obligate individuals into acting in concert (thus reflecting who "we" are and what "we stand for; <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Ellemers, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Zomeren et al., 2018)</ref>, we hypothesized that collectivism (which binds and obligates individual in groups; <ref type="bibr">Oyserman et al., 2002)</ref> and hierarchy values (that prioritize the status quo rather than social change) would constrain whether one would act collectively. Given that we found this relatively weak yet rather consistent broader pattern (including a constraining effect for non-Western countries, and the opposite pattern for countries with egalitarian values), this research synthesis offers a conceptual bridge between what binds and obligates individuals into groups at both the cultural and individual levels of analysis. Our findings offer a stepping stone for scholars to integrate key insights and concepts from cultural psychology into the psychology of collective action <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Jasper, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b344">van Zomeren &amp; Louis, 2017</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Oyserman &amp; Lauffer, 2002)</ref>-a promising, new, and largely untrodden avenue for theorizing and research.</p><p>Fourth and finally, the integration of morality into the protester's beating heart raises important questions about whether the definition of collective action itself may need an update. Because we are recommending further integration of the field with insights from moral and cultural psychology, it is critical that we can offer a definition that is based on state-of-the-art knowledge. Because our findings confirmed Table <ref type="table">6</ref> Nonsubstantive and Exploratory Moderators for the Effects of Identity, Morality, Injustice, and Efficacy on Collective Action that the protester's heart has moral and identity chambers and seems to beat the same for members of a disadvantaged group or other group acting in solidarity with the disadvantaged <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Curtin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b239">Reimer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b248">Saab et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b293">Subaši c et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b317">Thomas et al., 2020)</ref>, morality should be as central as identity in any updated definition of collective action. Such a definition should thus not only refer to the identity management processes assumed in previous definitions (about who "we" are) but also refer to value protection processes associated with moral motivations for collective action (and thus about what "we" stand for). We therefore suggest an updated definition of collective action that fits with our portrayal of the protester's beating heart:</p><p>Collective action is any action that individuals undertake as psychological group members to improve the position of a relevant disadvantaged group as a whole, and/or to protect their or that group's values, moral principles, or ideology. 40   Obviously, this definition is open for future debate and amendments. 40 Some have gone even further <ref type="bibr" target="#b335">(van Zomeren, 2016b)</ref> in arguing for opening up the definition for motivations that are not based in any group identity. We cannot evaluate this argument in the current research synthesis because we included only studies in line with previous, identity-based definitions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Morality, Identity, and Collective Action</head><p>This research synthesis substantiates the central and positively related positions of morality and identity in the dual chamber model of collective action. Indeed, mean effect sizes for each were unique, positive, and medium-sized, with moral conviction and politicized identity ranking among the strongest motivations for collective action. This fits with the importance of understanding how people come to develop politicized identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Duncan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b272">Simon &amp; Klandermans, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b290">Stürmer &amp; Simon, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b322">Turner-Zwinkels et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2017)</ref>. The dual chamber model suggests that morality may play an important part in this process of identity change of transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b333">(van Zomeren, 2013)</ref>, with moral conviction being a catalyst for such change and system justification a barrier. Conversely, it is possible that developing a politicized identity offers fertile ground for developing moral conviction on specific issues (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Leal et al., 2020)</ref>. We thus need to learn more about how the protester's beating heart comes into being.</p><p>It is also essential for collective action research to identify the psychologically relevant group identity in a given context. This concept is not only important because politicized identities yield stronger motivational potential than nonpoliticized identities but also because we found that identification with opinion-based groups (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Thomas &amp; McGarty, 2009)</ref> produced effect sizes on par with those of politicized identity. This finding is interesting because such group identities revolve around an opinion (e.g., against poverty) rather than around an organization (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Greenpeace)</ref>; yet in either case, the relevant identity may, implicitly or explicitly, already include a moral aspect. It is unclear at present, however, what the specific "active ingredient" is-moral conviction <ref type="bibr" target="#b340">(van Zomeren et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b343">van Zomeren, Leach, &amp; Spears, 2012)</ref>, perceived violation of moral beliefs of principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(Kutlaca et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Mazzoni et al., 2015)</ref>, moral identity content <ref type="bibr" target="#b321">(Turner-Zwinkels et al., 2017)</ref>, moral obligation <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">(Sabucedo et al., 2018)</ref>, or inner obligation <ref type="bibr" target="#b290">(Stürmer &amp; Simon, 2004)</ref>. We thus need to learn more about the psychological anatomy of this part of the protester's beating heart.</p><p>Finally, the dual chamber model implies that it is important to improve our understanding and conceptualization of how individuals and groups are embedded in systems that they sometimes seek to defend <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Jost et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b219">Owuamalam et al., 2018)</ref>. Indeed, our research synthesis included the recent trend to include system justification, as an ideological motivation to protect such a broader system, in the study of collective action. We grouped system justification under the umbrella of moral motivations for collective action based on its grounding in ideology <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Jost et al., 2017)</ref>, a decision supported by recent findings that system justification can motivate collective action to protect the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">(Osborne et al., 2019)</ref>. But other work might not conceptually include system justification as part of the moral domain (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b275">Skitka et al., 2017)</ref> or has not found empirical traces of it as part of people's everyday experiences of morality <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Hofmann et al., 2014)</ref>. As such, our decision is open for future debate and amendments, and offers a clear avenue for theorizing and focused research on the moral or nonmoral nature of the relationship between system justification and collective action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Injustice, Efficacy, and Collective Action</head><p>The dual chamber model conceptualizes the injustice and efficacy motivations as unique motivations for collective action, and as downstream motivational consequences of the protester's heart (that help one understand and deal with the group's situation). Our findings indeed show positive relationships with the moral-identity chambers of the protester's heart, while also showing that their own interrelationship reflects the weakest link. These associations are consistent with previous meta-analytic observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">(van Zomeren et al., 2008)</ref> and provide some support for the portrayals of the protester as "passionate responders" and "cold calculators" as two different ways to understand and deal with the group situation (van Zomeren, <ref type="bibr" target="#b343">Leach, &amp; Spears, 2012)</ref>. Indeed, the injustice and efficacy motivations are often based on "trigger events" (e.g., media coverage of an instance of police brutality) that individuals, as cultural beings, seek to understand and deal with. Although the protester's beating heart is key to understanding collective action, the situational triggers that directly affect the bloodstream are equally important to understand. Specifically, our findings replicated the key insight that felt injustice (e.g., anger) yields stronger motivational power than perceived injustice. This result confirms that anger is a potentially powerful response to threats or violations of one's identity or morals; as unlike most other negative emotions, it yields a strong approach motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Carver &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Frijda, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Lazarus, 1991</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Goldenberg et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">Mackie &amp; Smith, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b333">van Zomeren, 2013)</ref>. Furthermore, our findings replicated the key insight that efficacy yields strong motivational power, either in terms of group/participative efficacy beliefs or perceived effectiveness. These reflect different ways of understanding the group's situation: as an agentic team player (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Cohen-Chen &amp; Van Zomeren, 2018)</ref>; or as a cold, individualistic calculator of costs and benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Klandermans, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Olson, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Simon et al., 1998)</ref>. As such, and just like anger, they can be situationally triggered <ref type="bibr" target="#b290">(Stürmer &amp; Simon, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b343">van Zomeren, Leach, &amp; Spears, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_12">41</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for Theory and Research on Structural Constraints</head><p>Although our research synthesis found evidence for small structural constraints, the broader pattern was that the dual chamber model seems to have cross-cultural potential. For one, we found that the four motivations for collective action extended to members of other groups acting in solidarity with the disadvantaged, and to structural as well as incidental disadvantages. This likely reflects that collective action research perhaps too often studies why people engage in collective action under conditions already favorable to collective action (van Zomeren, 2016b), which may severely restrict structural variance, and further paint a rather overoptimistic picture of collective action. Indeed, McAdam and Boudet (2012) longitudinally found that in many contexts where collective action could have been expected, it simply did not materialize. We thus need a better understanding of the structural conditions under which motivations for collective action arise (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">McAdam &amp; Boudet, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b334">van Zomeren, 2016a)</ref>. 42  As for cultural constraints, the dual chamber model offers a conceptual bridge between cultural psychology and the psychology of collective action. Indeed, our findings suggest that theoretical integration of cultural constraints is a promising yet challenging path <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Jasper, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b344">van Zomeren &amp; Louis, 2017</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b280">Smith et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b359">Vignoles et al., 2016)</ref>: We specifically found that countries that are non-Western, more collectivist, and value hierarchy more and egalitarianism less yielded small but meaningful constraints on the identity motivation for collective action. We interpret these findings in terms of cross-cultural variance in how binding and obligating the relevant group identities are (which should be stronger in non-Western, collectivist countries) but also how binding and obligating the broader system is in which this group is embedded (which should be stronger in countries where hierarchy is valued more and egalitarianism less). To illustrate, <ref type="bibr">Van Zomeren et al. (2016)</ref> surveyed Indonesian ethnic minority members about ethnic discrimination in their country, which ranks high on collectivism as well as hierarchy values, and found, in two separate studies, rather rare null correlations between ethnic minority group identification and willingness to engage in collective action. We thus explain such findings in terms of cultural norms that embed the group in the broader (hierarchical) system. 43  Note that this explanation assumes a conceptualization of culture as shared norms that people internalize or otherwise conform to (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hofstede, 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Hofstede, , 2001;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 2010)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr">Oyserman and Lauffer (2002, p. 163)</ref> put it, people are assumed to "make sense of things using a culture-specific scaffolding" and in the context of collective action, such sense-making includes who "we" are and what "we" stand for. Making this assumption explicit is important because it connects the country-level conceptualizations of culture (and country-level data) we used in the research synthesis with the psychological level of analysis used in studies of collective action. As such, we assumed that cultural dimensions and values from a particular country would trickle down to the samples associated with that same country. This idea may explain, in part at least, why the cultural constraints we identified were small in size: Presumably, if we could have known the "true" cultural composition of the sample (rather than the country in which it was conducted), we might have seen stronger constraining effects. Future research should therefore not only rely on countrylevel indicators of culture but where possible, also on its psychological indicators.</p><p>Finally, our findings imply that there may be more cultural variance to explore, offering another step toward an exciting research agenda on the cultural psychology of collective action (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b344">van Zomeren &amp; Louis, 2017)</ref>. Indeed, we observed several unpredicted but interesting cultural constraints: For example-again, only for identity-we found effects for masculinity (i.e., valuing competitiveness; with weaker masculinity constraining identity effects) and long-term orientation (i.e., foregoing short-term outcomes; with longer-term orientation constraining identity effects). We interpret these findings as implying that valuing competitiveness and short-term outcomes means a stronger preference for collective action to achieve such goals. Future theory and research can explore such findings in more detail and test whether and how theoretically relevant cultural dimensions and values affect the motivations for collective action at both the cultural and individual level (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Fischer, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hofstede, 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Hofstede, , 2001;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b259">Schwartz, 1992)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications and Caveats</head><p>Previous practical recommendations focused on the importance of social identity, as well as injustice and efficacy, for motivating individuals for collective action; specifically, the main emphasis was on building a politicized identity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b290">Stürmer &amp; Simon, 2004)</ref>. The main changes we suggest to these practical recommendations are to emphasize the joint importance of morality and identity and to broaden the emphasis on targeting not just politicized but also opinion-based identities and the relevant moral convictions these may reflect. In other words, we recommend practitioners use narratives about who "we" are and what "we" stand for. If such framing psychologically (and culturally) resonates with individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(Oyserman &amp; Lauffer, 2002)</ref>; our findings imply that this is likely to stimulate (other motivations for) collective action (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Kleres &amp; Wettergren, 2017)</ref>, or to stimulate people's readiness to act in response to situational triggers of injustice and efficacy. Furthermore, it is important to consider what specific types of identity, morality, injustice, and efficacy should be targeted in a given collective action context. Our findings suggest, for example, that they should target politicized or opinion-based group identities, stronger moral convictions, anger, group and participative efficacy beliefs, and perceived effectiveness, to best motivate individuals for collective action.</p><p>Some caution is warranted in considering whether collective action is actually a good or desirable thing. Although this concept often refers to mostly peaceful attempts to change the world for what people believe is the better, 44 it cannot be completely valuefree or objective <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Gergen, 1973)</ref> because it requires assumptions about what counts as "better" (also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Kreienkamp et al., 2020)</ref>. Indeed, most studies of collective action focus on liberal goals and participant samples, and thus also on morals and social movements 42 Theories of goal pursuit and obstruction (e.g., De <ref type="bibr">Lemus et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Leander et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Leander et al., , 2020;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b287">Stollberg et al., 2017)</ref> argue that different means exist within a given situation to fulfill a currently active goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">(Kruglanski et al., 2002)</ref>. As such, cultural norms play an important part in determining what constitutes viable goals to achieve through collective action.</p><p>43 This may also explain why we did not find such cultural constraints for morality, as the core of such constraints does not lie in what "we" stand for, but whether this "we" is entrenched in a broader "us." 44 A similar observation can be made for the case of violent collective action. Most studies on collective action focus on so-called normative collective action <ref type="bibr" target="#b307">(Tausch et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b369">Wright et al., 1990)</ref>, which means the action would fall within societal norms of what is considered acceptable and appropriate (e.g., signing a petition, joining a peaceful demonstration). Whereas other work has focused on nonnormative collective action (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Becker et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b307">Tausch et al., 2011)</ref>, in practice it is often difficult to differentiate between what the protesters believe to be normative and what society finds acceptable (e.g., a strike of farmers occupying highways with their big machinery); which society might disapprove of if it takes too long, but the farmers themselves may feel this is perfectly acceptable and justified. This is different, however, for violent collective actions, such as riots, or acts of sabotage, or even terrorism, which are often consensually considered as non-normative <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">(Piven &amp; Cloward, 1977)</ref>. Against this backdrop, we found that, when testing for moderations by violent collective action in our database, the same motivations predicted violent collective action, although for some in a somewhat weaker way.</p><p>that many would consider politically left-wing <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Duarte et al., 2015)</ref>. With this comes a notion of social change as progressive social change (e.g., increasing equal rights) and collective action as mostly peaceful and nonharmful public manifestations of those who seek a better world <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Górska et al., 2017)</ref>. In fact, relatively few studies have focused on conservatives' collective action or on the protection of the system as the goal of such action (rather than social change). This gap raises the question as to whether the dual chamber model would apply to such action. As the few studies that have done so indeed seem to suggest that the same motivations apply <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Jost et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Milesi &amp; Alberici, 2018)</ref>, we would not be surprised to find that although liberal and conservative protesters may have different ideas about what is right and wrong, their hearts may, perhaps, not beat so differently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>This quantitative research synthesis has at least four limitations. First, we cannot control which contexts researchers (decided to) study, and hence our quantitative research synthesis is bounded to structural conditions already favorable to collective action. As such, we can interpret the effects of the identity, morality, injustice, and efficacy motivations when collective action is already likely or ongoing, but we need to be cautious in extending this to conditions under which structural conditions are less favorable.</p><p>Second, although we consistently conceptualized motivations for collective action as predictors of such action, a limitation of the correlational nature of the data is that the direction of causality may also be possible. We note, however, that we replicated <ref type="bibr">Van Zomeren et al.'s (2008)</ref> finding that studies that allowed for causal interpretation of the effects did not show larger or smaller effect sizes than studies that did not allow such causal interpretations (although cell sizes were small for causal effects). Like van <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">Zomeren et al. (2008)</ref>, we interpret this finding to mean that the direction of causality seems to flow from and in both directions with equal strength and hence does not invalidate our interpretation of our findings. It is up to future longitudinal or experimental studies to test whether this is indeed the case. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_13">45</ref>Third, sample sizes for the morality meta-analysis in particular, and for non-Western cultures more generally, were relatively small. This limitation directly derives from the state of the literature we synthesized, in which morality is only a recent focus of attention and most research is still conducted with Western samples. Across the board, however, our analyses showed converging patterns in line with the literature, suggesting this imbalance may not be a threat to the validity of our findings.</p><p>Fourth, although the mean effects of the four motivations on collective action were sizable, in line with predictions, and obtained despite much variance in groups, samples, methods, and contexts, a critic might argue that the dual chamber model does not yet explain this variance very well. We interpret this more positively, however, namely as offering scope for future theorizing and research. The current research synthesis reflects and documents the work in progress that the literature we synthesized represents, and the next step indeed is theoretically to better explain the contextual variance around the four motivations for collective action, and then systematically test such explanations in future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Directions for Future Research</head><p>We recommend at least four avenues for future research. First, we need to better understand psychological change over time (e.g., in terms of increased or decreased motivations for collective action). Although some studies have looked at the psychological consequences of participating in collective action (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Leal et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b317">Thomas et al., 2020)</ref>, the processes through which such psychological change occur are not yet clearly understood (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b322">Turner-Zwinkels et al., 2015)</ref>. Some models include predictions about such consequences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Becker &amp; Tausch, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b343">van Zomeren et al., 2012)</ref>, but these typically entail rather simplistic positive feedback loops from collective action to specific motivations for collective action, suggesting that participating in such action may politicize (identity), moralize (morality), enrage (injustice/anger), and empower (efficacy). Such exclusively positive feedback loops, however, seem somewhat unrealistic. We need to better understand such motivational but also potential null or demotivational effects on sustained participation.</p><p>Second, we recommend developing theories and studying the difference between motivation and actual behavior more systematically. <ref type="bibr" target="#b346">van Zomeren et al. (2008)</ref> observed that most studies on collective action used proxy measures of collective action, such as intentions or support for collective action, rather than measures of actual behavior-and it is no different in the current database, more than ten years later. Behavioral measures yielded smaller effect sizes than proxy measures, but future research should assess what this difference actually means. It may mean, for one, that the use of proxy measures inflated effect sizes, as people can more easily say that they want to engage in collective action than they would actually do so in practice. This would imply proxies are "cheap talk" measures and thus researchers should use behavioral measures. A second possibility is that behavioral measures, unlike proxy measures, tap into a broader process that does not only include motivation but also the individual's decision process that also involves reasons for not acting (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Klandermans, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr">Klandermans &amp; Van Stekelenburg, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b206">Oegema &amp; Klandermans, 1994)</ref>. This possibility would suggest that either effect size is meaningful in its own way (reflecting motivation, or motivation coupled with decision-making). Future research needs to examine this difference in more detail.</p><p>Third, future research can seek to further extend and apply the dual chamber model to other actors and possibly to other goals. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Klavina and van Zomeren (2018)</ref> recently found that the four motivations could even be applied to third groups, which are groups that may perhaps find themselves in a disadvantaged position in the future (also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b317">Thomas et al., 2020)</ref>. In terms of different goals, the four motivations may extend to collective action to maintain the status quo, rather than to change it <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">(Osborne et al., 2019)</ref>. Such a quest for a broader application of the dual chamber model may suggest that the four motivations may perhaps not be limited to predicting collective action as currently defined (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b335">van Zomeren, 2016b)</ref>. Exploring such questions will help to establish fruitful links with other literatures and disciplines interested in broader manifestations of political action, such as sociology and political science (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Green &amp; Gerber, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, future research can focus on the motivational power of interpersonal relationships and embeddedness in social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b334">(Van Zomeren, 2016a)</ref>. The social identity approach has been a dominant influence in this literature for the last three decades, and as a result, the focus has been on individuals who act as psychological group members (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">McGarty et al., 2009</ref>; for a critique). As much as individuals are cultural, moral, and group beings, individuals are also relational beings (van Zomeren, 2016a) who are motivated to manage their interpersonal relationships and networks, such as in the case of activists who ask their activist friends to join collective action (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Klandermans et al., 2008)</ref>. At present, however, there is no clear psychological explanation for why such embeddedness should motivate collective action. The recent trend toward studying how intra-and intergroup contact influences collective action might be helpful (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Cakal et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Dixon et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Dixon et al., , 2017;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b239">Reimer et al., 2017)</ref>, as this may force the field to consider the protester as a manager of interpersonal relationships as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>This article has synthesized a recent explosion of sociopsychological theorizing and research on collective action across very different groups, contexts, and cultures. Our research synthesis replicated previous meta-analytic work and breaks new theoretical ground by developing and substantiating an integrative, comprehensive, and potentially cross-cultural dual chamber model of collective action. This model paints a portrait of the protester's beating heart as having morality and identity chambers, which, to continue the metaphor, collaborate to oxygenate the blood pumped around the body, thus stimulating the injustice and efficacy motivations for collective action. Our findings confirm the need and value of integrating these four unique yet interrelated motivations and offer a new conceptual bridge for theorizing about structural (i.e., cultural and other contextual) constraints to these motivations. Our hope is that this research synthesis inspires collective action scholars to take theory and research to a next level of theoretical integration (e.g., seeking bridges with moral and cultural psychology, as well as sociology and political science), and toward innovative and exciting avenues of future research, as to better understand when and why people engage in collective action across the globe.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1The Dual Chamber Model of Collective Action(Conceptual Model)    </figDesc></figure>

Indeed, perceiving collective disadvantage as unfair does not necessarily imply that one's morals are violated (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b333">van Zomeren, 2013)</ref>, perceiving something as immoral can affect whether it is perceived as unfair or fair<ref type="bibr" target="#b274">(Skitka, 2010)</ref>, and one can be aware of social inequality yet consider this a morally acceptable, or even good, part of the system or social structure (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Jost et al., 2017)</ref>, and hence do not perceive it as unfair.</p></note>
