<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating role of experience quality between the dimensions of authenticity and satisfaction in a context of cultural-heritage tourism. This paper investigates the direct influences of these variables on satisfaction and the indirect influences of two dimensions of authenticity on satisfaction through quality of experience.</p><p>This study is a pioneer in analysing the influence of each of the two dimensions of authenticity on satisfaction via quality of experience in a cultural-heritage context. A questionnaire survey administered to 205 visitiors in the City of York, United Kingdom, was analysed using the structural equation modelling technique. The findings confirmed the direct and indirect influence of the variable authenticity in its double perspective (objective and existential authenticity) on satisfaction. The findings also identified the mediating role of quality of experience between authenticity and satisfaction. It is therefore recommended that cultural tourism attractions in a destination should be offered to provide visitors an authentic experience and a high quality of personal experience that would favour the satisfaction of consumption.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The tourism industry has experienced significantgrowth which is predicted to be sustained According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">WTTC (2015)</ref>, the contribution of tourism to the world GDP was 9.5% in 2014 and is expected to exceed 10.5% by 2024. According to <ref type="bibr">UNWTO (2016)</ref>, the arrival of international tourists is expected to grow by 3.3% per year between 2010 and 2030, to reach 1.8 billion by 2030. In 2016 there were 37.6 million inbound visits to the UK, an increase of 4.1% compared with 2015. These figures underscore the importance of tourism activity within the international economy. Public and private agents involved in the management of tourist destinations are showing a growing interest in the study of variables that can improve the satisfaction and fidelity of tourists. Heritage tourism has become popular with an increasing number of tourists seeking a meaningful experience and a relationship with the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Watson and Waterton, 2011)</ref>. In addition, increasing academic interest in heritage tourism has resulted in heritage being described as a "contemporary epidemic" <ref type="bibr">(Urry, 2002, p.5)</ref>.</p><p>The variable authenticity is a relevant explanatory variable in the formation of tourist satisfaction and loyalty in general and with cultural motivation in particular <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kolar and Zabkar, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Shen, Guo and</ref><ref type="bibr">Wu, 2012, Casteran and</ref><ref type="bibr">Roeder, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hede, Garma, Josiassen, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Thyne, 2014, Lee, Phau, Hughes, Li and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Quintal, 2016)</ref>. Some of these studies consider the variable authenticity as a one-dimensional construct while others consider it in its dual dimension: objective and existential <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kolar and Zabkar, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Shen et al., 2012)</ref>. This research considers authenticity in its double dimension as this results in a more informed understanding of the influence of authenticity and satisfaction.</p><p>A number of authors have found that the quality of experience variable, is important in the formation of the satisfaction and the loyalty of the tourists <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tian and Scott, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kim, Ritchie and Tung , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Chen and Chen, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">and 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Jin, Lee, and Lee, 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Otto and Ritchie (1995)</ref> define the quality of the experience as the affective component of the experience lived by a tourist in the visited destination. The cognitive-affective approach to satisfaction, mostly adopted in more recent research, has favored the study and use of this variable. Thereby, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kao, Huang and Wu, (2008)</ref> examined the mediating role of experience quality in a model of tourist experiences between performance quality and satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altunel and Erkut (2015)</ref> analyse the mediation effect of experience quality and satisfaction on the relationship between involvement and recommendation intention. This paper explores the possible mediating role of the quality of experience on the relationship that unites the variables authenticity and satisfaction.</p><p>Regarding the authenticity variable, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Li, Shen and Wen (2016)</ref> analyzes the relationship between this variable and the quality of experience in the context of cultural tourism. This work considers the authenticity variable as a one-dimensional construct. There is, however, limited empirical research which has analysed the possible influence or relationship of authenticity in its double dimension on the variable experience quality in the context of cultural-heritage tourism. In accordance with this, the following question is proposed: Do each of the two dimensions of the authenticity variable exert a certain direct influence on the variables of experience quality? In addition, this paper will explore if the data confirms the results obtained in previous works and verifies that the quality of experience exerts a positive or direct influence on satisfaction. In this case, the paper seeks to understand if the experience quality exerts a mediating effect in the influence that each of the two dimensions of authenticity can have on satisfaction.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows: Conceptual Background and Hypotheses, Methodology (sample, measures, data analysis), Results, Discussions and Conclusions, and Theoretical and Managerial Implications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Foundations, Research Model and Hypotheses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Authenticity and Satisfaction</head><p>Recent studies have identified the importance of authenticity in the formation of the satisfaction of cultural tourists <ref type="bibr">(Apostolokis, 2003, Zhou, Zhang and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Edelheim, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hede, Garma, Josiassen, and Thyne, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lee, Phau, Hughes, Li and Quintal, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Trilling (1972)</ref>, the original use of this concept arises in museum studies, where experts were interested in differentiating authentic works of art from those that looked to be, especially in the face of economic valuation. This use of the term was extended to tourism, particularly cultural tourism and the valuation of objects related to this activity. There is no consensus regarding the definiton of the word authenticity. According to MaCannel, the authenticity of a destination can be defined as a global assessment of "genuineness of a tourist destination" <ref type="bibr">(1973, p.590)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wang (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Reisinger and Steiner (2005)</ref> conducted a comprehensive review of the different approaches and interpretations of the concept and identrified that most of the works <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kolar and Zabkar, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Shen et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Lee et al., 2016)</ref> coincide in pointing out two dimensions within this variable: the object-based and the existential. Objective authenticity is an inherent feature of objects and can be interpreted as the authenticity of objects that are original or as the authenticity projected onto objects by tourists <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Wang, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Reisinger and Steiner, 2005)</ref>. Existential authenticity refers to a potential state of personal connection with destiny driven by participation in activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Wang 1999</ref><ref type="bibr">, Reisinger and Steiner 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">, Steiner and Reisinger 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The variable satisfaction has been widely studied in the field of marketing in general and tourism in particular. There is no single definition of this concept unanimously accepted.</p><p>However, a number of elements common to most of the contributions can be identified. First, satisfaction is a cognitive or emotional response, second, the response is related to an aspect or specific subject (expectations, product, consumer experience) and generally involves the comparison of a perception with a previously established standard, and third, satisfaction is the response at a time or during a certain time (after consumption, after a choice, during or after an experience ...). <ref type="bibr">Oliver (1997, p. 13</ref>) defined satisfaction as "the consumers' fulfilment response. It is a judgment on the product or service feature, or the product or the service itself, concerning the provision of a pleasurable level of consumption-related fulfilment, including levels of under-or over-fulfilment" In the field of tourism, the most recent definitions consider satisfaction as an evaluation judgment in which cognitive and affective aspects are combined <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bigné, Andreu and Gnoth, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">De Rojas and Camarero, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rodríguez and San Martín, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yuksel, Yuksel and Bilim, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen and Chen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lee, et al. 2016)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Rodríguez and San Martín (2008)</ref>, satisfaction as an individual"s cognitive-affective state derived from a tourist experience. It is this definition that is adopted in this study.</p><p>The causal relationship between perception of authenticity and satisfaction has been examined by a number of authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lu, Chi and Liu, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nguyen and Cheung, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lee et al., 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lu, Chi and Liu (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nguyen and Cheung (2016)</ref> analyse the direct influence of authenticity as a single variable on the satisfaction of cultural tourists, whilst <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lee et al., (2016)</ref> considers the two dimensions of the authenticity variable, objective-andexistential, and analyses the influence of each on satisfaction. The first and the third of these papers found that the relationship between authenticity and satisfaction was not significant.</p><p>However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nguyen and Cheung (2016)</ref> identified that a high perception of the authenticity also implies a high level of satisfaction in heritage tourism. It is suggested, therefore, that the consideration of the double dimension of authenticity is more enriching and can provide further clarity and information on the characteristics of the relationships explored in this study. This research, therefore, considers the two dimensions of the authenticity variable, objective-and-existential, and analyses the influence of each on satisfaction of cultural tourists. To verify if our data confirms the results obtained by the works mentioned above and to deepen the knowledge of these relations, the following hypotheses are proposed: H1: The higher the objective authenticity that the heritage tourists perceive, the higher the level of satisfaction they have. (a&gt;0) H2: The higher the existencial authenticity that the heritage tourists perceive, the higher the level of satisfaction they have. (b&gt;0) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kolar and Zabkar (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Shen et al. (2012)</ref> find that the objective dimension of authenticity positively influences its existential dimension. In the context of cultural tourism, it is reasonable to suggest that a high perception of objective authenticity, a positive evaluation of architecture, materials, presentation of resources, activities, all positively influences the perception of the existential authenticity, and it can favour the feeling of connection and the immersion of the tourists in the local culture. To verify this and to explore if the findings of this research corroborates the results obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kolar and Zabkar (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Shen et al. (2012)</ref>, the contrast hypothesis three of the model is as follows: H3: The higher the objective authenticity that the heritage tourists perceive, the higher the level of existencial authenticity they experience. (c&gt;0)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Authenticity and Experience Quality</head><p>In the early 1980s, within the field of consumer satisfaction studies, the experimental approach focused on the individual's affective response following the act of consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hirschman and Holbrook, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Holbrook and Hirschman, 1982)</ref>. Within this approach, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Otto and Ritchie (1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">1996)</ref> introduced the concept of quality of experience and applied this concept to leisure and tourism services. Otto stated that: "The affective component of the service experience has been shown to comprise the subjective, emotional and highly personal responses to various aspects of service delivery which lead to satisfaction with the service overall" <ref type="bibr">(1996, p.169)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chang and</ref><ref type="bibr">Horng (2010, p.2403</ref>) defined the quality of experience as: "a representation how customers emotionally evaluate their experiences as they participate in consumption activities, others customers, cuostomers' companions, and other elements".</p><p>Different scales have been proposed to measure the quality of the experience. Otto and Ritchie"s scale ( <ref type="formula">1996</ref>) is composed of four dimensions (hedonic, peace of mind, involvement, and recognition). <ref type="bibr">Kao, Huang and Wu's scale (2008)</ref> also identified four dimensions which consist of immersion, surprise, participation, and fun. Chang and Horng (2010) considers a scale with five dimensions including physical surroundings, service providers, other customer, customer's companions and customers themselves.</p><p>The relationship between authenticity and quality of experience variables has thus far not been fully explored. Hang"s (2010) study identified the existence of a positive linear correlation between both variables but does not raise the contrast of the hypothesis concerning the existence of such relationship. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Li, Shen and Wen (2016)</ref> analyzes the aforementioned relationship in a context of cultural tourism. This work considers authenticity as a one-dimensional construct and their results indicate the existence of a positive influence of the authenticity on the quality of the experience. This work considers the two dimensions of authenticity and it is suggested that each of these two dimensions, objective and existential, can influence the perception of the quality of the experience by tourists in a context of cultural tourism. Consequently, hypotheses four and five are identified as follows: H4: The higher the objective authenticity that the heritage tourists perceive, the higher the level of experience quality they have. (d&gt;0) H5: The higher the existencial authenticity that the heritage tourists perceive, the higher the level of experience quality they have. ( <ref type="formula">e&gt;0</ref>)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experience Quality and Satisfaction</head><p>The influence of experience quality on the satisfaction of cultural-heritage tourists has been extensively studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chen and Chen, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Li, Shen and Wen, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, Nguyen and Cheung, Lee et al., 2016)</ref>. In all of these works it has been shown that the quality of the influence exerts a positive or direct influence on the satisfaction of tourists. To verify if the data from this study supports the results obtained in these previous studies, the following hypothesis six is proposed: H6: The higher the experience quality that the heritage tourists perceive, the higher the level of satisfaction they have. ( <ref type="formula">f&gt;0</ref>)</p><p>The proposed model is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and Data Collection</head><p>The research population of this study is visitors aged eighteen years or older who visit the city of York. Data collection was conducted was collected in November 2016 in the Visit York Visitor Information Centre (VIC) and in the surroundings of the Cathedral and the York Castle Museum, where 218 completed questionnaires were obtained. After excluding 13 cases due to excessive missing data and when a response pattern was observed <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>, 205 questionnaires (94.04%) were retained as valid for the empirical analysis.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Green (1991, p. 503)</ref>, for an 80% confidence level and a 5% error level for a maximum of 3 predictors (which in our model feature the satisfaction variable), the minimum sampling size required for the measurement of the medium-sized effects between the variables would be 76 surveys. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the profile of the respondents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>The questionnaire"s design-base is a literature review of cultural tourism. The questionnaire was translated into Spanish, English, French, German and Mandarin in order to include tourists of many different nationalities. The first part includes questions regarding the sociodemographic characteristics of the interviewee (gender, age, place of origin, level of studies).</p><p>The second section asks respondents for information regarding their visit, such as the duration of the visit, cultural events or attractions visited, and the fundamental objective of the trip. The third part of the questionnaire includes the measurement of the constructs. These were measured using question statements adapted from academic studies related to this topic.</p><p>A first version of the questionnaire was presented to experts from the VIC in York (Visit York) who made suggestions for the adaptation of certain items or for improvement in the writing therein. In addition, a pilot survey was conducted to ensure the validity of the content.</p><p>The measurement of the authenticity variable in its double perspectiveobjective authenticity and existential authenticityis based on the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kolar and Zabkar (2010)</ref> and employs five items for objective dimension and six items for the existential dimension. This double perspective of authenticity provides a richer version of this variable than that gathered by others author. Quality of the experience is measured using an adaptation of the scale proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Otto and Ritchie (1996)</ref> and it employs five items for the measurements.</p><p>The measurement of the satisfaction variable is an adaption of the multi-dimensional scale provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Oliver (1997)</ref>. The authors have included two items that refer to the affective and cognitive evaluation of satisfaction and a third item for a global evaluation of satisfaction. A seven-point Likert scale was used for the measurement of all the variables, whereby the score 1 refers to strongly disagree, and 7 refers to strongly agree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>The research model outlined in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> has been tested using Partial Least Squares (PLS) -a variance-based structural equation modelling technique. The following reasons justify the choice of PLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Roldán &amp; Sánchez-Franco, 2012)</ref>: 1) the complexity of the research model, not only concerning the type of variables included in the model (reflective, formative, first and higher order constructs), but also the relationships established between the variables (direct mediating and moderating relations); 2) to explore and/or predict the behaviour of the dependent variables; 3) the non-normality of the research model"s variables; 4) to allow robust estimations when the number of observations is small <ref type="bibr">(Reinartz, Haenlein, &amp; Henseler, 2009)</ref>. In order to conduct the analysis, SmartPLS 3.4 software is used.</p><p>For the assessment of the research model in York, a two-stage procedure was conducted <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hair et al., 2018)</ref>. First, the measurement model is evaluated (outer model) by evaluating the reliability and validity of composite Mode A constructs. Second, the structural model is evaluated (inner model) by assessing the path coefficients, explanatory power (R 2 ), and the values of the Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) as an approximate model fit for PLS-SEM <ref type="bibr">(Henseler, Hubona, and Ray 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>A PLS model must be analysed and interpreted in two stages <ref type="bibr">(Hair, Hult, Ringle, &amp; Sarsted, 2014)</ref>. First, the measurement model is evaluated. The measurement model allows evaluating if the theoretical concepts or constructs are measured correctly through the items observed.</p><p>The evaluation is different according to the construct being formative or reflective. Second, the structural model is evaluated. The magnitude and significance of the causal relationships between the different variables is assessed from this model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model</head><p>In the first stage of the analysis, the assessment of the measurement model allows 19 items to be observed. The assessment of the measurement model for Composite Mode A entails an evaluation of the validity and reliability <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows that the indicators of Composite Mode A variables meet reliability requirements since, in general, they are higher than 0.7. In addition, there are some items with a loading of 0.4-0.7. These items should be considered for removal if they increase the Composite Reliability (CR) and AVE to a level above the threshold. However, the decision is to retain them to support the content validity of the scale. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows that the CR are greater than 0.7 and the AVE of the constructs is higher than 0.5, and therefore convergent validity is acceptable <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>. The fact that CR and AVE surpass the 0.5 threshold confirms that the removal of indicators in the two groups with loadings 0.4-0.7 was unnecessary. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows that all variables achieve discriminant validity following both the Fornell-Larcker and the HTMT criteria. This result suggests that each construct is distinct from other constructs <ref type="bibr">(Henseler, Ringle, and Sarstedt, 2015)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">[Insert Table 2] [Insert Table 3]</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model</head><p>In the second stage of analysis, the structural model was assessed. Table <ref type="table">4</ref> shows the path coefficients and the hypothesis testing by using 5,000 bootstrap resamples and the confidence intervals at 95%. From Table <ref type="table">4</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, it can be observed that the objective and existential authenticity exerts a positive and significant influence on satisfaction (a=0.317 and b=0.322). Hence, Hypotheses H1 and H2 are confirmed. Similarly, it can be observed that objective authenticity exerts a positive and significant influence on existential authenticity (c= 0.680). Hence, Hypothesis H3 is confirmed. Likewise, hypotheses H4 and H5 are also supported since a positive and significant effect of the objective and existential authenticity are observed on experience quality (d=0.351 and e=0.410). Hypotheses H6 is confirmed on observing a positive influence of the quality of the experience on satisfaction (f=0.171).</p><p>Table 4 also reports the mediating relationships in the model as the product of the coefficients of each of the causal relations in the mediating chain <ref type="bibr">(Hayes, Preacher, and Myers, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the one-tailed t-test, the indirect effect of the objective authenticity through experience quality on satisfaction (g=d*f= 0.060). The indirect effect of objective authenticity through experience quality and existential authenticity on satisfaction is also significant (h=c*e*f=0.048). This supports Hypothesis H7 and Hypothesis H8. The indirect effect of the existential authenticity through experience quality on satisfaction (i=e*f= 0.070) is significant. The importance of these indirect effects on satisfaction has been tested using 5,000 bootstrap resamples <ref type="bibr">(Chin, Kim and Lee 2013</ref>. The model has predictive validity for the three endogenous variables since the coefficient Q 2 is positive in all three cases. The Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) as an approximate fit of the composite factor model <ref type="bibr">(Henseler, Hubona, and Ray 2016</ref>) is also computed. The results revealed that the SRMR model fits values of 0.081. Since these values are lower than 0.10, they can be considered as acceptable for PLS-SEM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[Insert Figure 2] [Insert Table 4]</head><p>Three Multigroup analyses have also been conducted to support the research model and the analysis detailed above. First, given the high percentage of modern tourists (aged 18-34), a multigroup analysis with two groups "modern" versus "non-modern" tourists has been conducted. Second, differences on the model relationships might be observed regarding the groups "domestic" versus "non-domestic" tourists encouraging another multigroup analysis.</p><p>Lastly, the analysis of possible differences between "strictly cultural" versus "others" tourists appears to be appropriate in the cultural context of the study. The findings reveal no significant differences between the path coefficients in the three multigroup analyses supporting the specification of the research model proposed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and Conclusions</head><p>This study tests a structural model integrating constructs of objective and existential authenticity, quality of experience and satisfaction in a context of cultural-heritage tourism.</p><p>Focusing on the research model relationships, the influences of objective and existential authenticity on satisfaction were found to be significant. The findings suggest that tourists with positive perceived authenticity are better satisfied with the cultural site. These results are different to those obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lu, Chi and Liu (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lee et al. (2016)</ref> who found that this relationship was not significant. However, the results from this research coincide with those obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nguyen and Cheung (2016)</ref> and have identified that objective authenticity can be considered as a determinant of existential authenticity. This has also been observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kolar and Zabkar (2010)</ref>. These results mean that the objective authenticity induce the tourist to experience subjective perceptions attached to the objects" authenticity.</p><p>The model also highlights the relationship not previously studied in tourism and therefore contributes to our understanding of the factors leading to cultural consumption.</p><p>Positive influence of authenticity (objective and existential) on the experience quality has been confirmed.</p><p>The study also shows the significant influence of the experience quality on satisfaction. This is consistent with other research in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tian Cole and Scott, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kao et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen and Chen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hang, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altunel and Erkut, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The influences of the objective and existential authenticity on satisfaction are even greater if the mediating effects that appear in the model are considered. The results reveal that the greatest influence of objective authenticity is on satisfaction via existential authenticity and via experience quality and the greatest influence of existential authenticity is on satisfaction via experience quality. There is limited research that has examined this mediating relationship.</p><p>This study was motivated by the need to strengthen the understanding of the role of objective authenticity, existential authenticity, and experience quality on satisfaction. In this paper, not only are the direct influences of these variables on satisfaction analysed but the indirect influences of the predictor variables on the endogenous variables of the model were also studied. Testing these relationships leads to a better understanding of how these variables interact in a cultural-heritage tourist destination. This study is a pioneer in analysing the influence of each of the two dimensions of authenticity on satisfaction via quality of experience in a cultural-heritage context. The findings confirmed the importance of the variable authenticity in its double perspective (objective and existential authenticity) and quality of experience in cultural tourism consumption. Cultural tourist attractions in a destination should be offered to provide visitors an authentic experience and a high quality of personal experience that in turn would favour the satisfaction of consumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical and Managerial Implications</head><p>Regarding the notion of authenticity, the findings of this study reveal that cultural offerings were perceived not only as tangible tourism attractions but also as existential experiences derived from the different feelings attached to the tourism products (sense of enjoyment and escape). The results clearly show that visitors interpret authenticity in its double dimension (objective and existential authenticity) and that the concept of authenticity may have different meanings depending on the destination characteristics. The consideration of the notion of authenticity constitutes a key element in the present study since there is limited research in the generic and cultural-heritage tourism literature that has considered the influence of perceived authenticity on either satisfaction and behavioural intentions <ref type="bibr">(Sedmak and Mihalic, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ramkisson and Uysal, 2011)</ref>. The findings collaborate with <ref type="bibr">Kolar and Zabakar (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Ramkisson and Uysal (2011)</ref> who also noted that perceived authenticity in its double perspective influences successful consumption of cultural attractions. The theoretical contribution of this research aims at enriching the understanding of the complexity of the authenticity concept as a multi-dimensional construct and to provide relevant information for tourism marketers, planners and policy-makers to offer authentic experience at heritage sites.</p><p>Another theoretical implication and contribution derived from the research model is the significant influence of perceived authenticity on quality of experience and the significant and positive mediating effect of quality of experience between both dimensions of authenticity and satisfaction. Cultural offerings seek to provide visitors with authentic experiences that influence the quality of the tourist experience. Thus, this study also contributes to the generic and cultural-heritage literature by examining those relationships that thus far has not been analysed.</p><p>In addition to the theoretical implications of this study, managerial implications should also be identified. According to the relationships found in the research model, tourism marketers, planners and policy-makers should pay attention to the objective and existential dimension of authenticity to improve the quality of the tourist experience. Both dimensions should be considered as key factors in achieving differentiation and the competitive positioning of a destination in relation to other cultural-heritage destinations. Policy makers should consider these variables and identify destination scenarios where tourists are able to create their own authentic experiences. In order to provide a positive cultural experience, it is necessary to meet the expectations of visitors. In this sense, there must be correspondence between tourism advertisements and the offered experience. The marketing messages should be properly designed and communicated to ensure that tourists get the experience presented to them.</p><p>Managers of cultural tourist destinations should pay attention to architecture, faithful restoration of buildings, harmony of the buildings with the context of the destination, and provide attractive and complete heritage information. Tourist destination managers should pay special attention to the management of tourist flows ensure tourists are able to enjoy the environment without crowds of people. The cultural experience improves if heritage managers design strategies to meet expectations regarding the components of peace of mind, cultural experience, and involvement in the traditions and customs with the local population.</p><p>The environment should allow tourists to connect with the history of the place and its inhabitants and facilitate the lived emotions that make the experience authentic and memorable. In this sense, it is crucial that cultural tourism authorities present the cultural heritage within a setting that allows tourists to immerse themselves in different historical periods of the destination with accurate and detailed information. The symbolic and simulated elements must be carefully presented to facilitate the imagination and enjoyment of tourists. There must be an adequate balance between genuine and simulated objects in what is described here as the performance space. While simulated objects can facilitate the imagination and recreation of an earlier period of history, their excessive use may seem frivolous. It would be advisable that a mixture of genuine and simulated objects be used in order to stimulate the imagination and the enjoyment of tourists.</p><p>To improve the tourist experience of visitors, the destination should improve all elements that interact with tourists, from street cleaning and security to noise levels. Tourism managers should facilitate the meeting and connection with the local population, service workers and local residents. Tourists usually remember with pleasure the hospitality with which they have received. This provokes positive feelings and makes their experience memorable and authentic.</p><p>Tourist perceptions of authenticity, objective and existential, are important because both dimensions are the means by which individuals connect the materiality of visited space to the significance of their lived experiences <ref type="bibr">(Rickly &amp; McCabe, 2017, p.65)</ref>. This increases the likelihood of the experience been memorable and unique to each person and increases the likelihood that tourists are satisfied with their visit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research</head><p>There are a number of limitations that should be highlighted and avenues that merit further investigation. First, no minimum period of stay by the respondent was stipulated. Therefore, it would be interesting to interview people who stayed at the destination for several days so that the involvement of tourists with the place visited and with its residents could be observed. The active participation of tourists in the cultural life of the destination would therefore be encouraged, which would enhance the Experience Quality and consequently lead to greater Satisfaction and a better recommendation of the visit.</p><p>The analysis of the causal relationships has hitherto been restricted to the city of York and therefore limits generalisation of the study"s finding. It would therefore be interesting to contrast the relationships explored in the research model with those of another cultural destination. A cross-cultural study (multi-group analysis) could be employed that would not only allow the validity of the measurement model to be analysed in various cultural contexts, but would also enable the detection of any significant differences in certain causal relationships between the tourist destinations involved. Furthermore, the study sample size is another limitation that should be acknowledged. Although, the sample size used met the sample size requirements for Partial Least estimation, the fairly small sample size limits the degree of generalisation and validation of the model.       </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>[</head><label></label><figDesc>Insert figure 1 ] Mediating efects A deeper study of the relationships raised in the model leads to a consideration of the significance of the indirect effects that may arise. This research will therefore seek to understanding if each of the two dimensions of authenticity have an influence on satisfaction through the quality of experience. To answer these questions the following hypotheses are proposed: H7: Via experience quality, the objective authenticity positively influences satisfaction (g=d*f&gt;0) H8: Via existential authenticity and via experience quality, the objective authenticity positively influences satisfaction (h=c*e*f&gt;0) H9: Via experience quality, the existential authenticity positively influences satisfaction (i=e*f&gt;0)</figDesc></figure>
