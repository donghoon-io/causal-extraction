<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>By integrating literature on family functionality, family firms, and socioemotional wealth (SEW), we develop a theoretical model explaining how family functionality and SEW dimensions influence firm innovativeness. Our multi-group structural equation model on two samples of family SMEs shows that family functionality is positively linked to SEW, whereas divergences emerge on the effect of different SEW dimensions on innovativeness. Binding social ties, the emotional attachment of family members to the firm, and the renewal of family bonds through intra-family succession positively affect family SME innovativeness, while identification of family members with the firm has a negative effect. By deepening current understanding of the role and functionality of controlling families as determinants of their propensity to preserve SEW and achieve innovativeness, our findings offer important implications for theory and practice, paving the way for future research on SEW and family firm innovation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Prior studies show that family ownership has important effects on innovation inputs, such as R&amp;D spending <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chrisman and Patel, 2012)</ref> and technology acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Kotlar et al., 2013)</ref>, as well as on innovation outputs, such as patent citations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Block et al., 2013)</ref> and discontinuous technology adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(König, Kammerlander, and Enders, 2013)</ref>. Innovation scholars are consequently paying increasing attention to understanding how family ownership affects firm innovativeness, defined as the ability or capacity to innovate <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Mairesse and Mohnen, 2002)</ref>, and particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) where innovation is just as important as it is difficult to achieve (e.g., De <ref type="bibr">Massis, Frattini, and Lichtenthaler, 2013a)</ref>.</p><p>Although this research stream has grown rapidly, mixed and inconsistent findings emerge <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(De Massis et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Duran et al., 2015)</ref>. Some scholars note that such inconsistency implies that family firms are heterogeneous and likely to produce diverse innovation outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chrisman and Patel, 2012)</ref>. Accordingly, scholars call for research to identify the drivers of heterogeneity in innovation among family firms (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Chrisman et al., 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr">De Massis, Di Minin, and Frattini, 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Filser et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>We argue that the inconsistent findings in prior research can be reconciled by considering two important sources of heterogeneity among family firms: family functionality, referring to the functional integrity and stability of relationships, a construct of increasing interest in family firm research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Danes, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Neff, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Philbrick and Fitzgerald, 2007)</ref>; and socioemotional wealth (SEW), referring to the non-economic benefits derived from pursuing familycentered non-economic goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berrone, Cruz, and Gomez-Mejia, 2012)</ref>. Both concepts are important drivers of heterogeneity among family firms, since these firms vary greatly according to the differences in family integrity associated with functionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Smilkstein, 1978)</ref>, which can affect the firm's achievement of economic and non-economic family goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Danes et al., 1999)</ref>, and their innovativeness depending on differences in SEW <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berrone et al., 2012)</ref>. Consistent with this view, structural-functional theorists argue that family structures relate to the functions families assign to their members and expect of them <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Popenoe, 1996)</ref>, thus affecting the performance of family functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Johnson, 1971)</ref> and, in turn, the goals and behaviors of firms with family involvement. Likewise, prior research rooted in family science (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Jaskiewicz and Dyer, 2017)</ref> argues that family interactions are related to family functions, which are associated with the family goals driving family activities, thereby supporting the presence of a link between family functionality and SEW.</p><p>What is more, pioneering research on family systems theory indicates that functioning family systems and stable family relationships are important for the sustainability of family firms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Danes et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Jaskiewicz, Combs, and Rau, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Stafford et al., 1999)</ref> and a major driver of key behaviors, such as those related to entrepreneurship <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Danes et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, when exploring family firm behaviors, research suggests accounting for the effect of family interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Jaskiewicz and Dyer, 2017)</ref> in the form of integrity and stable relationships among family members, i.e., family functionality, on these firms' decisionmaking processes, e.g., their decision to focus on economic and non-economic goals (i.e., SEW). To extend and refine our knowledge of family firm behavior, recent family firm research points to the importance of considering family functions as well as family member interactions and relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Jaskiewicz and Dyer, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jaskiewicz et al., 2017)</ref>. However, to our best knowledge, no study examines the impact of family functionality and each of the different SEW dimensions on family firm innovativeness. As such, research is needed to investigate the family factors that determine family firm innovativeness and advance our limited understanding of the drivers of innovativeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hult, Hurley, and Knight, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, we seek to advance knowledge on the family-specific antecedents of firmlevel innovativeness by understanding how family functionality and the dimensions of SEW shape family firm innovativeness. More precisely, we seek to explain how family involvement affects innovativeness, which adds nuance to current theory on family firm innovation and holds promise in reconciling and explaining the mixed findings in extant literature focused primarily on innovation inputs and outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chua, Chrisman, and De Massis, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">De Massis et al., 2013a)</ref>. In particular, we examine these relationships in family SMEs, as they play a dominant role in most world economies <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Memili et al., 2015)</ref> and their innovativeness deserves a more detailed analysis (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Sciascia et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Our study makes two main contributions. First, literature on family firm innovation shows the importance of SEW in affecting innovation decisions <ref type="bibr">(Chrisman et al., 2015b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Kotlar et al., 2013)</ref>, but generally treats SEW as a unidimensional construct, neglecting its multidimensional nature and the effects of its various dimensions. Second, existing literature on family firm innovation reports mixed results as to whether family firms are more or less innovative than their non-family counterparts <ref type="bibr">(De Massis et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Duran et al., 2015)</ref>. A better understanding of what drives family firms' capacity to innovate could be useful to resolve the conflicting results of prior studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Craig et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">De Massis et al., 2015b)</ref>. We argue that ignoring family functional integrity and the stability of relationships among family members (i.e., family functionality) is problematic given that our understanding of family firm behavior is limited. By revealing the effect of family functionality on SEW decisions, we hope to encourage future innovation scholars to reflect more deeply on the functioning of families and their potential impact on family firm innovation.</p></div>

The concept of family functionality is used to assess the health of the family firm system (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Danes, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Gardner et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Neff, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Philbrick and Fitzgerald, 2007)</ref>. Family functionality describes the functional integrity of families <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Danes et al., 1999)</ref> and encompasses adaptability, partnership, growth, affection, and resolution as common themes in social science literature analyzing families <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Smilkstein, 1978)</ref>.</p><p>The concept represents the family members' satisfaction with each of these dimensions, their common interests, and perceived social support from family members with a focus on family members' emotional, communicative, and social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Gardner et al., 2001)</ref>. Although originating from medicine and psychiatry, family functionality is of growing interest in family firm research as it allows including the potential effect of family relationships on, amongst others, firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Neff, 2015)</ref> and business tensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Danes et al., 1999)</ref>, to analyze roles, responsibilities, and predictors of family functionality from a female perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Danes and Olson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Philbrick and Fitzgerald, 2007)</ref>, or to examine ways to manage work and family life in firm-owning families <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Avery, Haynes, and Haynes, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>To explore the antecedents of family firm innovativeness, we apply the concept of SEW, a dominant theoretical paradigm (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Berrone et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cennamo et al., 2012)</ref> defined as the family-firm owners' non-economic gains deriving from ownership, comprising their aim to: (1) exert influence on the firm, (2) uphold a strong family identity with the firm, (3) preserve binding social ties, (4) maintain emotional attachment, and (5) ensure intra-family succession <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Gomez-Mejia, Haynes, Nunez-Nickel, Jacobson, and Moyano-Fuentes, 2007)</ref>. Although family firms seek to achieve both economic and non-economic goals, they are inclined to sacrifice economic gains to maintain their non-economic utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chrisman and Patel, 2012)</ref> when taking SEW as their primary reference point <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Gomez-Mejia et al., 2007)</ref>, thus aiming to preserve their SEW <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Kammerlander and Ganter, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Family Functionality and Socioemotional Wealth in Family SMEs</head><p>Well-functioning families can gain access to resources including capital, assets, income, and labor <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Philbrick and Fitzgerald, 2007)</ref>, and show a high degree of integrity, commitment, and responsibility for each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Smilkstein, 1978)</ref>. They enjoy stable relationships, common interests, low conflict potential, and a high level of satisfaction. The resulting strong family bonds among family members and high level of mutual trust and commitment can benefit both the family and the firm when the emotional connection is intense <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Sundaramurthy, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>These family bonds influence to what extent family members hold key governance positions, how they act in ownership and management positions in the firm, and how strongly their behavior focuses on the firm's wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Corbetta and Salvato, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Stevens et al., 2015)</ref>. This is consistent with the recent view that the family's functioning is fundamental to understanding family firm behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Jaskiewicz and Dyer, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Holding key governance positions, family members can "override, abolish or ignore" control mechanisms <ref type="bibr">(Stevens et al., 2015, p. 207)</ref>, and exert influence by steering the family firm in their favored direction, based on the family's aspirations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ainsworth and Cox, 2003)</ref>. SEW, however, relates to the family's desire to achieve non-economic goals and the question arises whether family functionality only relates to the family members' ability to control the firm and/or their willingness to do so. In well-functioning families, family members support, share responsibilities, and trust each other. Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Kellermanns et al. (2012)</ref>, we argue that family members of well-functioning families are stewards of the firm. Family members holding key governance positions and closely involved in the business may develop responsibility and commitment to the firm.</p><p>Particularly in family SMEs, given their small size, owners from well-functioning families may be incentivized to attain decision-making roles and thus influence essential firm decisions in the family's best interests. In family SMEs, ownership tends to be concentrated, giving power and control to the dominant family that tries to impose its own individual objectives and strategies on the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Miller et al., 2008)</ref>. Here, family functionality can channel family bonds in support of the firm and increase family members' influence on the business <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Eddleston and Kellermanns, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Influencing family members' behaviors as owners, family bonds may also affect the family members' level of identification with the firm. For owning families, the sense of commitment and responsibility associated with family functionality may not be limited to the family, but includes firm activities, as these are typically intensely bound to each other. Indeed, the strong bonds of well-functioning families may lead to blurred family-firm boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Stevens et al., 2015)</ref> so that no distinction can be made between the two systems, leading to a unique identity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Berrone et al., 2010)</ref>. We therefore argue that well-functioning families that feel responsible for their families and their firms, and are deeply involved in the firm's processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Teal and Hofer, 2003)</ref>, will be more prone to identify themselves with the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Gomez-Mejia et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Reciprocal bonds, i.e., binding social ties or the firm's social relationships, may also extend beyond family members to a wide range of external and internal stakeholders (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Miller and Le Breton-Miller, 2005)</ref>. Stemming from strong, stable, and well-functioning family relationships, these bonds can be strengthened as they may provide mutual advantages compared to closed networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berrone et al., 2012)</ref>, including social capital, relational trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Coleman, 1990)</ref>, tacit knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Sirmon and Hitt, 2003)</ref>, closeness, and interpersonal solidarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Uzzi, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Family SMEs are said to be particularly proactive in their surrounding communities and support stakeholders in their geographic area <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Campopiano, De Massis, and Chirico, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, a sense of stability, commitment, and belonging emerges <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Miller and Le Breton-Miller, 2005)</ref> that is reinforced by family influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Carnes and Ireland, 2013)</ref> and culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Laforet, 2013)</ref> through increased identification, solidarity, reliability, and trust. Moreover, family functionality can increase the emphasis of social ties in family SMEs. In particular, family members of well-functioning families typically get along well and their social support of each other is strong, since the level of tension is low <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Danes et al., 1999)</ref>. These families presumably seek to preserve their good social relations within the family and with external stakeholders, as conflicts and tension among family members can have major implications for the family firm.</p><p>Emotional bonds emerge through organizational members' interactions when collaborating and experiencing success and failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Sherony and Green, 2002)</ref>. In family-owned organizations, family members share experiences and a mutual history <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Gomez-Mejia et al., 2011)</ref>. Given the blurred family and firm boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Stevens et al., 2015)</ref>, family members' emotions determine the firm's relationships and business activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Eddleston and Kellermanns, 2007)</ref>. Thus, particularly important for well-functioning families is maintaining strong emotional attachment, close ties, and high levels of harmony in both the family and the firm. Due to the stable relationships among family members, well-functioning families are also assumed to have more balanced and positive emotions that positively affect the level of emotional attachment in family firms. In family SMEs, "the interpersonal linkages, emotional bondings and affectionate ties that characterize all firms are possibly more complex and embedded" <ref type="bibr">(Fletcher, 2000, p. 164)</ref>, which may enhance the positive effect of family functionality on emotional attachment.</p><p>Well-functioning families with stable relationships and common interests enjoy a sense of continuity, since the level of conflict is low and the level of satisfaction is high. Such sense of continuity and the associated aspiration for the preservation of the firm and family wealth in the long-run can manifest in the family's desire for intra-family succession, which is typically a major goal of family firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chua, Chrisman, and Sharma, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zellweger et al., 2012)</ref>. Often, firm-owning families are eager to maintain their wealth and keep the firm in family hands for generations. This symbolizes the family's heritage and tradition <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Casson, 1999)</ref>, and long-term investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Berrone et al., 2010)</ref>. Hence, family functionality leads to strong family bonds that become a means of establishing family commitment and responsibility, and advance the family agenda across several generations.</p><p>In sum, prior research indicates that in family SMEs, greater family functionality ensues from achieving family goals rather than business goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Danes et al., 1999)</ref>.</p><p>H1: In family SMEs, family functionality has a positive impact on the five dimensions of SEW, which are family influence, identification, binding social ties, emotional attachment, and renewal of family bonds.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of Family Influence, Identification and Emotional Attachment on Firm Innovativeness</head><p>Family influence derives from family members' power to control key firm decisions.</p><p>Typically, family members can shape the firms' direction through their involvement in decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Chua et al., 1999)</ref>. Family identification with the firm stems from blurred family-firm boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Stevens et al., 2015)</ref> and the two overlapping value systems. When family members identify with the firm, it may be more difficult for the organization to change and innovate. Family members' emotional attachment <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Lawler, 2001)</ref> results from their shared history and knowledge of past events that influence how family members act at present. The family's emotions may be guided by their purpose to preserve the heritage of shared experiences, thereby influencing key decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Berrone et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">2012)</ref>. The family's substantial influence on decision-making, their strong emotional attachment and identification with the business, and the ensuing desire to keep the firm running across generations may lead family firms to develop a long-term orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Miller and Le Breton-Miller, 2006)</ref>. As innovations are needed for any firm's survival in the long run, such longterm orientation may in turn lead family firms to take the risk of improving their capacity to innovate to preserve their economic and non-economic utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Classen et al., 2014)</ref>. On the other hand, such long-term orientation may lead family members to act cautiously and have a passive attitude towards innovativeness, since engaging in the development of their innovation capacity is risky and may put the firm's survival at stake <ref type="bibr">(De Massis et al., 2015b)</ref>. We argue that the second reasoning prevails for a number of reasons that we detail below.</p><p>First, given the overlap between management and ownership, families that influence, identify with, and are emotionally attached to the firm are more likely to pursue their family agenda rather than make risky innovation decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Gomez-Mejia et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Stanley, 2010)</ref>. Moreover, family members with high family ownership, strong identification with the firm due to the long periods of tenure of family executives <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Zellweger, 2007)</ref>, and intense emotional attachment to the firm, have typically invested most of their wealth in the firm and have the power <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Carney, 2005)</ref> to move the organization in directions that diverge from investing in developing innovation capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Kotlar et al., 2014)</ref>. What is more, family firms represent "the lifeblood of the family" <ref type="bibr">(Kellermanns et al., 2012, p. 89)</ref> and the costs associated with potential business failure due to, for example, the unsuccessful development of innovativeness, often outweigh the benefits of success. Hence, the typically high power of family owners allows them to avoid potentially necessary investments in improving the family firm's capability to identify and seize innovation opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cabrera-Suárez, De Saá-Pérez, and Garcia-Almeida, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Roessl, Fink, and Kraus, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Second, the link between family, firm reputation, and the goal of preserving the family's SEW may again reduce innovativeness, as any harm to the family's and the firm's reputation resulting, for instance, from the unsuccessful development of the capacity to innovate, implies harming their SEW <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Deephouse and Jaskiewicz, 2013)</ref>. High investments in developing the firms' innovativeness may put not only the family's financial wealth at risk, but also its reputation and status. Thus, in such circumstance, innovativeness is likely to decrease (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Craig et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">De Massis et al., 2015b)</ref>. Such behaviors may be especially pronounced in family SMEs, which have distinct command and governance structures (Le Breton- <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Miller and Miller, 2006)</ref>. For example, due to family SMEs' centralized decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Speckbacher and Wentges, 2007)</ref>, owning families are heavily involved in business activities and usually play multiple roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Songini and Gnan, 2015)</ref>. Since active family SME owners have substantial authority over key decisions <ref type="bibr">(De Massis et al., 2013b)</ref>, enabling them to influence firm choices according to their preferences (for instance, preserving their SEW), they can steer the firm towards their preferred, possibly less risky, direction. As an example, although vital for firm innovativeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Naranjo-Valencia, Jiménez-Jiménez, and Sanz-Valle, 2011)</ref>, family SME owners tend to provide little opportunity to develop an organizational culture that cultivates innovation capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Laforet, 2016)</ref>, suggesting a negative effect of owners' risk-aversion on innovativeness in family SMEs.</p><p>Moreover, family SMEs often suffer from a liability of smallness <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Freeman, Carroll, and Hannan, 1983)</ref>. The associated limitations in resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aldrich and Auster, 1986)</ref>, skill, and capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Laforet, 2016)</ref> may deter their innovativeness for at least two reasons linked to family members' influence, identification, and emotional attachment. First, firm-owning families that value family control and influence are likely to show a modest capability to attract non-family managers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Colombo et al., 2014)</ref> and delegate decision-making responsibilities, as this changes the distribution of power. Second, despite facing financial constraints, owning families are skeptical about external financial capital sources, since external investors typically demand involvement in exchange for capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chrisman and Patel, 2012)</ref>, restricting family control and the possibility to advance a particularistic family-oriented agenda <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Sciascia et al., 2015)</ref>. Given these financial restrictions, we argue that families that highly influence their SME's key decisions, identify strongly with and are emotional attached to the SME, make less recourse to external financing. Consequently, a higher overlap between family wealth and firm equity is likely to occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Sciascia et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Sciascia et al. (2015)</ref> show that the firm equity and family wealth overlap is associated with a negative relationship between family ownership and R&amp;D intensity, whereas this relationship turns positive when the overlap is low. Although the authors focus on innovation input (namely, R&amp;D intensity), which differs from innovativeness, it could be argued that, ceteris paribus, higher innovation inputs are likely to lead to a higher capacity to innovate. Their results thus offer further support for the view that family owners are less likely to invest in the development of innovation capacity in the case of blurred family-firm boundaries and a high overlap of family and firm equity.</p><p>In sum, when family members' influence, identification, and emotional attachment are strong, their high power, low family-firm boundaries, and other owning family characteristics affect the SME's innovativeness.</p><p>H2: In family SMEs, family influence, family identification, and emotional attachment reduce firm innovativeness.</p></div>

As such, organized knowledge transfer between the source and recipient (i.e., the predecessor and successor) is crucial for innovativeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cabrera-Suárez et al., 2001)</ref>.

Further, easier transfer of tacit knowledge among family members can ensue from intra-family succession, as predecessor and successor know each other and already have a trustful social relationship.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples</head><p>Our samples were built through two data collection efforts in 2013 and 2015 using an online survey targeted at CEOs and board members of Finnish family firms. The basic population comprised all 348 firms listed in the membership dictionary of the Finnish Family Firms Association ("Perheyritysten liitto" 1 ), the largest network of family firms in Finland.</p><p>The firms in our study had to meet several criteria: they had to be controlled by a dominant family (the majority of voting shares belong to the owner family) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(De Massis et al., 2012)</ref>, be SMEs, and at least 6 years old to show a certain level of maturity. Further, the respondents had to be a member of the owning family to adequately assess family functionality and the existence and relevance of SEW.</p><p>After sending out the questionnaire twice in 2013 with a two-month interval, we received 161 completed questionnaires of family firms disclosing their name. The company names enabled us to access corporate information from the ORBIS/Bureau van Dijk database, a comprehensive corporate information source, and to identify 32 firms with double responses.</p><p>Randomly excluding one of the double responses led to 129 single responses from a corresponding sample of 129 family firms. However, according to our definition, only 118 of the 129 firms are family SMEs and only 116 publish corporate information in the ORBIS/Bureau van Dijk database, leading to a final response rate of 33.33%, which is comparable to other studies of Finish family firms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Mustakallio, Autio, and Zahra, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>In the second data collection in 2015, we received responses from 103 family SMEs.</p><p>In the 2013 sample, 49.1% of respondents are CEOs and 50.9% board members, while in the 2015 sample, 56.3% are CEOs and 43.7% board members. In both samples, the majority of shares of each individual business are in family hands. Regarding the organizational form, most family firms that responded to our survey are private limited liability companies <ref type="bibr">(95.7% in 2013; 95.1% in 2015)</ref>. Furthermore, the family firms in our sample mostly operate in the manufacturing, wholesale, and retail industries. In general, the structure of our samples represents the industry affiliations of the Finnish Family Firms Association members, although manufacturing companies are slightly over-represented and financial and insurance companies marginally under-represented. In the 2013 sample, 81% of respondents are male and 19% female, while in the 2015 sample, 79.6% of respondents are male and 22.4% female. The age of respondents in both samples ranges from 31 to 70 years with an average 51.8 in 2013 and 52.5 in 2015. The average firm size is 66 employees (median: 43 employees) in the 2013 sample and 69 employees (median: 45 employees) in the 2015 sample.

At the firm level, firm age, size and industry affiliation are used as measures, while at the individual level, the age and educational background of respondents are taken into account.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>We used SPSS and AMOS (v. 21.0) as well as the R package 'lavaan' to design and calculate the structural equation model (SEM) with maximum likelihood estimation for the factor and path analyses carried out in two-stages. First, an exploratory factor analysis was undertaken to define and validate the underlying dimensions of each variable (generated by calculating the average score). Second, the model was built and tested for multicollinearity (correlations are all below 0.8, cp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Kennedy, 1992)</ref>, convergent and discriminant validity. Since two samples were used (2013 and 2015) and the respondents may not be the same in both years, we applied a multi-group approach, testing for differences in measurement, intercepts, and means, and statistically compared differences in the structural relationships between 2013 and 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Byrne, 2004)</ref>. Additionally, we integrated five control variables in this model to check for background effects (industry, firm size, firm age, education, and age of respondent).</p><p>Convergent validity was indicated, since Cronbach's Alpha is close to or above 0.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Hair, Black, Babin, and Anderson, 2010)</ref> for all dimensions in both models, while the average variance extracted (AVE) is always above 0.5. The multi-grouped confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) reflecting all latent variables also confirmed discriminant validity, since the square root of AVE is always greater than the largest latent variable correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref>. The differences between both groups were also found insignificant, demonstrating that all items reflect the same constructs in both samples (see Tables <ref type="table">3</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">4) 2 .</ref> - <ref type="figure">------------------------------------------------------------</ref>Insert Tables <ref type="table">3</ref> and<ref type="table">4</ref> about here - <ref type="figure">------------------------------------------------------------</ref>The model fit statistics show a good fit. The ratio of model explanation to parsimony, CMIN/DF, has a value below 3 in both models, which is associated with a good descriptive fit considering the model size <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Kline, 1998)</ref>. Likewise, the lack-of-fit indices RMSEA (should be &lt; .07) and SRMR (&lt; .09), as well as the goodness-of-fit indices CFI and IFI (both &gt; .95), indicate a sufficiently fitting multi-group model <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Hu and Bentler, 1999)</ref>. Potential response bias was evaluated by comparing the composition of early and late respondents <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Churchill, 1991)</ref>.

(2003)</ref>, offering all respondents anonymity and confidentiality during data collection. Further, we asked the respondents to answer the questions as truthfully as possible and highlighted in the cover letter that there were no right or wrong answers. Using the singlecommon-method-factor approach, we tested for the presence of common method bias. To do so, we estimated two CFAs (a, b) for each sample <ref type="bibr">(2013,</ref><ref type="bibr">2015)</ref> that (a) excluded versus (b) included a latent common method bias variable with all indicators loading on it, comparing both to the structural parameters (correlations) between the present latent variables. Following the assumption that a statistical difference would indicate that the 'method' component is substantial compared to the 'trait' component <ref type="bibr">(Podsakoff et al., 2003, p. 891)</ref>, we then tested all correlations between models (a) and (b) for differences. In both years, all differences are non-significant (largest difference in 2013 between family bonding social ties and family functionality, 0.32 [a] to 0.41 [b], t = .74, p = 0.39; largest difference in 2015 between emotional attachment and family identification, 0.56 [a] to 0.52 [b], t = 0.16, p = 0.70). Further, looking at this latent factor, only 2.5% and 2.78% of total variance is observed in the 2013 sample and the 2015 sample respectively if accounting for the theoretical and common method factor simultaneously. Overall, a substantial common method bias is highly unlikely. In addition, we made use of the double responses in the 2013 sample by rotating the respondent of the dependent and independent variables. We found no significant differences regarding either the results or the goodness of fit statistics. Considering the endogenous variables, the double responses are strongly correlated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Socioemotional Wealth and Innovativeness in Family SMEs</head><p>Differences prevailed in the effect of each SEW dimension on innovativeness. Among the assumed negative predictors of innovativeness (H2), only identification with the firm was found as expected. Contrarily, family members' influence on the firm did not show any significant effect, and emotional attachment was found to have a strong significant effect on family firm innovativeness, but in the opposite direction (positive). This supports the assumption that a high degree of identification with the firm promotes an inclination towards risk aversion. Regarding the positive effects on innovativeness (H3), our findings show the expected direction and effect for binding social ties and renewal of family bonds.</p><p>In summary, although we do not find full support for H2, hypotheses H1 and H3 are confirmed. Some supplementary results should be highlighted. First, the differences between the results on the 2013 and 2015 samples indicate that the influence of family functionality on binding social ties is weaker in the 2015 sample compared to the 2013 sample (0.38 instead of 0.48, difference p &lt; .05). However, the impact of binding social ties improves in the 2015 sample (2015: 0.39, 2013: 0.24, p &lt; .05). Second, the robustness checks comparing the models with and without control variables, the robust estimates, and the factor score-based bootstrapped regressions, all indicate that neither the control variables nor the estimation methods altered our findings in the 2013 and the 2015 samples. Firm age increased innovativeness in the 2015 sample (.29), however, the Wald difference test (t(1) = 1.13, p &gt; .05) rejected a significant difference 3 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study explores the relationship between family functionality, SEW, and innovativeness in family SMEs. The findings show (1) a strongly positive and significant link between family functionality and the five SEW variables, and (2) a significant link (positive and negative) between four of the five SEW variables and innovativeness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Family Functionality and Socioemotional Wealth</head><p>The results show a positive relation between family functionality and SEW. This implies that if the SME-owning family is satisfied with the general conditions prevailing in the family, including stable intra-familial relationships, common interests, and mutual understanding, amongst others, the focus on SEW is enhanced. Thus, family functionality in terms of integrity and strong, well-functioning, and satisfying family relationships determines how family members act as owners <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Stevens et al., 2015)</ref>, on which priorities they focus, and the extent to which they can achieve family goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Danes et al., 1999)</ref>. This is consistent with pioneering research in structural-functional theory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Popenoe, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Johnson, 1971)</ref> and family system theory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Danes et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Stafford et al., 1999)</ref> arguing that the family's functional integrity and the stability of relationships within the family system are important in shaping the priority and behavior of key family members and, ultimately, of the family firm in case of firm-controlling families. This responds to recent calls to draw on family science and take into account family functioning and family member relationships to advance current knowledge of family firm behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Jaskiewicz and Dyer, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jaskiewicz et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Emotional attachment shows the strongest link with family functionality, while influence, identification, binding social ties, and renewal of family bonds, are all relatively equally strong. This finding may relate to the strong interrelatedness of the family, its emotions and culture with the firm, its activities and decision-making, since the firm's organizational culture is strongly affected by the family's emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ashforth and Humphrey, 1995)</ref> and culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Litz and Kleysen, 2001)</ref>. As the family-firm boundaries are often blurred <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cennamo et al., 2012)</ref>, affective considerations and family values are transferred to the firm, leading to higher value congruence. Such value congruence refers to the extent to which individuals perceive similar organizational values (O' <ref type="bibr">Reilly and Chatman, 1991)</ref>, which leads to a more cohesive culture, consistent and common expectations of behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Quinn and Rohrbaugh, 1983)</ref>, and a shared vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Khazanchi, Lewis, and Boyer, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Socioemotional Wealth and Innovativeness</head><p>Generally, family firm innovativeness is determined by the family's propensity to preserve SEW given that family identification with the firm, binding social ties, emotional attachment, and renewal of family bonds exert a significant influence on family firm innovativeness. The family's identification with the firm negatively affects firm innovativeness. Blurred family-firm boundaries can thus hamper firms' capacity to innovate, since risk-aversion may result in more conservative and careful decisions when the identification of family members with the firm is high <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Cucculelli, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>However, in contrast to H2, the family's emotional attachment stemming from shared experiences, values, and wealth, shows the strongest positive effect on family SME innovativeness. This positive relationship may derive from the family's desire to preserve its heritage over a long time. It could be argued that family members with strong emotional attachment to the firm tend to feel more responsible and committed to the firm and its longterm success, which outweigh the potential risks of innovation, including the risk of business failure due to unsuccessful innovations. This finding is in line with research suggesting that responsibility and commitment can motivate family members to act in the firm's best interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Corbetta and Salvato, 2004)</ref>, which can support the fulfillment of organizational goals and improve firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Davis, Schoorman, and Donaldson, 1997)</ref>. As innovativeness is known for its positive effect on firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hult et al., 2004)</ref>, firm-owning families with strong emotional attachment to the business may recognize the importance of their capacity to engage in innovation.</p><p>Binding social ties and the desire to renew family bonds positively affect innovativeness.</p><p>Binding social ties are the foundation of well-functioning networks with internal and external stakeholders. Strong social ties within a business facilitate the internal exchange and expansion of tacit knowledge, a vital ingredient for firm innovativeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Sirmon and Hitt, 2003)</ref>. As a consequence, the ability to learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Fernandes and Ussman, 2013)</ref> is promoted in terms of formal and informal learning processes that are advantageous for family firm innovativeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Laforet, 2013)</ref>, requiring a strong relation among family members, but also with and among employees.</p><p>Hence, the firm's social ties are important determinants of innovative behavior and can eventually lead to high innovativeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Spriggs et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The ability to transfer family firm specific knowledge through intra-family succession supports innovativeness, as the firm can reap the benefits of the potential value of past knowledge over generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Messeni Petruzzelli and Albino, 2012)</ref>. Through the close link between the present and the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Zellweger and Sieger, 2012)</ref>, tacit knowledge, organizational practices and processes, as well as the family's shared values, norms, and beliefs are transferred across generations <ref type="bibr">(De Massis et al., 2016a)</ref>. Due to the importance of tacit knowledge, it is vital for family firms to ensure that such knowledge is shared and combined through trusted and close-knit relationships associated with intra-family succession <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Sirmon and Hitt, 2003)</ref>. Accordingly, we echo recent calls to investigate innovation issues across generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barczak, 2014)</ref> and encourage scholars to conduct such investigations in family firms where the temporal dimension may play an important role <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Sharma, Salvato, and Reay, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, the rejection of family influence as a negative correlate of innovativeness is an interesting "non-result" <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bettis et al., 2014)</ref>, suggesting that the relationship is more complex than hypothesized. For example, there may be other underlying considerations associated with family influence working in a positive direction. Similarly to emotional attachment, family influence through the family members' involvement in decision-making may positively affect innovativeness when the family strives to maintain its legacy in the long-run and recognizes the key role of the capacity to innovate in their firm's long-term performance. Thus, firms may be willing to accept the risks of developing their innovativeness to maintain their economic and non-economic wealth <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Classen et al., 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Kellermanns et al. (2012)</ref> argue that family influence can help family firms benefit from their capacity to innovate. Accordingly, family influence may improve the firm's quality of decision making and risk management <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(March and Shapira, 1987)</ref>, as well as the ability to identify and evaluate the firm's opportunities and challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Zahra, 2005)</ref>. This positive effect and the negative effect we proposed may have produced the insignificant net effect observed. This conjecture to explain the insignificant effect of family influence, although intuitively plausible, would seem to diverge from the consistent body of research showing that family influence affects innovation inputs and outputs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Matzler et al., 2015)</ref>. Understanding whether and why such effect disappears when we shift our attention from innovation inputs/outputs to innovativeness is an area that warrants future investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>Our study contributes to family firm research and particularly to the flourishing literature on family firm innovation <ref type="bibr">(Chrisman et al., 2015b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Duran et al., 2015)</ref>. Despite the multidimensional nature of SEW and the potential effects of its five dimensions, prior research largely treats SEW as a unidimensional construct. In particular, while the five SEW dimensions enjoy acceptance in family firm literature, empirical studies examining the effect of each dimension are scarce <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Miller and Le Breton-Miller, 2014)</ref>. Some scholars argue that this simplistic approach engenders theoretical limitations and empirical indeterminacy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Chua et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Schulze and Kellermanns, 2015)</ref>. By including the effect of the different SEW dimensions and responding to recent calls to distinguish the SEW dimensions to accurately predict family firm behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chua et al., 2015)</ref>, we provide a more fine-grained understanding of the mechanisms behind family firm innovativeness and contribute to addressing key theoretical and empirical issues in prior SEW research.</p><p>The enhanced understanding of the role of family functionality and the SEW dimensions in shaping firms' innovativeness can reconcile the mixed findings in prior family firm innovation literature focusing primarily on innovation inputs and outputs <ref type="bibr">(De Massis et al., 2013a)</ref>. Thus, our study points to the risks of neglecting the family's functional integrity and stability of relationships among family members to fully understand family firm behavior, and responds to recent calls to include an examination of the family and its heterogeneity to enrich current family firm research <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Jaskiewicz and Dyer, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jaskiewicz et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial implications</head><p>Our findings are also important for practice because innovativeness is vital for the long-term survival of any firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hult et al., 2004)</ref>. By adding to our understanding of the SEW dimensions that lead to a greater or lesser capacity to innovate, and the positive effect of family functionality on such SEW dimensions, our findings provide family SMEs' owners, managers, and consultants with a practical way to help shape their firms' innovativeness. For instance, even in the presence of well-functioning families, family members should beware that a higher degree of identification of family members with the firm will likely result in lower innovativeness. As such, family firm practitioners could sensitize family members to circumvent self-presentation and the external expression of pride, or implement practices aimed at educating family members to distinguish family aspects from business aspects so as to reduce viewing the family business success as their own. Conversely, the pursuit of other family-centered non-economic goals, such as binding social ties, emotional attachment of family members to the firm, and renewal of family bonds through intra-family succession, helps increase innovativeness. As such, they could benefit from determining generally valid codes of conduct and creating the prerequisites for trustful relationships and norms of reciprocity, as well as from establishing internal principles to help maintain a positive selfconcept and defining how the welfare of family members is protected. Moreover, open crossgenerational dialog, consensus on the long-term direction, explicit succession regulations, and clear distribution of decision-making power, family control, and independence, in addition to preserving the family legacy and traditions, foster innovativeness across generations. Last, our study's findings caution practitioners to reflect more deeply on the functioning of their families as a critical management lever to influence the pursuit of family-centered non-economic goals and, in turn, the firm's innovativeness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research Directions</head><p>As with all studies, ours has limitations, which also provide opportunities for future research.</p><p>First, our analysis of Finnish firms restricts the generalizability of our findings in a global context. Previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Mustakallio et al., 2002)</ref> highlight that Finnish firms have unique ownership and governance structures that are strongly shaped by their local culture. Furthermore, differences in cultures, economic development, and legal regimes may influence both the effect of family functionality on the SEW dimensions and the effect of the SEW dimensions on innovativeness <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Gedajlovic et al., 2012)</ref>. Hence, the analyzed relationships may change across countries given that innovation-related processes and capabilities can be bound to cultural contingencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Hayton, George, and Zahra, 2002)</ref>. Additionally, variations over time are possible. Future research could apply our model across different countries, especially those with divergent cultures, economic development stages, and legal regimes, and over multiple years, ideally by employing a longitudinal design.</p><p>Second, the SEW priorities of individuals may vary, even among members of the same family <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chua et al., 2015)</ref>. Although our double respondents' answers indicated a low variance of SEW priorities within the family, we were unable to take into account the net effects of the different SEW dimensions. Therefore, we invite scholars to develop more sophisticated research designs that account for how the five SEW dimensions may affect each other, and whether such mutual influences should be modeled as dependent or interdependent.</p><p>Third, we analyzed the relationships in the context of family SMEs. As such, our findings may not be generalizable to large family firms, and future research is needed to determine whether the linkages and obtained insights differ in large family firms.</p><p>Fourth, our study focuses on family firm capacity to innovate, which may vary depending on the type of innovation considered. For instance, this capacity may change depending on the radical versus incremental, disruptive versus sustaining, and exploratory versus exploitative nature of the innovation. We thus welcome future research that explicitly includes innovation types when studying family firm innovativeness. Further, we focus on product and service innovation, whereas future research could also examine process, organizational, and business model innovation.</p><p>Moreover, prior scholars acknowledge the heterogeneity among families <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aldrich and Cliff, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Olson et al., 2003)</ref>. Yet, the integration of prevalent family differences in theory building and empirical testing in the context of family firms is still in its infancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Danes, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">James, Jennings, and Breitkreuz, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Powell et al., 2017)</ref> and scholars commonly apply management theories that include neither the family nor its heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Jaskiewicz and Dyer, 2017)</ref>. We therefore envisage future studies on family firm innovativeness aimed at capturing further sources of heterogeneity among different families.</p><p>Finally, there may be other factors that affect innovativeness in family SMEs, including imminence of succession <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Chua, Chrisman, and Sharma, 2003)</ref> and family firm incumbents' attitude towards intra-family succession <ref type="bibr">(De Massis et al., 2016b)</ref>. These factors suggest additional ways in which family functionality and family owners' non-economic goals affect family firms' capacity to innovate.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Smilkstein, 1978)</ref> I) I am satisfied with the help that I receive from my family when something is troubling me II) I am satisfied with the way my family discusses items of common interest and solves problems III) I am satisfied with the way my family expresses affection and responds to my feelings, such as anger, sorrow, and love Influence on the Family Firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berrone et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cennamo et al., 2012)</ref> I) The majority of shares in the family business are owned by family members II) In the family business, most executive positions are occupied by family members III) The board of directors is mainly composed of family members</p></div>

In order to do so, six different models were estimated ranging from one to six factors aligning dimensions based on the results of previously conducted maximum likelihood explorative factor analyses (promax rotation) with the same number of dimensions. Overall model fit confirmed the five-dimensional model (e.g., CFI2013 = .97, CFI2015 = .95, SRMR2013 = .05, SRMR2015 = .05) and illustrated no issues regarding convergent or discriminant validity.</p><p>3 Robustness was assessed to safeguard against methodological issues. First, firm age, firm size, industry (dummy variables), age and education (dummy variables) were deployed as manifest variables and correlated with all other measures <ref type="bibr">(for 2013 and 2015)</ref>. This alternative specification of multi-group model was applied to both datasets in order to investigate background effects not captured before. Second, Huber-White robust standard error estimates were used in the multi-group models to check whether unequal error variances biased our results. Third, factor scores for each latent variable were obtained from the multi-group models and used in bootstrapped regressions (5,000 replications) for both years for the purpose of exploring possible inappropriateness of structural equation modeling for the given sample sizes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><graphic coords="15,68.05,206.05,458.85,323.75" type="bitmap" /></figure>
