<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The daily schedule of millions of people in the world is divided between the time they spent at work and the time outside work. Academicians have studied the interaction between those two domains for the last decades, what has been called work-life or work-family literature. The seminal paper of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Greenhaus and Beutell (1985)</ref> defined work-family conflict as "a form of interrole conflict in which the role pressures from the work and family domains are mutually incompatible in some respect". Although the field initially focused on the conflict that heavy work demands could generate on the family sphere, it rapidly evolved into the study of the bidirectional relationship, with studies taking into consideration both, work to family conflict and family to work conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Frone et al., 1992b)</ref>. More recently, literature has spanned its scope to consider not only the conflict that may arise between the demands of work and family, but also the enrichment that these two domains might generate on each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Greenhaus and Powell, 2006)</ref> and the advantages of achieving a certain equilibrium between the two <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jain and Nair, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The terms work-life balance and work-family balance have been used interchangeably in the literature. In this article, we will use both of them, however it is important to underline that as our study is concerned about the equilibrium between work and any type of activities external to work, whether they are leisure activities, family time or others.</p><p>The antecedents and consequences of work-life conflict and work-life balance have been widely studied. The lack of company policies that enable work-life balance or the particular employees' family and work demands have been identified as antecedents of worklife conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Saltzstein et al., 2001)</ref>. And, at the same time, consequences of work-family conflict have multiple impacts in both life and work. Some of the consequences most widely studied are the impact of work-family conflict on job satisfaction and turnover intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kossek and Ozeki, 1998)</ref> as well as the impact of work-family conflict on employee health <ref type="bibr">(Frone et al., 1992a)</ref>.</p><p>Although the company-wide organization policies and other factors at the organizational level like organizational climate or culture do have an impact on employee worklife balance, the factors that have stronger influence are those related to the closer environment of the employee in the organization. Studies at the employee-level analysis show that colleagues and the employee's direct supervisor have a crucial role in the employee experience of work-life conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Wu et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baral and Bhargava (2010)</ref> confirm the importance of supervisor support for work-life balance, and <ref type="bibr">Beham and Drobnic (2010)</ref> that of colleagues. Autonomy is also one of the strongest antecedents <ref type="bibr">(Morganson et al., 2010, Annink and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">den Dulk, 2012)</ref>; if the employee has autonomy in terms of schedule and in organizing his/her work, the conflict is mitigated.</p><p>Scales and questionnaires used for measuring work-family balance and work-family conflict usually include questions about supervisor support and colleague support. However, a global measure of work-family balance is then calculated without differentiating those two levels: support from the employer and support from the other employees. In the present research we do differentiate between employer and employee work-life balance support. Results show that employer work-life balance support is an antecedent of colleagues' work-life balance support. Autonomy has been also included in the analysis as previous research has shown its importance in employees' ability to achieve work-life balance. Some of the studies on work-life conflict have focused on women <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hoobler et al., 2009)</ref> or employees' with family responsibilities assuming that only those with a certain level of conflict between the two domains work and family, would really value family friendly policies, have a decrease in job satisfaction or change in turnover intentions. In this research, we would like to broaden the scope and we consider that an organization which enables employees balance their work and personal life, will be considered a better organization not only by the employees that need this balance but also by those that do not need it. The organization that facilitates work-life balance will increase job satisfaction via the creation of a positive climate and an increase in organizational pride in all employees. Research on the consequences of attitudinal organizational pride suggested a significant and positive relationship between pride and job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gunter and Furnham, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>The objective of this study therefore is to explore the relationship between autonomy, employer work-life balance support and employee work-life balance support, and its relation with organizational pride and job satisfaction. We explore if better work-life balance perception increases organizational pride and job satisfaction.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the background and the hypothesis.</p><p>Then, the methodology is described and results from the analysis are presented. Finally the discussion and contributions of the paper are explained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background and hypothesis</head><p>Currently, managing conflict between work and life is a big challenge for organizations and individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kossek and Ozeki, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Zhang et al., 2012)</ref>. Previous research shows that abusive supervision is related to higher levels of work-family conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Tepper, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Tepper, , 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Tepper, , 2011;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wu et al., 2012)</ref> in US and Western cultures. As opposite to this concept, individual or group autonomy have long been considered critical dimensions of a good organizational climate.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hong and Kaur (2008)</ref> organizational climate is defined as a global impression of one's organization and personal impact of the work environment, and also, it describes the perception of employees towards their organizations. Autonomy is one of the most used variables in the organizational climate construct (e.g. <ref type="bibr">James et al., 1974, Koys and</ref><ref type="bibr">DeCotiis, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Patterson et al., 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Patterson et al., (2005)</ref> define autonomy as "designing jobs in ways which give employees wide scope to enact work". Autonomy reproduces the extent to which job permit self-determination, freedom to organize their own work or make decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hackman and Oldham, 1975)</ref>. Increased autonomy will allow employees more flexibility in how, where or when they define their daily work <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Morgeson et al., 2005)</ref>.Many companies have a culture that employees are participative decision-making (for example, set their own schedules, choose how to do their work or even elect to work from home). The perception of autonomy has positive effects on employees and enhances their motivation and productivity.</p><p>Autonomy seems to be a relevant characteristic, enabling employees to balance their work more easily with others social and personal activities <ref type="bibr">(Annink and den Dulk, 2012)</ref>. In this sense, autonomy in decision-making process implies low levels of work-life conflict because employees have the possibility to choose the best way to work. As a result, we suggest that employees who have autonomy are likely to experience high levels of work-life balance. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>):</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1. Autonomy will be positively related to employee work-life balance.</head><p>As we say before, in our research we have differentiated between employer support and employee work-life balance support. According to <ref type="bibr">Saltztein et al., (2001)</ref> work-family policies have different impact in different groups of employees. So, it is relevant study in a different way employer and employee support. Supervisor support assessed positive affect of each subordinate <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baral and Bhargava, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Bosses' perception on employee work-family conflict plays an important role in employee career's progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hoobler et al., 2009)</ref>. They found that manager's perception of employees' work-life conflict influenced the bosses' perception of fit and performance. These results suggested that supervisor perception of family-work conflict mediate the relation between employees and its satisfaction. We can hope that employer support is actually an antecedent of colleagues' support. Based on previous research and experience, the following hypothesis can be made (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>):</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2. Employer work-life balance will be positively related to employee work-life balance.</head><p>One of manager's challenges is to motivate employees to take pride of their work. CHA report <ref type="bibr">(2004)</ref> states that it is possible to develop a stable inner pride attitude towards the organization for they work. Pride can be considered an emotion <ref type="bibr">(Elfenbein, 2007)</ref> but previous research consider pride as a construct grounded in employee group membership <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arnett et al., 2002)</ref>. Although this construct has not yet achieved large scientific attention, organizational pride is an important factor for business success <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gouthier and Rhein, 2011)</ref>. Organizational pride positively influences the decision to stay in a particular company and stimulates the employee commitment <ref type="bibr">(Appleberg, 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gunter and Furnham (1996)</ref> has divided organizational pride into emotional versus attitudinal organizational pride. Emotional organizational pride is defined as the affective emotions based on the perception of a successful event related to the organization. Attitudinal pride is defined as a cognitive and durable attitude of pride resulting from general perception of the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gouthier and Rhein 2011)</ref>. We argue here that an organization that both, supervisors and colleagues provide support to employees' work-life balance will enhance organizational pride among employees' that will result on higher job satisfaction. Specifically, work-family balance initiatives can cause strong pride emotions to employees. Hence, we propose that (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>):</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3.Employee work-life balance will be positively related to organizational pride</head><p>Research on organizational pride has shown the impact of pride on job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arnett et al., 2002)</ref>. Research on the consequences of attitudinal organizational pride suggested a significant and positive relationship between pride and employee behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gouthier and Rhein, 2011)</ref>. Organizational pride enhances commitment to customer service, enthusiasm or creativity. In addition, employees who are identified and proud to work in a company are also satisfied of their job <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Porter et al., 1974</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Hom and Kinicki, 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, Van Dick et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Motivation and job satisfaction are frequent concepts used to present a framework through which companies can affect to their employees' drive to work and increase their interesting and passion towards their work <ref type="bibr">(Furnham et al., 2008)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Crossman and Abou-Zaki (2003)</ref> job satisfaction is one criterion for assessing the health of an organization. Based on the foregoing, we suggest that (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>): H4.Organizational pride will be positively related to job satisfaction.</p><p>---Insert Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> about here ---</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and procedure</head><p>Study participants were employees of a company working in the pharmaceutical industry in Spain. In order to ensure that respondents would be able to understand all the questions included in the survey, a pilot test was conducted. To this end, five employees from different hierarchical levels in the organization were randomly chosen. They were asked to complete the survey individually and to provide feedback in regard to the meaningfulness of the language used as the questionnaire was designed for all levels of the workforce. The emphasis at this early stage was to enhance readability and clarity of the questions. Based on their comments, changes were made to strengthen the accuracy of the survey by deleting troublesome items and rewording items that were confusing to the respondents.</p><p>For the final test, all respondents were informed that their participation was totally voluntary, and that no names or identifying information was required. The first page contained an explanation of the purpose of the study (stressing the importance of answering all questions honestly), the estimated time for completing it (about 10-15 minutes), as well as a promise that any information provided would remain confidential. In addition, respondents provided information about their department, job position, seniority within the company and work shift.</p><p>The filed work was completed in March 2013. To maximize responses rates, both an online and a paper-and-pencil format questionnaire were made available to employees. The questionnaire was sent out to employees at their place of work in personally addresses and with a link to an on-line questionnaire. Altogether, 463 surveys were administered. Returned questionnaires were manually checked against protest responses or those with more than 2 unanswered items. Missing data points were imputed with the mean of nearby points in each case. After discarding some incomplete questionnaires, 374 valid surveys remained for analysis (response rate of 80.78%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>All items in the survey were presented as statements to which respondents indicated their level of agreement/disagreement on a four-point Likert scale of (1) definitely false; (2) mostly false;</p><p>(3) mostly true, an (4) definitely true. This rating scale has been recommended to minimize ambivalent neutral ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lynn, 1986</ref><ref type="bibr">, cited in Thrush et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The questionnaire was based on an extensive review of the relevant literature. Items in the scales were originally in English. A back translation process was used to ensure the quality of the measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brislin et al., 1973)</ref>.</p><p>Five dimensions were considered: autonomy, organizational pride, satisfaction, employer work-life family balance and employee work-life family balance. For the first three dimensions adaptation of validated scales were used. This method is shorter and less-time consuming and the utilizations of existing measures often lead to increased refinement and improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fields, 2002)</ref>. Only for those dimensions related to work-life family balance, new scales were generated. A further explanation of each construct follows below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Autonomy</head><p>Autonomy was operationalized by using the construct with the same name from the scale on organizational climate (the Organizational Climate Measure, OCM) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Patterson et al. (2005)</ref>, which in turn is based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Quinn and Rohrbaugh's (1981)</ref> Competing Values Model (CVM). We only included the first two items from the original scale, excluding reverse items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Organizational pride</head><p>Organizational pride was measured by using the "attitudinal organizational pride" scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gouthier and Rhein (2011)</ref>. One item was eliminated from the original scale ("I feel proud to contribute to my company's success") because we assumed that the underlying aspect of this question goes beyond our interpretation of organizational pride, as it entails a more comprehensive definition, including here economic challenges. Contrary, our interest is more focused on individuals and their internal emotions and feelings that may contribute to explain job satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Job satisfaction</head><p>Job satisfaction was assessed using a single-item overall measure. According the <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dolbier et al. (2005)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Nagy (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wanous et al. (1997)</ref>, from a psychometric perspective, single-item measures to operationalize this construct compare favorably with multiple-item measures. First, their reliability and validity have been proved, being demonstrated that they provide an effective measure to represent job satisfaction. Second, they are easier to understand, are completed more quickly, and change scores are more interpretable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Employer work-life family balance support</head><p>Literature provides very little evidence on how to measure work-life balance form the viewpoint of the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carlson et al., 2013)</ref>. For the purpose of this study, focused on the central figure of the employee, we included one factor able to reflect this aspect, which is expected to impact on employees' perceptions about their job, and thus, in job satisfaction. The approach used considers two items where employees were asked to evaluate the position of the company and their managers with respect to work-life balance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Employee work-life family balance support</head><p>The scale used to evaluate work-life balance was built upon the work-life family scales of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hayman (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gröpel and Kuhl (2009)</ref>. Three items were included: the first one considers work interference with personal life, that is, the feasibility (whether it is very difficult or not) of maintaining relationships and social contacts (with family and friends). Second item takes into account the perceived sufficiency of time, asking respondents about their routines and the need to work extra hours to complete the assigned tasks. Lastly, a third item was included in order to account for time spent in recreation activities.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows how items were arranged in the 5 aforementioned constructs and their loadings.</p><p>---Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> about here ---</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The analysis consisted of a two-step process. First, we assessed the validity and reliability of the measurement scale using confirmatory factor analysis. Second, causal relationships (hypotheses) were tested using structural equation modeling. The data were analyzed using EQS, a software package.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of fit</head><p>The dimensional scales for each of the multi-item constructs were first evaluated. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bagozzi and Yi (1988)</ref>, factor loadings should be 0.60 or higher. Since the lowest factor loading in our model is 0.671, there is support for convergent validity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Reliability of the constructs was then evaluated. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> reports that both the Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability (CR) exceeding the threshold value of 0.6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Malhotra, 2004)</ref>, indicating good internal consistency among the items within each dimension.</p><p>The variance-extracted measures (AVE) for each construct were also estimated, surpassed or being very close to the recommended cut-off value of 0.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>---Insert Table 2 about here ---</head><p>The correlation results presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> further corroborates that the square root of the AVE (shown in italic in the diagonal) of each of the scales was greater than the correlations between each construct and all other latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hair et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>---Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> about here ---</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Causal model</head><p>The overall validity of the model was evaluated with respect to best-fit indices:  2 Satorra-Bentler was 80.2009 with 29 degrees of freedom and a p-value of 0.0000, being  2 /df 2.76, which is clearly below the limit of 5. Both CFI (0.948) surpassing 0.9 and RMSEA (0.069) below 0.08 indicate good fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hu and Bentler, 1998)</ref>. Taking the significance of the robust  2 statistic with caution, and considering the above fit indices the model fit was suggested to be acceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bollen and Long, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>---Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> about here ---Hypotheses 2 to 4 were confirmed at a confidence level of 99%, while hypothesis 1 was accepted at a confidence level of 95%. These results underline the appropriateness of the proposed model.</p><p>Particularly, our findings show that autonomy affects employee work-life balance (=0.252), supporting the first hypothesis. This last factor is also explained by employer worklife balance with a stronger effect than the previous one (=0.648), validating H2. Results also support hypothesis 3, stating that employee work-life balance is positively related to higher levels of organizational pride (=0.581). In turn, this factor positively influences job satisfaction (=0.405), thus confirming hypothesis 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and contributions</head><p>The present study sought to expand our understanding of job autonomy, work-life balance, organizational pride and job satisfaction. First, autonomy in decision-making allows employees to have flexibility in managing their time and work. This freedom will help to balance in a good manner time spent in the job and in family or leisure activities. This balance has mutual profit and synergies to workers and to the organization. So, autonomy will allow employees more flexibility in their daily work, increasing the level of work-life balance.</p><p>Results also suggest the distinction between employer and employee work-life balance support. This perspective helps us to analyze if employer support affects employee work-life balance support. The perspective top-down it is important to be considered as an antecedent of a real work-life balance. If managers believe and support all the work-life initiatives it is easier for workers to perceive a high level of work-life balance.</p><p>Our results extend previous work-family research focused on the employee work outcomes, that is, that employee work-life balance is related to organizational pride. Although pride sentiment has been linked to constructs such as organizational commitment or job involvement, very few studies in the field of work-life balance literature included it. Our results seem to indicate that employees that feel comfortable in their job and have effective work-life balance, are proud to work for their companies. This affect is a strong and perdurable feeling that enhances employee's satisfaction.</p><p>The originality of our research can be outlined in three main contributions. First, it offers a model which shows the relations between variables related to work-life balance and organizational pride. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carlson et al. (2013)</ref> the major gap in the work-family research is the absence of theoretical foundations that link work-life balance to organizational gaps. Research on these constructs is an original contribution because no literature has paid enough attention at these relations. We extend our understanding of the consequences of worklife balance by examining whether employee work-life balance fosters organizational pride.</p><p>Second, traditionally, work-life conflict was studied by considering the bidirectional relation between work and life conflict, that is, work can interfere with family, and family can interfere with work <ref type="bibr">(Frone et al., 1992a)</ref>. In our research we propose an original classification depending on the organizational perspective: top down (employer) and bottom up (employee).</p><p>Although this paper provides an original contribution to the existing literature, further research efforts are needed in order to better understand how these two constructs interact, in order to improve how work-life balance can be correctly managed.</p><p>Finally, the theoretical model proposed has broadened the antecedents and consequences of work-life balance research. Specifically, we identify autonomy as an antecedent that exerts a significant influence on employee work-life balance. Also, employee work-life balance has been found to be an antecedent of organizational pride, and this last one, an antecedent of job satisfaction.</p><p>In conclusion, our study empirically supports the relationship between job autonomy, work-life balance, organizational pride and job satisfaction. We believe that this study provides a useful measurement model that employers and employees can use to evaluate and improve work-life balance. Companies should pay attention to job autonomy and work-life balance in order to enhance organizational pride and job satisfaction. Our research tries to help companies more effectively use their human capital resources.  People are enthusiastic about their work <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dolbier et al.
