<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study examined the componential structure of second-language (L2) speaking profi ciency. Participants-181 L2 and 54 native speakers of Dutch-performed eight speaking tasks and six tasks tapping nine linguistic skills. Performance in the speaking tasks was rated on functional adequacy by a panel of judges and formed the dependent variable in subsequent analyses (structural equation modeling). The following independent variables were assessed separately: linguistic knowledge in two tests (vocabulary and grammar); linguistic processing skills (four reaction time measures obtained in three tasks: picture naming, delayed picture naming, and sentence building); and pronunciation skills (speech sounds, word stress, and intonation). All linguistic skills, with the exception of two articulation measures in the delayed picture naming task, were signifi cantly and substantially related to functional adequacy of speaking, explaining 76% of the variance. This provides substantial evidence for a componential view of L2 speaking profi ciency that consists of languageknowledge and language-processing components. The componential structure of speaking profi ciency was almost identical for the 40% of participants at the lower and the 40% of participants at the higher end This research was funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientifi c Research by a grant awarded to Hulstijn and Schoonen (NWO grant 254-70-030).

Some speak slowly, others fast; some articulate poorly, others well; the speech of some is characterized by a high incidence of short utterances, false starts, and self corrections, and the speech of others is characterized by long and fl awless utterances <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Levelt, 1989</ref> ). Such differences are also likely to show up in the speech of second language (L2) speakers. Compared to L1 speakers, however, L2 speakers encounter more problems in fi nding the right words, in giving their utterances the correct morphosyntactic form, and in articulating their utterances correctly and fl uently <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kormos, 2006 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Poulisse, 1999 )</ref>. This study aims to explore the componential structure of speaking profi ciency of L2 learners at intermediate and advanced levels of L2 proficiency. In other words, this study is concerned with a fundamental issue, which has to be addressed prior to any practical matters, such as the assessment of L2 learners' profi ciency <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Schoonen, 2011 )</ref>. Previous research on the components of L2 speaking profi ciency and the rationale of the current study is presented in the next two sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Previous Research Investigating Components of L2 Speaking Profi ciency</head><p>There have been several studies that aimed to unravel the componential structure of L2 speaking profi ciency. Two general approaches can broadly be distinguished, labeled here as the subjective-subjective and the subjective-objective approach. In the subjective-subjective approach, global ratings of speaking performances are related to ratings of specifi c features of the same speaking performances, such as fl uency, lexical richness, and grammatical accuracy. In the subjective-objective approach, global ratings of speaking performances are related to objective measurements of lexical, grammatical, and fl uency features of the same performances.</p><p>One of the fi rst studies adopting the subjective-subjective approach was conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams ( 1980 )</ref>. In this study, 834 participants performed the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) oral interview test. FSI testers rated both overall global profi ciency and a number of subskills <ref type="bibr">(accent, comprehension, fl uency, grammar, and vocabulary)</ref>. Adams used discriminant analyses to investigate which subskills contributed mostly to the different levels of global profi ciency. The main factors found to discriminate between the levels were vocabulary and grammar, whereas accent and fl uency discriminated the least. Adams concluded that, at different levels, raters are sensitive to different aspects of performance. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fulcher ( 2003 )</ref> observed, however, no clear pattern of discrimination was found in Adams's study, which makes it diffi cult to theoretically link the discriminating factors to specifi c levels of the FSI descriptors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Higgs and Clifford ( 1982 )</ref> also used the subjective-subjective approach, in an attempt to fi nd evidence for their relative contribution model, which posits a fl uctuating relative importance of subskill factors contributing to global language profi ciency. Fifty foreign-language teachers rated what they perceived to be the relative contribution of subskills for each of the six profi ciency levels of the FSI rating scale (thus, the teachers did not rate actual L2 learner performances). Across global profi ciency ratings, the relative importance of the subskill factors of vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, fl uency, and sociolinguistic ability did indeed vary, with vocabulary being the most important factor at lower levels of profi ciency, and with all factors being equally important at the highest level of profi ciency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">McNamara ( 1990 )</ref> reported on results of the Occupational English Test (OET) for health professionals. Part of this test is a speaking task in which candidates engage in a role-play situation. Trained raters gave judgments-for performances in two sessions (produced by 214 and 233 candidates)-of overall communicative effectiveness, intelligibility, fl uency, comprehension, appropriateness, and resources of grammar and expression. The researcher analyzed the two sessions separately using stepwise regression analysis and found that the rating on overall communicative effectiveness could largely be explained by the variable resources of grammar and expression (68% and 70% of variance explained in the two sessions respectively). The ratings of fl uency, intelligibility, appropriateness, and comprehension each explained some added variance, leading to a total of 78% and 84% of variance explained. McNamara concludes that the construct "resources of grammar and expression" played a crucial role in determining the rating of "overall communicative effectiveness <ref type="bibr">" (p. 62)</ref>.</p><p>In what could also be seen as a subjective-subjective study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">De Jong and Van Ginkel ( 1992 )</ref> asked teachers to rate speaking performances of 25 Dutch speakers of French as a foreign language (prefi nal year in secondary education) on several components as well as on overall speaking profi ciency. Participants carried out separate tasks for pronunciation, sentence completion, picture description, strategic skills, and structured conversation. Performance on the pronunciation task was rated dichotomously (correct or incorrect). Performance on the sentence completion task was rated on a 3-point scale that ranged from meaningless response to meaningful response, almost without errors . Performance on the picture description task was rated with four dichotomous scales: comprehensibility, formal correctness, completeness, and fl uency. In the strategic skills and structured conversation tasks, responses were rated on a 4-point scale of comprehensibility. Finally, raters were asked to provide a global impression of each participant's oral proficiency. This rating for global impression was given after all other sections had been rated, and raters based this impression on participants' performance on the whole test battery. It was found that the relative contribution of subskills varied depending on global rating of proficiency. For low overall profi ciency scores, pronunciation contributed mostly to overall ability, whereas for higher profi ciency scores, all subskills provided an equal contribution to overall proficiency. These results largely supported <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Higgs and Clifford's ( 1982 )</ref> relative contribution model.</p><p>In the subjective-objective approach, expert ratings of overall proficiency in speaking tasks are compared to objective measures of various aspects of performance in those same speaking tasks. Using this approach, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Magnan ( 1988 )</ref> related grammatical errors in transcriptions of 40 oral profi ciency interviews (OPI) to ratings on these interviews and found signifi cant differences in mean percentages of grammatical errors between levels of speaking profi ciency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Douglas ( 1994 )</ref> administered the fi ve-part semidirect AGSPEAK test of speaking profi ciency to six speakers of L2 English with speakers of L1 Slovak. Test performance was rated by two trained raters on comprehensibility, grammar, and pronunciation. Transcripts of test performance were also scored on grammar, vocabulary, and fl uency (type-token ratio) as well as content and rhetorical organization. The researcher then compared the subjective ratings with the objective scores and found little relationship. Because of lack of relevant information, and possibly because of the small sample size too, it is diffi cult to assess the importance of this study.</p><p>A recent subjective-objective approach study was conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Iwashita, Brown, McNamara, and O'Hagan ( 2008 )</ref>. Speaking performances of 200 L2 English speakers on a fi ve-task speaking test, developed by Educational Testing Services (ETS; see Y.-W. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lee, 2005 )</ref>, were holistically rated as well as objectively scored in terms of linguistic resources (grammatical accuracy, grammatical complexity, and vocabulary profi le), phonology (pronunciation, intonation, and rhythm), and fl uency (fi lled and unfi lled pauses, repair, total pausing time, speech rate, and mean length of run). Each performance was rated by two trained ETS staff on a 5-level scale that integrated four criteria: (a) provision of main ideas and supporting details, (b) speech fl uency based on self-generated text (not copied from the stimulus materials), (c) speech intelligibility and listener effort, and (d) appropriate use of grammar and vocabulary. ANOVAs revealed that many but not all of the objective measures (corrected for amount of speech) distinguished between the 5 levels of the holistic rating scale. Signifi cant predictors were vocabulary (type and token), fl uency, grammatical accuracy, and pronunciation. Of these, vocabulary and fl uency (speech rate) seemed particularly important, which was not surprising, because fl uency and vocabulary formed two of the rubrics of the holistic rating scale. The predictors did not distinguish ratings at all adjacent levels of the holistic scale. The researchers interpreted this fi nding as supporting <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Higgs and Clifford's ( 1982 )</ref> claim that not all aspects of speaking profi ciency play an equally important role in the development of L2 speaking skills.</p><p>In sum, studies-whether they take the subjective-subjective or the subjective-objective approach-found signifi cant associations between what might be called subskills or components of speaking profi ciency, on the one hand, and a holistic, overall construct of speaking proficiency, on the other hand. Authors of most of these studies, regardless of the approach, interpreted their fi ndings as support for a componential view of the construct of speaking profi ciency as well as for the claim that the weight of particular components may differ across profi ciency levels (e.g., intelligibility being more important at lower levels and fl uency more important at higher levels).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivation for the Current Study</head><p>These studies addressed the question of how holistic, global ratings of speaking profi ciency are related to subjective ratings or objective measures of various aspects or features of speech. However, they were not optimally suited to examine the componential nature of speaking profi ciency, because the two types of data being compared in these studies were obtained from the same speech productions-with the exception of the small <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">De Jong and Van Ginkel ( 1992 )</ref> study. This feature, although not problematic for a study in the fi eld of language testing, potentially generates the danger of circularity for a study that aims to defi ne and decompose the construct of speaking profi ciency. This study aims to decompose the construct of speaking profi ciency. It thus addresses a fundamental issue in the study of learner competence (language profi ciency); it does not, however, address issues concerning rater behavior or the validity of rating scales. This study investigates how individual differences in subskills (i.e., in skills hypothesized to be components of speaking profi ciency) are related to individual differences in successfully conveying information through speaking. To investigate this issue, while trying to avoid the danger of circularity, subskills and success of conveying messages through speaking were measured separately. Success of conveying information (the dependent variable) was measured by a panel of nonlinguists, who rated the functional adequacy of performance in eight speaking tasks of 181 L2 learners of Dutch. The independent (predictor) variables consisted of participants' performance in a number of different linguistic skill tasks (see Method section for details).</p><p>To assess success of conveying messages through speaking, speech was elicited in computer-administrated monologic tasks. As has been demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">He and Young ( 1998 )</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Young ( 2002 )</ref>, what people say and understand in real communications with other people is coconstructed by virtue of the interactive nature of such communications (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Berry, 2007 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fulcher, 2003 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lazaraton &amp; Davis, 2008 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">McNamara, 1997 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">O'Sullivan, 2008 )</ref>. The question of whether to assess speaking profi ciency (in terms of functional adequacy) with computer-administered tasks or in settings of more natural interaction between people physically present always forms an obstacle for researchers (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Iwashita et al., 2008 )</ref>. For this study, the computer-administered tasks were selected to investigate language profi ciency as an individual attribute. For that purpose, this study assessed speaking performances not affected by the behavior of other individuals in the communication. Although the tasks were not interactive in the sense that the participants spoke to a live person in several turns, they could be considered communicative, as they were fully contextualized-that is, the addressee, communicative setting, and such were specifi ed. The candidate was expected to give a (long) turn in a communicative role play. To standardize the testing conditions for all participants, a live interlocutor was not used (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brown, 2003 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Nakatsuhara, 2008 )</ref>.</p><p>The aim of this study is to produce a defi nition, or at least a partial one, of the construct of L2 speaking profi ciency. Starting from the premise that speaking profi ciency is componential in nature (i.e., it consists of various linguistic skills), the relative weight of and the relationship among these skills were empirically examined. A rough distinction must then be made between two types of skills: those that are seen as forms of declarative, crystalized knowledge, and those seen as the ability to rapidly and correctly process linguistic information. For ease of reference, these two types will be referred to as knowledge skills and processing skills and represent, respectively, knowledge and processing components (and hence facets) of speaking profi ciency. This distinction between knowledge and processing is roughly in line with various pairs of related labels in the psychological literature, such as declarative versus procedural knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson, 1980 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson &amp; Lebiere, 1998 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Paradis, 2004 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ullman, 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Ullman, , 2004 ) )</ref>. 1  These measures of linguistic skills were developed using <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Levelt's ( 1989 )</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Levelt, Roelofs, and Meyer's ( 1999 )</ref> model of speaking as a point of departure. According to Levelt, speaking consists of three major components: generating a preverbal message, putting this message into words, and articulating the generated utterance. Levelt calls these components the conceptualizer, the formulator, and the articulator. Concepts generated by the conceptualizer initiate lexical retrieval by activating the appropriate lemmas. After lemma retrieval, knowledge of the phonological form must also be retrieved from the mental lexicon, and the correct infl ectional form has to be selected. Subsequently, the phonological forms are phonetically encoded, with aid of knowledge of frequent sound patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cholin, Levelt, &amp; Schiller, 2006 )</ref>. Finally, motor processes execute the gestural scores that are the product of phonetic encoding, and articulation takes place.</p><p>To tap the knowledge and processing skills that follow conceptualization, two knowledge tests (which measured knowledge of vocabulary and grammar) and several processing tests were constructed. A picture naming task (for lexical retrieval speed) and a sentence completion task (for speed with which morphosyntactic knowledge can be used) were then administered to tap formulation processes. Delayed picture naming tasks were also administered to tap the speed with which speech plans can be articulated. In the delayed picture naming task, processes of lexical retrieval and phonetic encoding are supposedly completed, and therefore reaction times reflect articulatory skills, pertaining to the retrieval, unpacking, and execution of the motor program <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Eriksen, Pollack, &amp; Montague, 1970 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Sternberg, Knoll, Monsell, &amp; Wright, 1988 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sternberg, Monsell, Knoll, &amp; Wright, 1978 )</ref>. Finally, to tap knowledge of phonetic forms and the ability to correctly produce them, a pronunciation test was constructed in which participants read aloud words and sentences (without time pressure). These sentences were later rated on pronunciation quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Questions</head><p>This study was designed to address the following questions:</p><p>1. To what extent do L2 knowledge skills and L2 processing skills predict communicative success in L2 speaking, in a mixed-profi ciency group of adult L2 learners? 2. To what extent does the relative weight of the linguistic skills measured in this study differ for L2 learners who are more successful versus L2 learners who are less successful in communicating their message in the speaking tasks?</p><p>Whereas the fi rst question aims to examine the relative weight of knowledge and processing skills as facets of L2 speaking profi ciency, the second research question aims to explore <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Higgs and Clifford's ( 1982 )</ref> relative contribution model. 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD Overview of the Study</head><p>Participants in this study, 181 adult L2 learners of Dutch, performed eight speaking tasks and six tasks tapping linguistic skills. The eight speaking tasks differed in formality, discourse genre, and topic complexity. Performance in the eight speaking tasks was rated on functional adequacy by a panel of judges. Whether the scores of functional adequacy in the eight tasks could be reduced to a single-factor score was fi rst examined using structural equation modeling (SEM). Because this was found to be the case, the single-factor scores were subsequently used in the SEM analyses examining the weight of the predictor variables. The predictor variables consisted of (a) scores obtained from two tasks tapping knowledge skills (knowledge of vocabulary and grammar), (b) scores derived from performance in three tasks tapping speed of processing (picture naming, delayed picture naming, and sentence completion), and (c) three scores obtained in a pronunciation task. The three speed-of-processing tasks produced four speed-of-processing variables, all measured as reaction times (RTs) in ms: speed of lexical retrieval in the picture naming task, response latency and response duration in the delayed picture naming task, and speed of sentence building in the sentence completion task. The pronunciation task produced three variables: participants' ability to produce (a) a variety of speech sounds in word contexts, (b) word stress in multisyllable words, and (c) intonation patterns. The SEM analyses, in sum, comprised nine predictor variables-two knowledge, four speed-of-processing, and three pronunciation variables-and examined how functional adequacy (in the eight speaking tasks) related to linguistic skills. All tasks were designed for this study and were extensively piloted with L1 and L2 speakers.</p><p>The design of the current study is somewhat similar to the one used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Schoonen et al. ( 2003 )</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Van Gelderen et al. ( 2004 )</ref>. These studies investigated how well several knowledge and skill variables, measured in separate tasks, predicted participants' L2 (and L1) text comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Van Gelderen et al., 2004 )</ref> and their ability to write comprehensible texts in L2 (and L1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Schoonen et al., 2003 )</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Data were collected from 208 adult L2 learners of Dutch and from 58 adult L1 speakers, as a control group. Because not all participants were able to complete all tasks, data of 181 L2 learners and 54 L1 speakers are reported. Almost all of the L2 learners were taking Dutch courses at intermediate or advanced levels to prepare for enrollment at the University of Amsterdam. The ages of the 181 L2 learners ranged from 20 to 56 ( M = 29; SD = 6); the ages of the 54 L1 speakers ranged from 18 to 45 ( M = 25; SD = 6). Of the L2 learners, 72% were female and 28% were male, whereas 63% of the L1 speakers were female and 37% were male. The L2 learners reported 46 different L1 backgrounds. The languages most frequently reported were German ( n = 23), English ( n = 18), Spanish ( n = 16), French ( n = 15), Polish ( n = 11), and Russian ( n = 10). Participants' length of residence in the Netherlands ranged from 10 months to 20 years. Almost all L1 speakers were students enrolled at the same university, studying in programs other than Dutch or foreign languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sessions</head><p>The tasks were performed over two sessions and took approximately 2 hr for L1 speakers and around 2.5 to 3 hr for L2 learners. Participants were paid 20 € (L1 speakers) or 25 € (L2 learners). In the fi rst session, participants started with the speaking tasks (approximately 30 min), followed by the picture naming task and delayed picture naming task (10 min), the sentence completion task (10 min), and the pronunciation task (5 min). In the second session, participants completed the vocabulary and grammar tests and fi lled out the language background questionnaire. Because all tasks in the second session were not administered with time restrictions, this second session took from around 1 to as much as 2 hr. All participants were informed about the purpose of the study and signed a consent form during the fi rst session.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Speaking Tasks</head><p>Materials. Speaking profi ciency was measured with eight computeradministered speaking tasks. The tasks were constructed with contrasts on the following three dimensions, in a 2 × 2 × 2 fashion: complexity (complex vs. simple topic), formality (informal vs. formal setting), and discourse type (descriptive vs. argumentative). The task instructions specifi cally mentioned that participants should try to imagine that they were addressing an audience in each task, and participants were to role-play accordingly. For each task (as illustrated in tasks 1-8), the screen provided a picture of the communicative situation and one or several visual-verbal cues concerning the topic.</p><p>Task 1 (simple, informal, descriptive): Participant speaks on the phone to a friend and describes the apartment of friends who have recently moved.</p><p>Task 2 (simple, formal, descriptive): Participant, who witnessed a road accident some time ago, is in a courtroom and describes to a judge what happened. Task 3 (simple, informal, argumentative): Participant advises his or her sister on how to choose between (or combine) child care, further education, and paid work. Task 4 (simple, formal, argumentative): Participant is present at a neighborhood meeting at which an offi cial has just proposed to build a school playground, separated by a road from the school building.</p><p>Participant gets up to speak, takes the fl oor, and argues against the planned location of the playground. Task 5 (complex, informal, descriptive): Participant tells a friend about the development of unemployment among women and men over the last ten years. Task 6 (complex, informal, argumentative): Participant discusses the pros and cons of three means of transportation (public transportation, bicycle, and automobile) with respect to how to solve the problem of traffi c congestion. Task 7 (complex, formal, descriptive): Participant works at the employment offi ce of a hospital and tells a candidate for a nursing position what the main job duties entail. Task 8 (complex, formal, argumentative): Participant, who is the manager of a supermarket, addresses a neighborhood meeting and argues for whichever of three alternative plans for building a parking lot he or she prefers.</p><p>Apparatus and Software. The tasks were set in Macromedia Authorware, version 7. Speech was recorded with a microphone on the same computer, using PRAAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Boersma &amp; Weenink, 2005 )</ref> with 11,250 Hz sampling frequency.</p><p>Procedure. Each task started with two screens that provided detailed information on the assignment. After a set time of up to 17 s (for reading directions), participants were allotted 30 s to prepare their response. Their time was gauged by a blue bar that appeared at the bottom of the screen. A second (green) bar then appeared and cued participants to speak. Participants were given 120 s for this portion but were told they could stop whenever they had fi nished. Participants were urged to do their best in imagining they actually were in the situation described. As a warm-up, participants carried out a practice task in which they had to tell a friend about the research project in which they were participating. The tasks were administered in the same order for all participants.</p><p>Measure of Functional Adequacy. Participants' speaking profi ciency in the eight tasks was measured in terms of the functional adequacy of their responses and rated by a panel of four judges, from a pool of 12 graduate students who received payment. Nonexperts (none of the students studied linguistics or languages) were deliberately selected to obtain naive judgments on the functional adequacy of the responses. The rationale behind this was that if linguists or L2 teachers were asked to rate the responses, they would have found it almost impossible to ignore the linguistic infelicities in the responses (e.g., errors in grammar, lexis, and pronunciation) as opposed to focusing solely on the responses' functional (informational) adequacy. For all tasks, the scales comprised six levels and contained descriptors pertaining to both the amount and detail of information conveyed, relevant to the topic, setting (formal or informal), and discourse type (descriptive or argumentative) and the ease with which the description could be followed. For each task, the scale was slightly adapted to include the task-specifi c descriptions. Each of these six categories was subdivided into fi ve score intervals to allow for an even more precise distinction between responses, and this resulted in a rating scale ranging from 1 to 30. Scores 1 to 5, 6 to 10, and 11 to 15 were described as being insuffi cient in terms of functional adequacy, with descriptors such as unsuccessful , weak , and mediocre . Scores 16 to 20, 21 to 25, and 26 to 30 were described as being suffi cient in terms of functional adequacy, with descriptors such as suffi cient , quite successful , and very successful .</p><p>After an introductory training session, the judges received all responses of either two or three tasks, such that, for each speaking task, four judges independently rated all speaking responses, randomized per task. Judges performed their rating tasks at home in the span of 20 to 25 hr.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vocabulary Knowledge</head><p>Materials and Procedure. For the assessment of productive vocabulary knowledge, a two-part paper-and-pencil task was administered. Part 1 (90 items) elicited knowledge of single words, and part 2 (26 items) elicited knowledge of multiword units. For part 1, nine words were selected from each frequency band of 1,000 words between words ranked 1 to 10,000 according to the Corpus Gesproken Nederlands "Corpus of Spoken Dutch" (CGN, Dutch Language Union, 2004 ). The format by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Laufer and Nation ( 1999 )</ref> was used; that is, for each item a meaningful sentence was presented with the target word omitted, except for its fi rst letter. When alternative words beginning with the same letter could also be appropriately used, more letters were given. Part 2 of the vocabulary task tested knowledge of 26 prepositional phrases and verb-noun collocations; the preposition or main verb was omitted and the gap had to be fi lled in. The test format was the same as in the fi rst part of the vocabulary test, except that for this part, no fi rst letter(s) were given, because all contexts suffi ciently narrowed down the possible candidates for the target word(s).</p><p>Scoring. Correct and incorrect answers were counted for all 118 items. Because the study is concerned with facets of speaking ability, there was extreme leniency toward spelling mistakes. If the spelling of a response was incorrect but the most likely pronunciation was the same as the correct answer, the item was scored as correct. All infl ectional variants of a word were also scored as correct to avoid measuring morphosyntactic knowledge in the vocabulary test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grammar Knowledge</head><p>Materials and Procedure. The grammar task consisted of 142 items that covered a range of grammatical issues grouped in different test sections. Short instructions and an example were given at the beginning of each section. Knowledge of infl ectional variants of adjectives (19 items) and verbs (19 items); word order of main clauses and subclauses (33 items); the place of particles (10 items); use of relative pronouns (15 items), possessive pronouns (5 items), and clause pronouns (26 items); choice of auxiliary verbs (10 items); and construction of passive sentences (5 items) were assessed.</p><p>Scoring. One point was awarded for each correct response. Items were also scored as correct if the grammatical form intended to be elicited was correct. For example, mistakes in infl ectional variants were not penalized in the parts eliciting word order.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lexical Retrieval Speed</head><p>Materials. From the picture set produced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Snodgrass and Vanderwart ( 1980 )</ref>, 28 pictures were selected with 100% name agreement in Dutch <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Severens, Van Lommel, Ratinckx, &amp; Hartsuiker, 2005 )</ref>. The names belonged to the 2,200 most frequent lemmas in the CGN, with frequencies ranging from 20 to 498 per million. In a pilot study, both L1 and L2 speakers named these 28 pictures without mistakes.</p><p>Apparatus. The presentation of the stimuli was controlled by the E-Prime software system <ref type="bibr">(Schneider, Eschman, &amp; Zuccolotto, 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2002b )</ref>, and speech was recorded on a fl ash digital recorder (Edirol) with a microphone (48,000 Hz sampling frequency). The speech signal as well as an auditory cue (unheard by the participant) generated by the E-Prime script was recorded to determine latencies between the target cue and the response.</p><p>Procedure. Participants were fi rst made familiar with the pictures and the procedure and were then instructed to name the pictures as fast and accurately as possible. First, a fi xation cross was presented in the middle of the screen for 1,500 ms. Then the picture appeared, which was presented for 2,000 ms. After the picture, a blank screen followed for 500 ms. The pictures were presented in different random orders in the familiarization and the test phase but in the same order for all participants. The familiarization phase was preceded by a practice list of seven pictures. The experimenter noted wrong answers and other deviations from the intended responses.</p><p>Measure. The time between the appearance of the picture and the beginning of the response was measured using a script written in PRAAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Boersma &amp; Weenink, 2005 )</ref>, which automatically measured changes in dB as well as voice onsets. This script automatically determined the unheard beep generated by the E-Prime script as well as the onset of speech. Response times were then measured for all correct responses (as noted by the experimenter). Incorrect responses and outliers were replaced by missing values. Outliers were defi ned after inspection of the data as RTs below the minimum of 300 ms and RTs higher than 3 standard deviations above the grand mean. In this way, 11% of all picture naming RTs were replaced. Multiple imputation by chained equations was used to impute these missing data <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Van Buuren &amp; Oudshoorn, 1999 )</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Speed of Articulation: Response Latency and Response Duration</head><p>Materials and Apparatus. The materials and apparatus were the same as the ones used for the lexical retrieval measure (picture naming).</p><p>Procedure. Participants carried out the picture naming task once more. This time, however, they were asked to prepare their response and wait until a cue was given to name the picture. A fi xation cross was presented in the middle of the screen for 500 ms. Then the picture appeared and remained on the screen for 2,000 ms. After 2,000 ms, the participant heard a short beep, and a green border appeared on the screen, around the picture. The beep together with the green border formed the cue for participants to give their response. The picture (with the green border) remained on the screen for another 1,000 ms, during which the participants responded.</p><p>Measures. Response latency was measured as the latency between the auditory cue and the beginning of the response. Response duration was measured as the duration of the response-that is, the latency between the beginning and the end of the response. This was done using a script written in PRAAT and was then computed for all correct responses. Incorrect responses and outliers were replaced by missing values. Minimum response time was defi ned after inspection of the data (minimum 50 ms for articulation latency and pronunciation duration). For both measures, the maximum response time was set to 3 standard deviations above the grand mean. In this way, 13% and 12% of all articulation latency and articulation duration data, respectively, were replaced by missing values. Missing data were imputed as described for the lexical retrieval task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sentence Building Speed</head><p>Materials. Participants performed a sentence completion task, in which the completion was an alteration of a given sentence elicited by a cue. For instance, they would hear and read, De meisjes gaan meestal naar de bakker "The girls usually go to the bakery," after which the written cue Het meisje . . . "The girl" was presented. The correct response would be, Het meisje gaat meestal naar de bakker "The girl usually goes to the bakery." The alteration of the sentences always involved a grammatical change that was induced by the written cue following the original sentence. Grammatical changes required adjectival infl ection (10 items), verbal infl ection of number (10 items), verbal conjugation changing present tense to past tense (10 items), construction of subclauses from main clauses (10 items), or subject-verb inversion in main clauses (10 items). The original sentences were recorded in a noise-free booth by a trained female speaker.</p><p>Apparatus. The apparatus was the same as described for the lexical retrieval measure.</p><p>Procedure. Instructions were presented on the computer screen. For each sentence-changing type, an example was shown. In each experimental trial, fi rst, a fi xation cross was presented near the top-left corner of the screen for 1,000 ms. Then participants heard a sentence through the headphones while the same sentence appeared simultaneously (in written form) on the screen. The fi rst letter of the sentence was presented at the same point as where the fi xation cross had appeared. The beginning of the altered sentence was presented (in written form) 500 ms after offset of the auditory stimulus, precisely below the fi rst sentence, which remained on the screen. The E-Prime script generated a beep unheard by the participants while the beginning of the altered sentence was presented on the screen. Both the original sentence and the beginning of the altered sentence stayed on the screen for 5,000 ms. Participants were instructed to use the content of the fi rst sentence to correctly complete the altered sentence, beginning with the word or words on the screen (i.e., with Het meisje in the example). The sentences were presented in a random order identical for all participants. The experimenter noted wrong answers and other deviations from the intended responses.</p><p>Measure. The period between the beginning and the end of the participants' response was measured. However, due to a technical failure, the response of the last item could not be measured. A script written in PRAAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Boersma &amp; Weenink, 2005 )</ref> was used to determine the latencies, and to automatically measure changes in dB as well as voice onsets. Incorrect responses and outliers (minimum defi ned after inspection of the data as 1,000 ms, and maximum set to 3 standard deviations above the grand mean) were replaced by missing values. In this way, 22% of all data were replaced as missing values (3% outliers and 19% incorrect responses). Missing data were imputed as described for the lexical retrieval task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pronunciation</head><p>Materials. The materials in the pronunciation task were constructed on the basis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Thio and Verboog ( 1993 )</ref>, a book on the pronunciation of standard Dutch and pronunciation diffi culties encountered by L2 learners with a wide range of L1s. Sixty target words (mostly monosyllabic) were selected, covering a broad range of vowels, diphthongs, and to a lesser extent, consonants (each sound occurred in one to four target words). Thirty-six of these words were divided into six sets of six single-word items, and the 24 remaining target words were embedded in 15 sentences. Ten of these sentences were also designated to test the quality of the intonation pattern. Finally, to test word-stress knowledge, 10 words with two to four syllables were added, divided into two sets of fi ve target words.</p><p>Apparatus. The apparatus was the same as described for the lexical retrieval measure.</p><p>Procedure. The presentation of the written stimuli was controlled by the E-Prime software system, and speech was recorded on a fl ash digital recorder (Edirol) with a directional microphone (48,000 Hz sampling frequency). Participants were instructed to inspect the items at their leisure before pressing the space bar. They started reading aloud after pressing the space bar, which induced an unheard beep that was recorded, together with the speech signal, in order to automatically cut speech fi les into the sets just mentioned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures.</head><p>A script was written in PRAAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Boersma &amp; Weenink, 2005 )</ref> to automatically create 25 sets of responses (six sets of six words, two sets of fi ve words, and 17 sentences). Three judges (undergraduate students in phonetic sciences) received payment to rate the responses. The judges rated whether the pronunciation of the designated sound of the target word was correct or incorrect for the fi rst six sets of words as well as whether the stress patterns were correct or incorrect for the two sets of fi ve multisyllable words. They also rated the target sounds in words as correct or incorrect for the 15 remaining sentences. Furthermore, for 10 of these sentences, an additional judgment on intonation had to be given (correct or incorrect). In a 2-hr session, the judges were trained to give judgments of phonetic quality of sounds in words, word stress, and sentence intonation. The judges were asked to rate sounds as correct if they were correct in any version of standard Dutch. After the training session, the judges rated all responses (six sets of six words, two sets of fi ve words, and 15 sentences) at home. Speaker responses were randomized per sets of words and sentences, and per judge. Each set of words or sentence could be played a maximum of three times per judge. The rating task took the judges approximately 35 hr. Each judge scored 2% of all items as not scoreable . Missing data were imputed as described for the lexical retrieval task. Each correct item counted as one point, and mean scores were calculated per item over the three judges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses: Structural Equation Modeling</head><p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to address the research questions. SEM can be conceived of as a combination of factor analysis and regression analysis (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Raykov &amp; Marcoulides, 2000 )</ref>. First, the structure of the measurements was examined-that is, the observed scores were related to latent variables (like in factor analysis). This part of the analysis is referred to as the measurement model. One measurement model was developed for the dependent variable functional adequacy, representing the construct speaking profi ciency, and one for the independent variables (linguistics knowledge and processing skills). For the identifi cation of latent variables, at least three indicators (observed variables) are required. For functional adequacy, the ratings of four judges per task are included in the analyses; in the case of the predictor variables, subscores were used (see the Results section for details). The second step of the analyses investigated the relationship between speaking profi ciency (i.e., the latent variable functional adequacy of the speaking tasks) and the independent (latent) variables (as in regression analysis). This part of the analysis is referred to as the structural model.</p><p>In SEM there are several indices to evaluate the fi t between model and data. One statistical measure is χ 2 ( df ), where χ 2 should be small compared to the degrees of freedom ( df ) for the model to be accepted (i.e., not rejected). However, χ 2 is very sensitive to sample size and the number of parameters in the model and easily leads to the rejection of almost any (complex) model. Therefore, the ratio of χ 2 / df is often used as a (rough) indicator of fi t. This ratio should preferably be smaller than 2. A more relevant use of the χ 2 is in the comparison of two concurrent nested models-that is, when a model can be converted into another model by adding one or more free parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kline, 2005 )</ref>. The difference in fi t between two nested models can be tested using the difference in χ 2 and df values of the competing models. Descriptive measures for model fi t are the standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR), root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), and comparative fi t index (CFI). The fi t of a model is considered good when SRMR ≤ .08, RMSEA ≤ .06, and CFI ≥ .95 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999 )</ref>.</p><p>Analyses were carried out by fi tting two measurement models, one for the predictor variables and one for the dependent variable speaking. The measurement models were satisfactory and thus were combined in the next step-that is, in the examination of the structural model. Structural equation modeling allows for testing many different models, but here it was confi ned to the measurement and structural models that operationalize the research questions and match the research designthat is, the measurement of speaking profi ciency with eight tasks each rated by four raters, the measurement of the nine constituent predictor variables, and fi nally the regression of speaking on the constituent predictor variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison between L2 and L1 Speakers</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the descriptive statistics of all measures, for L2 and L1 speakers. Interitem reliability for all measures was satisfactory (Cronbach's alpha &gt; 0.86), with the exception of the two pronunciation measures with only ten items-namely, word stress (alpha = 0.70) and intonation (alpha = 0.55). The Shapiro-Wilk test showed that for all variables, normality could reasonably be assumed ( W s &gt; 0.9). The 40% of participants with highest functional adequacy scores and the 40% of participants with lowest functional adequacy scores ( n = 73 each) were defi ned within the group of 181 L2 speakers. This was done to answer the second research question. Separate columns in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> show the performance of the high and the low L2 speakers. Group comparisons showed that, as expected, L1 speakers scored signifi cantly higher and faster than the 73 L2 speakers in the high L2 group. This fi nding suggests that all measures tapped profi ciencyrelated skills rather than individual differences associated with nonlinguistic attributes. As expected, the high L2 speakers scored signifi cantly better (i.e., higher or faster) than the low L2 speakers on all measures, except response duration in delayed picture naming.</p><p>Using SEM, it was hoped that these data would also allow for the examination of the structure of speaking profi ciency in the L1 speaker control group. Although scores on some predictor variables showed suffi cient dispersion, functional adequacy ratings turned out to be almost at ceiling. Functional adequacy, therefore, was not signifi cantly associated with any of the predictor variables ( r values between -.06 and .18). A multiple regression analysis on the observed variables showed that only 10% of the variance in functional adequacy could be explained by all predictors together. Thus, the fact that the data exhibited low and nonsignifi cant correlations prevented a meaningful examination of the componential nature of speaking profi ciency in the case of the L1 speaker control group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model: Speaking Profi ciency</head><p>In the measurement model for functional adequacy, 32 scores (8 tasks × 4 raters) had to be modeled. Several competing models could be assumed. The most simple model would be a single-factor model with one single functional adequacy factor explaining (the interrelations between) the 32 scores. Alternatively, it could be assumed that each task tapped a separate yet adequate ability of expression leading to eight functional adequacy factors. Other theoretically plausible models might postulate two speaking factors-that is, functional adequacy in argumentative versus descriptive tasks, in formal versus informal tasks, or (somewhat less plausibly) in complex versus simple tasks. These models accommodate the design features of the speaking tasks in different ways. Analyses showed that none of these models was completely satisfactory. However, there is a complicating issue-namely, that the 32 scores are hierarchically related themselves, which means that it is not possible to consider them as 32 independent measures of speaking profi ciency. There were eight (independent) performances, each of which was rated four times. This hierarchy is best accommodated in a second-order factor analysis with the eight different tasks as fi rst-order factors, and with each task factor indicated by the four ratings. At the second-order level, the eight task factors can be modeled as a single factor, speaking profi ciency, or as two or more factors-for example, as informal speaking and formal speaking. A measurement model with one second-order factor fi tted the data fairly well: χ 2 (456) = 647.5, p ≤ .001; SRMR = .039, RMSEA = .046, CFI = .994. Models with two second-order factors, refl ecting one of the three task dimensions, did not fi t better. The standardized loadings for the (four) ratings per task ranged from .68 to .96; for the tasks on the latent factor speaking proficiency, the loadings ranged from .87 to .96. In the SEM analyses (structural model), this second-order factor, illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> , is the dependent variable, to be explained by (latent) predictor variables. Thus, the operationalization of speaking profi ciency, communicative success, can indeed be considered to represent a single construct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model: Independent Variables</head><p>Of the seven measures of linguistic knowledge and processing skills, 24 subscores were initially derived in such a way that each independent variable was indicated by between three and fi ve subscores. As a fi rst step, to test whether these subscores of each variable would indeed load on a single factor, separate confi rmatory factor analyses were carried out. A squared loading of .6 was considered as minimum for subscores. For most variables, all loadings were well above this minimum. In the confi rmatory factor analysis for pronunciation, however, two subscores had loadings below this minimum (squared loadings for intonation and word stress were .56 and .41, respectively), which indicated that the three indicators did not load well on a single latent factor. Therefore pronunciation was split into three separate latent variablesnamely, speech sound quality, word stress quality, and intonationeach with the three separate judge scores as subscores. For these new models, the loadings were satisfactory. The fi nal measurement model, representing the relations between the 30 subscores and 9 (correlated) latent variables, fi tted the data quite well, χ 2 (369) = 531, p ≤ .001; SRMR = .033, RMSEA = .040, CFI = .988.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Models: Relations between Speaking and Linguistic Knowledge and Skills</head><p>In the structural model, the dependent latent variable speaking proficiency (i.e., the second-order factor of the variable functional adequacy) was regressed on the independent latent variables vocabulary knowledge, grammar knowledge, speed of lexical retrieval (picture naming), speed of articulation response latency (delayed picture naming), speed of articulation response duration (delayed picture naming), speed of sentence building, pronunciation speech sound, pronunciation word stress, and pronunciation intonation (with n = 181). The structural model fi ts the data quite well, χ 2 (1776) = 2,380, p ≤ .001; SRMR = .044, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Measurement model of speaking profi ciency (operationalized as functional adequacy of the responses in eight speaking tasks) with one second-order factor. Ovals refer to latent variables, boxes to observed variables. The eight (latent) tasks are designated with three letters, referring to the fi rst letters of the following features: descriptive or argumentative, simple or complex, and formal or informal, respectively. Functional adequacy of each task elicits the observed four ratings, indicated by the same letter-trigram and a rater ID; e is error. RMSEA = .034, CFI = .991. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the separate correlations of the nine independent variables with functional adequacy.</p><p>All correlations between functional adequacy and the predictor variables were substantial, except for response latency and response duration in the delayed picture naming task. In the regression analyses, vocabulary knowledge and intonation were found to be signifi cant predictors (standardized regression coeffi cients of .305 and .341, respectively). Because the two linguistic knowledge, the four speed-of-processing, and the three pronunciation predictors exhibited substantial intercorrelations (collinearity), the most parsimonious model, with only one knowledge predictor (knowledge of vocabulary) and one pronunciation predictor (quality of intonation)-that is, the variables with the two highest correlation coeffi cients in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> -accounted for virtually the same amount of variance: 75.3% in the pruned model versus 75.7% in the full model ( χ 2 (1783) = 2,388, p ≤ .001; SRMR = .0458, RMSEA = .0341, CFI = .991).</p><p>In sum, the answer to the fi rst research question is that all latent variables, except for response latency and response duration in the delayed picture naming task, correlate substantially with the communicative success with which the 181 L2 speakers were able to deliver the message in the eight speaking tasks. Thus, speaking profi ciency was determined by linguistic knowledge skills (vocabulary and grammar), speed-of-processing skills (lexical retrieval and sentence building), and pronunciation skills (speech sounds, word stress, and intonation). Furthermore, because of the substantial collinearity among the predictors, the full model, containing all predictors, did not explain more variance in functional adequacy than the most parsimonious model with just vocabulary and intonation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Comparison of Communicatively Less and More Successful L2 Speakers</head><p>The second research question asked whether the linguistic knowledge and linguistic processing skills attribute equally to speaking profi ciency for L2 learners who are more or less successful in communicating their message. To answer this question, the 40% of L2 speakers with the highest and the 40% of L2 speakers with the lowest functional adequacy scores ( n = 73 each), called the high and the low L2 groups, were selected from the whole sample of 181 L2 speakers. By selecting the lowest and highest 40%, rather than taking the medium split, the two groups were clearly made distinct from each other, to better test <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Higgs and Clifford's ( 1982 )</ref> relative contribution model. SEM analyses were carried out for each independent variable separately. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the resulting regression weights.</p><p>The multigroup analyses (high and low) with single predictors showed signifi cant contributions for all predictors, except for the two measures in the delayed picture naming task (speed of articulation), which was similar to the fi nding for the L2 group as a whole. In contrast with what could be expected on the basis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Higgs and Clifford's ( 1982 )</ref> relative contribution model, the weight of each predictor was always larger for the communicatively more successful group than for the less successful group. This means that a similar increase in linguistic knowledge or speed of processing predicts a higher gain in speaking proficiency for the high group than for the low group. All differences in (unstandardized) regression weights between the two groups were signifi cant, except for lexical retrieval, articulation latency, and response duration (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>This study explored the componential makeup of L2 speaking proficiency. In a sample of 181 adult L2 speakers of Dutch (nonbeginners) and in a control group of 54 adult L1 speakers, speaking profi ciency was assessed as the success with which participants were able to get their message across in eight speaking tasks. Their linguistic knowledge was separately assessed in two tests (vocabulary and grammar) as well as their linguistic processing skills (four reaction time measures obtained in three tasks: picture naming, delayed picture naming, and sentence building) and their pronunciation skills (speech sounds, word stress, and intonation). The study addressed two research questions that pertained to the componential structure of speaking profi ciency.</p><p>Speaking was elicited in eight tasks, differing in complexity (complex vs. simple topic), formality (informal vs. formal setting), and discourse type (descriptive vs. argumentative). As expected, the L1 speaker control group performed signifi cantly better (higher or faster) than the L2 speakers, which suggested that the measures were relevant with respect to L2 profi ciency. In the measurement model for speaking proficiency, it was found that the scores for functional adequacy on the eight different tasks could best be modeled with a single (higher-order) factor, which showed that these tasks all measured the same speaking profi ciency construct.</p><p>With respect to the fi rst research question, using SEM, all linguistic skills assessed in the study were signifi cantly and substantially related to functional adequacy of speaking, with the exception of the two articulation speed measures obtained in the delayed picture naming task ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> ). Thus, the effi ciency of L2 speakers' articulatory skills was not found to be associated with speaking profi ciency.</p><p>Of the seven language skill variables associated with functional adequacy, knowledge of vocabulary and the ability to produce correct sentence intonation turned out to be the best predictors of speaking profi ciency. The model with only these two predictors explained the variance in functional adequacy in speaking (75.3%) as well as did the model with all predictors (75.7%). It is important to emphasize that this fi nding does not mean that the only variables that matter for communicative success are vocabulary and intonation skills. Knowledge of grammar, speed of lexical retrieval, speed of sentence building, and correct pronunciation of speech sounds and word stress were also strongly associated with speaking profi ciency (with correlation coeffi cients between .49 and .75; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> ). Thus, speaking profi ciency is a matter of declarative knowledge (elicited in this study with a vocabulary and a grammar task), a matter of processing knowledge quickly (elicited in this study in the picture naming and sentence building tasks), and a matter of pronunciation skills (quality of speech sounds, word stress, and intonation). Whether these predictor variables contribute to overall speaking profi ciency similarly for all individuals in this study cannot be answered with these data. Follow-up research is needed to investigate whether different speakers show different profi les of factors that contribute to speaking profi ciency.</p><p>The large-scale study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Iwashita et al. ( 2008 ;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> see the Previous Research Investigating Components of L2 Speaking Profi ciency section) pointed to the important role of vocabulary, fl uency, grammatical accuracy, and pronunciation in speaking. In a similar manner, this study also points out the importance of those factors, but the current evidence is stronger. It is possible to argue that, in contrast to <ref type="bibr">Iwashita et al.,</ref> this study measured the functional adequacy of speech (content) independently from the component skills.</p><p>The fi nding that performance in a functional task (in eight speaking tasks in this study) requires knowledge (the representation of information) and the ability to use that knowledge fl uently (the processing of information) is in line with fi ndings that <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Van Gelderen et al. ( 2004 )</ref> obtained for components of reading and with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Schoonen et al. ( 2003 )</ref> for writing. Participants in these two studies were 281 eighth-grade students in the Netherlands, who were tested on reading comprehension and writing in L2 English and L1 Dutch. Additionally, they were tested on (a) several knowledge subskills (vocabulary, grammar, and orthography in L2 and L1), (b) several speed-of-processing subskills (lexical decision, lexical retrieval, sentence verifi cation, and sentence building in L2 and L1), and (c) metacognition (i.e., their knowledge of reading and writing strategies and their knowledge of text characteristics, elicited with an 80item questionnaire). Structural equation modeling was used to determine the contribution of the subskill variables to performance in the reading comprehension tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Van Gelderen et al., 2004 )</ref> and the writing tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Schoonen et al., 2003 )</ref>. This was done for L2 and L1 separately. The common fi nding was that the variance in reading and writing (in L2 and L1) was signifi cantly associated with (a) the language knowledge predictors (in L2 and L1, respectively) and (b) most of the language processing predictors (in L2 and L1, respectively) and was almost always associated with (c) the metacognitive knowledge predictor.</p><p>Unfortunately, the data did not permit the modeling of speaking profi ciency in the control group of L1 speakers mainly because of a lack of variability in the dependent variable; most L1 speakers scored at ceiling on functional adequacy and were rather homogenous in natureconsisting of young, intelligent adults (university students). In a separate study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mulder and Hulstijn (2011)</ref> administered four of the eight speaking tasks of this study to a group of 98 Dutch L1 speakers differing in age (18-76) and levels of education and profession (high vs. low). Functional adequacy was rated in the same way as in the present study. Level of education and profession affected functional adequacy scores substantially. This fi nding suggests that it should also be possible to investigate the componential structure, in terms of linguistic subskills, of the speaking profi ciency of L1 speakers.</p><p>The second research question explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Higgs and Clifford's ( 1982 )</ref> relative contribution model predicting that, while L2 learners become more profi cient over time, the relative weight of component skills may change. In the realm of speaking, the experienced raters in the Higgs and Clifford study exhibited intuitions that largely converged with those of the authors themselves-namely, that at lower levels of the FSI overall speaking profi ciency scale, knowledge of vocabulary and grammar would play the most dominant role, whereas at the highest scale level, all components would play an equal role. Only the weight of fl uency was estimated to be lower by the teacher raters than expected by the researchers. As mentioned in the introduction to this article, fi ndings of the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">De Jong and Van Ginkel ( 1992 )</ref>, involving 25 L2 learners, supported the model. However, support for the relative contribution model was not found in the cross-sectional data, when the sample of 181 L2 learners was split into the 40% lowest and the 40% highest performing participants on the dependent variable functional adequacy. It is necessary to notice that functional adequacy was rated on a 30-point scale with scores lower and higher than 15, indicating insuffi cient and suffi cient, respectively, success in conveying the message. All participants in the low group had an average score lower than 15, whereas all participants in the high group had an average score higher than 15 (when the ratings were pooled over the eight speaking tasks). The two groups thus were not only well apart from each other but differed meaningfully in communicative profi ciency (pass vs. fail). Furthermore, the relationship of speaking profi ciency with the predictor variables differed across the two groups. The regression slopes were steeper in the high group than in the low group for almost all predictor variables ( Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> ). It should be kept in mind, however, when interpreting these fi ndings, that L2 speaking performance in the studies of Higgs and Clifford as well as De Jong and Van Ginkel was rated from a hearer perspective. In contrast, this study assessed the components of speaking profi ciency as attributes of the speaker. In conclusion, although the data of the current study do not falsify Higgs and Clifford's hypothesis, they certainly do not provide evidence in its support in the domain of speaking.</p><p>In terms of the study's strengths, it is important to point to several of its features. First, this study is (to the knowledge of the authors) the fi rst one using SEM in the exploration of candidate components of speaking profi ciency. SEM allows the researcher to examine associations between variables, free of measurement error. Second, contrary to some previous studies, potential problems arising from computing the dependent and the independent variables from the same data in the investigation of facets of speaking profi ciency were avoided. Third, L2 learners substantially differing in speaking profi ciency were tested. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Harley, Cummins, Swain, and Allen ( 1990 )</ref> pointed out in the context of their large-scale study of the French L2 profi ciency of Canadian immersion students, heterogeneity in the subject sample is a requirement for testing models of profi ciency. Fourth, functional adequacy in speaking was assessed not with a single task but with eight tasks, differing in topic complexity, discourse type, and formality. It is known from language testing that test tasks may differ in diffi culty for different test takers and that they may not all be assumed to measure the same skill to the same extent. The best way of dealing with this problem in language testing is to include several tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brennan, 2001 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Y.-W. Lee, 2006 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">S. K. Lee, 2007 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sawaki, 2007 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Schoonen, 2005 )</ref>. The fi rst part of the SEM analyses, which can be seen as a kind of factor analysis, showed that, as far as rated adequacy of task performance is concerned, a common factor emerged. This demonstrates that the measurement of the ability to successfully communicate a message was assessed in a reliable way in this study.</p><p>How do the fi ndings relate to models of language profi ciency in general (i.e., models not of speaking profi ciency in particular)? There are two models that have become very well known in the literature. The fi rst one, proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Canale and Swain ( 1980 )</ref>, consists of grammatical, sociolinguistic, and strategic competence. The second one, proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bachman and Palmer ( 1996 ;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bachman, 1990 )</ref>, conceives language ability as consisting of language knowledge (including pragmatic knowledge)-that is, functional and sociolinguistic knowledge-and strategic competence (metacognitive components and strategies). Both models include linguistic knowledge, but linguistic processing skills are not explicitly mentioned. In this study, pragmatic knowledge was not assessed separately. However, the participants in this study performed speaking tasks-differentiated in formality and discourse type-that called on their pragmatic skills to a considerable extent. Thus, although the present study was not designed to test the <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Canale and Swain ( 1980 )</ref> or the <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bachman and Palmer ( 1996 )</ref> models, its results do not seem to be at variance with these models. What the empirical studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Van Gelderen et al. ( 2004 )</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Schoonen et al. ( 2003 )</ref>, and this study clearly demonstrate, however, is the importance of linguistic knowledge and processing skills, explaining, in the case of this study, 75.7% of the variance in communicative success in speaking. Thus, linguistic knowledge and processing skills deserve a prominent place in any model of language profi ciency.</p><p>( Received 6 October 2010 ) NOTES 1. In the language testing fi eld, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Carroll ( 1961 )</ref> made a somewhat similar distinction between knowledge and channel control. This study will not delve further into these theoretical distinctions, because its aim is not to test the question of whether the distinction between the representation (knowledge) and use (speed of processing) of information can be upheld.</p><p>2. Another study based on the same data <ref type="bibr">(De Jong, Steinel, Florijn, Schoonen, &amp; Hulstijn, in press</ref>) investigated how the fl uency of the speech produced in the speaking tasks was affected by the topical complexity of the speaking tasks, in the speech produced by L2 and L1 participants. Because fl uency was assessed on the basis of the same data as was functional adequacy, and not independently (as the knowledge and processing components in the current study), the analyses reported in this article do not include fl uency.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Means and standard deviations (in parentheses) for L1 and L2 speakers, and effect sizes (partial eta square, η</figDesc><table><row><cell>p 2 ) for group comparisons</cell><cell>L2 speakers with</cell><cell>low functional L2 speakers with high η p 2 L1 speaker η adequacy scores functional adequacy All L2 speakers control group p 2 L1 speakers vs. low vs. high L2</cell><cell>Measures ( n = 73) scores ( n = 73) ( n = 181) ( n = 54) high L2 speakers speakers</cell><cell>15.3 (3.7) 24.6 (2.3) .566 Functional adequacy in 11.9 (2.0) 18.7 (2.6) .684</cell><cell>the eight speaking</cell><cell>tasks (max = 30)</cell><cell>55 (27) 106 (5) .446 Knowledge of 38 (21) 75 (22) .438</cell><cell>vocabulary</cell><cell>(max = 118)</cell><cell>107 (20) 137 (10) .340 Knowledge of grammar 94 (20) 120 (11) .403</cell><cell>(max = 142)</cell><cell>754 (122) 589 (99) .262 Speed of lexical 809 (120) 692 (109) .209</cell><cell>retrieval (ms)</cell><cell>446 (138) 364 (151) .057 Speed of articulation: 490 (151) 413 (118) .077</cell><cell>response latency (ms)</cell><cell>463 (90) 430 (76) .026 Speed of articulation: 453 (81) 463 (87) .004</cell><cell>response duration (ms)</cell><cell>2,547 (399) 1,840 (188) .405 Speed of sentence 2,765 (327) 2,270 (314) .378</cell><cell>building (ms)</cell><cell>133 (23) 178 (2) .473 Pronunciation: speech sounds (max = 180) a 122 (20) 145 (21) .251</cell><cell>25 (4) 30 (1) .257 Pronunciation: word stress (max = 30) a 24 (4) 27 (3) .171</cell><cell>20 (6) 29 (2) .386 Pronunciation: Intonation (max = 30) a 16 (5) 23 (4) .345</cell><cell>&lt; .001), and the high L2 speakers scored signifi cantly better than the Note .
