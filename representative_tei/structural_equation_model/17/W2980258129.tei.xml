<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>While lean management practices (LMP) helps small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to be efficient, sustainability oriented innovation (SOI) facilitates to adopt environmental and social practices. Although prior research looks into the effect of LMP on economic performance of SMEs, less is known about the effect of LMP on sustainability (economic, environmental, and social) performance. Studies on effect of SOI on sustainability and economic performance are also scant. Additionally, examining the mediating effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices (environmental and social practices) on both LMP and SOI achieving sustainability performance is rare. This research bridges these knowledge gaps by answering the question how LMP, SOI, CSR practices, sustainability and economic performance are correlated. Through a few hypotheses testing using structural equation modelling, this study reveals the impact of LMP, SOI, CSR (environmental and social) practices on sustainability and economic performance. The study uses data from 119 SMEs within manufacturing industries in the Midlands, UK. The analysis reveals that LMP and SOI facilitate achieve both sustainability and economic performance, and SOI mediates LMP to achieve sustainability performance. Additionally, although CSR practices mediate LMP to achieve sustainability performance, it does mediate SOI only borderline to achieve sustainability performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) make up around 90% of the world's businesses and they employ 50-60% of the world's population <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Dey et al., 2018)</ref>. The total number of SMEs in the UK is 5.7 million, and they employ approximately 15.8 million people, contributing close to 20% in the GDP (Department for Business, <ref type="bibr">Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy, 2019</ref>). An SME is a small or medium-sized enterprise. According to the EU, definition of an SME is a business with fewer than 250 employees, and a turnover of less than €50 million <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hall, 2019)</ref>. The UK SMEs are likely to contribute £250 billion by 2025, which is 19% more than current figure <ref type="bibr">(Global Banking &amp; Finance Review, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>It has been estimated that SMEs contribute up to 70 percent of global pollution collectively. Especially manufacturing SMEs are reported to account for 64% of air pollution whereas only a small portion of 0.4% of these SMEs complies with an environmental management system <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Bonner, 2019)</ref>. Recent survey reveals that SMEs consume more than 13% of total global energy demand (around 74 exajoules (EJ)). Cost-effective energy efficiency measures could shave off as much as 30% of their consumption, namely 22 EJ, which is more energy than Japan and Korea combined consume per year <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(IEA, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Three quarter of UK SMEs are struggling to embed sustainability practices, citing costs issues and unfavourable government policies as major stumbling blocks <ref type="bibr">(Abdelaziz, et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Anderton, 2018)</ref>. While 88% of respondents claimed to value sustainability, 70% had struggled to embed practices and strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Mace, 2019)</ref>. Although 8 out of 10 SMEs plan to introduce more ethical and sustainable practices, 40% thought that sustainable practices were too costly to implement, while 42% claimed that the UK Government wasn't doing enough to encourage sustainable business practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Mace, 2019)</ref>. When chief executives were asked on what makes a business ethical, 75% responded ‗treating people fairly', 58% responded ‗sourcing manufacturing materials responsibly', 51% responded ‗maintaining energy efficacy', and 33% responded stakeholder engagement outside the financial backers <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Newsroom, 2018)</ref>. Prior studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dey and Cheffi, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Dey et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Zhu and Sarkis, 2004)</ref> reveal that there are number of barriers that do not allow SMEs to achieve economic sustainability. There are intense competition, cash flow issues, demand uncertainties, and business process immaturity. Additionally, SMEs suffer from skill shortage and large employee turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Dey et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Many manufacturing and service companies adopt lean management practices for achieving economic sustainability through emphasizing on waste reduction across the business processes. Recently, there is growing interest in linking LMP with environmental sustainability. Lean is economy focused and environmental friendly, as philosophically lean management focuses on waste reduction through resource optimisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Dey et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">De et al., 2018)</ref>. However, a few environmental and social sustainability projects are cost intensive (e.g. adopting environmental management system such as ISO 14000, specific measures for reducing energy consumption, employee wellbeing. Corporate social responsibility projects are also considered capital intensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Tang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Walker et al., 2019)</ref>. There are a few constructs that are common for LMP and CSR practices and they are all economy oriented. Prior literature has linked LMP with economic sustainability <ref type="bibr">(Martinez-Jurado and Moyono-Fuentes, 2014)</ref>. LMP facilitates to adopt green manufacturing principles and enhances environmental performance of many manufacturing companies.</p><p>Despite the fact that LMP contributes to environmental sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Moreira et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Vinodh et al., 2011)</ref>, the findings are still not conclusive, as both positive <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(King and Lenox, 2001)</ref> and negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Rothenberg et al., 2001)</ref> relationships have been found to exist.</p><p>Moreover, the relationship between LMP, and environmental and social performance is also non-conclusive.</p><p>LMP has been extended to SMEs' supply chain through eliminating waste, enhancing quality, reducing costs and increasing flexibility across supply chain in different tiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Inman and Green, 2018)</ref>. The economic sustainability of SMEs is achieved through supply chain cost and risk reduction through joint investment in R&amp;D and technology, optimised inventory, improved products and services quality, and reduction of waste across the supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Arkader, 2001)</ref>. Similarly, adopting LMP across supply chain helps achieve environmental and social sustainability through collaborative relationship building across all the stakeholders, engaging with suppliers at the early stage of product development, introducing vendor managed inventory, considering environmental and social criteria for supplier selection along with economic criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Inman and Green, 2018)</ref>. Environmental sustainability of supply chain could be achieved through reduction of emission and waste across the supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Martinez-Conesa et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Sustainability oriented innovation could be achieved through product, process and organisational innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Klewitz and Hansen, 2014)</ref>. In order to improve sustainability performance of products, eco-design is an overarching concept. Process innovation means the implementation of a new or significantly improved production or delivery method (including significant changes in techniques, equipment and/or software) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Adams et al., 2016)</ref>. Cleaner production is an example of process innovation for environmental sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Adams et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Klewitz and Hansen, 2014)</ref>. Implementing environmental management system (EMS) including ISO 14000 is a typical example of organisational innovation for environmental sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Candi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wu, 2017)</ref>. Appendix A provides the definitions of Lean Management Practices (LMP), sustainability Oriented Innovation (SOI), Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices, Sustainability Performance (SP) and Economic Performance (EP), the variables that are used in this study.</p><p>LMP is by default economy focused <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Inman and Green, 2018)</ref>. Therefore, achieving overall sustainability through lean approach enables organisations to emphasize on achieving economic sustainability. On the other hand, SOI is responsiveness focused, which allows organisations to achieve overall sustainability through right trade off among economic, environmental and social factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Adams et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Yu et al., 2019)</ref>. Although there are studies on LMP and sustainability, and SOI through product, process, and organisation innovation, according to authors' knowledge there is no study that links both LMP and SOI with SMEs' supply chain sustainability performance. Moreover, although prior literatures have established that both lean and SOI are the enablers for achieving sustainability, their combined effect on sustainability performance of SMEs' supply chain remains unexplored.</p><p>Additionally, the mediating effect of environmental and social practices on LMP and SOI to achieve sustainability performance is also scant. The overarching goal of this research is to make SMEs sustainable. This paper aims to address the questions on how LMP and SOI are correlated to sustainability and economic performance, and if there is any mediating effect of CSR practices on the above relationship within SMEs in the Midlands, UK. Additionally, it also examines the mediating effect of SOI for LMP to achieve sustainability performance.</p><p>This study uses structural Equation Modelling (SEM) through AMOS software to reveal the stated relationship. The statistical software is widely used by researchers for SEM analyses due to certain advantages, such as the support for advanced SEM methods, the ability to create path diagrams or the direct access to fit indices for model validation. The contributions of this research are three foldsrelationship among lean management practices, sustainability oriented innovation, corporate social responsibility practices, and sustainability and economic performance of SMEs in the Midlands, UK; a diagnostic tool for SMEs' sustainable supply chain analysis, and means for achieving sustainability across SMEs' supply chain.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 elaborates the literature review explaining relevant constructs for sustainability analysis of SMEs' supply chain along with identifying knowledge gaps. Section 3 develops hypotheses for this study along with theorised model. Section 4 explains the methodology that has been used for analysing the data. Section 5 illustrates the results and section 6 provides discussion and conclusion of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature review</head><p>The theoretical underpinning of this study follows complementarity theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bergmiller and McCright, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Mahapatra et al., 2010)</ref>. Lean management practices and sustainability oriented innovation are organizational competencies that enhance organizations' competitiveness. These need strategic, policy and operational intervention to implement. LMP and SOI are complementary as one set of practices support the other.</p><p>In principle, LMP eliminates all forms of waste across the supply chain through appropriate supply, internal operations and demand management <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Inman and Green, 2018)</ref> to achieve efficiency. SOI is product, process, and organizational innovation for achieving sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Adams et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Martinez-Conesa et al., 2017)</ref>. LMP and SOI in combination are likely to help achieve higher sustainability through appropriate trade-off among economic, environmental and social criteria.</p><p>A systematic literature review is undertaken in order to explore the current state of knowledge on the relationship among LMP, SOI, CSR practices, sustainability performance and economic performance, and identify knowledge gaps. The following sub-sections first briefly define the sustainability constructs (lean management practices, corporate social responsibility, sustainability oriented innovation, and sustainability performance) that are considered in this study. Secondly, the correlations among the constructs are explored from prior literature. Finally, the knowledge gaps are established with appropriate rational for the current research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Corporate social responsibility</head><p>CSR is the combination of environmental and social practices that are strategy driven within an organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Martinez-Conesa et al., 2017)</ref>. Environmental and social practices across supply chain are also called green supply chain management practices, which include green product development, green design, green procurement, green manufacturing / operations, green logistics and green marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Luthra et al., 2011)</ref> and key aspects for achieving sustainability performance. For the green manufacturer, these processes, practices and techniques can result in lower costs, increased productivity and an enhanced image within consumers and community. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Sambrani and Pol (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Sarkis et al. (2011)</ref> present comprehensive literature on CSR. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Adams et al. (2016)</ref> via review presents a model for achieving sustainability oriented innovation. They reveal that SOI could be initiated through product, process and organisation level innovation to achieve higher sustainability performance. Operational optimisation (ecoefficiency), organisational transformation (new market opportunities) and system building (societal change) lead to SOI <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Adams et al., 2016)</ref>. Based on product life cycle concept, SOI could be achieved through sustainable product design and development using eco-design, design for the environment as well as for sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Khor and Udin, 2013)</ref>, reducing and eliminating hazardous materials, minimizing wastes <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Zsidisin and Siferd, 2001)</ref>, improving resource efficiency and preservation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Duflou et al., 2012)</ref>, increasing resource recovery by recycling, designing for reuse and remanufacturing <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Lee et al., 2001)</ref>, as well as increasing the aspects of sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Jaafar et al., 2007)</ref>; sustainable process through reducing energy consumption, waste reduction, and resource optimisation with the aim to reduce CO 2 emission <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Despeisse et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fang et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Jayal et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Pajunen et al., 2012)</ref>, sustainable supply chain management through sustainable warehousing <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Carter and Jennings, 2002)</ref>, sustainable packaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(James et al., 2005)</ref>, reverse logistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Prahinski and Kocabasoglu, 2006)</ref>, environmental purchasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Jimenez and Lorente, 2001)</ref>, sustainable end-of-life management through reuse, and remanufacturing or recycling <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Abdul-Rashid et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Sustainability oriented innovation</head><p>The above paragraphs reveal that there are commonalities and differences among LMP, CSR practices and SOI. LMP is efficiency focused, whereas CSR practices and SOI are responsiveness oriented. In other words, by adopting LMP SMEs are assured of achieving cost reduction but not guaranteed for better environmental and social performance. On the other hand, Practicing CSR and SOI will help SMEs to achieve superior environmental and social performance but will not assure achieving higher efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Sustainability performance</head><p>Sustainability from corporate perspective is defined as the right combination of economic, environmental and social aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Elkington, 1994)</ref>. A growing number of businesses are adopting green initiatives in order to achieve sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Teixeira et al., 2012)</ref>. Organisations achieve sustainability through economic outcomes and operational outcomes. Economic outcomes are financial benefits through return on investment and reduction of cost across the supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Eltayeb et al., 2011)</ref>. Business growth is another measure for economic outcomes. Operational outcomes (i.e. productivity) have direct relationship with sustainability performance, which leads to economic performance.</p><p>Environmental performance is highly dependent on energy usage, resource optimisation and waste reduction, which have direct relationship with CO 2 emissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Yusuf et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Social performance refers to enhancing quality of life of all the concerned stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Yusuf et al., 2013)</ref>. This is measured through CSR project investments, employee wellbeing initiatives, reduction of accidents etc. Social sustainability not only ensures that industries making profits, but also ensures that industrial activities do not cause social degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Tsai et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Economic performance</head><p>Economic performance is one of the pillars of sustainability performance and equivalent to business performance, which is measured throughproductivity, cost reduction, revenue, profit, cash flow, and business growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Lean and corporate social responsibility practices</head><p>Lean, and corporate social responsibility practices have many common aspects such aswaste reduction, resource efficiency, end-to-end supply chain management, workforce empowerment, transparency, community strategy, better quality and higher productivity.</p><p>Many authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Drohomeretski et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tang and Tang, 2017)</ref> argue that the main purpose of implementing green supply chain is to achieve efficiency. Through empirical survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hajmohammad et al. (2013)</ref> found the level of LMP to be positively associated with the CSR practices. However, a few CSR practices are capital intensive, and both short and long term efficiency is also not assured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">Lean and sustainability performance</head><p>Research on link between lean and sustainability performance is somewhat scant as indicated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Negrão et al. (2017)</ref> in their review paper. However, through case studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Azevedo et al., 2012)</ref> and analysis of secondary data <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Hong et al., 2014)</ref> studies have reported positive results of LMP on green performance. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hajmohammad et al. (2013)</ref> via survey among Canadian manufacturing companies found that a positive association between level of LMP and environmental performance was not supported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hallam and Contreras (2016)</ref> note that while LMP, and environmental and social practices share waste reduction as an objective, both the philosophies may also work against each other. LMP alone may not be able to achieve sustainability performance targets and never be enough to address all sustainability issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Inman and Green, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8">Sustainability oriented innovation and sustainability performance</head><p>New product development following sustainability practices (e.g. eco-design) enhances environmental and social performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Boons et al., 2013)</ref>. However, achieving economic performance is not assured. In a few cases, social performance may not get effected. With effective energy management, not only there would be reduction of energy consumption, in turn carbon footprint, but also help achieve efficiency through cost reduction. Increasing resource recovery by recycling, designing for reuse and remanufacturing <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Lee et al., 2001)</ref> may enhance sustainability performance. With effective energy management, the cost of manufacturing operations can be reduced significantly with increased flexibility and improved quality <ref type="bibr">(Schonsleben, 2007)</ref>. Sustainable supply chain practices (integrating various processesinbound and outbound logistics, internal operations, and both demand and supply sides management, along with SOI across supply chain) will have strong impact on sustainability performance. Sustainable end-of-life management has considerable effect on sustainable performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Wu, 2017)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Khor and Udin (2013)</ref> one should focus on recovering end-of-use products at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Recycling is the most common practice for sustainable end-of-life management since it creates economic value. Even though remanufacturing has less environmental impact compared to reuse and recycling, it is less implemented in practice as it requires extensive infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Amelia et al., 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.9">Lean manufacturing practices, Sustainability oriented innovation and sustainability performance</head><p>Though, LMP and SOI are two driving forces of today's business success, they are fundamentally different concepts, and some aspects of innovation may negatively impact a firm's ability to be successful by incorporating certain types of innovations. For example, should ideas/innovation that do not add value straightaway, but are likely to create value in the future, be eliminated from the current agenda following the lean principles? It is worth investigating, how innovation can be promoted by maintaining a good level of lean practices. This will require an investigation into impact of different supply chain practices on the performance measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Dey et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Malesios et al., 2018a,b)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Brown and Duguid (2002)</ref> business practices and innovation need to be established at the same time.</p><p>Lack of practices and creativity will result in less innovative ideas. The authors suggest that a balance between practices and innovative processes will help to attain sustainability in the firm.</p><p>Due to intense competition, SMEs business needs to be economy focused with reasonable agility so as to adapt to the dynamic business environment quickly <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Boiral et al., 2013)</ref>. Many SMEs adopt LMP formally and informally in order to achieve efficiency that help them to become environment friendly to certain extent (e.g. resource efficiency). SMEs also have accomplished several innovations in product development, process reengineering and organizational transformation, the main driver of which is achieving strategic fits through customer satisfaction and efficiency. SOI is lacking among the SMEs as achieving superior environmental and social performance is perceived as cost intensive. Moreover, supply chain integration through collaboration with customers and suppliers in different tiers is almost absent within SMEs across the world.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Conceptual model and hypotheses development</head><p>In view of the above, this study explores the combined impact of lean management practices and sustainability oriented innovation on economic and sustainability performance.</p><p>In doing this, a conceptual framework is developed based on the literature review and tested using structural equation modelling. The key constructs are also proposed to formulate the framework. The framework can be used as a guideline to select the most appropriate LMP and SOI practices to achieve desired sustainability performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Impact of lean management practices on economic and sustainability performance</head><p>Prior literatures reveal that LMP emphasize on resource efficiency, waste reduction, and productivity enhancement, which in fact contribute to better economic performance through cost reduction (Martinez-Jurado and Moyono-Fuentes, 2014). However, LMP may cause lower environmental and social performance of SMEs as LMP may abstain from implementing cost intensive environmental and social measures (e.g. by replacing energy intense machine, undertaking CSR projects, taking employee wellbeing initiatives) <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Rothenberg et al., 2001)</ref>. Energy efficiency in operating systems, by helping achieve lean as well as desired environmental and social targets, could be the best candidate to achieve overall sustainability of any type of organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Viesi et al., 2017)</ref>. However, capital cost of achieving energy efficiency could be a concern for many organisations and put them off from adopting this. Accordingly, we formulate the hypothesis 1 and 2. H1: LMP helps SMEs to enhance economic performance H2: LMP helps SMEs to enhance sustainability performance</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Impact of sustainability oriented innovation practices on economic and sustainability performance</head><p>Sustainability oriented innovation in SMEs could be performed within new product development, operational processes, organizational level and across the supply chain through most appropriate tradeoff among economic, environmental and social aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Adams et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wu, 2017)</ref>. SOI is responsiveness focused <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Adams et al., 2016)</ref> compared to LMP, which is efficiency focused <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Piercy and Rich, 2015)</ref>. Therefore, although SOI may not facilitate SMEs to achieve their economic performance, but quite likely to facilitate achieve environmental and social performance. Accordingly, hypotheses 3 and 4 are formulated.</p><p>H3: SOI helps SMEs to enhance economic performance H4: SOI helps SMEs to enhance sustainability performance</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Impact of lean management practices on sustainability performance with sustainability oriented innovation as a mediator</head><p>Although there are synergies between LMP and SOI as both the approaches aim to achieve resource efficiency, energy efficiency, and waste reduction with enhanced productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Adams et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Inman and Green, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wu, 2017)</ref>, however, the means for achieving the desired targets following both the philosophies are different. Therefore, it is worth empirically studying the impact of LMP on sustainability performance with SOI as a moderator. Accordingly, hypothesis 5 has been formed.

A structural equation modelling (SEM) methodology is used to process the data collected from SMEs in order to test the proposed seven hypotheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Hussey and Eagan, 2007)</ref>, according to the hypothesized sustainability model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data collection</head><p>The data used for this study has been collected from randomly selected manufacturing SMEs in the Midlands, UK. Manufacturing SMEs have been chosen for this study as manufacturing industry is one of the most polluting industries but also have undertaken several measures for reducing their impact. Manufacturing industries currently contribute 11% of GDP in the UK economy. Although this has been substantially reduced from a 25% in 1970, UK is likely to be within World's first 5 countries in manufacturing outputs by 2021 (current position is 8 th ). Midlands is the heart of manufacturing with the home of many manufacturing maestrosoriginal equipment manufacturers such as Rolls Royce; Jaguar and Land Rover, JCB, Bombardier, East Midlands train, Toyota, etc. Midlands is the home of many tier one and other suppliers that are within SMEs sector (employee number not more than 250).</p><p>A survey questionnaire (Appendix B) has been designed using the latent variables of the constructs (LMP, SOI, CSR, sustainability performance and economic performance) to gather quantitative data on sustainability practices and performances of SMEs in the UK, instead of collecting secondary data, e.g., by using GRI reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Gold et al., 2017)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the constructs, latent variables and proxies.  Initially a workshop was organized with the involvement of relevant researchers and SME managers along with a few representatives of policymakers (Birmingham and Derby City Council) to validate the questionnaire (Appendix B). Secondly, an initial pre-sample telephone survey was conducted on 20 SMEs in the Midlands, UK. This was accomplished in a period of one week. This helped to finalise the questionnaire following feedback from the pilot survey. The final data has been collected from a total of 119 SMEs in the Midlands. We have chosen SMEs from the region on the basis of their maturity of business and adoption of environmental management system.</p><p>Sampling was done based on the snowballing strategy. In particular, we have contacted close to three hundred SMEs in the Midlands of the UK via email and received consents for taking part in this research from around 150 SMEs. Interviews were done with few selected SMEs and further surveys were done by sending questionnaire through federation email. Hence the sample was small, focused and consisted of potential respondents. This ensured a high response rate of 50% and a minimum data cleaning effort in the survey. We interviewed each SME's representative via telephone or in person. Only 119 responses were considered eligible for detailed analysis. The sample of SMEs is from manufacturing industries that generally impact environment more than SMEs in other industries (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows demographic summary of the SMEs that responded to our survey).</p><p>The entire data collection took close to six months.</p><p>All variables in the questionnaire have been measured at a 5-point likert scale. Specifically, we measure lean management practices, sustainability oriented innovation, corporate social responsibility, economic performance, and sustainability performance through the questions as depicted in Appendix B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Statistical analysis</head><p>This section demonstrates statistical analysis using structural equation modelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bollen, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hussey and Eagan, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jöreskog et al., 1979)</ref> to test the proposed hypotheses (H1 to H7) establishing correlations among LMP, SOI, CSR, sustainability performance and economic performance (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). All the latent constructs used in the analyses are measured via the indicator variables developed from the responses obtained from the interviews with the SMEs' managers / owners (Appendix B). More specifically, in order to test the influence of the various latent variables of interest on the latent construct of sustainability, we fit a structural equation model, as hypothesized in section 6.</p><p>Structural equation models are a system where causal relationships are modelled between variables and latent factors. SEM consist of multiple regression equations for both observed and latent items that can be visually illustrated by graphical structures called -SEM diagrams‖ or -path diagrams‖. We have chosen the specific statistical method since the complex higher order structure of our research hypotheses constitute a typical SEM application. Further, SEM allows for observed or latent variables to be included as predictors or dependent variables and can handle the fit of complex model structures that assume different layers, such as the hypothesized structure of our modelling framework. Finally, SEM include more than one dependent variable.</p><p>Fitting a SEM model with maximum likelihood assumes multivariate normal data.</p><p>However, with non-normal data, for instance to apply structural equation modeling with ordinal variables, the method of Weighted Least Squares (WLS) is a typical alternative <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Jöreskog, 1994)</ref>, which is the estimation method followed in the current analysis.</p><p>In addition to the SEM analysis, we test for mediating effects as posed through the research hypotheses H5-H7. A variable may be considered a mediator to the extent to which it carries the influence of a given independent variable to a given dependent variable. The bootstrap approach introduced by Preacher and Hayes ( <ref type="formula">2004</ref>) is one of the most widely used methods to test the mediation hypotheses (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Adebanjo et al., 2016)</ref>. In the current study, the formal significance test for deciding on the absence or presence of a mediation effect, relying on a nonparametric bootstrapping procedure is utilized <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Preacher and Hayes, 2004)</ref>. The bootstrap test for the significance of an indirect effect is based on bootstrapping the sampling distribution of the mediation effect and subsequently deriving a confidence interval with the obtained bootstrapped sampling distribution. The advantage of this procedure is that no assumption about the shape of the distributions of the variables is made and can be applied to small samples with more confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Preacher and Hayes, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, we analyzed and calculated the mediating effects (i.e. both direct and indirect effects) through the bootstrap approach.</p><p>To assess fit of our SEM model, several alternative fit statistics are utilized (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Marsh and Balla, 1994)</ref>, such as the GFI (goodness-of-fit index), the AGFI (adjusted goodness-of-fit index) and the PGFI (parsimonious goodness-of-fit index). Typically, for a good fit the indices should be above 0.9, however this cut-off threshold has been often criticized. Another popular measure is the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and the residuals-based fit index of the standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR). For a good model fit, GFI and AGFI should approach one, whereas RMSEA and SRMR should be small (typically RMSEA less than 0.05 and SRMR less than 0.07).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Data analysis and results</head><p>The research hypotheses presented in the introduction section have been tested via the application of SEM modeling, and specifically through the utilization of the weighted least squares method <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Jöreskog, 1970)</ref>. Model estimation was performed with the use of the AMOS software <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Arbuckle, 2014)</ref>. Sample size selection for valid analyses and fit of SEM models in AMOS often depends on out-dated general rules of thumb, however recent studies suggest sample sizes ranging between 30 and 450 observations, depending on the complexity of the fitted model (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Sideridis et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Wolf et al., 2013)</ref>. The medium complexity, strong factor loadings of our fitted SEM model and minimum missing values indicates that the sample size of 119 responses is sufficient for correct model identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Wolf et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) has been performed in order to obtain information about the formulation of the latent factors and test their reliability and validity. Hence, the constructs and latent variables indicated by EFA and subsequently utilized for the SEM analysis are described below (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The Cronbach's α <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bollen, 1989)</ref> along with and the percentage of variance of the selected items explained by each of the latent factors is also presented. As we observe, the constructs utilized for the statistical analysis are adequately addressing the reliability and validity. In addition, the collected data do not seem to suffer from common method bias, since that the total percentage of variance explained by each single factor is much higher than 50%. SEM results in the form of standardized path coefficients are displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and corresponding significances along with support for the four direct hypotheses (H1-H4) are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>. As one observes from the fit of the Model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> below and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>), LMP is proven to be a significant factor for achieving sustainability (path coefficient is +0.473; significant at the 0.05 level), thus verifying research hypothesis H2.</p><p>Also, looking at the standardized regression weights, it is seen that LMPs are highly positively associated with economic performance, completely verifying hypothesis H1 (path coefficient is +0.996; significant at the 0.01 level). Regarding research hypotheses H3 and H4, we see that both of the latter are supported by the data, with a stronger verification being observed however, for the H3 hypothesis (path coefficient is +0.958; significant at the 0.01 level), indicating a positive and very strong association between SOI and economic performance. SOI is also a significant moderator of sustainability as revealed by the SEM results (path coefficient is +0.405; significant at the 0.05 level).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>) Next, we examine the support by our data of the indirect research hypotheses H5-H7, associated with mediating effects of SOI and environmental/social practices on LMP and SOI, respectively. Hence, we analyzed and calculated the mediating effects (i.e. both direct and indirect effects) through the bootstrap approach and the corresponding results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sustainability</head><p>First, our findings seem to support an indirect mediation effect of SOI in the relationship between LMP and sustainability (hypothesis H5). Indeed, while the direct effect of LMP and SOI is negligible (direct effect is 0.049; non-significant), the indirect effect of the former construct on sustainability through SOI is statistically significant (indirect effect is +0.327; significant at the 0.05 level). Similarly, regarding hypothesis H6, it is observed that indeed CSR (environmental and social) practices is a mediator factor between LMP and sustainability, since that the indirect effects of SOI on the association between LMP and sustainability are statistically significant at the 0.01 level of significance (indirect effect is 0.569).</p><p>Finally, although we do not have strong evidence to reject research hypothesis H7, since the indirect association between SOI and sustainability through the CSR mediator is statistically significant (indirect effect is +0.103; significant at the 0.1 level), however significance is at the borderline while the direct effect between SOI and sustainability is strong and positive (direct effect is 0.517; statistically significant at the 0.01 level of significance). In overall thus, the bootstrap analysis results for mediation effects offer in general support for hypotheses H5-H7. </p></div>

Secondly, the limitations of the study are elaborated. Thirdly, the practical implications of this research are explored and finally, the scope for future work is stated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Discussion on results / findings</head><p>Sustainability could be achieved through the right combination of economic, environmental and social factors and it is the major concern of today's business <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Dey et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Dües et al., 2013)</ref>. SMEs' sustainability is crucial for every economy as they contribute largely to gross domestic product and additionally employ a major portion of workforce of any economy. However, SMEs contribute negatively to environment not individually but collectively. Therefore, the drivers that contribute towards enhancing sustainability of SMEs need attention. SMEs are different from larger organisations with respect to their policies and strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Perrini, 2006)</ref>, and therefore, SMEs supply chain sustainability has been discussed separately in literature. Lean management practices lead to achieving sustainability <ref type="bibr">(Dey et al., 2019)</ref>. However SMEs find it difficult to implement. SMEs struggle with finance to adopt lean management practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Chiarini, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Moreira et al., 2010)</ref>. The sustainability oriented innovation of SMEs is discussed as a facilitator for their sustainability <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Klewitz, and Hansen, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Prior studies reveal that LMP and SOI are the enablers for achieving sustainability of supply chain. Although prior studies examined the impact of each LMP and SOI separately on sustainability performance there is no work that reveals the impact of both LMP and SOI collectively on sustainability performance of SMEs' supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Piercy and Rich, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The present study explores and investigates the combined impact of lean management practices and sustainability oriented innovation on SMEs' supply chain sustainability performance and economic performance empirically. Additionally, we examine the mediating effect of CSR practices to correlate LMP and SOI with sustainability performance. This enables SMEs to identify means for achieving sustainability through right combination of LMP, SOI and CSR through their respective constructs.</p><p>The underpinning of this research is to answer the question of whether lean management practices in combination with sustainable oriented innovation could enable right trade off among economic, environmental and social performance in order to make SMEs more sustainable. The main purpose of this empirical research is to investigate the potential effects of LMP and SOI on sustainability performance and economic performance.</p><p>Additionally, we have examined three under-examined associations, relating to (a) the mediating effects of SOI in the relationship between LMP and sustainability performance, (b) the mediating effects of CSR practices in the relationship between LMP and sustainability performance and (c) the mediating effects of CSR practices in the relationship between SOI and sustainability performance within SMEs in the Midlands of the UK.</p><p>We reveal that LMP and SOI are both positively associated with sustainability performance. Our findings are at a large part consistent with prior research. In particular, we have found that LMP effects sustainability performance in a positive way, in accordance with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Inman and Green (2018)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Moreira et al. (2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">), Vinodh et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">King and Lenox (2001)</ref>, and despite the contrasting results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Rothenberg et al. (2001)</ref>. We additionally contribute to the limited research on the effect of SOI on sustainability performance, finding again a positive effect of the former on the latter latent construct, through SEM modelling. These results come as verification to our initial argument that LMP and SOI in combination may help SMEs to achieve higher sustainability performance levels.</p><p>Hence, we may say that LMP and SOI are complementary practices since they support each other in enhancing sustainability.</p><p>Our results also verify the economic focus of LMP, since we have found a strong and positive effect of LMP on the latent structure of economic performance. Similar strong positive effects, however, have been found for the SOI on the economic performance, in contrast to existing research (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Piercy and Rich, 2015)</ref>, since that SOI is perceived as more responsiveness focused compared to LMP, which is efficiency focused.</p><p>According to previous research, the associations between SOI and CSR practices are non-conclusive (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Adams et al., 2016)</ref>, thus a significant research gap remains when considering relationship between CSR and SOI <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Martinez-Conesa et al., 2017)</ref>. We contribute on this issue, by finding moderate positive associations between the two constructs, for the UK SMEs. Previous literature argues in favour of positive effects of SOI on environmental and social performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Piercy and Rich, 2015)</ref>. On the other hand, however, noteworthy is the finding of the strong and positive direct effect of LMP on CSR practices. This finding is in contrast with previous research which argues that LMP causes lower environmental and social performance for SMEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Rothenberg et al., 2001)</ref>.</p><p>There is scant literature for examining the mediation effects of SOI on the relationship between LMP and sustainability performance. Hence, it is useful to empirically examine the impact of LMP on sustainability performance with SOI as a mediator. Our findings indicate a significant positive indirect effect from LMP to sustainability performance through the mediation of SOI. This implies that Midlands based SMEs with lean management practices will achieve better sustainability performance if they also have sustainability oriented innovation implemented. This is in line with the complementarity theory.</p><p>Additionally, the mediating effect of CSR practices on both LMP and SOI to achieve sustainability performance is rare <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Adams et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Inman and Green, 2018)</ref>. Our analysis also reveals that improvement in sustainability performance of the UK SMEs do not come only through LMP and SOI, but also mediating effect of CSR practices. On one hand, LMP along with SOI help to achieve SMEs sustainability performance. On the other hand, both LMP and SOI through implementation of CSR practices enable achieving enhanced sustainability performance.</p><p>This study also contributes a conceptual framework for sustainability performance measurement with four major constructslean management practices, sustainability oriented innovation, corporate social responsibility and sustainability performance. The latent variables act as sub-constructs and data could be gathered in line with the proxies related to each sub-construct. The framework will enable to measure the current state of SMEs sustainability performance and means for improvement. Data collected using the proposed performance measurement framework can be processed using multiple criteria decisionmaking method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Dey and Cheffi (2013)</ref> demonstrate a multiple criteria based sustainability performance measurement framework, which uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process.</p><p>Lean management practices and sustainability oriented innovation are organizational competencies that not only help achieve efficiency but also responsiveness in line with stakeholders' satisfaction. LMP brings efficiency and SOI emphasizes on responsiveness.</p><p>Combining both LMP and SOI, SMEs achieve sustainability across their supply chain.</p><p>Additionally, CSR practices helps enhance sustainability performance. This clearly depicts the alignment of the findings of this research with complementarity theory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Limitations of the study</head><p>This study focuses on the lean management practices and sustainability oriented innovation of SMEs (manufacturing) in the Midlands of the UK. Additionally, only corporate social responsivity practices is considered as mediator. There are many studies that have conceptualized the sustainability performance measurement through different constructs and antecedents. External pressure from customers and policymakers, and internal obstacles are the popular moderators for the sustainability analysis in many recent studies. The data has been gathered from limited number of SMEs (119) in the UK. The latent variables and proxies are also limited (see Table <ref type="table">3</ref> and Appendix B). Average experience of the responders is 12 years. As SEM uses perceptions of the responders, the correctness of the perceptions is very important in order to reveal the overall results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Practical implications</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> demonstrates the correlation between lean management practices, sustainability oriented innovation, economic performance and sustainability performance.</p><p>Although LMP assures higher economic performance, LMP alone is not adequate for SMEs to achieve higher sustainability performance. SMEs' managers / owners aspiring greater sustainability performance need to implement sustainability oriented innovation through ecodesign, green supply chain management and adopting environmental management system in strategic level along with lean management practices. Similarly, SOI alone may also help achieve higher economic performance. However, sustainability performance of SMEs improves marginally when only SOI implemented. Adopting CSR practices through appropriate environmental and social measures along with LMP and SOI will help SMEs achieve higher sustainability performance. The effectiveness of implementing LMP, SOI and CSR will depend on the roles of each stakeholder across the SMEs' chain. Individual SME owners/managers must undertake diagnostics of their current state through sustainability analysis using the constructs, and in line with the findings of the analysis, improvement measures will be pursued. Both industry consortium and policymakers need to foster positive environment for motivating SMEs to implement a combined lean management practices, CSR and sustainability oriented innovation planning. Both customers and suppliers must incorporate sustainability constructs in their procurement contracts. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Scope for future work</head><p>A similar study could be undertaken in other industries and varied geographical locations. Additionally, comparative analysis across the industries and geographical locations would be very interesting. The objective of the study is to reveal combined effect of LMP, SOI, CSR practices on sustainability and economic performance and accordingly the model has been formulated with limited constructs. However, the model could be more robust with several constructs and moderators (external pressure, internal obstacles etc.). Effect of lean management practices and sustainability oriented innovation on sustainability and economic performance could be derived using other quantitative methods (e.g. data envelopment analysis, multiple criteria decision-making techniques such as the analytic hierarchy / network process, goal programming, fuzzy theory etc.) and qualitative approaches such as ethnographic study, case study, and grounded theory. This study uses complementarity theory. However, resource based and institutional theories could also be deployed. Finally, we did not consider identifying the commonalities and differences of LMP, CSR and SOI as one of our research objective / question in this study. Additionally, economic performance is considered as one of the pillars of sustainability performance. Therefore, we did not develop any hypothesis to examine the correlation between economic and sustainability performance.</p><p>Future studies may look at the commonalities and differences of all these variables.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>. The model incorporates five constructs (lean management practices, sustainability oriented innovation, Environmental and social management practices, sustainability performance and economic performance) and seven hypotheses. The model is designed to test the combined impact of LMP and SOI on sustainability performance of SMEs.</figDesc></figure>
