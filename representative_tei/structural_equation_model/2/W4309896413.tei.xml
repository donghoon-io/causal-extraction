<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Due to China's massive usage of fossil fuels, climate change concerns have become serious challenges to the country's sustainable development. Despite the fact that China has effectively employed solar technology to address these problems, there is a paucity of research examining consumers' intention to adopt solar energy in the rural region of China. This study intends to fill this gap in the literature by studying consumers' buying intentions for solar energy in rural China for household purposes. Additionally, the study added to the theory of planned behavior by adding three new variables, namely, environmental knowledge, environmental concern, and beliefs about the benefits of solar energy. Primary data were collected from 847 respondents in Hebei Province using a comprehensive questionnaire survey. Structural equation modeling was employed to examine the data. Empirical results revealed that attitude, environmental knowledge, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and beliefs about the benefits of solar energy positively influence buying intention of solar energy. On the contrary, environmental concern had no significant effect on buying intention for solar energy. Study outcomes emphasize the critical significance of changing societal norms, boosting consumer awareness, redesigning regulatory mechanisms, and stressing the benefits provided by solar power through coherent and persistent efforts while simultaneously enhancing environmental sustainability practices.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Massive dependence on thermal energy sources imposes a strain on the national economy and contributes to a variety of environmental issues, including climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, and unusual weather patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hao et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Wu et al. 2021)</ref>. Natural resources are being depleted due to the overuse of conventional fuels <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Liu et al. 2022)</ref>. Therefore, it is necessary to build a new energy framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Wang et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Yang et al. 2022</ref>). Renewables will be employed in this modern energy system, which may bring down the price of imported oil and ameliorate climate issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Tanveer et al. 2021)</ref>. In this regard, solar power is viewed as a viable means to combat environmental change and address climate problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Liang et al. 2022)</ref>. Numerous economies have made measures to increase solar energy's part in their energy portfolios. Residents' quality of life may be improved in several ways through solar power initiatives. For instance, solar energy may reduce emissions, creates new employment possibilities for inhabitants that promote economic development, provides inexpensive energy, and is anticipated to stabilize future power costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Irfan et al. 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The deployment of solar energy in China is critical for three fundamental reasons, as shown by past research. Firstly, the conventional fossil-fuel reliance strategy for electricity production failed to provide the desired results for addressing climate change issues in the country and was a failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Luo et al. 2022)</ref>. Secondly, China has been acknowledged as an economy having climate vulnerability challenges. Nonetheless, reliance on traditional thermal power might bring the country to an unfavorable climate change position <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bai et al. 2022)</ref>. Lastly, China has massive solar power potential that, if adequately used, might mitigate the current climate and energy challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Sun 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Prior research was conducted mostly in nations with welldefined carbon emission reduction policies. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Heiskanen and Matschoss (2017)</ref> conducted a research in Europe and found that age, education, and income had a substantial impact on the likelihood of families adopting renewable energy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Li et al. (2020)</ref> analyzed Australia's transition to renewable energy sources. Results revealed that the country is aggressively adopting renewables, positively impacting the climate. Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Jamil et al. (2015)</ref> analyzed the deployment of renewables in the United Arab Emirates. The analysis revealed that despite its abundant oil sources, the country is growing the renewable industry to combat carbon footprints in the future.</p><p>However, social acceptability and buying intentions of renewable energy, particularly solar energy, in developing nations have been examined by few researchers. In this context, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Yazdanpanah and Forouzani (2015)</ref> surveyed to investigate students' buying intention towards renewable energy. According to the survey findings, attitude, moral norms, and perceived behavioral control substantially impact respondents' buying intention of renewable energy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Mosly and Makki (2018)</ref> investigated the societal propensity to adopt renewables. Researchers concluded that as educational attainment rises, so does knowledge of renewable. Similarly, age and economic circumstances are key factors of renewables' acceptance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Yuan et al. (2015)</ref> performed a study in the Chinese province of Shandong to determine the societal acceptability of wind power. Residents have a good opinion of wind energy, according to the survey findings. Nonetheless, their willingness for measures such as installing wind turbines in their backyards or accepting increased power bills lowers. Low consumers' readiness impedes solar energy penetration and prevents the achievement of national goals, indicating that consumers' buying intention plays a crucial role in the deployment of solar energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hai 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Until now, the majority of studies has focused on examining these relationships within the following dimensions: (i) different power sources, rivalry, and power generation potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Ren et al. 2021</ref>); (ii) the effect on economic development, environmental pollution reduction, and economic expansion; and (iii) the barriers to the adoption of solar energy. Some scholars have seen the impact of intent aspects such as knowledge, attitude, social norms, perceived behavioral control, and solar energy costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Alsabbagh 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Jabeen et al. 2021)</ref>. Though the new factors (proposed in this study), such as environmental concern, environmental knowledge, and beliefs about the benefits of solar energy, which could influence consumers' buying intention of solar energy are discussed to some extent in previous literature with the integration of TPB, researchers used these factors in different time and regions with different findings. Furthermore, in the case of China, these novel factors were never taken into account in any setting before, which warrants a comprehensive analysis. This study gap motivated us to contribute to the available body of knowledge by understanding consumers' buying intention of solar energy in China.</p><p>In this regard, three main contributions are drawn by this study. Firstly, in contrast to earlier research, this study addresses a gap in the literature by examining all of the elements that may influence solar energy buying intention. According to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study undertaken in China's Hebei Province to determine consumers' buying intention of solar energy. Due to recent economic development and massive population growth, the province is facing severe energyrelated challenges, necessitating the urgency to perform comprehensive research to determine the social acceptance of solar energy technologies. Secondly, the theory of planned behavior (TPB) is expanded by integrating 3 unique dimensions, which may impact consumers' buying intention. Incorporating these factors for the first time in the Chinese context is a further contribution made by this work that other scholars have not done. Finally, the current study extends the research results in a manner distinct from earlier studies. For example, environmental knowledge proved to be a critical dimension in solar energy adoption. In the same vein, beliefs about the benefits of solar energy remain a crucial component of TPB's theoretical framework. In contrast, environmental concern has little impact on solar energy acceptability.</p><p>This research comprehensively investigates the propensity of Chinese customers to adopt solar energy by combining current and proposed novel factors. Concerning the significance of the study results, although the research was conducted in a specific region (China), the implications of the study findings indicate households' intention characteristics to use solar energy. China can meet all of its existing and future energy needs if its rich solar energy resources are used effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chen et al. 2017)</ref>. Nonetheless, China is an emerging economy, confronting numerous challenges to the growth of solar power, such as technological limitations, the reluctance of inventors to participate in solar energy schemes, and governmental, and financial impediments <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Liu 2018)</ref>. The variables mentioned above and the continuing energy issues are also prevalent in other emerging economies. Along these lines, the findings of this study are not region-specific but are transferable to other emerging economies and specify the influence of intention factors on solar power utilization. The example of China can be used as a typical illustration to govern this phenomenon. Consequently, the experiences obtained from this study will provide important lessons for other countries during the formulation of solar energy-related strategies.</p><p>The rest of the study is divided into different sections: theoretical framework and hypotheses development are provided in the "Research framework and formulation of hypotheses" section. Research methods are elaborated in the "Methods" section. Data analysis is given in the "Data analysis" section. Discussion and implications are provided in the "Discussion" section. Finally, a conclusion is provided in the "Conclusions and policy recommendations" section, along with valuable and essential policy proposals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research framework and formulation of hypotheses</head><p>Consumers' decision-making is a complicated process; several factors influence the purchase decision, including social, psychological, and economic factors. Many researchers proposed different frameworks to know consumers' buying intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Shakeel et al. 2018)</ref>, for instance, self-efficacy theory, the theory of reasoned action, social cognitive theory, and the TPB. However, TPB was adopted and constantly remained notable among all research frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Madden et al. 1992</ref>). This theory predicts individuals' intention to perform such behavior. Based on this theory, we establish the theoretical framework (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>With TPB's model, consumers' behavior can be identified and forecasted. Many scholars expanded the theoretical model to better understand why some people cannot keep good intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abreu et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bashiri &amp; Alizadeh 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Walters et al. 2018</ref>). In addition to the fundamental components of the TPB model, the model can integrate other essential factors that influence consumers' behavior specifically. We thoroughly studied previous literature and incorporated three additional variables, i.e., environmental knowledge, environmental concern, and beliefs about the benefits of solar energy, with other variables with the TPB model to inquire about the buying intention of solar energy technologies. Environmental concern had an insignificant effect on buying intention of solar energy technologies as people do not care about saving the environment through sustainable consumption. While the other factors, i.e., environmental knowledge, beliefs about the benefits of solar energy, and other TPB variables, significantly affected buying intention of solar energy technologies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attitude</head><p>Attitude has been recognized as a predictor of behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Casaló &amp; Escario 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen (1985)</ref> opined that people with a positive attitude towards action should perform the Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> Theoretical framework desired action. In addition to other independent variables of TPB, the relation between attitude and behavior specifying the degree to one's advantageous or non-advantageous assessment of the behavior remains a query <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ajzen 1991)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Wang et al. (2011)</ref> explain attitudes as people's understanding of power-saving behavior mainly leaning on evaluating power-saving partiality and the information individuals hold for such behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Greaves et al. (2013)</ref> concluded that attitude towards behavior represents a person's total behavior assessment, based on the belief that the behavior will produce the desired results. Several studies show that green attitudes are essential predictors of pro-environmental behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Yadav &amp; Pathak 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Greaves et al. (2013)</ref> researched a sample of 2000 staff of a specific company in the UK through TPB. The study shows that attitudes and extended TPB variables consist of significant divergence in staff ambitions to engross environmental behaviors, including energy preserving by switching computers off. Based on this debate, the following hypothesis was formulated:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1: Attitude is positively related to buying intention behavior of solar energy technologies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental knowledge</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Zsóka et al. (2013)</ref>, ENK means "knowledge and awareness about environmental problems and possible solutions to those problems." People tend to avoid situations where uncertainty and knowledge are insufficient to guide behavior. Therefore, people with high ENK are impatient to carry out eco-friendly behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Frick et al. 2004)</ref>. Individuals with positive ENK recognize their activity's outcomes on the environment; this realization establishes action-based knowledge in their cognitive psychology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Pothitou et al. (2016)</ref> conducted a household survey evaluating the influence of ENK and knowledge on energy issues on potential pro-environmental behavior. A study confirms that people with more knowledge (about energy) are more likely to buy renewable energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Zografakis et al., 2010)</ref>. Thus, it shows a strong association with ENK and BISETs and is formulated as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2: ENK is positively related to buying intention behavior of solar energy technologies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental concern</head><p>Environmental concern (ENC) is defined as people's understanding of environmental problems and their eagerness to fix these complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hoang et al. 2019)</ref>. Consumers with more ENC tend to react positively regarding attitudes, which positively impacts behavioral intentions. From a policy point of view, environmental issues may be an incentive because environmental issues seem to be liberated from the attractiveness and worthwhile of energy-efficient behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Urban &amp; Ščasný, 2012)</ref>. ENC is an important variable in studying environmental behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Albayrak et al., 2013)</ref>. ENC is mainly said to be the environmental attitude in different studies, which means one's opinions affect the motive regarding environmental behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chan et al. 2014)</ref>. Some empirical studies positively relate the overall importance of the environment associated with a product and consumer satisfaction (Y.-S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chen et al. 2015)</ref>. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Zhang et al. (2015)</ref> determined ENC as the acknowledger self-observed liability for energy conservation. Thus, environmental concern has a relationship with buying intention of consumers and is formulated as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3: ENC is positively related to buying intention behavior of solar energy technologies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective norm</head><p>A perceived social provocation of performing or not performing a certain behavior is labeled as subjective norm (SBN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gadenne et al. (2011)</ref> detect a strong linkage between subjective norms and consumers' intentions regarding the environment and energy-saving behavior. SBN also means an individual's feelings of social pressure faced by other individuals or groups of people <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chen &amp; Tung 2014)</ref>. In Korea, SBN directly affects consumers' buying intention for energy-efficient appliances <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ha &amp; Janda 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">López-Mosquera et al. (2014)</ref> concluded that SBN would either motivate or obstruct an individual's act if there is social pressure. SBN is a significant role player in energy saving or buying intentions of green energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Zhang et al. 2015)</ref>. The above statements show a positive relationship between subjective norm and buying intention of green energy technologies, so we put forward the following hypothesis:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H4: SBN is positively related to buying intention behavior of solar energy technologies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived behavioral control</head><p>Perceived behavioral control (PBC) refers to an individual's comprehended mitigate or struggles in carrying out precise behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ajzen 1991)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Wang et al. (2014)</ref> revealed that PBC significantly affects behavioral aims among Chinese inhabitants in the viewpoint of energy-saving behavior. PBC significantly affects small-scale households' sustainable energy utilization intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Alam et al. 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Klöckner (2013)</ref> elaborated that it estimates an individual's degree of possessing chance and capacity to bring off a behavior. PBC is part of the most popular TPB theory and is elaborated in many research fields, including purchasing behavior and intentions. Different authors refer to it in recent studies in different fields, and it is verified as a substantial factor of behavioral intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(López-Mosquera et al., 2014)</ref>. PBC is stalwartly related to one's beliefs concerning the influence of situational and internal factors to facilitate the behavior. If there is a check over the energy-saving of such a product, it will most probably be used by that individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Alam et al. 2014)</ref>. The above discussion shows that there is a positive relationship between perceived behavioral control and buying intention of green energy technologies. Along these lines, we put forward the following hypothesis:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H5: PBC is positively related to buying intention behavior of solar energy technologies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beliefs about the benefits of solar energy</head><p>Devine-Wright (2005) elaborated that many households in the UK support renewable energy development. The research results depicted that local consumers' interest in using renewable energy products was high while the number of locals was low. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Diakoulaki et al. (2001)</ref> described that installing and operating renewable energy systems can benefit three categories: decrease in environmental pollution, energy-saving, and generation of new working posts. One of the authors believes that social acceptance of renewable energy technologies is not yet on the shelf other than the actual deployment of renewable energy technologies and policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Sposato &amp; Hampl 2018)</ref>. The most significant benefit of solar energy sources is a decrease in pollution of the environment. It is only possible by reducing other fuel-based energy production systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kalogirou 2004)</ref>. It shows a positive outcome upon the usage of S sources and its benefits on RE technologies so that the hypothesis will be as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H6: BSE is positively related to buying intention behavior of solar energy technologies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Buying intention of solar energy technologies</head><p>A previous study confirmed that Canadian peoples' intention to purchase solar energy technologies is influenced by visual publicity of these technologies, engagement of the public, and perceived knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Parkins et al. 2018)</ref>. Their results depict the vital significance of solar technology to people who intend to purchase it. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Yuan et al. (2011)</ref> assessed social acceptance from an end-user perspective in Shandong province. The results showed significant high-level acceptance of solar water heaters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hsu (2018)</ref> conducted research on local consumer solar installations in California and revealed that cities with high proportions of pro-environment, larger population size, and municipal utilities are more interested in solar energy technologies and processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Aklin et al. (2018)</ref> examined the social acceptance of solar power in rural areas of northern India. The findings show a manipulation from private businesses in which the cost of solar energy with conventional grid energy limits locals from accepting solar energy technology. Although many studies are conducted on the acceptance or adoption of SE technologies, a standard TPB was used to get results <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Perri et al. 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Target population</head><p>Our study specifically targeted the rural areas of Hebei province of China, including Anxin, Boye, Dingxing, Fuping, and Gaoyang. China is focusing on developing underdeveloped regions. It is being noticed that many rural dwellers are slowly shifting towards populated and developed cities, searching for good opportunities, education, and businesses. China is the main hub of green energy production, while some rural regions still deploy green energy solutions to prevent further environmental damage. Demographically rural inhabitants are unaware of purchasing green energy technologies, as they are less aware of new technology. Hence, we selected these cities to determine our research outcomes. We selected these regions depending on their population size. Anxin has a population of 513,000, while Boye has 272,000, Dingxing 610,000 M, Fuping 230,000, and Gaoyang 325,000, respectively (National Bureau of Statistics of China 2021). These areas are less populated, and the growth ratio regarding development is slightly low, due to which these regions got mere attention for analysis purposes.</p><p>Due to the recent pandemic, some hurdles were faced with collecting the data. Due to language barrier to collecting data accurately from respondents, we performed an online questionnaire survey. The area was far from the current residence city, with COVID-19 waves and restrictions on moving to other cities, which led us to opt for an online survey strategy. All the items were analyzed using a 5-point Likert scale from 5 "strongly agree" to 1 "strongly disagree." Considering the scale, we had a sample size of 1000 respondents, of which 847 valid responses were collected for analysis purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Developing questionnaire</head><p>Table 1 reports data sources and questionnaire development. The questionnaire consists of two sections. "Introduction" section has five questions, related to demographics, including gender, age, education, income, and occupation. "Research framework and formulation of hypotheses" section consists of 39 questions based on each construct to assess the findings of our proposed research. In these parts, we had seven questions for subjective norms, seven for beliefs about the benefits of solar energy, seven for attitude, five for environmental concern and environmental knowledge, and four for PBC and BISETs. Questionnaire details are provided in the Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>We used AMOS (26.0) for structural equation modeling and the statistical program for social sciences (SPSS 26.0) to conduct our research analysis. To check the relationship between each variable, SEM is used to get meaningful and valid results <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Steenkamp &amp; Baumgartner 2000)</ref>. Keeping account of measurement errors, SEM measured all the dependent and independent variables, while most other methods cannot estimate measurement error <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Sardeshmukh &amp; Vandenberg 2017)</ref>. We opted for this technique due to its robustness and reliability in results <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Belaïd 2017)</ref>. Based on these arguments, it is evident that SEM is the best and most efficient method to evaluate relationships among all the variables. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> presents the descriptive statistics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants' profile</head><p>Most respondents fall in the male category with a total of 493 (58.2%), while females were around 354 (41.8%). In addition, the young respondents aged 19-28 were 132 (15.58%), respondents aged 29-38 were 253 (29.87%), and 39-48-year-old respondents were 259 (30.57%) in majority from all age ranges, followed by respondents aged 49-58 years who were 157 (18.54%) and respondents aged above 58 who were in low quantity (46, 5.44%). On the other hand, 87 (10.27%) respondents belong to low education below the secondary level, which is the lowest. We also go through their income; respondents with income below 1500 RMB<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> were 259 (30.58%), while a majority of them (316 (37.31%)) have income ranging from 1501 to 3000 RMB, followed by 3001-5000 RMB in 125 (14.76%) respondents, and 147 (17.35%) respondents fall above 5001 RMB income. For occupation, there were 259 (30.58%) respondents with their own business, 213 (25.15%) employed as government person, 325 (38.37%) having a private job, and 50 (5.9%) being freelancers. Statistics are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discriminant validity and convergent validity tests</head><p>We used correlation analysis to check the interrelationship between variables, and after analyzing the test, the results showed a significant correlation between variables. Applying the square root of the average variance extracted, we investigated discriminant validity. The results generated support for discriminant validity, as the square root of AVE is greater than its correlation with other variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahmad et al. 2020</ref>). An alternate method to discover discriminant validity is by comparing AVE by MSV value with all variables. If AVE is greater than MSV, discriminant validity is achieved <ref type="bibr">(Fornell &amp; Larcker 1981)</ref>. The results support AVE values of variables greater than MSV values. After that, we conducted convergent validity analysis using AVE and item loadings to check the potential association between these items <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Wong 2013)</ref>. Results confirm that the AVE values for every variable are greater than 0.5, which clears that these variables hit the benchmark and have 50% more variance. The test is shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reliability analysis</head><p>To validate regarding reliability of each item, we employed Cronbach-α. The minimum acceptable value of Cronbach-α is 0.70, and the results indicate that all variables crossed the benchmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Anderson &amp; Gerbing 1988)</ref>. To investigate the consistency of all variables items, we endorse composite reliability (CR) analysis. The results depict higher values of CR than the suggested value of 0.70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hair et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">5</ref> provides the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multicollinearity</head><p>A regression test is executed to check the multicollinearity issues to find tolerance and variance inflation factor (VIF) values. The value of VIF should not be greater than 0.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Field 2013)</ref>. According to the results, this model does not have any multicollinearity issues because values of VIF and tolerance are within the suggested range of each variable and are in line <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Strupeit &amp; Palm 2016)</ref>. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factor analysis</head><p>EFA has opted to obtain contributing design structure as it investigates factor structure in which relation of variables and grouping between them depending upon inter-variable correlations is to be found <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Mahmood et al. 2019)</ref>. We used the maximum likelihood method to extract the variables and analyzed them with promax Kaiser normalization to gain valid outcomes. The number of variables was determined with the help of eigenvalues. We performed different tests and methods to examine whether EFA is fit to be applied to data <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Deng et al. 2013)</ref>. To check the fitness of the data, we performed the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test and Bartlett's test of sphericity (BTS). The outcomes indicate the value of 0.979 for KMO and prove to continue factor analysis further <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kaiser 1974)</ref>, while on the other side, BTS reveals a value of 9945.37. Analogously, communality result values indicate that all variables have a higher number than the minimum benchmark value of 0.4 (Table <ref type="table">7</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Osborne et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The data was further scrutinized by utilizing confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to identify the model. It approves the structure of the factors gained in EFA. For identification, we evaluated the uni-dimensionality of the model. Items consisting of robust loadings are sustained (more than 0.7) <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Truong et al. 2020)</ref>. Finding reveals that all item loadings were above the benchmark of 0.7 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). All the data </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural model and hypothesis outcomes</head><p>After the results and reliable measures, we tested our hypothesis link with each other and the presented model. The value of R 2 was determined to be 0.74, indicating a significant clarification as it exceeded the advisable value of 0.35 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Cohen 2013)</ref>. The results depict a high f-value which shows linearity between all linkages. We also performed various fitness tests to make sure our data is perfect for the presented structural model (i.e., CFI = 0.996, NFI = 0.971, IFI = 0.994, TLI = 0.991, GFI = 0.984, RMSEA = 0.023, X 2 /df = 1.156, and SRMR = 0.020) falling into the suggested criteria that reveal the structural model and fit to our data <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lucianetti et al. 2018</ref>) (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">8</ref>).</p><p>The graphical illustration and structural paths are in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. The path coefficients of the variables "attitude," "environmental knowledge," "subjective norms," "perceived behavioral control," and "beliefs about the benefits of solar energy" H1 (β = 0.09, p &lt; 0.01), H2 (β = 0.01, p &lt; 0.05), H4 (β = 0.10, p &lt; 0.001), H5 (β = 0.19, p &lt; 0.05), and H6 (β = 0.06, p &lt; 0.001) indicate that the variables ATD, ENK, SBN, PBC, and BSE have significant effects on BISETs. Consequently, we accepted hypotheses 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, while on the opposing side, hypothesis H3 was not validated (β = 0.68); hence, it was refused (see Table <ref type="table">9</ref> for hypothesis validity and hypothesized paths).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Consumers' attitude towards buying intention of solar energy technologies was found to have a positive relationship. The outcomes reveal that consumers' attitude towards adopting energy-efficient technologies is high, and they intend to buy such technologies. Similar findings were reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Greaves et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">López-Mosquera et al. (2014)</ref>. They conclude a high correlation between consumer buying intention and adoption of RE technologies which declares that the relation between these variables is positive. Thus, in the early stages, the Chinese government should revert people's minds to specific technologies so that potential customers can opt for future solar energy technologies.</p><p>Environmental knowledge is the key to triggering or boosting consumers' purchase intention. The results of our study depict a significant positive effect of ENK on BISETs. Although in previous studies, it has less weight on consumers to convert into RE technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chan et al. 2014)</ref>. The past discovery shows that consumers do not react to the preconditions of environmental behavior until they are educated about the actual circumstances. Hence, it is clear that ENK is crucial in increasing awareness about solar energy technologies to develop buying intention. Also, the government must create a public awareness campaign to make people's minds towards these technologies and convert them from traditional energy systems to conventional solar energy technologies by showing the pros and cons.</p><p>The results confirmed that environmental concern has no significant relation to buying intention of solar energy technologies, as previous studies showed similar results to our findings in Chinese rural areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Shakeel et al. 2018</ref>). There might be no such urge to opt for these new renewable energy technologies or have buying intentions. Contrary to previous studies, consumers' intentions to purchase solar energy technologies are triggered by environmental concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Liu et al. 2013)</ref>. Possible outcomes might be linked with government policies that never direct consumers towards purchasing energy-efficient technologies that preserve the environment and create less pollution than traditional technologies that are harmful. Another factor can be a mindset to buy cheap products rather than useful and future-proof solar energy technologies. The government should imply such policies or environmental awareness campaigns to decide better to purchase these RE technologies.  The findings specify that consumers' buying intention of solar energy technologies is affected by subjective norms. These results are consistent with former studies of Chen (2016) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Jayaraman et al. (2017)</ref>. Word of mouth is a powerful tool to spread awareness about something. A circle with friends, family, or office colleagues can spread something positive or negative about anything beneficial or not useful for them, leading to decision-making in moment minutes, hours, or days. The excellent experience of one consumer of specific solar energy technology can lead to positive results in adopting such technologies, while terrible experiences have a reciprocal effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ali et al. 2019)</ref>. As mobile phones and social media applications are commonly used in China, the positive image of such technologies can be easily spread to urge consumers further to purchase such technology.</p><p>Since the development of TPB, previous researchers confirmed PBC as a significant factor of pro-environmental behavioral intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chen &amp; Tung 2014)</ref>, while there exist some studies which did not find any significant effect in their outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Greaves et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">López-Mosquera et al. 2014)</ref>. Current outcomes depict a positive association between PBC and BISETs. While results indicate that consumers have proper control, resources, and ability to adopt these RE technologies under consideration, they are likely to do so.</p><p>The results show a positive relationship between BSE and BISETs, while BSE strongly influences BISETs. Outcomes are consistent with former scholars' analysis, which depict consumers' buying intention to the specific technology they believe in its benefits. The citizens incorporate solar energy technologies by distinguishing the differences or actual benefits between ordinary energy origins (Colmenares-quintero et al. 2020). There must be a possibility as the Chinese government is briefly advertising the benefits of solar energy technologies and people prefer them. While a strong awareness is rapidly increasing among China's people towards adopting such technologies, their belief about it is boosting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and policy recommendations</head><p>This study examined the solar energy technology buying intention in rural regions of China by incorporating novel factors (i.e., beliefs about the benefits of solar energy, environmental concern, and environmental knowledge) in our conceptualized framework of TPB. We fetched the data by generating a questionnaire and getting responses from the rural area of China and analyzed it using SEM. Outcomes revealed that ATD, ENK, SBN, PBC, and BSE positively affect buying intention of solar energy technologies. In contrast, environmental concern has an insignificant effect on consumers' buying intentions.</p><p>China is a developing country with rapid growth in the vast type of technologies. The country contributes to renewable energy and has deployed such technologies in different regions. Although the world is shifting towards sustainable energy technologies, solar energy technologies are the priority for energy generation purposes. Our study conclusion suggests that the government should rapidly deploy these technologies to rural regions, provide a sense of knowledge about these technologies, and inform people about such technologies that consume low energy. Along these lines, it is proposed that the government create a massive promotional program in rural regions to educate people about these new technologies and their benefits to the environment and society for a better future.</p><p>The results of our study can help policymakers and developers pursue these regions and gather more information to implement such technologies for their people. The government of China should give more subsidies to the renewable energy sector to develop sustainable energy. People's intention towards purchasing these solar energy technologies will increase if they are cheap and eco-friendly to the environment. The government can also provide an opportunity for such developers with excellent knowledge to produce such technologies and provide tax relief to decrease pressure from one side and produce The study also has some limitations. First, we use TPB as the theoretical framework. However, basic or original TPB is now not considered for theoretical underpinning because its parsimony and validity have been questioned <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Sniehotta et al. 2014)</ref>. Subsequent researchers should develop their theoretical frameworks using other relevant theories. Secondly, due to COVID-19 and travel restrictions, only rural regions of Hebei Province were selected for data analysis, which might raise the generalizability concern about the study results. Future studies can tackle this issue by including rural regions of other provinces to enrich the data sample. Finally, performing the levelized cost of electricity and cost-benefit analysis would be interesting in future studies to strengthen the existing knowledge pool. </p></div>
