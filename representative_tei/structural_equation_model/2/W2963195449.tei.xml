<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Nowadays, with the development of the Word Wide Web, e-learning system provides many benefits to individuals and organizations. Additionally, it enables the employees to access the training materials from any way at any time which have overcomes the many challenges with the traditional training methods. Also, such system offers an enjoyable training environment due to the presentation of the materials in various forms (e.g. video, audio, animation and etc.). Furthermore, with the increasing demand to improve the employees' skills and knowledge reflecting on their work performance and their productivity, web based training system enables the organizations to offer the training for their employees without any adversely effect on work performance. Additionally, web based training reduces the training cost and time and support the customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, not many studies have been conducted to the acceptance of such system <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> till now. Therefore, this study investigates the acceptance of web based training.</p><p>In the meantime, research on acceptance of e-learning system by universities' students and organizations' employees has generated interest of a lot of information system researchers. They have identified many constructs that influence people intention to use e-learning system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>. These researchers had used many models and theories to explain the acceptance of information technology. In this respect, the modern model had been used to describe such acceptance is Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use Technology (UTAUT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. As far as, there is no trail to extend this theory to include other successful factors for e-learning system acceptance. This study makes an effort to extend the original UTAUT to include three critical success factors in the e-learning context including, system flexibility, system enjoyment and system interactivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.0">THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use Technology (UTAUT)</head><p>The acceptance of web based training system may be treated as information system acceptance. As previously mentioned the modern theory in this field is UTAUT <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. This theory could predict the acceptance of an information system in approximately 70% of the cases. Comparing with TAM, it could only predict the acceptance of an information system in approximately 40% of the cases. On the other hand, the validity of UTAUT in the information system context needs further testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore in this study the extended UTAUT with some of information system successful factors that mentioned below in this section is going to be tested. Thus, the following hypotheses have been proposed for this study. H1. Performance expectancy will have direct effect on the employees' intention to use web based training system. H2. Effort expectancy will have direct effect on the employees' intention to use web based training system. H3. Social influence will have direct effect on the employees' intention to use web based training system. H4. Facilitating conditions will have direct effect on the employees' intention to use web based training system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">System Flexibility</head><p>Many scholars introduced the perceived flexibility as one of the critical factors to understand user's behavioral acceptance of e-learning system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>. Flexibility of e-learning system was defined as the degree to which individual believes that he/she can access the system from anywhere at any time <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Adapting this construct to examine the acceptance of web based training system by public sector's employees suggests that they will accept web based training system if they believe that they can access the system from anywhere at any time. Hsia and Tseng <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Sahin and Shelley <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, Nanayakkara <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Lim et al. [13]</ref> argued that perceived flexibility of e-learning system positively influence user's intention to use e-learning system. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed.H5. System flexibility has a positive effect on employees' intention to use web based training system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">System Interactivity</head><p>Although, few studies have paid attention to this factor, Abbad et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> suggested that system interactivity has indirect impact on the user's intention to use e-learning system through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Additionally, Davis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> found that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use fully mediates effect of system's characteristics on user's intention to use the e-mail technology. Consequently, because many scholars agree that perceived performance expectancy and perceived effort expectancy similar to perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> the following hypotheses are proposed. H6. System interactivity has a positive impact on perceived performance expectancy. H7. System interactivity has a positive impact on perceived effort expectancy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">System enjoyment</head><p>In the effect of perceived system enjoyment, many studies indicated that perceived system enjoyment has direct effect on user's intention to use e-learning system and indirect effect on the user's intention through perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Thus, the following hypotheses are proposed. H8. System enjoyment has a direct impact on perceived performance expectancy. H9. System enjoyment has a direct impact on perceived effort expectancy. H10. System enjoyment has a direct impact on employees' intention to use web based training. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.0">RESEACH METHODOLOGY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data collection method</head><p>A questionnaire has been designed and used to collect a data. This research is going to measure eight constructs and the questionnaire was divided into nine sections. The first section includes information regarding the characteristics of respondents (e.g. age, gender, having personal computer, having internet access, having experience with e-learning system), while each one of other sections includes questions that measure each of this research model constructs. The total number of questionnaire's items is 43. Each item is measured using 7point-likert scale. All such items have been adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Sampling and Content Validation</head><p>The validity is concerned with reducing the possibility of getting incorrect answers during the data collection period <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. In this research, content validity was carried out through questionnaire pre-test process <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>, while, the questionnaire was modified based on the comments which were received from ten employees who responded to the questionnaire before it was distributed to the sample of study.</p><p>In total, five hundred (500) questionnaires had been distributed to the public sector's employees in Jordan. Eventually, only two hundred and ninety employees at a response rate of 58% had successfully completed and returned the questionnaire. Lately, the Structural Equation Model (SEM) approach and AMOS software was used to analyze the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.0">DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Measure Reliability and construct Validity</head><p>AMOS 16.0 statistical software (structural equation model) was used to evaluate the construct validity and the reliability of the measurement. Interestingly, the following equation was used to measure the composite reliability (∑ factor loading)2 / (∑ factor loading)2 + ∑ measurement error. As well as, the average variance extracted (AVE) was measured to examine the convergent validity using the following equation AVE= ∑ (factor loading)2/∑(factor loading)2 + ∑ measurement error. The results of composite reliability and convergent validity tests provided evidence of the validity of the measurement's items, since the reliability and validity of all the constructs have exceeded the recommended level of 0.7 (see table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">The Measurement Model</head><p>In order to assess the overall metric model fit, five measures have been applied namely, ratio chisquare to degrees of freedom (X2/d.f.), Root Mean Square of Error Approximation (RMSEA), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Goodness of Fit Index (GFI), and Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI). The final model of this study was obtained through the process including deleting items, since seven teen items (PE RMSEA's value is below the 0.08 threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, GFI value is above the 0.9 threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, AGFI value is above the 0.8 threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, while CFI value is above the 0.9 threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> presents the values of previous model-fit measures. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Structural Model and Results</head><p>In the previous section, CFA was performed to assess the model's goodness of fit and loading of the research constructs with items which were used to measure them. In this section, a path analysis for structural model was conducted to examine the hypothesized relationships that help to predict employees' intention to use web based training system. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> explains the structural model with the assessed path coefficient and the adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) scores, while table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the overall results of hypotheses' examining.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. Research structural model</head><p>The findings of this study revealed that all of the proposed relationships are accepted and statistically significant. Additionally, according to the modification indices (SEM analysis) there were three new significant relationships: (i) between Effort Expectancy (EE) and Performance Expectance (PE), (ii) between System Flexibility (SF) and Performance Expectance (PE), and (iii) between Facilitating Conditions (FC) and Effort Expectancy (EE). These three relationships have been intervened within the structural model, (see table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Interestingly, the first hypothesis (H1) revealed that performance expectancy will have direct effect on the employees' intention to use web based training system. This hypothesis was accepted, since the statistical result showed that there is strong significant relationship between the performance expectancy and employees' intention to use web based training system (.107***) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Additionally, the second relationship (H2) indicated that effort expectancy has direct effect on the employees' intention to use web based training system. This hypothesis was also accepted, since statistical result indicated that there is strong relationship between effort expectancy and employees' intention to use web based training system (.175***) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Otherwise, statistical results revealed that there is new significant relationship between effort expectancy and performance expectancy (.228***) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). This result is consistent with that Taylor and Todd <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> and Davis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> who indicated that effort expectancy (ease of use) has affected on performance expectancy (usefulness) and user attitude.</p><p>Furthermore, third hypothesis (H3) indicated that there is significant relationship between social influence and employees' intention to use web based training system. Consequently, statistical results indicated that there is relationship (0.091***) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>) among social influence and user's intention to use web training (H4). This finding has supported the findings of Venkatesh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref> and Venkatesh and Morris <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>. Focusing in this relationship, it can be assumed that, employees pay much attention about the opinions of other people who are important to them, when they intend to use web training system. Otherwise, the opinions of the people who important for employees (e.g. their managers) influence them to use web training system.</p><p>Additionally, fourth hypothesis (H4) indicated that facilitating conditions have direct effect on the employees' intention to use web based training system. This hypothesis was accepted, since the statistical result revealed that there is a strong relationship (.257***) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). This result has also been confirmed by <ref type="bibr">Thompson et al. [22]</ref> and Ajzen <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, it is contrast with Venkatesh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref> who argued that the facilitating conditions does not have effect on an individual's intention to use an information system, but it have direct effect on the actual use beyond that explained by behavioral intention.</p><p>Similar to other studies Hsia and Tseng <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>; Nanayakkara <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Lim et al. [13]</ref>, the relationship between Flexibility of web based training and employees' intention to use web training (H5) has been confirmed (.265***) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). This relation possibly indicates that, a trainer intends to use a web training system, if he/she believes that he/she can access the system from anywhere at any time. In other words, trainees will participate in the e-training process if they believe that they can choose their training equipment and time themselves. Furthermore, similar to Hsia and Tseng <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> study, this study found that there is also relationship between system flexibility and performance expectancy (0.243***) (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</p><p>System interactivity is concerned. Since it refers to degree to which employees believe that web based training can provide interactive communication between members of organizations and trainees and between trainees themselves. This study provides evidence that system interactivity has direct effect on the performance expectancy (0.1**) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>) (H6) and effort expectancy (.132***) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>) (H7). That possibly means when the employees intend to use web based training to interact with members of organization (e.g. help disk) and together, they also believe that web based training will enhance their training performance and make the training much easy. This result is in contrast with Abbad et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and similar to <ref type="bibr">Lim et al. [13]</ref> and Davis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>As regard to the eighth hypothesis (H8), ninth hypothesis (H9) and tenth hypothesis (H10) which revealed that system enjoyment has a positive impact on perceived performance expectancy, on perceived effort expectancy, and on the employees' intention. These hypotheses were accepted, since statistical results showed that system enjoyment has a strong impact on performance expectancy (.337***) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>); has a strong impact on effort expectancy (.419***) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>); and has direct effect on the employees intention (.219***) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). These results were supported vary previous studies. Such as Chatzoglou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and Abbad et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> found that there are significant relationships between system enjoyment usefulness (performance expectancy), ease of use (effort expectancy) and behavioral intention. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.0">CONCLUSION AND RESEARCH LIMITATIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Conclusion</head><p>This research has been conducted to collect data from organizations' employees in Jordan; in order to examine the acceptance of web based training system by those employees. The results of this research has indicted that six factors, namely facilitating conditions; performance expectancy, effort expectancy, system flexibility, system enjoyment, and social influence, have direct effect on the employee's intention to use a web based training system. Furthermore, system interactivity, system enjoyment, system flexibility, and facilitating conditions, have affected the performance expectancy and effort expectancy.</p><p>These results showed that the employees intend to use web based training system due to improve their training and complete it more quickly, since performance expectancy have strong effect on their intention to use web based training system.</p><p>Additionally, one of the study contributions is, this study found that perceived system flexibility impacts intention of the employees to use web based training system, thus, web based training system's designers should assure that the system's components is accessible from anywhere at any time. Further, the employees pay much attention for the opinions of people who are important for them (e.g. their supervisors or their peers); since the result showed that social influence impacts the employees' intention. Knowledge and resources which necessary in the training process are concerned, since the result indicates facilitating conditions have a strong effect on the employees' intention to use web based training system. Therefore, managers should take into their account employees' knowledge and resources which are needed in training process, in order to motivate them and increase their interest to use web based training system.</p><p>Furthermore, the employees should feel joyful and can contact other people (e.g. other trainees, trainers or organization's members) during a training process, in order to realize the performance expectancy and effort expectancy of training process, since the statistical result indicate that system enjoyment and system interactivity have direct effect on the performance expectancy and effort expectancy, and have indirect effect on the employees intention to use web based training system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Research Limitations and Future Research</head><p>The first limitation of this research relates to sample size, since small one was taken into consideration (290). Second, other limitation relates to measurement items, whereas just high rate items (α) were taken into consideration. Additionally, further research should pay attention to employees' characteristics (such as, computer anxiety and computer self-efficacy) and assess changing of these characteristics over the time. Furthermore, as prior mention regards lack of relevant studies, thus, more studies should be conducted in this context (acceptance of an information technology by public sector's employees) to support this study's findings.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
