<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Adolescents' self-evaluation is an expressive form of their self-concept.

Personality traits and psychological status were directly associated with adolescents' self-evaluation (personality trait→ self-evaluation, β=0.78 and K6→ self-evaluation, β=0.39).</p><p>Conclusions: The use of SEM offered a detailed analysis of the correlations between parental bonding, personality traits, and psychological status, and a systematic approach to investigate their direct and indirect effects on adolescents' self-evaluation. The three factors were directly associated with adolescents' self-evaluation and parental bonding had an indirect effect on adolescents' self-evaluation that was mediated by both personality traits and psychological status.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Developing a clear and multifaceted self-concept is an important goal in adolescence. Self-concepts are de ned in the developmental literature as selfperceptions related to speci c domains, roles, or social contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Although some speci city in self-concepts are developed earlier in childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, these self-perceptions become increasingly complex and differentiated across adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, presumably due to both the cognitive development and social changes experienced during adolescence.</p><p>Adolescents' self-evaluation is an expressive form of their self-concept. A person with a positive cognitive core self-evaluation in his adolescence, probably has con dence and hope for the future life that encourage him to make continuous efforts to solve problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Recently, the society from all walks of life has attached more importance to self-evaluation issues among adolescents and the factors in uencing contemporary adolescent selfevaluation are multidimensional and complex. Here, we nominate three main groups of factors: rst, factors related to the family of origin; such as the relationships between the family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Parents are the earliest social environment for children, and play a unique and signi cant role in the development of adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Parental bonding was identi ed as one of the crucial factors in children' self-evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The second group of factors that affects adolescents' self-evaluation is related to the personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> which contribute to the diversity in personal, emotional, motivational and social behaviours of adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Compared to parental bonding and personality traits, little research has been done on the impact of the third group of factors; the psychological status of adolescents on their self-evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Adolescents with negative core beliefs, attachment anxiety, or low self-esteem were described as exhibiting behaviors that re ect a negative self-image and then compensate for that, which implies that they act in accord with negative self-patterns in order to gain positive self-respect <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Although studies have respectively investigated the associations of parental bonding, personality traits, and psychological status on adolescents' selfevaluation, no study has combined all the three factors together nor examined the relations between them so far. Therefore, we aimed in this study to ll this gap and provide a new perspective in examining the associations between these three factors in their pathways to affect the adolescents' selfevaluation. Based on the evidence presented previously, the hypotheses were formulated as follow: H1: Parental bonding is directly associated with adolescents' self-evaluation. H2: Personality traits are directly associated with adolescents' self-evaluation. H3: Psychological status is directly associated with adolescents' self-evaluation. H4: Parental bonding is indirectly associated with adolescents' self-evaluation (mediated by personality traits and psychological status).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Sources and Participants</head><p>The data for this study were obtained from the China Social Science Survey Center, Peking University, which is one of the Chinese Family Panel Studies (CFPS) for which samples were collected from all over China in 2010. The study had collected data over four rounds, however, the data analyzed in this research was only from a single-round collection in 2014. The details of the study protocol and sampling method can be found elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. In brief, the CFPS sample was a multi-stage probability sample extracted by implicit strati cation method. The samples of subsampling frame were extracted in three stages. The rst-stage sampling (primary sampling units, PSUs) were counties (or county-level cities/districts) listed in descending order by a socioeconomic indicator. The second-stage sampling (Secondary sampling units, SSUs) were resident committees and administrative villages from counties (or county-level cities/districts). The third and nal stage sampling (Tertiary sampling units, TSUs) were households from resident committees and administrative villages. At the rst two stages in the sampling process, o cial administrative entities were used. The administrative structure in China has two important features: rst, it is strictly hierarchical; and second, at least in theory, it covers the entire population of China exhaustively, without exception. Moreover, to minimize sampling frame errors, in the third stage it was the random starting point of the circular isometric sampling method that was used to extract sample households. The study was designed to include, interview and consider all members over the age of 9 years in a sampled household as core members of the CFPS.</p><p>Adolescents in this study were students aged 10 to 15 years old in east, north, south, central, northeast, northwest and southwest regions of China.</p><p>Among 2519 recruited adolescents from 2229 families, 1627 adolescents from 1358 families were excluded from the analysis because they had not a clear self-concept of themselves and chose the answer "I don't know" when asked questions about self-evaluation. Only 892 adolescents from 871 families included in the study with relatively complete and signi cant study questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaire design</head><p>To improve the operability of the questionnaire survey, a preliminary survey of 783 adolescents was conducted in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong provinces in 2008 and 2009. Those 783 adolescents were excluded from the formal study because the nal questionnaire had been modi ed according to their feedback. The study is based on the CFPS self-administered questionnaire for adolescents aged 10 to 15 years that covered basic information on age, gender, living condition, educational level, type of residence, self-evaluation, parental bonding instrume-nt, personality traits, and psychological status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-evaluation</head><p>Adolescents' self-evaluation consists of three scales: the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale for children (NLCS-C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and the Self-Discipline Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale consisted of 10 questions and answers were on a 4 -point Likert scale (1) "totally disagree" (2) "disagree" (3) "agree" and ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) "totally agree", with some questions were reverse scored. A higher nal sum score for all the ten items indicated higher self-esteem. The NLCS-C scale consisted of 40 yes/no answered questions with a low score indicating internal locus of control and a high score indicating external locus of control. The Self-Discipline Scale based a 5 -point Likert scale (1) "Disagree strongly" (2) ", Disagree a little" (3) "Neither agree nor disagree" (4) "Agree a little" and (5) "Agree Strongly" of 12 questions, a higher score indicates optimism and higher perceived self-e cacy. However, existing and mature scales from foreign countries have been introduced to China, and the researchers are also faced with the problems of measuring validity and reliability. Because Chinese people tend to be conservative in their responses to the scale, they tend to choose neutral answers rather than the most suitable ones, which leads to the inaccurate measurement results. In dealing with this problem, the researchers of CFPS has added or deleted items and modi ed their scoring to include (1) "totally disagree" (2) "disagree" (3) "neither agree nor disagree" (4) "agree" and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) "totally agree" to reduce the probability that respondents improperly choose the middle option <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The Cronbach's alphas for respective three scales were 0.88, 0.82 and 0.70.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parental Bonding Instrument, Personality Traits and Psychological Status</head><p>In order to make the scales conform to Chinese people's answering habits and thinking mode, and to reduce the inaccurate measurement results, the researchers of CFPS have modi ed these scoring scales a little and re-measured the validity and reliability of the scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The Parental Bonding Instrument introduced by Parker et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> was used with a 14-item measure of differences in parental bonding and responses were scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from (1) "never" (2) "rarely" (3) "sometimes" (4) "often" and (5) "always"; Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.80. The Responsibility Scale that was used to assess the personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> was derived from a sub-scale of the Big Five Questionnaire-Children produced by Barbaranelli et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> with a 12-self-reported items rated from (1) "totally disagree" to (5) "totally agree" and its Cronbach's alpha was 0.77. The psychological status was measured using the <ref type="bibr">Kessler 6</ref> Psychological Distress Scale (K6) by Kessler <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The scale consisted of 6 items scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from (1) "always" (2) "often" (3) "sometimes" (4) "rarely" and (5) "never". Some of the items were reversely scored so that the high total score indicates positive psychological status. The Cronbach's alpha for this scale was 0.649. Statistical analysis SPSS 25.0 and AMOS V-24.0 were used for data analyses. The participants' characteristics were presented as number and frequencies. In order to examine the theoretical model which contained the targeted factors, a type of multivariate analysis method, structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied. Initially, a model contained the nal scores of parental bonding instrument, personality traits scale and psychological status scale with the adolescents' self-evaluation domains was designed. Then the estimated value and signi cance level of each parameter were obtained. After that, the bivariate correlation analysis (BCA) was used to observe the correlation among the included factors. After the analysis results are con rmed, the proposed hypothesis model was veri ed and tted with the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis of AMOS. The proposed model was con rmed by examining the goodness of t statistics, which indicted a ratio of the chi-square (χ 2 ) to the degree of freedom (df), a goodness of t index (GFI), adjusted goodness of t index (AGFI), comparative t index (CFI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The de nition of satisfactory goodness of t was χ 2 /df &lt; 2.0, GFI &gt; 0.95, AGFI &gt; 0.90, CFI &gt; 0.97, and RMSEA &lt; 0.05, while the standard of acceptable goodness of t was χ2/df &lt; 3.0, GFI &gt; 0.90, AGFI &gt; 0.85, CFI &gt; 0.95, and RMSEA &lt; 0.08 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The chi-square difference test was used to check the nested models and if the complex model tted a higher degree of the data when compared to the simpler model <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. By comparing the Akaike information criterion (AIC) value of the models, a nested model is proved to be a signi cant well-tting model if it was associated with at least 50 units reduction in the measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline characteristics</head><p>The baseline characteristics of study participants are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. A total of 892 adolescents from east (15.1%), north (11.3%), south (14.0%), central (19.7%), northeast (10.2%), northwest (16.0%) and southwest (13.6%) China, included 485 (54.4%) males and 407 (45.6%) females were included in the current study. The sample was composed of 365 (40.9%) adolescents living in urban areas and 527 (59.1%) adolescents from rural areas. The average age of total, male and female adolescents was 10.72 (SD = 0.892), 10.71 (SD = 0.832) and 10.72 (SD = 0.959) years respectively. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlations</head><p>The mean, standard deviation (SD) and Pearson correlation coe cients of the targeted variables are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The results show that the score of parental bonding instrument correlated with scores of the self-evaluation domains, including self-esteem, self-discipline and NLCS-C (r from 0.119 to 0.265, P &lt; 0.01). The personality traits score was reasonably associated with K6 score of psychological status and personality traits score (r = 0.185 and 0.157, P &lt; 0.01, respectively). At the same time, personality traits score was correlated with all self-evaluation domains' scores (r from 0.156 to 0.364, P &lt; 0.01), with the strongest correlation was observed with self-esteem (r = 0.364). Meanwhile, K6 score (psychological status) was moderately correlated with some self-evaluation domains, which were the self-esteem score (r = 0.250, p &lt; 0.01) and NLCS-C score (r = 0.126, p &lt; 0.01) speci cally. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural equation model</head><p>In the initial model, was assumed that self-evaluation was affected by the scores of parental bonding instrument, personality traits and psychological status. The unsatisfactory t of the initial model was revealed by the measures of model t (χ 2 /df = 12.214, GFI = 0.961, AGFI = 0.908, CFI = 0.793, RMSEA = 0.112), especially whose AIC was 133.929 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</p><p>To optimize the model, several signi cant paths were added and a revised structural equation model was speci ed in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The measures of the revised model t (χ 2 /df = 2.876, GFI = 0.994, AGFI = 0.977, CFI = 0.977, RMSEA = 0.046) indicates that the revised model has a satisfactory t.</p><p>Furthermore, given that the AIC for the revised model (47.255) was lower than that of the initial model (133.929); thus, the revised model was more suitable for the data than the initial one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Signi cant relationships between observed variables</head><p>As path with the standardized coe cients for each factor was provided in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> presented the direct, indirect and total effects of the scores of parental bonding instrument, personality traits and K6 (psychological status) on the self-evaluation scores calculated with both unstandardized and standardized coe cients. Using the standardized coe cients, the path coe cients of variables measured at different scales within the same model can be directly compared. In the revised SEM, parental bonding instrument has a great direct and indirect in uence on selfevaluation (direct β = 0.28; mediated by personality traits and K6 β = 0.21, and total effect β = 0.49), while K6 was directly related to self-evaluation (β = 0.39). Additionally, personality traits have the strongest positive total (direct) effect on self-evaluation (β = 0.78). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This is the rst empirical study to use the SEM approach to investigate the in uence of parental bonding, personality traits and psychological status on self-evaluation of Chinese adolescents, which presented a comprehensive study of mechanisms for the parental, personal and psychological impacts on adolescents' self-concept. The SEM analysis has demonstrated that parental ponding, personality traits and psychological status played signi cant positive roles in the self-evaluation of Chinese adolescents.</p><p>The current study ndings indicated that parental ponding was a determining factor of Chinese adolescents' self-evaluation. The score of parental bonding instrument was not only directly associated with self-evaluation, but also had an indirect association with self-evaluation mediated by personality traits and K6 scores (total effect = 0.49). During adolescence, adolescents are vulnerable to the harm of adverse stimuli, which would cause some learning and psychological problems and reduce their self-evaluation. In such situations, there is no doubt that the parental effects will not only limit to the role in their children's growth and development, but will also extend to the ways by which the adolescents interact with these harmful stimuli. In a recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, it was indicated that adolescents who perceived no parental support were 4-times likely to have mental health problems compared with those who perceived a strong support from their parents (adjusted odds ratio = 3.80, CI: 2.81-5.13). Personality traits and K6-measured psychological status mediated the association between parental ponding and self-evaluation of adolescents, besides their direct in uencing effects on self-evaluation, which a rms the previous study ndings that pointed to concrete psychological mechanisms in terms of mentality and personality for parental ponding affecting adolescent self-evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</p><p>The study found that not only parental ponding had signi cant effects on self-evaluation among Chinese adolescents but also those adolescents with higher scores on personality traits scale were more likely to have higher self-evaluation (total effect = 0.78). Personality traits are persistent and universal positive or negative attitudes towards people or things <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Adolescents with high personality traits score usually have constant a rmation and ability to complete daily tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>; thus, personality traits are a crucial factor in the improvement of adolescents' self-evaluation, which was consistent with previous studies' ndings <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. Therefore, in the progress of enhancing self-evaluation, the development of personality traits merits is a major consideration.</p><p>As indicated by the results, psychological status, measured by K6 scale was also associated with the self-evaluation in Chinese adolescents (total effect = 0.39). Psychological status acts as a major internal motive for improving psychological and physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> and a few previous studies had investigated this association and reached supporting conclusions that adolescents with poor psychological status were prone to a negative selfevaluation, considering themselves inferior to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. Consequently, those adolescents with distressed psychological status were vulnerable to lose their courage and determination to surmount di culties and experienced greater emotional instability (higher neuroticism), which can lead to a reduction in individual self-evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Therefore, not coincidentally was the positive correlation between self-evaluation and K6 scores observed in this study. In the view of this, it is essential to ameliorate the psychological status of adolescents for improving their self-evaluation.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figures</head><label></label><figDesc>Figures</figDesc><graphic coords="10,28.00,486.53,490.92,209.27" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>From the view of practical signi cance, with the aim of raising the level of self-evaluation among Chinese adolescents, compared to interventional measures that target a single variable of either parental bonding, personality traits or psychological status of the adolescents, simultaneous interventions that take in consideration the mentioned three variables should be formulated and conduced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The causal associations between variables cannot be deduced because of the cross-sectional nature of this study. Besides, the associations between the variables may be over-or under-estimated, since the study was conducted by self-reports from only one source. Last, about 60% of the interviewed adolescents did not submit a relatively complete research questionnaire, especially the question about self-evaluations, so they were excluded from the study in the process of selecting the population. Although, those participants were probably not having a clear self-concept of themselves, the characteristics of them did not differ than those of the included adolescents in terms of sociodemographic data, health status, and scores for parental bonding instrument, personality traits, and psychological status scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Factors in uencing Chinese adolescent's self-evaluation included parental bonding, personality traits and psychological status. Findings of this research contributed to the scarce empirical evidence regarding the factors determining the adolescent's self-evaluation. The direct and indirect effects of parental bonding, personality traits and psychological status in the association's paths towards self-evaluation and its domains (self-esteem, selfdiscipline and NLCS-C were supported by the SEM (path analyses).</p><p>Abbreviations CFPS: the Chinese Family Panel Studies. K6 the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. SEM the structural equation modeling. PSUs: primary sampling units. SSUs: Secondary sampling units. TSUs: Tertiary sampling units. NLCS-C: the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale. BCA: the bivariate correlation analysis. χ 2 : the chi-square; df: the degree of freedom. GFI: goodness of t index.
