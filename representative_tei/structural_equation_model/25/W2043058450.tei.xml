<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose -A large variety of online communities have emerged during the last years as a result of the challenges faced by both the business and scientific worlds. This trend has also been promoted by the development of internet and new Web 2.0 technologies. In this context, this paper is focused on the determinants of success of online communities. But, as a difference from other studies, these determinants are analyzed from the social network analysis perspective. Several constructs related to the community organization as a social network are proposed and their interrelations are hypothesized in a general research framework. The obtained results test the proposed model providing the most relevant antecedents of the project success. Design/methodology/approach -A case study based on Linux ports to non-conventional processor and environments is used to test the proposed model. Structural equation modeling analysis is used to validate the structural proposed model. Findings -The main antecedents of online communities' success, quantifying the strength of the relation through the standardized path coefficients.</p><p>Research limitations/implications -The research is limited to a particular set of online communities engaged with the development of the non-conventional Linux ports. However, they constitute a representative set of communities in the field of the open source projects (OSS) development, which are typically developed using a community of support. Originality/value -This paper fulfils the main antecedents causing the successful development of Internet virtual communities. Instead of using sources of data coming from users' surveys, this study employs community interactions as a source of data. Results have important implications over the development of online communities, like software business models based on virtual communities and open source software.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The notion of community has been at the heart of the internet since its inception <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lesser et al., 2000)</ref>. Initially, internet was used by scientist to share knowledge, collaborate on research and exchange messages, and today, million of internet users worldwide communicate themselves using electronic tools. The advent of Web 2.0 and social software have propitiated the organization of users around communities of interest. The distinctive feature of these online communities is the intensive use of electronic media for people getting in contact. Although intuitively everyone seems to understand the concept of "online community", there is no agreed definition (De Souza and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Preece, 2004)</ref>. This is due to the multidisciplinary nature of this topic, which can be analyzed from different perspectives. The theoretical background behind online communities has been treated by numerous authors. For instance, some authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Preece, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Amin and Roberts, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Albors et al., 2008)</ref> highlight the connection of online communities with the social learning theory and communities of practice developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wenger (1998)</ref>, while others are focused on their relation with knowledge sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kuk, 2006)</ref>, knowledge creation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lee and Cole, 2003)</ref> and innovation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Von Hippel and von Krogh, 2003)</ref>. Another important block of works are devoted to motivation of people participating in online communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bonaccorsi and Rossi, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hertel et al., 2003)</ref>, the analysis social interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sowe et al., 2006)</ref> and participation mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Shang et al., 2006)</ref>, and practical applications to successful online communities <ref type="bibr">(Zhao et al., n.d.;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Trung and Bieman, 2005)</ref>. Of particular importance are the online communities supporting open source software (OSS) projects, as they are changing the way in which software is produced. Several case studies can be found on the literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mockus et al. (2002)</ref> raise some questions about OSS development and analyze two case examples based on Apache and Mozilla projects. This study was focused above all on code development and problem resolution, and data were mainly extracted from concurrent versioning systems (CVS) and databases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee and Cole (2003)</ref> focused on the most well known OSS project: Linux.</p><p>Understanding what makes online communities successful is quite complicated. Although the development of such communities requires a specific technology, it is evident that technology alone does not guarantee a successful development <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(De Souza and Preece, 2004)</ref>. This is because online communities should be understood as a social phenomenon that establishes social networks of people with common interests. Consequently, success of online communities should be determined by social factors. The purpose of this study consists of going deeply in the social network analysis of online communities. In particular, our work is focused on the discussion space (mailing lists, forums) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Sack et al., 2006)</ref>, in which most of the design activity takes place <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mockus et al., 2002)</ref>. A structural and measurement causal model is developed to test several hypotheses about the driving forces behind online communities. The necessity of considering latent variables (not directly observables) and both exogenous and endogenous variables advise the use of structural equation models (SEM) as the appropriate methodology. The findings illustrate which are the causal factors of success of online communities, leading to more effective strategies for their creation and future development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online communities overview</head><p>The online community can be defined as a social relationship aggregation, facilitated by internet-based technology, in which users communicate and build personal relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Rheingold, 1993)</ref>. They enable the creation of weak structural links between thousands of geographically dispersed individuals. Individuals may quickly and effortlessly access a broad source of expertise through a wide variety of knowledgeable individuals with whom they are not acquainted regardless of their demographic characteristics, organizational setting, or local culture. Individuals engage in knowledge sharing, problem solving, and learning through posting and responding to questions on professional advice, storytelling of personal experiences, and debate on issues relevant to the network. Examples of online communities can be Online communities found on fields like education <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barrero et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Toral et al., 2005)</ref>, software development <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barcellini et al., 2008)</ref> or consumer behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Shang et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Online communities have been frequently connected with communities of practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Wellman and Gulia, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lin and Lee, 2006)</ref>, in the sense that communities develop their own routines, formal and informal "rules", and practices evolve as a result of learning. One of the basic mechanisms of these communities is participation. The learning process is considered inseparable of the social context in which knowledge is generated <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Wenger, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Pan and Leidner, 2003)</ref>. Expertise does not appear as a result of being taught, but through direct engagement in the social, cultural, and technical practice of the community. At first, newcomers can only peripherally participate in small and easy tasks. Through participation and collaboration with others practitioners, they create their own learning curriculum by developing a global view of the community and what there is to be learned. Gradually, they change their position inside the community gaining knowledge and becoming competent in undertaking more important roles. The described mechanism allows community members to improve their expertise through participation in the community activities. But it also illustrates the structured organization of online communities. Attending to the degree of expertise, different kinds of community members can be distinguished. Several studies of online discussions and online communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cassell et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barcellini et al., 2008)</ref> have highlighted how participants actively construct their positions and their roles within an online community. These roles reflect the project's organizational structure, the technical skills and activities exhibited by participants, and the participants' contributions to the online discussions.</p><p>Usually, success of online communities has been studied from the perspective of the information system success models, under the assumption that an online community is a form of the internet-based information system <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Wachter et al., 2000)</ref>. Basically, this model posits that system quality, information quality and service quality affect both user satisfaction and behavioral intention to use IS, which in turn are direct antecedents of IS effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(DeLone and McLean, 2003)</ref>. The main problem is that this model does not consider the social relationships among community members nor the structure of the community. For this reason, this paper proposes a new approach based on social network analysis (SNA), which is the study of the social relations among a set of actors with the particularity of being focused on the relationships between actors rather than the attributes of these individual actors <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Wasserman and Faust, 1994)</ref>. We argue that network relationships provide the online communities with both opportunities and constraints that can have rich implications for their performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical background and hypotheses</head><p>Social network theory uses methods of depicting and analyzing networks of people to help understand and communicate the ways in which they are connected <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Wasserman and Faust, 1994)</ref>. These connections and relationships can be based on online activity, thus allowing social network analysis to be applied to the study of online communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Garton et al., 1997)</ref>.</p><p>SNA focuses on patterns of relations among people, organizations, states, etc. Researchers have recognized that a broader sense of social network is a self-organized structure of people, information, and communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kautz et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Raghavan, 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTR 19,4</head><p>A social network can be modeled by a net structure consisting of nodes and edges. Nodes represent individuals or organizations. The edges connecting nodes are called ties, which represent the relationships between the individuals. Social networks can be represented as matrices; therefore, the properties of the social networks can be analyzed by graph theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Yang and Chen, 2008)</ref>. The basic terminology regarding SNA is summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>.</p><p>Grounded on the social network theory, a model of online communities' success is proposed in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>The five considered constructs will be next detailed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Network cohesion</head><p>Cohesion describes the overall level of connections in a given network. It is frequently measured using the idea of network density, which is the percentage of all possible lines that are present in a network. However, this definition is not very useful because  Online communities it depends on the size of the network. It is better to look at the number of ties in which each vertex is involved. This is called the degree of a vertex. A higher degree of vertices yields a denser network, because vertices entertain more ties. Therefore, we can use the average degree of all vertices to measure the cohesion of a network. This is a better measure of overall cohesion than density because it does not depend on network size <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Nooy et al., 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Network structure</head><p>The challenge of motivating participation revolves around attracting and retaining a critical mass of users. The odds that a community can attract new users are significantly improved if there are already a number of users who contribute to the community. But there is no fixed number of users that defines the threshold for critical mass. Instead, it depends on the number of actively contributing users versus the number of passive users or so-called lurkers (people who just are seeking answers without making any contributions). Usually, this ratio is heavily skewed towards lurkers and online communities can expect 45-90 percent of non-contributing users <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Nonnecke and Preece, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Basically, the following three kinds of participants can be distinguished <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mockus et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Xu et al., 2005)</ref>:</p><p>(1) Core members. They are responsible for guiding and coordinating the development of the community. They are usually involved with the community during a long period of time and have made significant contributions to the development and evolution of the system. Moderators and leaders are included in this group. (2) Active developers. They regularly make contributions to the community.</p><p>(3) Peripheral developers. They occasionally contribute with new features to the community. This contribution is irregular, and the period of involvement is short and sporadic. Lurkers are also included in this group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core of the community</head><p>The core group is usually responsible of the majority of contributions. But they should be also responsible of ensuring trust and a high response rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Madanmohan and Navelkar, 2004)</ref>. That means they are involved in day-to-day interaction and tasks, and they must develop a brokerage role between knowledge seekers and knowledge providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sowe et al., 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Network centrality</head><p>A network is highly centralized if there is a clear boundary between the center and the periphery. There are several ways of measuring the centrality of vertices and the centralization of networks. Viewed from a sociocentered perspective, the network as a whole is more or less centralized. But we used an alternative idea of centrality based on the called ego-centered approach. This approach considers that people have better access to information and better opportunities to spread information depending on their position on a network. A person is more central if he or she is more important as an intermediary in the communication network. This idea is included on the concept of betweenness centrality. According to this concept, the centrality of a person depends on the extent to which he or she is needed as a link in the chains of contacts that INTR 19,4</p><p>facilitate the spread of information within the network. The more a person is a go-between, the more central his or her position in the network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Community success</head><p>A challenge for the current literature on the success of online communities is the question of how to measure success. It should be treated as a multi-facet construct. In the literature of information systems (IS), the most widely used model is the one proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">DeLone and McLean (2003)</ref>. This model considers that system quality, information quality and service quality affect both user satisfaction and behavioral intention to use IS, which in turn are direct antecedents of IS effectiveness. In the case of internet communities, the widely proposed process outcome measures include level of activities (developer and user contributions), number of developers, and team effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Preece, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Crowston et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Having defined the conceptual boundary and the constructs of our proposed framework, we will discuss now how these constructs are related to each other.</p><p>Cohesive networks facilitate the dissemination of a good reputation and, consequently, make easy new members to join the community <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hagedoorn and Duysters, 2002)</ref>. As a result, we posit that cohesion would have a positive impact in the success of the virtual community. On the other hand, network cohesion promotes the involvement of developers in the underlying project leading to a bigger core group. Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses: H1. Network cohesion will have a positive impact on the core group of the community.</p><p>H2. Network cohesion will have a positive impact on the success of the community.</p><p>Network structure is due to the different community members profiles. The presence of this kind of structure leads to a core group of developers with the ability of taking decisions. Besides, participation inequality typical of the mentioned network structure has been demonstrated to be beneficial for the development of the community <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kuk, 2006)</ref>. Therefore, we propose that:</p><p>H3. Network structure will have a positive impact on the core group of the community.</p><p>H4. Network structure will have a positive impact on the success of the community.</p><p>A project with a higher betweenness centrality is able to spread its various complex and tedious tasks over a larger number of developers, leading to increased technical success and improved efficiency and quality in serving users' needs. A project with a high betweenness centrality has a larger number of developers working closely within the project team and such strong ties benefit the project through the exchange of high-quality information and tacit knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Rowley et al., 2000)</ref>. Consequently, we propose that:</p><p>H5. Network centrality will have a positive impact on the success of the community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online communities</head><p>The core group involvement is critical for building relationships and developing user-created content. They should promote collaboration and trust among community members as well as stimulate participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Koh et al., 2007)</ref>. That means they are no not only the most frequent contributors but they also should bridge the gap between expert software developers and user communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sowe et al., 2006)</ref>. Therefore, we proposed the following hypothesis:</p><p>H6. An active core group is positively related to the community success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>The proposed hypotheses were tested using several online communities related to Linux port to non-conventional processors and environments. Linux is perhaps the most well known open source project, and it is developed under the scheme of an online community of support <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lee and Cole, 2003)</ref>. Just as Windows is the most prominent operating system released under a proprietary software license, Linux is the most prominent operating system released under a free license like GPL <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hertel et al., 2003)</ref>. Nevertheless, the proposed case study was focused on Linux ports to other processor architectures not intended for desktop or personal computer market (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref>). There are several reasons for this choice. First, Linux is firmly in first place as the operating system of choice for smart gadgets and embedded systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Henkel, 2006)</ref>. Second, in contrast to other typical open source projects or even desktop Linux projects, most contributions in this field do not come from volunteers or hobbyists, but from commercial firms, many of which are dedicated embedded Linux firms. Third, there are a lot of communities supporting each one of these Linux ports, and this is an excellent opportunity for analyzing a big group of more or less "homogeneous" communities.</p><p>The 11 proposed online communities of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> were analyzed during the period of time between 2001 and 2007. Each year was considered an independent case study. Consequently, up to 77 cases were considered.</p><p>The community interactions are usually structured in threads of discussion. Threads are groups of messages sharing the same subject. A thread is initiated by someone who posts a message asking for help, suggesting some improvements, or just considering some new idea. Then people start answering this initial message, posting possible solutions, sources of information or just extending posted considerations. Some members of the community become engaged in a process of conceptualization, leading to some collective innovation and new knowledge. The result is a list of related messages where the sequence of reflections is detailed, so newcomers can follow expert reasoning step by step.</p><p>SNA techniques were used to obtain several indicators able to measure the five latent constructs of the research framework. A social network can be represented as a graph G ¼ ðV; EÞ where V denotes a finite set of vertices and E denotes a finite set of edges such that E#V £ V. Some network analysis methods are easier to understand when graphs are conceptualized as matrices, equation (1):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M ¼ ðm i;j Þ n*n where n ¼ V j j; m i;j ¼ 1 0 ( if ðv i ; v j Þ [ E otherwise<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>In case of a valued graph, real valued weight function w(e) is defined on the set of edges, i.e. wðeÞ ¼ ExR, and the matrix is then defined as given by equation (2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTR</head><p>19,4</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">m i;j ¼ wðeÞ 0 ( if; ðv i ; v j Þ [ E otherwise<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>In the context of threads of discussion, V is given by all the authors posting messages and E is given by the successive answers among authors inside a thread, which is the basic unit considered. The use of discussion threads as the basic unit of analysis is highly valid, considering that the epistemic interactions in support of OSS development often take place in discussion threads where individual postings provide the context to encourage participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kuk, 2006)</ref>. In contrast to a reply to a single message, it is more cognitively complex to reply to a threaded discussion, because the ebb and flow of earlier postings must be taken into account to develop a coherent answer <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Knock, 2001)</ref>. That is the reason why an author posting to a thread was tied to all the authors who have previously posted to the same thread when constructing the social network. The cohesion of the network was measured using the idea of the degree of a vertex or, more precisely, the idea of outdegree. Outdegree of a vertex if the number of arcs it  The GNU Hurd is a totally new operating system being put together by the GNU group Debian port to SPARC (D-SPARC) <ref type="url" target="http://lists.debian.org/debia">http://lists.debian.org/debia</ref> n-sparc/ This port runs on the Sun SPARCstation series of workstations, as well as some of their successors in the sun4 architectures Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref>. Virtual communities considered in the proposed case study Online communities sends to other vertices. We are interested in the outdegree because it shows the flow of information between community members. The higher the outdegree of a vertex is, the more this vertex is contributing to the community. Therefore, the outdegree can be used to distinguish the different kind of community members. In particular, we used the community average outdegree as the threshold value to be considered an active member of the community and the community average outdegree plus its standard deviation as the threshold to be considered a core member of the community. Using these thresholds values, the active developers' partition and the core partition can be extracted from the whole community. The average outdegree of these two key partitions was used to measure the cohesion of the network (indicators I1 and I2 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">III</ref>).</p><p>The structure of the community is defined by the ratios core/active developers (I3) and active developers/peripheral developers (I4).</p><p>The core activity was determined by its size (I5) and the number of core developers performing a brokerage role (I6). This last indicator is essential to promote co-learning experience within the community <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sowe et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Network centrality was measured using the concept of betweenness centrality. In particular, betweennes centrality of the whole community and active developers' partition (I7 and I8, respectively) were used as indicators of the network centrality construct.</p><p>Regarding measurement of the project success, researchers agree that software success is a multi-facet construct. The widely proposed process outcome measures include the size of the community (I9 and I10) and its activity (I11). They are in line with previously proposed measurements in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Crowston et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>An example of the resulting social network is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Vertices represent community members and arcs represent the flow of information through threads of discussion. Arcs are valued with a value showing the number of interactions, although it has been omitted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>  active members. The direction of the arc is important because shows the flow of knowledge. That means that a vertex with a lot of inner arcs would be an information receptor while vertices with a lot of outer arcs would be information providers. Vertices without arcs are passive observers. Betweennes centrality is determined by the ability of each vertex to go between two other vertices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>A structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis has been used to test the research hypotheses. Within SEM techniques, two approaches can be identified. The covariance-based SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bollen and Lennox, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Jo ¨reskog, 1970</ref>) is a widely accepted approach, in part due to the development of several computer programs (e.g. LISREL, EQS and AMOS) allowing the estimation of this kind of model. In contrast, partial least squares (PLS) approach has a primary objective to minimize errors in all endogenous constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chin, 1998)</ref>. Between the two alternative SEM approaches, we have selected PLS mainly because the required assumptions of the observed variables and the sample size are much smaller than in covariance-based SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Toral et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Martı ´nez-Torres et al., 2008)</ref>. Before the testing and assessment of the structural model, we analyzed the reliability of individual reflective items and the corresponding constructs, as well as the convergent validity and discriminant validity of our measures (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">IV</ref>). All the reflective item loadings are significant and greater than 0.7, which is the generally recommended threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chin, 1998)</ref>. We evaluated composite reliability using the internal consistency measure (rc) developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref>. A construct is considered reliable if rc is at least 0.70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nunnally, 1978)</ref>. We also examined the average variance extracted (AVE) of each latent construct, which should be greater than 0.5. All the reflective constructs exceed these conditions (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">IV</ref>).</p><p>Discriminant validity is established by comparing the square root of AVE (i.e. the diagonals in Table <ref type="table">V</ref>) with the correlations among latent variables (i.e. the off-diagonal elements in Table <ref type="table">V</ref>). For each reflective construct, the square root of its AVE should be greater than its correlation with any other construct, which means that it shares more variance with its own measures than with other constructs in the model. This condition is met in all the cases. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online communities</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> summarizes the results of the PLS analysis performed to test the structural model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chin, 2003)</ref>. Standardized path coefficients and their significance level (t statistic) between brackets are detailed to test the proposed hypotheses. The value of the R 2 of the two dependent variables is also shown below the corresponding constructs.</p><p>All our proposed hypotheses are supported, with the exception of H5. We have not found a significant direct relationship between network centrality and project success. The explanation could be that the centrality of the network has been measured based on the concept of betweenness, and the brokerage role is essentially developed by the core group of the community. Consequently, this idea is included in the latent construct referred to the core group.</p><p>Network cohesion exhibits a direct and an indirect effect on the project success. The cohesion of the network is supporting the mechanism of participation, necessary for the project development, and participation promotes the success of the underlying project increasing the number of threads and contributions. On the other hand, cohesion also means a cohesive core group. Consequently, there is an indirect effect on the project success mediated by the activity of the core of the community. Network structure is the most important antecedent attending to standardized path coefficients. This construct also exhibits a direct and indirect influence on the project success. The structure of the network responds to the participation inequality principle recognized by numerous authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kuk, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sowe et al., 2006)</ref>. The clear distinction among core, active and peripheral developers promotes the project success. In particular, a good structure promotes a strong core of the community addressing the future development of the underlying project.</p><p>Finally, the activity of the core group is essential for the project success. This construct occupies a central position in the proposed model and it is not only causing a direct effect on success, but also mediates an indirect effect of the previous constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Since two decades ago, internet has promoted the emergence of new kinds of communities. This upward trend has become more pronounced with the advent of Web 2.0 technologies. Communities are basically based on interactions among users, and participation is the basic mechanism promoting its development. This participation has been analyzed using social network analysis techniques. Features like cohesion, structure, centralization and user profiles has been analyzed and defined, and several indicators has been evaluated for a set of online communities related to Linux ports. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online communities</head><p>A research framework considering several antecedents of the project success has been proposed and tested using structural equation modeling analysis. The obtained results reveal that the network structure is the most important antecedent, which is in consonance with the participation inequality typical of online communities. Network cohesion and core group activity also supports the development of the community. These latent constructs have been tested and shown to be the driving forces under which online communities are likely to succeed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1.
