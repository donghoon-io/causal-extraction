<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose</head><p>-It remains unclear how environmental scanning (ES) can generate firm performance through supply chain management (SCM) practices. This study investigates the effects of ES on operational performance through supply chain integration (SCI) and supply chain responsiveness (SCR). Design/methodology/approach -The scanning-interpretation-action-performance (SIAP) model and organization information processing theory (OIPT) are used to explain the ES-SCI-SCR-performance (S-I-A-P) relationships, which were tested by structural equation modelling of survey data of 329 manufacturing firms in China. Findings -The results indicate that ES has a significant positive effect on SCI and SCR. SCI is significantly and positively related to SCR. SCR partially mediates the relationship between ES and operational performance, and fully mediates the relationship between SCI and operational performance. Practical implications -Supply chain managers should collaborate with senior executives to obtain signals from ES activities, as input for building SCI and SCR, and use SCI as a joint interpretation mechanism of ES signals for developing SCR to reap operational advantages in the rapidly changing business environment. Original/value -Strategic management academics and practitioners have explicitly emphasized the importance of ES in developing strategic plans but are unsure about the role of SCM in creating operational advantages through ES. Using the SIAP model, this study theorizes and demonstrates how SCI and SCR transform signals from ES into operational performance. In doing so a more precise application of OIPT is explicated in the supply chain context.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The demise of the car company Rover, according to the post mortem case study analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Oliver et al. (2008)</ref>, was caused primarily by a disconnect between the management team and the market. This disconnect was created by a failure to adequately scan the environment and resulted in poor product portfolio choices, missed opportunities to capture innovation, and inefficient production processes that increased product cost. Environmental scanning (ES) is defined as "scanning for information about events and relationships in a company's outside environment, the knowledge of which would assist top management in its task of charting the company's future course of action" <ref type="bibr">(Aguilar, 1967, p. 1)</ref>. Through ES, senior executives gather signals about competitors' strategies, technological innovations, governmental regulations, customer needs, and supplier conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Daft et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr">McGee and Sawyerr, 1994)</ref> to ensure business strategy fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cousins et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Garg et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hambrick, 1981)</ref>. As a key strategic management concept (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aguilar, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hambrick, 1981)</ref> ES is regarded as a prerequisite for developing strategic plans <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beal, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Elenkov, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hambrick, 1981)</ref> in dynamic and complex business environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hambrick, 1982)</ref>.</p><p>While the strategic management literature emphasizes using ES for information gathering to reduce strategic uncertainty, the links between ES and performance remain little understood.</p><p>The collapse of Rover in 2005 reminds us of the importance of ES for strategic planning and operational aspects of firms; how signals from ES must be interpreted by members of a supply chain so they can respond appropriately to improve performance. The organizational information processing theory (OIPT) argues that uncertainty necessitates reducing information processing needs and/or increasing information processing capacities <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Daft and Lengel, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Galbraith, 1973)</ref>. As such, approaches to reducing information processing requirements through strategies such as organizational designs, liaisons, boundary spanning roles, and lateral information systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Galbraith, 1973)</ref> have been explored in the Operations Management (OM) literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Flynn and Flynn, 1999)</ref>. However, the capacities of the supply chain to process information (interpret) and respond remain unexplored.</p><p>This study argues the ES-performance links can be more fully explicated by investigating how firms interpret ES signals and subsequently take supply chain actions. While the strategic management research argues the importance of ES, it lacks an overarching framework to explain how ES generates performance. Toward that end, we introduce a structured framework, the Scanning-Interpretation-Action-Performance (SIAP) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas et al., 1993)</ref>. The SIAP model positions "scanning" (S), e.g., ES, as a critical first step in organizational adaptation to environmental changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aguilar, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ebrahimi, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hambrick, 1981)</ref>. The model recognizes the difficulty senior executives have spotting weak signals which may be crucial for generating strategic insights and rapid response <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Daft et al., 1988)</ref>. Strategic uncertainty can be caused by distorted information and push senior executives toward a situation called equivocality <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Daft and Macintosh, 1981)</ref> wherein different actors use different frames to interpret the same information <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Weick, 1979)</ref>. The value of SIAP model is that once information from the external environment is "interpreted" (I) accurately <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ebrahimi, 2000)</ref> it can be transformed into strategic "actions" (A) aligned with the environment to generate "performance" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beal, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bourgeois, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Yasai-Ardekani and Nystrom, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>We emphasize it is the quick "action" through supply chain responsiveness (SCR) informed by accurate "interpretation" that helps firms stay ahead of competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Fabbe-Costes et al., 2014)</ref> and achieve superior performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beal, 2000)</ref>. Early evidence suggests it is the faster response to environmental information than competitors, not signals from ES, that contributes to distinctive advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hambrick, 1982)</ref>. Moreover, to quickly respond to changes in customer demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kim and Lee, 2010)</ref> or supply disruption risks, firms must realign supply chain resources with the environment <ref type="bibr">(Ambulker et al., 2015)</ref>. As such, we argue supply chain integration (SCI) acts as a supply chain information processing and "joint interpretation" mechanism to reduce uncertainty and equivocality and to create shared meanings and goals that can form the basis for SCR. However, empirical research on the roles of supply chain management (SCM) practices in the SIAP model remains scarce. To address these research gaps this study integrates the concept of ES as "scanning", SCI as "interpretations" of signals from ES to inform SCR as "actions" to create "performance" in the SIAP model.</p><p>In summary, this study integrates the strategic management and supply chain management literatures to explain the relationship between ES and performance. While the strategic management literature provides information on "scanning" through ES, applying the SIAP model <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas et al., 1993)</ref> will explain how ES creates performance through SCI as "joint interpretation" and SCR as "quick action". The supply chain literature has recently recognized that ES can support responses to disruptions <ref type="bibr">(Ambulker et al., 2015)</ref>, sensing of regulatory changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Nair et al., 2016)</ref> and sustainability risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Fabbe-Costes et al., 2014)</ref>. In the context of firms spending time scanning and learning from the environment (ES) to better respond to disruption risks (SCR), we contribute to the SCM literature by expanding the work of Ambulker et al. <ref type="bibr">(2015)</ref> by adding that SCI can act as an interpretation mechanism of ES signals to inform SCR. We also demonstrate that existing supply chain knowledge can inform the strategic management literature and senior executives. For example, we know SCI can support SCR by reducing uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Danese et al., 2013)</ref>, support responses to customer demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Ralston et al., 2015)</ref>, and increase commitment to a more responsive supply chain through strategic collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kim and Lee, 2010)</ref>. The "interpretation" role played by SCI to reduce uncertainty and equivocality and the quick response "actions" by SCR when incorporated into the SIAP model expand the knowledge base by testing an ES-SCI-SCR-performance conceptual model.</p><p>From a practical perspective, this study reveals how supply chain managers may better exploit ES activities carried out by senior executives by integrating them into the implementation of SCI and SCR strategies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Environmental scanning (ES)</head><p>Environmental scanning (ES) involves gathering information about events, trends, and relationships from the external environment as input for the planning of an organization's course of action <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aguilar, 1967)</ref>. ES absorbs information about emerging issues, situations, and potential pitfalls from the external environment that potentially influence a firm's decisionmaking process <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Albright, 2004)</ref>. ES also enables firms to identify external competitive, social, economic, and technical issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Albright, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aguilar, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hambrick, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Stoffels, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>ES informs the potential influences from external environments and how firms can respond strategically in a timelier and more effective manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Albright, 2004)</ref>. ES is viewed as an effective tactic helping firms adapt to the external environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Albright, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Beal, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Fabbe-Costes et al., 2014)</ref>. To survive in today's dynamic and competitive marketplace firms must adequately understand and interpret the signals derived from the external environment and systematically identify, gather, analyse, and process external environmental information <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aguilar, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Albright, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hambrick, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hough and White, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Past studies show that ES is often carried out by senior executives or specialized scanning departments <ref type="bibr">(Daft et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Daft and Lengel, 1986)</ref>. Some firms may use employees at different levels to perform scanning tasks, and there is a variety of scope, geographical coverage, and futurity of scanning <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas, et al., 1993)</ref>. The environment can be divided into two layers.</p><p>The first layer is the task environment which has direct interactions with the firms (e.g., customers, markets, competitors and suppliers) and the second is the general environment which is an outer environment related to social, demographic, and economic sectors <ref type="bibr">(Daft et al., 1998)</ref>.</p><p>It remains an ongoing debate whether the two layers (task and general environments) should be scanned in combination or separately <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bourgeois, 1980)</ref> and whether the search of environments should be broadened or narrowed <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Srinivasan et al., 2011)</ref>. To improve the validity of our study, we conceptualize ES based on task environment (i.e., customers, markets, competitors and suppliers) since it is where strategic uncertainty is perceived as high <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Daft et al., 1988)</ref> and it is closely related to SCI and SCR. Given that perceived strategic uncertainty tends to increase scanning frequency <ref type="bibr">(Daft et al., 1998)</ref>, the measurement of ES also considers whether scanning activities have been routinely carried out.</p><p>Though the ES literature provides insight into information gathering for strategic foresight, there are a number of limitations. The literature focuses more on understanding information gathering behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Daft et al., 1988)</ref>, design of organization structures to reduce information needs and the use of liaison, boundary spanning integrators, and lateral information systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Galbraith, 1973)</ref>. Less is known about the interpretation aspect of information processing capacity. While it is important to know what environments to scan and how to spot weak signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Daft et al., 1988)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hambrick (1982)</ref> shows that it is the ability to act on the environmental information that leads to distinct competitive advantage. A similar argument is that know-what (information to scan) and know-how (how to run operations) are equally important for formulating manufacturing strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Paiva et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Firms need to clarify what the future may hold especially when the environment is highly uncertain and equivocal. Foresight can be created when business partners interpret the environment together to jointly describe and agree upon what will happen in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cuhl, 2003)</ref>. Thus, there is a need to better understand joint interpretation activities and their connection to scanning. Moreover, although ES is a key concept in the strategic management literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aguilar, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hambrick, 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hambrick, , 1982) )</ref> its application and importance in a supply chain context is nascent <ref type="bibr">(Ambulker et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Fabbe-Costes et al., 2014)</ref>. While the supply chain literature focuses on the sharing of operational information (demand, capacity, inventory and supply) with suppliers and customers, the scanning of strategic information related to competitors, markets, wider customer needs, technologies, society, governmental regulations, and politics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Badri et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Fabbe-Costes et al., 2011)</ref> are not well integrated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Supply chain integration (SCI)</head><p>Supply chain integration (SCI) is generally defined as strategic collaboration among supply chain partners through information sharing and coordination of decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wong et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wu et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Yu et al., 2017)</ref>. Academics have long articulated the importance of building a strategic collaboration between a firm and its supply chain partners, but their arguments have generally been from the resource-based and relational views <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bowersox et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wu et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Yu et al., 2013)</ref>. The use of OIPT may help better explain the role of SCI in enabling information sharing and alignment as a way to reduce strategic uncertainty. Additionally, SCI can facilitate information processing by coordinating strategic supply chain activities (such as forecasting and planning) with trading partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Yu et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Yu et al., , 2018))</ref>. Such coordination activities, supported by boundary spanning and liaison roles, can reduce strategic uncertainty through face-to-face and group meetings <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Daft and Macintosh, 1981)</ref>.</p><p>However, another role of SCI is to reduce equivocality <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Daft and Macintosh, 1981)</ref>.</p><p>Equivocality restricts goal alignment. Through strategic collaboration and joint interpretation of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Srinivasan and Swink, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Swink and Schoenherr, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wong et al., 2011)</ref> equivocality can be reduced such that shared schema and goals can be reached <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bowersox et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Sheu et al., 2006)</ref>. By extending the notion of a firm as an information processing system <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Daft and Weick, 1984)</ref> into the supply chain context, we position SCI as a joint information processing agent reducing uncertainty and equivocality <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Daft and Macintosh, 1981)</ref>. As such, SCI helps align the external operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Kim, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Huo, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wong et al., 2011)</ref> and leverage the resources and knowledge of suppliers and customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cao and Zhang, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Even though SCI can have positive effects on all dimensions of operational performance, these effects are not universal <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Danese et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mackelprang et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wong et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Since quick response is suited to environments with high uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Daft et al., 1988)</ref>, SCI may improve interpretation of ES signals and thus lead to better SCR. There is already some evidence for the positive link between SCI and SCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Danese et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Ralston et al., 2015)</ref> serving as a basis for explaining the missing ES-operational performance links.</p><p>The present study acknowledges SCI can have different foci, e.g., technology integration and activity integration <ref type="bibr">(Vickery et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wu et al., 2006)</ref>. While earlier studies conceptualize SCI as a unidimensional meta construct <ref type="bibr">(Vickery et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wu et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Yu et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Yu et al., , 2018))</ref>, SCI is elsewhere divided into two dimensionsinternal and external <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Danese et al., 2013)</ref>. External integration is further divided into customer and supplier integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Jacobs et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Swink et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wong et al., 2011)</ref>. However, the use of different dimensions and scales to measure SCI may be one of the reasons studies of SCI have reached disparate findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Danese et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mackelprang et al., 2014)</ref>. The division of SCI into different dimensions has created a new challenge to research. Even though evidence shows internal, supplier, and customer integration can positively affect responses to customer demand <ref type="bibr">(Droge et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Ralston et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wong et al., 2011)</ref>, there is evidence of insignificant effects (see meta-analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mackelprang et al., 2014)</ref>, varying performance effects of each SCI dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Danese et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wong et al., 2011)</ref>, and interaction effects among SCI dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Flynn et al., 2010)</ref>. No theory or study, so far, has fully theorized or explained the insignificant, interaction, or varying effects among SCI dimensions.</p><p>The focus of this study is not to address the issues arising from the division of SCI into different dimensions, but rather the focus is to understand the roles of SCI in facilitating the effects of ES and SCR on operational performance. Since the conceptualizations of ES and SCR encompass suppliers, customers, markets, and competitors, our theory considers "joint integration" among all of them through SCI as an aggregated construct. Dividing SCI into discrete dimensions would lead to inconsistency in the level of abstraction in our theory (e.g., no division of supplier and customer for ES and SCR, but dividing SCI into internal, supplier and customer). To maintain a parsimonious theoretical model, avoid the potential complex interactions, and varying effects among SCI dimensions, we have chosen to focus on conceptualizing SCI as an aggregated construct.</p></div>

SCR entails quickly responding to changing customer/supplier needs and competitor strategies by developing new products/services or adjusting supply chain operations to match the changing markets through strategic collaboration with partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kim and Lee, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lee, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wu et al., 2006)</ref>. This conceptualization reflects a supply chain's overall responsiveness to changes in demand and supply <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Williams et al., 2013)</ref>. Thus, SCR comes from not only the firm itself but also its supply chain partners when the entire supply chain is able to effectively respond to demands from each supply chain member and the business environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kim et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Kim and Lee, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wu et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Yu et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>This study acknowledges the possible overlaps in terms of the conceptualizations between SCR and supply chain flexibility and agility. The term responsiveness refers to being quick (speedy) in responding to changing market or customer needs, which can be achieved with any of the following antecedents: short lead time, quick response capability, flexibility, agility, and visibility. The supply chain literature assumes supply chain agility includes both responsiveness and flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Christopher and Peck, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">van Hoek et al., 2001)</ref> thus indicating a distinction and hierarchy in conceptualizations. Some studies consider a wider scope of SCR by including flexibility and delivery performance as components of the construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Danese et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Droge et al., 2012)</ref>, which is appropriate as long as the theory considers all these components. We understand our conceptualisation of SCR based on quick response can be viewed as a limitation, but it is also a strength because we strictly adhere to our theoretical domain and we use a unidimensional SCR construct to avoid effect size errors.</p><p>Herein, following previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Wu et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Yu et al., 2018)</ref>, we focus on overall indicators of responsiveness, e.g., the ability to quickly respond to changes in the needs of market, customer, supplier and strategies of competitors instead of the many possible antecedents such as flexibility, agility, visibility, etc. This approach maintains the unidimensionality of the SCR construct and therefore improves the parsimoniousness of the theoretical model. Since OIPT considers that environmental uncertainty arises from markets, customers, suppliers, and competitors, we conceptualize ES to reflect this scope of task environment (customer, supplier, competitor, and market) and therefore SCR also represents the ability to quickly respond to changes in the task environment.</p></div>

Information sharing among supply chain partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Huo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Williams et al., 2013)</ref> can help reduce information needs.

However, OIPT does not focus on the ability to gather and interpret information (such as signals from ES) and how firms incorporate the information into their strategic actions. Thus, OIPT alone cannot fully explain the links between ES and performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Conceptual framework and research hypotheses</head><p>To supplement the OIPT and better explain the roles of SCI and SCR in transforming ES signals into operational performance, this study introduces the scanning-interpretation-actionperformance (SIAP) model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Thomas et al. (1993)</ref> to the supply chain literature. The model was initially developed to understand how managers and organizations deal with potentially significant information. It is argued that organizations adapt to the environment through three processes: scanning, interpreting, and responding <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Milliken, 1990)</ref>. Similarly, strategic sense-making activities performed by executives often involve reciprocal interaction of information seeking, meaning ascription, and action <ref type="bibr">(Gioia and Chittopeddi, 1991)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Thomas et al. (1993)</ref> further argue each sense-making process could affect performance.</p><p>Scanning involves information gathering through identification of events or issues from the external and internal environments that might affect an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ebrahimi, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Thomas et al., 1993)</ref>. The SIAP model suggests that "scanning" is a crucial first step in organizational adaptation to the environment through its role as an antecedent to interpretation and action <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aguilar, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hambrick, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Thomas et al., 1993)</ref>. Scanning is often performed by top executives who are frequently provided more information than they can process <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Mintzberg, 1973)</ref>. Among this information weak signals, which are crucial for strategic insight, are difficult to identify <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Daft et al., 1988)</ref>. Thus, information specificity is key to scanning effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Choudhury and Sampler, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Interpretation involves the development or application of methods for comprehending the meaning of information supporting decisions related to strategic actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas et al., 1993)</ref>.</p><p>At an individual or group level, managers use various schema as information processing mechanisms to interpret and label information <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Gioia and Chittipeddi, 1991)</ref>. During this process managers may categorize incoming information about an object, event, or issue as an "opportunity", "problem" or "threat" (Duncan and Duncan, 1987) which will subsequently effect the level of risk taking, involvement, and commitment associated with a given strategic decision or action <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Kahneman and Tversky, 1984)</ref>. Since there is a need to align across suppliers and customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Skipworth et al., 2015)</ref> with the environment <ref type="bibr">(Beal, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bourgeois, 1980)</ref>, we argue focal firms should develop a shared schema with key suppliers and customers by using SCIdefined as strategic collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wong et al., 2011)</ref> as an interorganizational information processing mechanism.</p><p>Action is referred to as strategic changes implemented by organizations adapting to the environment; they can range from minor changes in procedures, to significant changes in product and market strategies, and the redesign of organizational structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Dutton and Duncan, 1987)</ref>.</p><p>Owing to the dependency between a firm and its suppliers and customers, we argue the implementation of supply chain strategies acts as a key organizational action. In practice, organizational actions can be generated based on information gathered from the environment with or without substantial interpretation thereof. However, the lack of an ability to align organizational actions with the environment using information from the environment could lead to compromised performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas et al., 1993)</ref>. In the present study, SCR is treated as a strategic action for responding to a changing environment.</p><p>Performance is the last component of the SIAP model. Researchers seek to attribute differences in the performance of similar organizations to differences in their ability to carry out the scanning, interpretation, and action activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas et al., 1993)</ref>. Since executives often lack a process for assessing the effects of their scanning and interpretation activities, or the associated actions on a performance in practice, an important role of academic researchers is to collect and analyse data about each element of the SIAP model to better inform the practice. One of the issues debated concerns the possible direct and indirect effects of scanning and interpretation processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas et al., 1993)</ref>. One stream of literature argues performance depends greatly on a rational thought process, which involves active information processing and systematic sequential execution of the scanning, interpretation, and action processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas et al., 1993)</ref>. In contrast, other scholars argue for a less deliberate approach to sense-making (interpretation) and that managers may simply refer to the outcomes of past actions to inform the next action without scanning and/or interpreting information from the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Weick, 1979)</ref>. To interpret the performance implications for organizations, we therefore need a comprehensive understanding of the detailed linkages among scanning, interpretation, action, and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Daft et al., 1988)</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> illustrates a proposed conceptual model to link ES, SCI, SCR, and performance following the SIAP model <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas et al., 1993)</ref>. We chose operational performance as the "P" in the SIAP model. Operational performance is a composite measure of volume flexibility, delivery performance, inventory cost and product quality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Huo et al., 2014)</ref>. It is commonly used in the strategy literature to explain effects of ES <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas et al., 1993)</ref>. It could be indirectly affected by SCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Swink et al., 2007)</ref> and ES <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas et al., 1993)</ref>. Demonstrating the effects of SCI and SCR on operational performance helps justify the strategic value of such SCM practices in supporting the efforts by executives to capitalize on weak signals. Six hypotheses (H1-H6) are developed to accommodate all possible direct and indirect paths.</p><p>- <ref type="figure">--------------------------------</ref>Insert Figure <ref type="figure">1 ---------------------------------</ref></p></div>

ES can provide information about changes to supply and/or demand and thus serves as a prerequisite for strategic flexibility and responsiveness. ES enables firms to perceive external events and trends that threaten its existence or offer business opportunities to exploit, and to identify the necessary capabilities or skills to be able to effectively adapt to a changing business environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beal, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Castanias and Helfat, 2001)</ref>. In a supply chain context, to develop an integrated and responsive supply chain, firms need to gather information from the business environment, e.g., information about forecasting sales and customer preferences, supply markets, and other trading members.</p><p>The ES literature suggests that effectively identifying, gathering, and analysing information about events and trends occurring outside the firm is integrally linked to organizational and strategic planning as well as planning for unexpected changes in environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aguilar, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Albright, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hambrick, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hough and White, 2004)</ref>. Since supply chain integration processes entail information sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chavez et al., 2015)</ref> they can act as an information processing mechanism in the OIPT sense <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Zsidisin et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Information from the external environment is processed and used to develop and coordinate strategic collaboration and helps firms be responsive in dynamic and competitive environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Hult et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Huo et al., 2014)</ref>. In a supply chain context, we argue that the information gained from scanning the external environment, e.g., new technologies, new markets, and best practices, can be acted upon to improve supplier selection and customer satisfaction. The information can be used to build long-term strategic collaborations with supply chain partners which in turn could lead to the supply chain becoming more responsive to market dynamics and customer needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Albright, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Koufteros et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>From an OIPT perspective, SCI can be viewed as the formulation of a strategic collaboration where supply chain partners share information and resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Flynn et al., 2010)</ref>; strategic collaboration being made possible when there is a common schema to interpret information from the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Wong et al., 2011)</ref>. For example, a manufacturer may share its inventory planning and demand forecasts with suppliers and/or its customers may share point of sale information and related market information <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Huo et al., 2014)</ref>. The result is that more insight and coordinated actions can be achieved when the trading partners jointly interpret information related to forecasting sales, customer preferences, supply markets, and new technologies. As such ES acts as an information gathering device to inform and facilitate SCI activities such as supplier involvement in product development <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Koufteros et al., 2005)</ref>, joint decision making (Schoenherr and Swink, 2012), or supplier performance improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Sanders et al., 2011)</ref>. SCI activities increase information processing capacity by involving suppliers and customers in the supply chain planning process with the aim being to more accurately respond to changes in the market.</p><p>The SIAP model considers the possibility that scanning "S" directly affects action "A", especially for highly familiar environmental information <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas et al., 1993)</ref>. Accurate and credible information increases the ability of the supply chain to react effectively to changes through coordinated actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chavez et al., 2015)</ref>. Through ES, firms can also quickly respond to changes in the needs of the market, strategies of competitors, and new technologies. In stable environments ES can be beneficial to firms for responding to new opportunities before competitors. Additionally, ES can help explain demand unpredictability, such that supply chain managers can develop accurate supply chain strategies. Similarly, from an OIPT perspective SCR can be viewed as a strategy that enables firms to react and adapt to the changes in demand and supply <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Williams et al., 2013)</ref> by interpreting external business environments and using responsiveness to adapt to changes in market dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Albright, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Huo et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, we expect a significant effect of ES on SCI and SCR.</p><p>H1: ES has a significant positive effect on SCI.</p><p>H2: ES has a significant positive effect on SCR.</p><p>Previous research has suggested that effective scanning of the business environment provides a firm with current and valuable information, which influences a firm's ability to align its competitive strategy with its external business environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beal, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Yasai-Ardekani and Nystrom, 1996)</ref>. According to OIPT, information has become an important resource for firms to enhance organizational competitiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bergeron, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Swink and Schoenherr, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Williams et al., 2013)</ref>. The development of ES capability is important for firms to survive and prosper in a dynamic and competitive market by quickly adapting strategy and structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Yasai-Ardekani and Nystrom, 1996)</ref>. Similarly, in more stable industries ES should be established to ensure the most accurate and cost-efficient transmission of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Lee, 2002)</ref>. Through effective scanning of the business environment firms can better identify external events and trends that threaten their existence or offer opportunities to exploit, which then become inputs for strategic decisions that deliver operational and financial benefits to the firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahituv et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Beal, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Castanias and Helfat, 2001)</ref>. Our argument is grounded in OIPT's notion that ES provides a firm the capacity to achieve superior performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahituv et al., 1998)</ref>. Other than the capacity of SCI and SCR to minimize supply chain disruption due to unanticipated changes in the business environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Fabbe-Costes et al., 2014)</ref>, there are other capabilities that can respond to new signals or changes in the market. For example, portfolio breadth <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Closs et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Jacobs, 2007)</ref>, new product design and development <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Koufteros et al., 2005)</ref>, and production process design <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Jacobs et al., 2011)</ref> all benefit from external information. While these other means are not included into our model for parsimony and clarity reasons, we argue that ES may directly deliver operational performance.</p><p>H3: ES has a significant positive effect on operational performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">The role of SCI</head><p>According to OIPT, to respond to increasing environmental uncertainty and dynamism firms need to gather and process more and better information to increase responsiveness in supply chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Daft and Lengel, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Williams et al., 2013)</ref>.

Following the argument of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Daft and Weick (1984)</ref> that organizations act as interpretation systems, the use of shared goals and schema through SCI represents another form of an inter-organizational interpretation system. Thus, SCI is regarded as the "I" in the SIAP model.</p><p>Our arguments are grounded in the SIAP model and OIPT's tenet that effective interpretation of information by supply chain partners helps the supply chain to become more responsive <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Williams et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Wong and Hvolby, 2007)</ref>. Without the ability to quickly and effectively respond to changes in demand and supply <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Williams et al., 2013)</ref>, opportunities and threats identified by ES cannot be exploited or mitigated. In an integrated supply chain firms can share and jointly utilize high quality information about demand and supply conditions from supply chain partners. Such integration is deemed to be an important prerequisite to a SCR capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Holsapple and Jones, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Williams et al., 2013)</ref>.

Accordingly, we expect that SCI acts as an important enabler of SCR.</p><p>H4: SCI has a significant positive effect on SCR.</p><p>Researchers have long articulated the important role of SCI in improving firm performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Huo, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Jacobs et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Ralston et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Yu, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Yu et al., 2013)</ref> and it has been argued that SCI affects firm performance through the creation of operational competitive advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Swink et al., 2007)</ref>. Consistent with the fundamental principle of OIPT, we expect that information processing capability afforded by SCI leads to better operational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Wong et al., 2011)</ref>. In an integrated supply chain, building longterm strategic partnerships with customers and suppliers will facilitate strategic collaboration such as the better understanding of customer requirements, reduction of uncertainty and equivocality, better forecasting of customer demand, and collaboration in planning and joint product development with suppliers, which will, in turn, enable firms to more flexibly produce and deliver better quality products/services at lower cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wong et al., 2011)</ref> with better delivery performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Danese et al., 2013)</ref>. The SIAP model argues the link between "I" and "P" <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas et al., 1993)</ref> because interpretation is used to enact or confirm the validity of a strategy, as well as to create competitive performance in delivery speed, inventory cost reduction, and volume flexibility.

For each randomly selected manufacturer, we identified a key informant, who typically held a managerial position such as CEO, president, director, or general manager, and was knowledgeable about the firm's supply chain process <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Flynn et al., 2010)</ref>. We contacted key informants (n = 1500) by telephone and email in order to obtain their preliminary agreement to participate in this research. We identified key informants with the help of part-time research assistants (e.g., undergraduate and postgraduate students) and guanxi networks (e.g., personal connections with manufacturing firms, industrial authorities, and local universities). Previous research has suggested that accessing personal guanxi networks is a useful tool to ensure success in collecting survey data in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Yu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Zhao et al., 2006)</ref>. Most of the informants had been in their current position for more than five years. Thus, based on position and tenure it is reasonable to expect that the informants had sufficient knowledge to complete the survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Zhao et al., 2006)</ref>. The questionnaires and a cover letter explaining the main purpose of the study and assuring confidentiality were sent to 1230 firms that agreed to participate and provide information for this research. After several telephone and email reminders a total of 337 questionnaires were received. Eight returned questionnaires were discarded because of significant missing data leaving 329 completed and useable questionnaires. Even though previous studies in the Chinese context have indicated that it is difficult to obtain a high response rate to surveys, especially when targeting multiple regions of China <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Zhao et al., 2006)</ref>, the effective response rate was 26.75%.

A number of questions were reworded in minor ways to improve the accuracy of the translation and relevance to cultural and business practices in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Zhao et al., 2006)</ref>. Even though the measurement scales were used prior and demonstrated to be valid we took extra steps before administering the survey. Content validity was established through a comprehensive analysis of the relevant literature, iterative construct review, and a pilot test with academic and industrial experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Zhao et al., 2011)</ref>. To assess the content validity of the scales we consulted three academic experts on the basis of their research and consulting activities.</p><p>Further, we conducted a pilot test with five randomly selected manufacturers using semistructured interviews.

The measures for ES were adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barringer and Bluedorn (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Miller and Friesen (1982)</ref> and focus on gathering information about business environment from clients and suppliers and other channel members, through explicit tracking of the policies and tactics of competitors, forecasting sales and customer preferences, and special marketing research studies. A seven-point scale was used, ranging from 1 "not ever used" to 7 "used extremely frequently".</p><p>The measures for SCI and SCR were adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wu et al. (2006)</ref>. We measured SCI using five items: developing strategic plans in collaboration with partners, collaborating actively in forecasting and planning with partners, planning future demand collaboratively with partners, collaboration in demand forecasting and planning with partners, and forecasting and planning activities collaboratively with partners. Collaborative forecasting and planning involves a significant amount of joint data interpretation; thus, SCI is treated as "I" in the SIAP model <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas et al., 1993)</ref>. The measurement items for SCR include responding more quickly and effectively to changing customer and supplier needs, responding more quickly and effectively to changing competitor strategies, developing new products more quickly and effectively, and increasing SCR to market changes through collaboration. SCR is positioned as a deliberate strategic action, "A" in the SIAP model <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas et al., 1993)</ref>, implemented by the supply chain.</p><p>All these items were measured using a seven-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).</p><p>The perceptual measures for operational performance were adapted from the SCM literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Huo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wong et al., 2011)</ref> and include volume flexibility, delivery performance, inventory cost and product quality, which have been widely</p><p>used in previous research. Conducting empirical research collecting objective performance data can be very challenging in China, partly because there is little incentive for respondents to provide researchers with accurate accounting data <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Zhao et al., 2006)</ref>. Therefore, consistent with previous empirical studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wong et al., 2011)</ref> perceptual performance data were used in this study.

Industry type was controlled because firms in differing manufacturing industries may develop different levels of SCI and SCR for performance improvement. We used a dummy variable for industry types.

The t-test results indicate no significant statistical difference (p &lt; 0.05) among the category means for number of employees and sales suggesting that non-response bias is unlikely to be a concern in this study. It would be ideal to compare nonresponders to responders to check for bias, but we were not able to track down enough information about non-respondents and therefore are not able to compare them with respondents.</p><p>This is a limitation that is common for survey based studies.</p><p>We assessed common method bias because we gathered data from a single respondent per firm using the self-reported questionnaire survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. Harman's single-factor test is arguably the most widely known approach for assessing common method bias in a singlemethod research design <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. Previous research has argued that Harman's single-factor test does not eliminate the possibility of common method bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. We therefore tested common method bias using two approaches. First, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied to Harman's single-factor model in order to further evaluate common method bias. The CFA generated an unacceptable model fit of 2 /df (2141.356/189) = 11.330, CFI = 0.661, IFI = 0.663, TLI = 0.624, RMSEA = 0.177 and SRMR = 0.122 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hair et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hu and Bentler, 1999)</ref> significantly worse than those of the measurement model (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Second, to further assess common method bias two measurement models were tested and compared; one model including only the traits and the other model including both the traits and a latent factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Podsakoff et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Yu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Zhao et al., 2011)</ref>. This approach provides a further assessment of common method bias. The results indicate that the model with a latent factor changed inconsequentially (CFI by 0.003, IFI by 0.002 and TLI by 0.008). While the above tests suggest common method variance bias is unlikely to be a problem in this study, we acknowledge that these tests are not confirmatory in nature.</p></div>

Discussion and implications</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Theoretical implications</head><p>This study provides several original theoretical implications for the interpretation of the relationship between ES, SCI, SCR, and firm performance. First, we address a common problem facing strategic management and SCM researchers, i.e., the lack of an integrative and comprehensive framework to understand complex relationships among several constructs, especially constructs from other disciplines. For example, more complex sequential effects of SCI have been recognized <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kim and Lee, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Sanders, 2007)</ref> but progress in SCI research is largely limited to the use of contingency and configuration theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wong et al., 2011)</ref>. Using the SIAP model <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas et al., 1993)</ref>, this study integrates knowledge from the literatures of strategic management and SCM to reveal the strategic roles of SCI and SCR. While the strategic management literature attempts to explain the performance effects of ES <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beal, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Garg et al., 2003)</ref>, the roles of SCM practices in facilitating supply-chain-wide interpretation capacity and strategic response are often not captured in theoretical models. On the other hand, the SCM literature addressing the effects of various SCM practices using resourcebased view or the like cannot fully explain the mechanisms in which SCI and SCR support strategy processes such as ES to generate operational advantages. The SIAP model can be used to understand the effects of other SCM practices, as long as scanning of environmental information and interpretation of the data is involved to develop an adaptive strategy.</p><p>The second implication concerns the application of OIPT. OIPT has been useful in explaining the differing information processing mechanisms for coping with environmental complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Flynn and Flynn, 1999)</ref> and the distinct roles of internal and external integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Scheonherr and Swink, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wong et al., 2011)</ref>. However, never before has the field systematically divided information gathering and information interpretation while linking them to the supply chain strategy process. Information processing in a supply chain context is not new <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Flynn and Flynn, 1999)</ref>, but its wider application for explaining the SIAP model is new. As mentioned, OIPT could be expanded to encompass a supply chain level analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Nair et al. (2016)</ref> have explored the roles of environmental sensing in a supply network level. When the SIAP model is applied at the supply chain level it allows us to extend OIPT beyond the boundaries of the firm to consider how multiple supply chain actors gather, interpret and apply information to deal with uncertainty in the external environment. This extended perspective of OIPT helps explain how the scanning for and interpretation of information across supply chain partners, and then integrated and coordinated action, leads to enhanced firm and supply chain performance.</p><p>This study expands the role of SCI from an OIPT perspective. Prior to this study SCI was considered to play information sharing and coordination roles to improve SCR through uncertainty reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Danese et al., 2013)</ref>, but the "joint interpretation" roles of SCI to reduce equivocality is a novel perspective added. As such, by positioning SCI as "interpretation" we can explain a related "action" such as SCR and fill the gaps between ES and performance. While studies using OIPT have focused on uncertainty reduction, we extend knowledge of alternate information processing mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Flynn and Flynn, 1999)</ref> for reducing equivocality offered by SCI, to better explain the significance of SCI in creating shared meanings and joint goals despite the potential use of different frames to interpret the environment.</p><p>The third implication concerns the opportunity to expand the SIAP model to better explain the ES-SCI-SCR-performance relationships. The strategy literature acknowledges executives base their interpretation of outcomes on the environment to devise new scanning strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Thomas et al., 1993)</ref>. That means the environment is a trigger of scanning activities that could be added to the SIAP model, thus leading to a more comprehensive SIAP model. The strategy literature acknowledges the need for ES at different hierarchical levels but not at a supply chain level. This study reveals the importance of jointly interpreting ES signals with supply chain partners through SCI to devise joint actions to respond to environmental changes (SCR as a supply chain-wide strategy). Thus, theories applying the SIAP model can be extended from the firm to the supply chain level. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that SCI and SCR are crucial but not the only explanatory factors for operational performance. Therefore, there could be other constructs that represent SIAP models. ES is not the only channel of external environmental information and other SCM practices (such as supply chain innovation, supply chain resilience, and supply chain sustainability) require external input to ultimately affect performance. This implies a wealth of new research opportunities. On the other hand, frameworks such as the strategy-structure-performance (SSP) might also be used to explain firm performance from a structural perspective (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chow et al., 1995)</ref>, even though the "strategy" here might have to consider ES and other sources of strategic insights.</p><p>The fourth implication can also be viewed as a refinement and extension of SCI research.</p><p>Although previous studies have investigated the relationship between SCI and firm performance, these studies have generated inconsistent results <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Yu, 2015)</ref>. The mixed support in the SCI literature indicates that further investigation is needed to explore the SCIperformance relationship. Our results reveal that there is no significant direct relationship between SCI and operational performance, which is consistent with that reported in several previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Flynn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Yu, 2015)</ref>. While the existing findings may suggest SCI plays little strategic role, our findings demystify such claims. Our study identifies the strategic roles of SCI on SCR in transforming weak signals into competitive performance. Thus, the present study extends the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Yu et al. (2018)</ref> by investigating the mediating role of SCR from an OIPT perspective. The implication of the SIAP model is that SCI and SCR can be classified as a hierarchical sequence, one after another, in the strategic foresight and actions process. Previous SCM studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Yu et al., 2018)</ref> have not recognized such crucial strategic roles of SCI. Hence, future research may treat SCI as an interpretation process for achieving shared meaning and goals, from the OIPT perspective, to uncover other supply chain strategies that mediate the SCI-performance relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kim and Lee, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wu et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Yu et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The final important theoretical implication informs the strategic planning literature. We found that the effect of ES on firm performance is partially mediated by the development of responsiveness in supply chains. Although previous research has addressed the importance of ES in the strategic planning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Albright, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Fabbe-Costes et al., 2014)</ref>, to the best of our knowledge no previous study has investigated the effect of ES on operational performance in the supply chain context. Our study is an initial attempt at filling the aforementioned gaps in the literature. More specifically, our study suggests that a more refined and nuanced explanation of the ES-performance relationship lies in the supply chain literature. SCR is simply one competitive weapon enabling firms to respond effectively to changes in the market which, in turn, leads to superior operational performance. Other forms of supply chain strategies could be incorporated into the SIAP model to refine understanding of the effects of ES.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Managerial implications</head><p>The study findings suggest that ES activities provide useful information for developing a quick response supply chain (SCR) strategy to supply chain partners. As today's industries are becoming more competitive and dynamic, information from the external environment has become an important resource for firms to capitalize upon to enhance competitiveness. Our study suggests that managers should develop information processing strategies coupled with effective ES, especially for identifying, gathering, and analysing information about events and trends occurring outside the firm that are specifically related to establishing strategic collaboration, SCI, and responsive supply chains. Since more than half of the operational performance benefit from ES is derived from SCI and SCR activities, top executives should learn to scan supply chain related environmental information and provide the information to supply chain managers; the goal being to work with such managers and supply chain partners to adapt to the changing environment.</p><p>Second, supply chain managers need to work with senior executives to obtain strategic signals from ES activities, serve as a conduit to facilitate joint interpretation of the strategic signals with business partners, and transform them into strategic insights about changes in suppliers, customers, competitors and markets. Additionally, it is important to then reconfigure the supply chain to respond quickly to the changes. Without integrating these activities through the SIAP model (ES as scanning, SCI as interpretation, and SCR as action), signals from ES and collaboration through SCI would not necessarily lead to better operational outcomes. Managers are advised to find ways to link ES activities with processes for developing and implementing SCM practices, especially responsiveness and integration. Based on the OIPT argument that the levels of responsiveness and integration should be aligned with the levels of dynamic and changing competitive environment, we suggest three processes -ES activities in gathering sufficient and relevant information, SCI activities in processing and sharing the information with supply chain partners, and supply chain responsiveness strategyought to be aligned. Bear in mind many firms have adopted process models such as the SCOR model. However, it is important to complement such models with the design of appropriate ES processes and link them to the supply chain strategy processes.</p><p>Third, while researchers have long articulated the benefits of building strategic collaboration among supply chain partners, our findings suggest supply chain managers should view SCI as a joint interpretation process and a potential preparation for big data initiatives.</p><p>Managers should recognize the improved SCR associated with SCI instead of viewing SCI exclusively as an initiative to achieve cost efficiency. The mediation analysis strongly suggests that if firms focus only on developing a close and integrated relationship without developing a shared schema for interpreting the environmental information and translating insights from the shared information into quick actions, they may not be able to fully leverage the potential operational benefits. Our study reveals SCR is one of the key strategies that enable firms to achieve superior operational performance. While SCI did not directly affect operational performance it is, nevertheless, a key antecedent to the development of SCR. In fact, since all of the operational performance benefit of SCI is delivered through SCR, managers seeking to obtain operational benefits should invest in improving responsiveness in conjunction with SCI.</p><p>Fourth, as a mental model guiding managers to become more holistic and systems-oriented thinkers, this study provides an example of how the SIAP model can be a useful framework that helps mangers better understand the ES-SCM practices (SCI/SCR)-performance relationships. With the emphasis on scanning "S" as the first step, this framework will be useful for managers considering implementing supply chain big data analytics to further consider other types of data to scan "S", and different means to interpret "I", including the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and to support a supply chain strategy be it responsiveness (SCR), lean, smart, or intelligence. More importantly, using SIAP as a mental model drives a constant search for fits between strategy and the environment to better cope with today's turbulent and uncertain environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Directions for future research</head><p>The study has a number of limitations that present opportunities for future research. First, our conceptualization of ES from a SIAP perspective focuses on gathering information about business environments from supply chain partners. The ES literature suggests that effective scanning of both the external environment and the internal circumstances of a firm is important to performance improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Garg et al., 2003)</ref>. Thus, future research should examine the aspects of both the firm's external environment and its internal circumstances and their differential impacts on SCM and firm performance.</p><p>Second, another limitation is that this study conceptualized SCI as an aggregate construct.</p><p>The SCI literature has examined SCI as a multidimensional construct inclusive of internal integration, customer integration, and supplier integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Flynn et al., 2010)</ref>. Thus, future research should investigate the different dimensions of SCI and their relative impact on responsiveness and firm performance.</p><p>Third, future research should examine the relationship between ES, SCM practices, and firm performance in different economies to confirm the results obtained in this study. Studies that compare ES in a supply chain context in developed versus developing nations may also be of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Sawyerr, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Fourth, this study considered supply chain responsiveness as the "action'. However, supply chain responsiveness might be investigated more granularly to determine which dimensions of responsiveness are most critical, e.g., volume or mix flexibility, price changes, supply base changes or investments.</p><p>Fifth, this study considered operational performance as an important performance outcome of SCI and SCR. However, previous research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wu et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Yu et al., 2018)</ref> suggests that integrated and responsive supply chains improve financial and marketing performance. Therefore, a possible direction for future research could be to examine how SCI and SCR bear on a wider range of performance measures.</p><p>Lastly, related to the sample, another limitation relates to the single respondent design. The perspectives of individuals within the firm may not be uniform or the respondent may not represent the dominant view within the firm. Multiple respondents at each firm could improve the study's reliability and incorporating a broader range of industries could enhance generalizability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusions</head><p>Our study extends the SCM literature in several important ways. The first is through importing the SIAP model, which forms a bridge to the strategy literature and brings a new perspective to the supply chain literature. The use of the SIAP model enables a more precise application of the OIPT in the supply chain context. To the best of our knowledge, the use of the SIAP model herein is the first in an empirical study focused on comprehensively explaining the performance effects of ES through the development of two SCM practicessupply chain responsiveness and integration. The demonstration that the SIAP model serves as an integrative framework for refining understanding of the ES-SCI-SCR-performance leads to the implication that other scanning and SCM practices could be studied in a more comprehensive manner. The second implication is that this study positions OIPT in conjunction with the SIAP model as a new way to refine disparate knowledge on ES, SCI, SCR and performance. The SIAP model can also be extended to account for the environment and other explanatory variables. From a practical perspective our empirical findings, especially the indirect effect of ES through SCI and SCR, provide useful insights for supply chain managers and their top executives.      </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>scanning.
