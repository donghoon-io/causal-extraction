<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study presents a unique perspective on the application of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) in the context of the green lodging industry via configurational modelling of three TPB dimensions in formulating hotel visitors' behavioural responses. Attitudes toward behaviour, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control are the three indicators of TPB used to predict guests' continued intention to use and recommend green hotels on Cyprus, a Mediterranean island with a fragile ecological system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design/methodology/approach</head><p>A questionnaire-based survey is used to evaluate the study's objectives. A total of 320 guests of green hotels were approached between June and July 2017 and invited to participate. Among them, 260 valid cases were obtained and used for data analysis. The structural model was tested using structural equation modelling (SEM), the configurational model was assessed using the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), and the necessary predictor was evaluated using the necessary condition analysis (NCA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings</head><p>The SEM results revealed that attitudes regarding behaviour increased the continued intention to visit and recommend green hotels. Similarly, subjective norms enhanced the guests' desired behavioural responses. Perceived behavioural control boosted their continued intention to visit, but this was insufficient for predicting green hotel guests' intention to recommend. The fsQCA results indicated that two causal models explain the conditions of both high and low levels of behavioural responses. The NCA results showed that attitudes toward behaviour were the only necessary condition of the two expected behavioural responses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Desired behavioural responses from guests are among the major drivers of success for green hotels, as they contribute to the hotels' performances <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gil et al., 2001)</ref>. Some scholars have identified guest loyalty as one of the ultimate objectives of green hotel hoteliers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teng et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wu et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yusof et al., 2017)</ref>. To formulate individuals' behavioural intentions, researchers must apply a solid scientific theory to sufficiently explain the proposed conceptual model <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Olya &amp; Gavilyan, 2017)</ref>. The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) is frequently used to model green hotel guests' behaviours (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Line &amp; Hanks, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teng et al., 2018)</ref>. Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Teng et al. (2018</ref><ref type="bibr">Teng et al. ( , p. 1138</ref>) stated, "TPB provide[s] green hotel practitioners with an important implication that investigating consumers' behavioural intention and attitude towards the green hotel would be the first step to predict whether consumers would actually choose green hotels to stay."</p><p>Many researchers believe that TPB needs to be decomposed, merged, or extended to support conceptual models for indicating customers' behavioural intentions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dahiya &amp; Gayatri, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Han, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hsu &amp; Huang, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kiatkawsin &amp; Han, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">López-Mosquera &amp; Olya, H., Bagheri, P., &amp; Tumer, M., (2019)</ref>. Decoding behavioural responses of green hotel guests: A deeper insight into the application of the theory of planned behaviour. International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management. 10.1108/IJCHM-05-2018-0374. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sánchez, 2012)</ref>. These studies have indicated that the investigation of the net effects of three TPB indicators-namely, attitude toward the behaviour, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control-is insufficient for predicting the expected behavioural intentions of moral customers.</p><p>In line with studies that have tried to apply dissected, merged, or extended versions of the TPB, this study intends to offer a deeper insight into the TPB for modelling the behavioural intentions of green hotel guests using the set-theoretic analytical approach of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). In other words, a sufficient combination of the three TPB variables is explored to predict the expected behavioural intentions of green hotel guests.</p><p>Along with noting the sufficient net effect and combination of the three TPB variables, this is, to our knowledge, the first attempt in the literature to identify the necessary factors of TPB for achieving desired behavioural intentions among green hotel guests.</p><p>A green hotel is defined as "an environmental friendly lodging property that institutes and follows ecologically sound programs/practices (e.g., water and energy savings, reduction of solid waste, and cost saving) to help protect our planet" <ref type="bibr">(Han et al., 2010, p. 325)</ref>. According to the Cyprus Tourism Organization, green hotels are responsible for minimizing their negative impact on the environment and maximizing their benefits through reinforcing sustainable development policies and pro-environmental actions. Specifically, green hotels are committed to satisfy standards for energy efficiency, consumption of green products, water conservation, air quality management, solid waste management, wastewater management and treatment, noise pollution control, toxic and harmful substance disposal management, human resource management, cooperation with local organizations, and environmental policies and practices for hotel operation. <ref type="bibr">Olya, H., Bagheri, P., &amp; Tumer, M., (2019)</ref>.

International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality <ref type="bibr">Management. 10.1108</ref><ref type="bibr">/IJCHM-05-2018-0374. 4</ref> This study aims to evaluate the sufficient effects of three TPB variables on intention to recommend and continue to use green hotels using structural equation modelling (SEM). This empirical study uses SEM to explore the sufficient combination of the three TPB variables to explain conditions leading to the guests' desired behavioural intentions. Although SEM and configurational modelling investigate a sufficient net effect and combinations of three TPB variables (i.e., causal recipes), we use the necessary condition analysis to identify which TPB factor(s) are necessary to achieve the desired behavioural responses from green hotel guests.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to model TPB using three analytical approaches (i.e., SEM, fsQCA, and NCA), which provide a deeper insight of the behaviour of green hotel guests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The theory of planned behaviour (TPB)</head><p>The TPB, which is an extended version of the theory of reasoned action through its inclusion of perceived behavioural control, explains how individuals intend to take action <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Ajzen (1991, p. 181)</ref> described behavioural intention as "an indication of how hard people are willing to try, of how much of an effort they are planning to exert, in order to perform the behavior." The TPB suggests individuals' beliefs, attitudes, and intentions are involved in shaping their behaviours. Specifically, subjective norms, attitudes toward the behaviour, and perceived behavioural control are major predictors of an individual's behavioural intent. According to <ref type="bibr">Ajzen (1991, p. 188)</ref>, subjective norms refer to "the perceived social pressure to perform or not to perform the behaviour" and indicates "the degree to which a person has a favorable or unfavorable evaluation or appraisal of the behavior in question." Perceived behavioural control is described as "the perceived ease or difficulty of performing the behaviour." <ref type="bibr">Olya, H., Bagheri, P., &amp; Tumer, M., (2019)</ref>. Decoding behavioural responses of green hotel guests: A deeper insight into the application of the theory of planned behaviour. International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management. 10.1108/IJCHM-05-2018-0374.</p><p>The TPB is commonly used to elucidate customers' behavioural intentions in the green consumption context, which is a complex social phenomenon. This complexity is caused by the non-linear, fuzzy, and dynamic processes of human decision-making and the complication of behaviours toward environmental issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lezak &amp; Thibodeau, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Olya &amp; Akhshik, 2018)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Lucas et al. (2008, p. 458)</ref>, "Socio-psychological models of individual behavior reveal environment-related behaviors to be complex and non-linear, shaped by multiple antecedent factors applying in different sequences and with different weighting to determine the end behavior."</p><p>To tackle the complexity of green consumption, scholars have worked to break down, extend, modify, and/or merge the TPB to offer a sensible, theoretical justification for their proposed conceptual models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Han, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Han, , 2015;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hsu &amp; Huang, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kiatkawsin &amp; Han, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kim &amp; Han, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">López-Mosquera &amp; Sánchez, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ryu &amp; Jang, 2006)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Goh et al. (2017)</ref> extended the TPB with pro-environmental values to describe the behaviours of national park visitors. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hsu and Huang (2012)</ref> modified the TPB with the inclusion of tourists' motivation to visit a destination and their actual behaviour. They advised that the association of tourists' motivation with their pro-environmental behaviour was not tenable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Han et al. (2010)</ref> extended the TPB by adding environmentally friendly activities into the model to predict consumers' intention to visit a green hotel. They administrated an online survey among potential American customers and found that attitude toward the behaviour, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control positively affected visit intention. They found the level of consumer engagement in pro-environmental behaviour did not moderate the associations of the three TPB elements with visit intention. However, <ref type="bibr">Han et al.'s (2010)</ref> study was limited to the intention to visit a green hotel and did not include the behavioural intention of guests who already stayed in a green hotel. <ref type="bibr">Olya, H., Bagheri, P., &amp; Tumer, M., (2019)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6</head><p>A recent study extended the TPB by adding moral reflectiveness and conscientiousness to the proposed structural model using SEM with Indian lodging data <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Verma &amp; Chandra 2018)</ref>. They found that three elements of TPB plus two added factors improved young consumers' visit intention of Indian green hotels. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen and Tung (2014)</ref> extended the TPB model with perceived moral obligation and environmental concern to formulate consumers' intention to visit Taiwanese green hotels. Using SEM, they found environmental concern positively improved three TPB dimensions. They also found perceived moral obligation and three TPB elements enhanced consumers' visit intention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Botetzagias et al. (2015)</ref> extended TPB with moral norms to predict the recycling intention of Greek people. The SEM results showed that the moral norm, attitude, and perceived behavioural control increased the recycling intention of individuals. They found the subjective norm and demographic variables did not influence an individual's recycling intention.</p><p>López-Mosquera and Sánchez (2012) merged the TPB with the value-belief-norm (VBN) theory to elucidate visitors' intention to pay for the conservation of a suburban park. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Olya and Akhshik (2018)</ref> merged the TPB and VBN theories to model the pro-environmental behaviours of participants attending marine turtle tours. In the lodging industry, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Han (2015)</ref> merged the TPB with VBN to predict the behaviours of green hotel guests. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kim and Han (2010)</ref> added a number of predictors (e.g., behaviour, normative, and control beliefs and environmental concessions behaviours) to the TPB model to predict guests' intention to pay conventional hotel prices. Several other studies have used a stripped down version of the TPB to explain models indicating customers' behavioural intentions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lin et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Sahli &amp; Legohérel, 2015)</ref>. In the decomposed version of the TPB, attitude is formed by the three indicators of relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity; perceived behavioural control is measured by two indicators-efficacy and facilitating conditions; and subjective norms are represented by normative influences. Against this backdrop, recent studies have called for the application of a pragmatic approach for advancing theories and methods to enlighten the black-box process of tourists' pro-environmental behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Juvan &amp; Dolnicar, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kiatkawsin &amp; Han 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Olya &amp; Akhshik, 2018)</ref>. As an alternative solution for the extension, decomposition, and merging of the TPB, this empirical study proposes a configurational model, along with a structural model, to explore the configuration of three TPB elements in formulating the behavioural intentions of green hotel guests. This study also extends the current knowledge of ethical consumption by conducting an analysis of the necessary conditions to achieve the desired behavioural intentions of green hotel guests.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> illustrates the proposed configurational model. The model includes the TPB configuration-composed of attitude toward the behaviour, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control-to predict two desired behavioural intentions of green hotel guests, continued use and recommendations. Configurational modelling enables researchers to explore the causal recipes for the negation of an outcome (the low score of a variable). This study explores the combination of three TPB elements that lead to low scores of continued intention to use and intention to recommend (i.e., undesired behavioural intentions) from the perspective of green hotel guests.</p></div>

All study variables except attitude toward the behaviour were measured using a 7-point Likert scale that ranged from "1" (strongly disagree) to "7" (strongly agree). Four items for attitude toward the behaviour were measured using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from "1" (bad/foolish/unpleasant/harmful) to "7" (good/wise/pleasant/beneficial).</p><p>Using different anchor labels for measuring the scale items is one procedural remedy that <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Podsakoff et al. (2003)</ref> recommend for controlling the potential threat of common method bias.</p><p>The questionnaire consists of three sections: an introduction, scale items for the five study variables, and guests' demographics. The purpose of the survey, statement on data confidentiality, voluntary participation, and anonymity of all respondents are outlined in the introduction. Two experts from the hospitality industry and two academics from the tourism and hospitality discipline evaluated the questionnaire prior to its use, and a pilot study with 15 hotel guests was conducted to ensure that all items were comprehensible to the respondents.</p><p>The results of the pilot study confirmed that respondents had no difficulty understanding and responding to the questions.</p></div>

The fragile ecosystem of this small Mediterranean island is under pressure related to tourism development <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Olya &amp; Alipour, 2015)</ref>. This study used a questionnaire-based survey to collect data from the guests of green hotels that operated under established mandatory sustainability standards for hotel establishments approved by the Cyprus Tourism Organization. To conduct the study, we first obtained permission for data collection from four green hotels before directly approaching guests and inviting them to participate in the survey. <ref type="bibr">Olya, H., Bagheri, P., &amp; Tumer, M., (2019)</ref>.

The field administration of the survey spanned from June 7 through July 28, 2017. Questionnaires with more than 20% of data missing were dropped from the study sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hair et al., 2014)</ref>. The response rate was 87%, with 260 valid cases used for data analysis.</p><p>The respondents' profiles are presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Forty (15.4%) respondents were between the ages of 18 and 27, 47 (18.1%) were 28-37 years old, 61 (23.5%) were 38-47 years old, 41 (15.8%) were 48-57 years old, and 71 (27.2%) were 58 years or older. The sample included 111 (42.7%) male and 149 (57.3%) female respondents. In terms of education level, 7 (2.7%) respondents had not completed high school, 56 (21.5%) held only a high school diploma, 66 (25.4%) had some college experience, 63 (24.2%) held a bachelor's degree, and 68 (26.2%) held graduate degrees. The annual income level of 43 (16.6%) respondents was under US$19,000; 57 (21.9%) respondents earned between $19,000 and $24,999 annually; 78 (30%) respondents earned between $25,000 and $49,999 per year; 44 (16.9%) earned between $50,000 and $69,999; and 38 (14.6%) respondents had an annual income of $70,000 or more.</p><p>Respondents were asked about their experiences staying at a green hotel: 174 (66.9%) had no prior experience, whereas 86 (33.1%) respondents had stayed at a green hotel previously.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>10</head><p>After testing the psychometric properties of the study measures, both symmetrical and asymmetrical analyses were applied to test proposed structural and configurational models, respectively. Symmetrical (e.g., regression, SEM) and asymmetrical techniques (e.g., fsQCA) differ mainly in their assumed association between the predictor (X) and outcome (Y). In the present study, three TPB elements are considered predictors (X) and two behavioural intentions are the outcomes (Y). The assumption in symmetrical thinking is that high or low scores of predictor (X) link with high or low scores of outcome (Y), whereas in an asymmetrical relationship, high/low scores of X do not necessarily connect with those of Y. Recent studies in hospitality and tourism support latent rational <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hsiao et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Olya et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Pappas, 2017)</ref>, as they recognize that a combination of the predictors must be considered a casual model (X) to predict a given outcome (Y). In this vein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Olya and Al-ansi (2018)</ref> argue that individuals make decisions while simultaneously considering several influential criteria. Therefore, a symmetrical pattern is less likely to emerge when a combination of X is used to predict Y. Symmetrical analyses show the net effect of X on Y, whereas asymmetrical approaches reveal a combination of the factors, called causal recipes, that explain the model that indicate the outcome. We believe both symmetrical and asymmetrical techniques are helpful, as they offer different insights of the social phenomena. This study used SEM, or a symmetrical analysis, to test the net effect of three TPB dimensions on continued intention to use and recommend green hotels. The CFA and SEM were conducted using AMOS V25.0. This study applied an fsQCA, or an asymmetrical approach, to explore the combination of the three TPB dimensions for predicting both high and low scores of the two behavioural outcomes. The configurational model was tested using the fsQCA V3.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ragin, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The fsQCA includes three stages of calibration, generating truth tables, and a counterfactual analysis. In the calibration stage, Likert scale data (e.g., ranging from 1: strongly <ref type="bibr">Olya, H., Bagheri, P., &amp; Tumer, M., (2019)</ref>.

In next step, all possible conditions, called truth tables, leading to the expected outcome are calculated based on a Boolean algebra function and set theory. The truth table is refined according to the two probabilistic measures of coverage and consistency. In the counterfactual analysis step, conditions are minimized based on the existent knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ragin, 2008)</ref>. This study follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Olya and Gavilyan's (2017)</ref> suggestion to conduct an fsQCA for travel and hospitality research using a questionnaire-based survey.

In accordance with Olya and Akhshik's (2018) findings, two causal models for the negation of an outcome (i.e., a low score for continued intention to use) are unique and different from the mirror opposite of causal models for high scores of the outcome (coverage: .773, consistency: .797). Model 1 indicates that low perceived behavioural control and high attitude toward the behaviour lead to low levels of continued intention to use green hotels. According to Model 2, low levels of continued intention to use green hotels occur when levels of attitudes toward the behaviour, subjective norms are low and perceived behavioural control is high (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>).</p></div>

These results indicate that to attain high intentions to recommend and continue to use green hotels, managers need to follow similar recipes. In other words, satisfying conditions for two causal recipes, obtained from the fsQCA, lead to both desired behavioural outcomes. These results are straightforward in comparison with the conditions in which causal recipes of intention to recommend differ from those of continued intention to use.

This means that, without an attitude toward the behaviour, guests' intention to recommend and continue to use green hotels will not be achieved. Values of consistency for subjective norms and perceived behavioural control were close to the recommended level for necessary conditions. Results from the fsQCA offered two recipes (M1: atb and M2: ~sn*pbc). An NCA was conducted to identify the causal recipe necessary to attain high levels of continued intention to use and recommendation intention.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion Theoretical Implications</head><p>This study extended the current knowledge of green hotel guests' behaviours using a novel application of the TPB. This study suggests that TPB configurational modelling can serve as a powerful solution for tackling the complexity of guests' behaviours in the green hotel industry.</p><p>We believe that asymmetrical TPB modelling is pragmatic as an extension, modification, and decomposition of the TPB for predicting green consumption. This study revealed that the net effects of attitude to behaviour, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control on guests' continued intention to use green hotels are significant and positive. Intention to recommend a green hotel to others is influenced by attitude to behaviour and subjective norms, but not affected by perceived behavioural control.</p><p>This study argues that, although investigating the distinct effect of TPB variables on the behavioural intentions of green hotel guests is significant, it is insufficient. In other words, causal models that indicate this combination of three TPB variables must be explored to describe conditions in which the desired behavioural intentions of guest can be achieved. Specifically, SEM results showed that perceived behavioural control, singly, is not associated with intention to recommend, whereas the results of the configurational modelling showed that perceived behavioural control, in combination with subjective norms, could contribute in predicting intention to recommend.</p><p>This study applied fsQCA to explore causal recipes from a combination of TPB variables in formulating the behavioural intentions of green hotel guests in Cyprus. Attitude to behaviour offers a sufficient condition for achieving a high level of intent to continue using and recommending green hotels to others. These desired behavioural intentions result from high levels of perceived behavioural control and low subjective norms.

The present study's findings from the configurational modelling indicate that guests with low levels of perceived behavioural control and high attitudes toward behaviour are less likely to continue using green hotels. Therefore, the marketing department of green hotels may wish to adjust strategies by excluding customers with a low level of perceived behavioural control, although they might have an appropriate attitude toward behaviour, from marketing practices. <ref type="bibr">Odedina et al. (2010)</ref> found that young and less educated males have a low level of perceived behavioural control. Nonetheless, we must acknowledge that it is not straightforward to recognize who has a low level of perceived behavioural control and further studies on green consumption need to address this research question. In the case of current customers who have a low level of perceived behavioural control and high level of attitude, green hotels can help improve their perception about control over behaviour through organized activities and campaigns that demonstrate to this group that they have control of their intentions and actions. As this group displays a high attitude toward behaviour, they are likely to participate in safe, interpretative, and fun activities.</p><p>A low score for continued intention to use also may be the result of low levels of guests' attitudes toward behaviour and subjective norms and high levels of perceived behavioural control. Combinations of TPB factors for low levels of intention to recommend are dissimilar to causal models for high levels of continued intention to use green hotels. Guests with low levels of attitudes toward behaviour may not recommend green hotels to others. Low levels of <ref type="bibr">Olya, H., Bagheri, P., &amp; Tumer, M., (2019)</ref>.

In terms of the practicality of the necessary condition results, an impactful plan is needed to improve attitudes toward behaviour among green hotel guests. One practice that improves attitude toward behaviour is taking action with a purpose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>The TPB is frequently used for predicting hotel guests' behaviours. Most of the research in this area is focused on the net effect of TPB indicators in explaining behavioural responses.</p><p>Although the investigation of sufficient TPB indicators is significant, managers of green hotels need to know how three specific TPB indicators can be combined to describe complex conditions leading to high and low levels of their guests' expected behaviours. Importantly, hoteliers must be vigilant to satisfy the necessary conditions that lead to guests' high intention to recommend and continue to use green hotels.</p><p>Attitude toward behaviour plays a critical role in guests recommending and continuing to use green hotels as a net effect of this factor, showed by SEM results (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). According to the fsQCA results, attitude toward behaviour as a single factor appeared as a causal recipe that is sufficient and consistent to predict two desired behavioural outcomes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the NCA results revealed that attitude toward behaviour is a necessary factor to attain favourable behaviours among guests of green hotels in Cyprus. Therefore, green hotel managers should invest in promoting the attitude toward behaviour of their guests. Specifically, <ref type="bibr">Olya, H., Bagheri, P., &amp; Tumer, M., (2019)</ref>. Decoding behavioural responses of green hotel guests: A deeper insight into the application of the theory of planned behaviour. International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management. 10.1108/IJCHM-05-2018-0374. social media can be used as an influential tool to increase the environmental concerns of guests or potential customers, which may improve their attitude toward behaviour. The marketing department can reinforce environmental policies and share eco-friendly practices through direct marketing via email.</p><p>Green hotels can support loyalty programs that demonstrate appreciation of the knowledge, concern, and attitude of guests toward behaviours. They can encourage guests who engage in eco-friendly activities by offering incentives and awards. Training programs may provide opportunities for guests to learn about the purpose of green consumption. Policy makers in Cyprus need to support green hotels as a priority in destination management by cooperating in pro-environmental actions because green consumption can contribute to the sustainable management of this small Mediterranean island's fragile ecosystem. The government can also provide technical and financial support for energy efficiency, water and energy conservation, and the air quality of green hotels. Such policies enhance awareness and attitude of all stakeholders including guests of green hotels toward sustainable management of hospitality and tourism in the small island of Cyprus. In addition, the government can establish electric charge stations near the green hotels to encourage using electrical vehicles by both guests and employees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research</head><p>This empirical study advances the theory and methods on ethical consumption in the hospitality industry by assessing the net effect of TPB indicators on the structural model's outcomes using SEM, investigating a complex combination of TPB indicators on the guests' behavioural responses using fsQCA, and identifying the necessary TPB indicators for predicting outcomes using NCA. Modelling the behaviours of green hotel guests using cross-sectional data from only one island (i.e., Cyprus) should be considered a limitation of this study, as Cypriot context <ref type="bibr">Olya, H., Bagheri, P., &amp; Tumer, M., (2019)</ref>.

International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality <ref type="bibr">Management. 10.1108</ref><ref type="bibr">/IJCHM-05-2018-0374.</ref> might be a hindrance to the generalization of the study's findings. Future scholars are encouraged to conduct longitudinal studies in different locations. Furthermore, data of this study is limited to the guests who chose to stay at green hotels. Hence, the results cannot be applied to other types of hotels. We recommend modelling the TPB using the three analytical approaches proposed in this study and comparing the outcomes between green and non-green hotels.</p><p>This empirical study used three TPB variables as a configuration for predicting two behavioural intentions of green hotel guests; we recommend the application of a decomposed version of the TPB that generates three configurations for predicting given behavioural intentions of green hotel guests. The prediction of willingness to pay more as an outcome of a configurational model designed based on the TPB is recommended as one direction for further studies. The proposed model of this study is limited to the views of guests (i.e., demand side); therefore, the inclusion of the supply side perspective (i.e., managers and employees) in configurational models would enrich our understanding of green consumption in the hospitality industry. Green consumption is an evolving trend in the hotel industry as governments reinforce pro-environmental policies and responsible institutions certify the eco-friendly practices of hotels. Therefore, it will remain a topic of interest to stakeholders and academics should continue to study the many aspects of green consumption to provide helpful recommendations in other subsectors of the hospitality industry such as restaurants, bars, nightclubs, resorts, tour operators, and leisure centres. friendliness, green support and green desire", International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality <ref type="bibr">Management, Doi: 10.1108</ref><ref type="bibr">/IJCHM-10-2016</ref><ref type="bibr">-0596 .
