<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fire and herbivory are important determinants of nutrient availability in savanna ecosystems. Fire and herbivory effects on the nutritive quality of savanna vegetation can occur directly, independent of changes in the plant community, or indirectly, via effects on the plant community. Indirect effects can be further subdivided into those occurring because of changes in plant species composition or plant abundance (i.e., quality versus quantity). We studied relationships between fire, herbivory, rainfall, soil fertility, and leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sodium (Na) at 30 sites inside and outside of Serengeti National Park. Using structural equation modeling, we asked whether fire and herbivory influences were largely direct or indirect and how their signs and strengths differed within the context of natural savanna processes. Herbivory was associated with enhanced leaf N and P through changes in plant biomass and community composition. Fire was associated with reduced leaf nutrient concentrations through changes in plant community composition. Additionally, fire had direct positive effects on Na and nonlinear direct effects on P that partially mitigated the indirect</p></div>

Thus, it is important to understand how factors such as fire and herbivory, pervasive in savanna grassland and grazing ecosystems, influence forage nutritive quality and plant-derived animal nutrition.</p><p>Models of herbivore influences on plant nutritive quality generally emphasize herbivore selectivity and the ability of plants to recover after defoliation <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Pastor and Naiman 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Jefferies et al. 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hobbs 1996</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Augustine and McNaughton 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Ritchie 2000)</ref>. Selective herbivory can decelerate nutrient cycling by shifting plant species composition toward unpalatable, low-nutritive-quality species. In contrast, generalist herbivores can promote or maintain palatable, high-nutritive-quality plant species when nutrient inputs, temporal variability, or the timing of defoliation are sufficient to maintain such species <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hobbs 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Augustine and McNaughton 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Frank et al. 1998</ref>).

Commonly, it has been observed that nutrient concentration is increased in postdefoliation regrowth through the replacement of older, low-quality leaves by younger, high-quality tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hamilton et al. 1998)</ref> or from physiological upregulation of enzymes stimulated by defoliation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson et al. 2006)</ref>.</p><p>In comparison with herbivory, fire is almost always a generalist consumer (sensu <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bond and Keeley 2005)</ref> and thus can have homogenizing effects on nutrient cycling and availability <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hobbs et al. 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hobbs 1996)</ref>.

However, fire can also have indirect effects on the nutritive quality of a plant community by promoting the abundance of fire-tolerant species <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gibson and Hulbert 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hartnett et al. 1996</ref>) and increasing germination rates of disturbance-adapted species <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Tyler 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Benwell 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Jutila and Grace 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The influences of fire and herbivory on plant nutritive quality discussed thus far can be generalized into rela-tionships that (1) are independent of changes in the plant community or (2) occur because of changes in the plant community. Influences that occur because of changes in the plant community can also be further subdivided into those that depend on (i) plant abundance (i.e., quantity) or (ii) plant species composition (i.e., quality). There are many ways that fire and herbivory can influence plant nutritive quality independent of the plant community, including upregulating metabolism in defoliated plants ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Karban and Myers 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderson et al. 2006)</ref>, translocating nutrients from roots to shoots <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Ourry et al. 1988)</ref>, or affecting soil-available nutrients through various mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Huntly 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sirotnak and Huntly 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Knops et al. 2002)</ref>. Thus, a conceptual illustration of the influences of fire and herbivory on plant nutritive quality includes a system of possible direct and indirect paths with unique signs and strengths (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>In Serengeti National Park (SNP), Tanzania, frequent fires and chronic herbivory are major ecological and evolutionary forces influencing the savanna-grassland plant communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Sinclair and Norton-Griffiths 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mc-Naughton 1985)</ref>. As one of the last fully functional grazing ecosystems and home to the largest aggregation of migratory ungulates on earth <ref type="bibr">(Sinclair et al. 2007)</ref>, the Serengeti provides a seminal example of how fire and herbivory can influence nutrient availability in a natural system. Although many studies have focused on N availability, research in SNP has demonstrated that the spatial and temporal distribution of at least seven elements is associated with resident herbivore densities <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(McNaughton 1988)</ref> and the timing of migratory herbivore movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(McNaughton 1990)</ref>. In particular, phosphorus (P) and sodium (Na) in aboveground forage are particularly important to herbivores because they are required to sustain pregnancy and lactation <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Murray 1993</ref><ref type="bibr">(Murray , 1995))</ref>. Like all natural ecosystems, the influences of fire and herbivory on plant nutritive quality in SNP operate within a system of multiple influences that obscure the true relationships between these variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Shipley 2000)</ref>; the most prominent of these in SNP are strong gradients in climate and soil fertility <ref type="bibr">(Mc-Naughton et al. 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Sinclair and Arcese 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson et al. 2007)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, observations of forage nutritive quality were examined in relation to patterns of fire frequency and herbivore density in Serengeti savanna grasslands. To account for the influences of climate and soils, variation in rainfall and soil nutrient data were incorporated into the analysis as broadscale environmental influences. The primary goal of the study was to partition the influences of fire frequency and herbivore density on plant nutritive quality into those effects that occurred independently of changes in the plant community (i.e., direct effects) and those that occurred because of changes in the plant com- ) or plant community composition ( ). Similarly, 1 r 7 2 r 8 fire effects on leaf nutrient concentrations can be direct (6), and thus independent of changes in the plant community, or they can be indirect, occurring via effects brought about by changes in plant abundance ( ) or changes in the composition of the plant community ( ). See 3 r 7 4 r 8 table 1 for a description of the processes linked to each path in the conceptual model. munity (i.e., indirect effects; fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Structural equation modeling (SEM), a means of accomplishing such partitioning, was used to address the following questions. (1) What is the relationship between herbivore density, fire frequency, and vegetation community properties, specifically, plant abundance and species composition? (2) Are the relationships between herbivore density, fire frequency, and plant N, P, and Na predominantly independent of changes in the plant community, dependent on changes in the plant community, or both? Finally, (3) how do the relationships whereby fire frequency and resident herbivore density influence plant nutrients differ? While the specific effects of fire and herbivory in particular plant communities are generally known, an understanding of the network of connections relating fire and herbivory to forage nutritive quality is lacking. By incorporating variation in rainfall and soils into our analysis, we build on the current understanding of the complex contingencies that operate in African savanna grasslands <ref type="bibr">(McNaughton 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(McNaughton , 1985))</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Site Selection and Compilation of Environmental Data Layers</head><p>The nature of our study questions required that we sample across sites that varied in fire frequency and herbivore use but that were not confounded by differences in soil fertility and rainfall. The network of game reserves and wildlife management areas on the western edge of SNP (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>)</p><p>have created a gradient of herbivore use because hunting in the reserve areas reduces resident herbivore densities compared with inside the national park, where hunting has been banned since 1951 <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Sinclair and Arcese 1995)</ref>.</p><p>The average rainfall in this region is high and, therefore, herbaceous fuel is abundant, whereas areas to the south and east have lower average rainfall and infrequent fires <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Norton-Griffiths 1979)</ref>. Fires set by park officials and people living near the park are common in the reserves and on the western edge of SNP (Norton-Griffiths 1979).</p><p>The conditions created by the reserve areas allowed us to sample sites with contrasting herbivore densities and various fire frequencies while controlling for variation in soil fertility and rainfall.</p><p>Thirty study sites along the western edge of SNP were sampled from February 5 to March 15, 2005, corresponding to the plant growing season and the period when herds of migratory wildebeests and zebras were located in their wet-season calving grounds in the Serengeti Plains. The timing of the study ensured that the sites had not been influenced by the annual migration for several months, as migratory animals typically move into the Serengeti Plains in November <ref type="bibr">(Murray 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Thirgood et al. 2004)</ref>. Satellite data, collected by the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at a spatial resolution of 250 m 2 between 2000 and 2004, was used a priori to identify sites that varied in fire frequency (see app. A and table B1 in the online edition of the American Naturalist).</p><p>As a measure of long-term resident herbivore use at each of the 30 sites, we utilized resident herbivore counts obtained by aerial surveys conducted by the Frankfurt Zoological <ref type="bibr">Society in 1988</ref><ref type="bibr">Society in , 1991</ref><ref type="bibr">Society in , 1996</ref><ref type="bibr">Society in , 2001</ref><ref type="bibr">Society in , and 2003</ref>. The available data included counts of four ungulate species: giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), Coke's hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), topi (Damaliscus korrigum), and impala (Aepyceros melampus). The methods used to count herbivores and estimate herbivore densities in SNP are described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Campbell and Borner (1995)</ref>. For each species, ArcGIS version 9.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA) was used to produce map layers that consisted of 5-km 2 grid cells of herbivore densities averaged across the five surveys. Densities of the four species were then combined to produce a final map layer from which the average ungulate density was extracted using the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of the sites (app. A).</p><p>As a measure of climate effects on leaf nutrients at each of the sites, monthly precipitation data from over 30 years and 58 rain-gauge locations across SNP were obtained from the Serengeti Environmental Monitoring Program. Data at each rain gauge were averaged annually, but only those years with data from each of the 12 calendar months were included in the calculations. The values for mean annual rainfall at each rain gauge were then interpolated using inverse-distance weighting to create a geographic information system (GIS) layer of mean annual precipitation across SNP. The UTM coordinates of each site were then used to extract mean annual precipitation at each of the sites using ArcMap (ESRI; <ref type="url" target="http://www.esri.com">http://www.esri.com</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection at Each Site</head><p>Each site consisted of a 1,000-m 2 ( m) plot in 50 # 20 which plant species composition, standing plant biomass, and soil and leaf-tissue nutrient concentrations were collected within five nested 1-m 2 subplots. Plant species abundance was measured by visually estimating percent cover of each species within subplots (app. A). Standing plant biomass was collected by clipping all aboveground vegetation from a 0.5-m 2 area within each subplot and weigh- ing the samples after they were oven-dried. Subsequent to weighing, all plant biomass samples were ground and analyzed for N, P, and Na using standard methods (app. A). In order to understand how leaf nutrient concentrations of dominant species influenced the community sample, five replicate individuals of the grass Themeda triandra were randomly collected in each plot and measured for N, P, and Na using the same methods. Themeda triandra is among the most commonly occurring herbaceous species in the Serengeti and often the most locally abundant <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson et al. 2006</ref>). Soil samples were collected within each subplot and analyzed for 21 soil elements and soil organic matter with standard methods (app. A). Soil organic matter was highly correlated with the abundance of soil elements and is therefore used as a surrogate measure of soil fertility for the remainder of this article (app. A). Site averages, calculated from replicate soil, leaf tissue, and standing crop biomass within plots, were used in all subsequent analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specific Hypotheses, Statistical Analyses, and Structural Equation Modeling</head><p>Statistical modeling was guided by the creation of an a priori conceptual model, also known as a construct model <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Grace 2006)</ref>. In this model, we hypothesized that fire frequency and history of herbivory are associated with forage nutrient availability through changes in the plant community or through associations that do not depend on changes in the plant community. The construct model provided a framework for the specific analyses of data using structural equation modeling and the evaluation of four a priori hypotheses (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>; table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), which were tested against the observed data. The four specific hypotheses follow logically from what is known of the effects of fire and herbivory in savanna ecosystems. The first (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>) is that fire and herbivory have mutual benefits for plant nutritional quality: fire by reducing plant biomass (i.e., van de Vijver et al. 1999) and herbivory by enhancing nutrient cycling (i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">McNaughton et al. 1997</ref>). The second (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>) is that both factors act as mutual detriments for plant nutritional quality by selecting for nutrient-poor unpalatable and/or fire-resistant species (i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Ritchie et al. 1998)</ref>. Third (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>) is that fire and herbivory may have balancing effects on leaf nutritional quality because their relative effects oppose and offset one another. Our hypothetical diagram shows the negative effects of fire on plant community composition being offset by the stimulatory effects of herbivory, although several other bal- Note: The numbers in the column labeled "Path" match the numbers associated with the arrows in figure 1. In the conceptual schematic, the effects of herbivory and fire can influence leaf nutrients in ways that do not depend on changes in plant community properties (direct) or in ways that depend on changes in properties of the plant community (indirect). ancing effects are possible (i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sirotnak and Huntly 2000)</ref>. Finally, variation in plant nutritional quality may be largely controlled by environmental and edaphic effects (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>). In this scenario, environmental factors, such as rainfall, and edaphic factors, such as soil fertility, impose a strong bottom-up effect on plant nutritional quality that is independent of the effects of fire and herbivory.</p><p>In developing the structural equation (SE) model, the general concept of plant abundance (i.e., quantity) in the construct model was represented in our data with estimates of standing plant biomass. Two types of specific data were used to represent plant species composition (i.e., quality). First was an ordination on the relative abundances of plant species (percent cover) using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) in PC-ORD version 4 (McCune and Medford 1999). Species' abundances in the five subplots were summed within each whole plot before calculating species relative abundance. The first ordination axis of the NMDS was used as an index of plant community composition across sites. Because individual plant species in SNP can vary drastically in the average Na concentration of leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hamilton et al. 2001</ref>), a single species can exert a disproportionately large influence on Na availability to herbivores. Thus, the second measure of community composition used was the abundance of those species in SNP known to have a high leaf-tissue Na concentration (app. A; table <ref type="table">B2</ref>). Finally, the general concept of history of herbivory was represented specifically in our data by density estimates of the four resident herbivore species, as described above. Estimates of resident herbivore densities do not capture the effects imposed by herds of migratory ungulates that graze in the western regions of SNP as they move toward dry season foraging grounds in Kenya. However, because the effects of migrants are ephemeral and more spatially uniform compared with long-term effects of resident herbivores, we argue that resident densities Forage Nutritive Quality 349 provide an appropriate measure of herbivore effects. Finally, to account for some of the other major systemwide influences on plant nutritive quality (i.e., the "environmental and edaphic effects" hypothesis), average annual rainfall (as a measure of climate effects) and soil organic matter (as a measure of soil fertility) were controlled for as background variables in the SEM.</p><p>The estimation of the SE model was based on maximum likelihood solution procedures using version 4 of the software package Mplus (Muthe ´n and Muthe ´n 1998). Robust estimation techniques were used, including bootstrapping of the model parameter estimates. Model fit was assessed using the x 2 statistic and its associated P value. The significance of individual path coefficients was evaluated using z-tests (standardized equivalent of t-tests) and by observing the effect on model fit when individual paths were omitted from the model. Model fit was judged adequate when the expected and observed covariances did not differ based on a critical P value of . In the case where a 1 0.05 nonlinear paths existed between variables that could not be made linear through transformations (app. A), nonlinear modeling methods involving the construction of composite variables were used <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Grace and Bollen 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Univariate statistics were conducted to evaluate net effects. Mean differences between the paired study sites inside and outside the national park boundary were compared with nonparametric Wilcoxon matched pairs test statistics when discrete count data were analyzed (i.e., fire frequency); otherwise, paired t-tests were preformed. Bivariate regressions were conducted to analyze the linear relationships between variables. Data were transformed when frequency distributions were significantly nonnormal. A multiple regression with rainfall, soil organic matter, herbivore density, and fire frequency as predictors was used to identify associations between these factors and T. triandra abundance. All statistics outside of the SEM analysis were performed in SAS version 8 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p></div>

Note that the large P value associated with the P p .73 x 2 value in this instance indicates that the covariance structure of the data did not differ significantly from that expected, based on the model. The amount of variance in leaf nutrient concentrations explained by the final SEM was relatively high, ranging from 44% in leaf N to 78% for leaf Na (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Statistically significant correlations existed between several of the explanatory variables, such as between precipitation and soil organic matter and between fire frequency and soil organic matter (table <ref type="table">B3</ref>).</p><p>Within the context of the SEM results, larger resident herbivore densities had negative paths to standing plant biomass and plant community ordination scores, both of which had negative paths to leaf tissue N and leaf P. Direct paths from herbivore density to leaf nutrients were not detectable, and there was no evidence that herbivore density was associated with leaf Na through any indirect path. The total effect of herbivore density on both leaf N and P was 0.30. Herbivore density was the single variable explaining variation in plant biomass, and much of the observed variation in biomass remained unexplained (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p><p>In contrast to herbivore density, the relationship of fire frequency to other variables in the final SE model was relatively complex, including associations with all three leaf tissue nutrients through either direct or indirect paths. With respect to leaf N, fire frequency had a net negative association mediated through changes in plant community composition and a total effect of Ϫ0.19. In contrast, fire frequency had both direct and indirect paths to leaf P and Na. Like leaf N, a negative association between fire frequency and leaf P was mediated through changes in plant community composition. However, the model also revealed a large nonlinear, unimodal path between fire frequency and leaf P (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>); as indicated by the bivariate relationship (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">B1</ref>), leaf P increases with fire frequency up to approximately 3 years, after which it declines with greater fire frequency. The total effect of fire frequency on leaf P was 0.30; however, because of the nonlinear direct path, only the magnitude of the total effect (not its sign) is relevant, which in this case is similar to that of herbivore density on leaf N and P. With respect to leaf Na, the results revealed a modest, positive, direct path from fire frequency to leaf Na and an indirect path mediated through changes in the abundance of Na-rich grasses. The negative association of the indirect path offset the direct path such that the total effect of fire frequency on leaf Na was Ϫ0.20.</p><p>The SEM results showed strong direct paths between environmental variables and plant community composition. Specifically, there was a strong positive path from precipitation to the plant community ordination score and a strong negative path from soil organic matter to the abundance of Na-rich grasses. Within the model, precipitation had an indirect association with leaf N and P, in which the total effects were Ϫ0.24 and Ϫ0.28, respectively. Similarly, the negative path from soil organic matter to abundance of Na-rich grasses led to an indirect negative association with leaf Na with a total effect of Ϫ0.51. None of the direct paths from environmental variables to leaf nutrients were retained in the final SEM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessing the Specific Hypotheses</head><p>The results of the SEM analysis demonstrated that fire frequency and herbivory commonly have offsetting effects on leaf nutrient concentrations, which occur via changes in plant community composition and abundance. Although this result is conceptually similar to the hypothesis of "balancing effects," the effects of fire and herbivory were not equally offsetting for any of the three nutrients (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). For leaf N (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>), the positive effects of herbivore density (0.30) mediated through changes in plant biomass and community composition outweighed the negative effects of fire (Ϫ0.19) that occurred because of changes in the plant community. Similarly, for leaf P (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>), the indirect positive effects of higher herbivore density (0.30) outweighed the negative effects of fire (Ϫ0.21). However, as already discussed, this interpretation is complicated somewhat by the fact that there exists a direct nonlinear effect of fire on leaf P. For Na (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>), an offsetting pattern was observed within the effects of fire frequency itself, although the indirect negative effects (Ϫ0.51) that occurred via changes in the abundance of Na-rich grasses strongly outweighed the direct positive effects (0.24).</p></div>

Composite environmental factors, such as her-bivory, fire, soils, and rainfall, were defined as the broad conceptual features of a system whose effects are actually composed of constellations of weak forces that are probabilistic, intermittent, and contingent on other properties of the system. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr">McNaughton (1983)</ref> suggested that "attempting an empirical evaluation of the importance of each of the many factors that ultimately affect community composition is presently technically impossible." Now, more than 20 years later, with recent advances in structural equation modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Shipley 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kline 2005</ref>; Forage Nutritive Quality 353 Grace 2006), analytical tools are available that allow researchers to characterize some of the inherent complexities in natural systems, such as those described by <ref type="bibr">McNaughton (1983)</ref> for the Serengeti. These methodological advances extend SEM beyond the traditional methods of path analysis and include advanced model solution procedures, hypothesis testing, and nonlinear modeling procedures involving composite variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Grace 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Grace and Bollen 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Analysis of our data by standard univariate statistical methods revealed consistent differences in herbivore densities, rainfall, standing plant biomass, and plant community composition between SNP and adjacent wildlife management areas. Differences in the plant community and exogenous factors were paralleled by differences in plant tissue N and P between paired sites inside and outside SNP. Moreover, bivariate scatter plots highlighted some important linear and unimodal relationships between variables, especially between fire frequency and leaf P (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">B1</ref>) and between leaf nutrients and plant community properties (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">B2</ref>). Based on the univariate results and knowledge of savanna-grassland plant communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Sarmiento 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Tothill and Mott 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Walker 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Sinclair and Arcese 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Solbrig et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">du Toit et al. 2003)</ref>, the most plausible conclusion is that greater plant N and P inside SNP is linked to higher resident herbivore densities, lower average rainfall and plant biomass, and shifts in community composition toward species with leaves of higher nutritive quality. While these conclusions are consistent with those of the SEM analyses, failure to explore the data past the univariate results leads to oversimplifying the relationships between variables, missing interesting results regarding Na, and neglecting important contingencies that characterize the Serengeti <ref type="bibr">(McNaughton 1983)</ref>.</p><p>For example, returning to the questions posed in the introduction, the analytical approach using SEM revealed that fire frequency and resident herbivore densities have opposing relationships with plant community composition and that this contributes to opposite associations with leaf N and P. In addition, the relationships between fire frequency and nutritive quality and between herbivore density and nutritive quality manifest themselves differently. Resident herbivore density was related to leaf N and P only indirectly, whereas fire frequency had direct effects on leaf P and Na in addition to indirect influences on leaf N, P, and Na. Whether offsetting effects of fire and herbivory on forage nutrient availability are a common property of savanna ecosystems is not known. Fire and bison grazing have contrasting effects on root production and root C : N ratios in temperate tallgrass prairies in Kansas (United States), thus creating offsetting effects on N cycling <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Johnson and Matchett 2001)</ref>. Either way, the answer should be one of considerable interest for the future conservation of endangered grazing ecosystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Frank et al. 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Additional insight was gained through the SEM analysis because the standardized path coefficients allow a comparison of the relative strengths of associations between fire frequency and leaf nutrient concentrations and between herbivore density and leaf nutrient concentrations. Within the context of the SEM results, the sum of the total effects of fire (0.68) was slightly greater than that of herbivore density (0.61), whereas the total effects of precipitation (0.52) and soil organic matter (0.51) were similar. In terms of individual path strengths, environmental variables had comparatively large effects; the strongest individual paths were from rainfall to plant community composition and from soil organic matter to Na-rich grass abundance. The negative indirect path from soil organic matter to Na-rich grass abundance implies that fertile soils (i.e., high soil organic matter) have lower available forage Na because they contain a lower abundance of species with Na-rich leaves.</p><p>Perhaps the most intriguing results from the SEM analysis were the direct paths from fire frequency to leaf Na and P. Such results may arise from increased green : dead leaf ratios, greater leaf : stem ratios, and equivalent total nutrient allocation distributed in proportionally less aboveground biomass <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hobbs et al. 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">van de Vijver et al. 1999)</ref>. Although the effects of a single fire on plant nutrients can last up to 1 year <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Jensen et al. 2001)</ref>, often the effects are short-lived, lasting just a few months <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hobbs et al. 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">van de Vijver et al. 1999)</ref>. Of the 14 sites in our study that were burned in the fire season just before sampling, eight burned in June, four in July, one in August, and one in September. Therefore, it is unlikely our results are linked to the initial nutrient-rich flush of regrowth that follows fire. Instead, it is more likely that these direct paths result from longer-lasting mechanisms, such as fire effects on green : dead leaf ratio, litter inputs, soil nutrient pools, microbial dynamics, or alteration of the plant microclimatic environment <ref type="bibr">(Singh et al. 1991a</ref><ref type="bibr">(Singh et al. , 1991b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bond and van Wilgen 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">DeBano et al. 1998)</ref>.</p><p>For leaf Na, the strongest path from fire frequency was via a negative relationship with Na-rich grasses, but after controlling for this relationship, there remained a direct positive path to leaf Na. Along with other heavy elements, Na is not volatilized during fire, and it may become concentrated in ash deposits <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kellman et al. 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">DeBano et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mills and Fey 2004)</ref>. Evidence exists for slight but significant increases in plant Na absorption following fire <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kellman 2002)</ref>, which may occur passively through increased uptake rates in plants that have no metabolic demand for Na or actively for C 4 or halophytic species <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brownell 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Marschner 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">McNaughton et al. 1997)</ref>. Similarly, increased inorganic P availability in ash deposits, coupled with the replacement of older leaf tissues, likely explains increased leaf P with fire frequency in our study <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Jensen et al. 2001)</ref>. However, the unimodal response of leaf P to fire frequency suggests that an additional mechanism must account for the decreased leaf P with higher fire frequency. Recent experiments on plant-mycorrhizae associations from South African savannas may provide an answer. Experiments demonstrated a strong negative relationship between fire frequency and the colonization of perennial grass roots by mycorrhizae <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hartnett et al. 2004</ref>). The authors suggested that the effects of increased fire frequency, such as intensified soil crusting, greater water runoff, and decreased soil moisture <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Mills and Fey 2004)</ref>, may have limited the colonization of roots by mycorrhizae <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hartnett et al. 2004</ref>). Alternatively, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hartnett et al. (2004)</ref> suggested that fire may have indirectly decreased mycorrhizae colonization rates by increasing soil-available P; with increased soil P, plants rely less on mycorrhizal associations and may reduce their investment in the mutualism. Our unimodal response of leaf P to fire frequency suggests that both may be occurring: fire may have increased plant-available P up to a point after which increased fire frequency damages associations between roots and mycorrhizae, thus reducing plant access to soil P. Root-fungal associations in SNP are an important component of nutrient-poor soils <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(McNaughton and Oesterheld 1990)</ref>, although the importance of these associations for nutrient uptake is yet to be fully explored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Placing the SEM Findings in a Broader Context</head><p>Conspicuously absent from our final SEM results were direct paths from herbivore density to leaf N and Na. Experiments in SNP, in which ungulate herbivores were uncoupled from grassland forages through fencing, suggest that herbivores have direct effects on the biogeochemical cycling, mineralization, and soil availability of <ref type="bibr">N and Na (McNaughton et al. 1997</ref>). There may be several reasons why such direct paths did not emerge in the results of this study. First, the aforementioned studies compared hotspots, areas of high resident herbivore densities, with adjacent areas of low herbivore use <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(McNaughton et al. 1997)</ref>. In our selection of study sites, no hotspots were sampled. Although hotspots play an important ecological role in SNP, the high herbivore densities and heavily utilized grasslands swards are not representative of our study sites. Second, our results indicate, at least for the western margins of the SNP ecosystem, that the compositional changes induced by long-term, pervasive herbivory may preclude direct effects that have been observed elsewhere under experimental conditions. Also conspicuously absent from our SEM results was a significant relationship between rainfall and plant biomass (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). A likely explanation is the relatively narrow range of rainfall captured by our study sites (700-969 mm year Ϫ1 ; table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">B1</ref>). Rainfall varies from !400 to 11,100 mm year Ϫ1 across the ecosystem, a gradient that has important implications for herbivore effects on plant communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson et al. 2007</ref>). However, despite the relatively narrow breadth of precipitation across sites, rainfall still had significant influence on forage nutritive quality. We can only speculate that such effects would increase across the larger SNP rainfall gradient.</p><p>Although not shown in our conceptual model, there are several different feedback pathways by which plant communities and forage nutrient availability can modify grazer preference and herbivore density. In addition to affecting nutrient distribution in forage, herbivores also respond to forage nutritive quality across a range of spatial scales, from the landscape to the individual plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Senft et al. 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Huntly 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Skarpe 1992)</ref>. Additionally, herbivory and fire frequency often interact in savannas; herbivores can modify fire frequency by removing aboveground biomass, while fire modifies herbivore density by altering plant chemistry in a way that attracts herbivores <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Coppock and Detling 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Wilsey 1996)</ref> and by removing biomass that could otherwise be consumed by herbivores <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Archibald et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bond and Keeley 2005)</ref>. Although our study was not designed to address these issues, they are clearly important mechanisms in SNP. For example, hotspots in SNP rarely, if ever, burn because they cannot sustain fire (S. J. McNaughton, personal observation), and recently burned swards are more heavily utilized by smallbodied ungulates than by larger-bodied ungulates <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Wilsey 1996)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response of the Dominant Grass: Themeda triandra</head><p>An important distinction between fire and herbivory in terms of plant community associations was the way in which the factors correlated with the abundance of the dominant grass Themeda triandra. High rainfall and infrequent grazing are known to promote T. triandra, while frequent or severe defoliation decreases the abundance of T. triandra <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Coughenour et al. 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Edroma 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hodgkinson et al. 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">O'Connor 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Fynn and O'Connor 2000)</ref>. This is in part because T. triandra is not able to efficiently utilize reserved carbon stores under repeated defoliation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Danckwerts 1993)</ref>. In contrast, T. triandra is particularly tolerant of fire, and continuous burning regimes maintain T. triandra grasslands throughout much of South Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Tainton and Mentis 1984)</ref>. In turn, T. triandra promotes the spread of fire because its canopy is highly flammable. Despite this, the specific effects of fire on T. triandra abundance in SNP have been somewhat inconsistent <ref type="bibr">(e.g., McNaughton 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Belsky 1992)</ref>. Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between fire frequency and T. triandra abundance across sites in SNP. This is consistent with previous studies of the effects of defoliation by fire and herbivory on T. triandra: few grasslands in SNP burn more than once a year, while heavily grazed areas are often subjected to repeated, if not persistent, defoliation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Sinclair and Arcese 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Calculations by <ref type="bibr">Murray (1995)</ref> suggest that animals, especially residents, may have trouble meeting dietary requirements in the grasslands of the western corridor. This is especially true for T. triandra-dominated stands, as average leaf P and Na do not meet the dietary requirements of lactating female wildebeests, and leaf P does not meet requirements for pregnant female wildebeests (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). Resident animals have adapted to forage of poor nutritive quality by migrating along catena gradients throughout the year, selecting dry hilltops during the wet season and wetter bottom hillslopes during the dry season <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bell 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Seagle and McNaughton 1992)</ref>.

The results of our SEM analysis suggest that frequent fire may contribute to the loss of key elements, such as Na and P, from these important transitional zones and may promote low-nutritive-quality forage in the form of T. triandra dominated savannas.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Conceptual diagram demonstrating some of the multivariate effects by which herbivory and fire frequency may influence the availability of nutrients in forage.

Fire can reduce leaf nutrient content through negative impacts on the microbial community, nutrient volatilization, destruction of soil organic matter, creation of soil crusts, or reductions in soil moisture. 7 Effects of plant abundance on leaf nutrient concentrations Plant abundance influences leaf nutrients because plant size is related negatively to nutrient-use efficiency and positively to respiration rate. Thus, leaf nutrients are diluted relative to carbon in aboveground components as plants become larger. 8 Effects of plant composition on leaf nutrient concentrations Compositional changes influence forage nutrient quality because species have different life-history strategies, nutrient-uptake capabilities, nutrient-use efficiencies, and carbon-allocation strategies that translate into different average leaf nutrient contents.</p></note></figure>
