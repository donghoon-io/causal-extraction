<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The main purpose of technology business incubation is supporting innovation through joint cooperation between competences and resources. As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Yee (2009)</ref>, "The technology incubator is an entity where knowledge is transformed into innovative products and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Yee 2009)</ref>." The combination of knowledge-sharing and incubator management helps these incubators to produce successful projects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cheng and Schaeffer (2011)</ref> found that business incubator functions had a positive impact on the economy in the 1980s. However, some issues were identified with the standard accepted for this examination. A review of the literature shows the impact of business incubators was examined for different categories: job creation <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Udell 1990)</ref>, incubatee development <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Smilor 1987</ref>) and incubatee graduation percentages <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Peters et al. 2004</ref>). The incubators reviewed were of diverse types, including as university-linked incubators, non-profit incubators and for-profit incubators <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Peters et al. 2004)</ref>. A company's knowledge base is the essential factor of the growth of the company and its competition with other companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gupta and Govindarajan 2000)</ref>. One of the principal challenges in is creating projects using what incubators produce or incorporating incubators in new projects. To ensure the success of new projects, many sources are required <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Brush and Greene 1996)</ref>. Good performance, the sustainability of the projects and acquaintance are critical factors. Because of the growth of a knowledge-based economy, technology and innovation are considered as important components of performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Rooney et al. 2012)</ref>. The business economy that can be enhanced by business organizations relies on their ability to innovate. Therefore, a lack of ability to do this blocks them of completion and limits their business development and ability to improve their profits <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Taylor et al. 1993)</ref>. Innovation can contribute to rises in productivity, a high level of competition and wealth generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Carlson and Wilmot 2006)</ref>.</p><p>There are two areas in the literature on business incubation: industry based and academic based.</p><p>Incubation is treated as an agency emphasizing on the relation between knowledge and innovation.</p><p>Many technology incubators are linked with study organizations such as universities, tech-parks or corporate/industries with research and development (R&amp;D) resources in public and private sectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ascigil and Magner 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hughes et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Tötterman and Sten 2005)</ref>. As a result, technology incubators are contributing to supporting entrepreneurs, tech-based organizations and other affiliates of universities and big organizations by providing appropriate materials for survival, wealthgeneration and job foundation.</p><p>In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, incubators are considered an essential part of the technological development of the country by encouraging business innovation. The main goal of Saudi incubators is to help Saudi society become more knowledge based, leading to the development of a knowledgebased economy through designed programs providing good opportunities to help in such situation. A review of related studies shows that technology incubation in KSA is in its progress levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Khorsheed et al. 2012</ref>). In the cities of Riyadh and Jeddah, there are two private-sector firms that operate as technology incubators by providing fee-based services to aspiring entrepreneurs. Saudi technology incubators are not autonomous institutions because they work under universities. Therefore the funding and services provided in these incubators are limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Salem 2014)</ref>. Saudi Arabia has also moved in with the rest of the world to develop technology incubators, although they are at the preliminary stages of introducing technology and science parks mostly. It has been noted in research that in the developing countries, including the Saudi Arabia, technology incubators have not been able to come up to their expectations. They have not been contributing to the development of local economy, the transfer of technology, creation of new enterprises, and increase of job creation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Al-Mubaraki et al., 2010)</ref>. Most of the Arab world faces deficiencies in their infrastructure as also in their products and services like goods, labor and their financial markets and slow pace of innovations and technological up-gradation; this is brought out in the 2010-2011 World Economics Forum's Global Competitiveness report <ref type="bibr">(Schwab and Sala-i-Martin, 2010)</ref>. Better resources and services enable entrepreneurs and startups to achieve higher growth and development facilitated by business incubation. There is no sound foundation theoretically to the available knowledge of the process of business incubation <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Tamasy, 2007)</ref>. Therefore, the inferences concerning business incubations and the effect they have on startups are not consolidated or clear <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chan and Lau, 2005)</ref>. The aim of business is to support successful startups. That knowledge is the vital determining factor for developing successful startups is a widely acknowledged fact. A new venture's performance is dependent on the knowledge that it is able to acquire as per many academic scholars <ref type="bibr">(Studdard 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">, Wiklund and Shepherd 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">, West and Noel 2009)</ref>.</p><p>There is a lack of existing knowledge about the process of business incubation <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Tamasy 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, the effect of business incubation and the influence incubators have on startups are not confirmed or clear <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chan and Lau 2005)</ref>. The goal of business incubators is to help new companies become established and successful. It has been proven that knowledge plays a fundamental role in successful startups. The knowledge is significant for a new projects' performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(West and Noel 2009)</ref>. This research extends <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Binsawad et al. 2017)</ref>  The paper is organized as follows. The following section 2 presents theoretical development and research model, and then the hypotheses development. Section 3 discusses the methodology followed by data analysis in section 4. Section 5 discusses the implications and finally the study concludes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical Background and Research Model</head><p>This study attempts to identify the influence of knowledge sharing process, individual creativity and diffusion of innovation toward technology business incubators performance in Saudi Arabia. Hence, the theoretical foundations include existing models related to knowledge-sharing, diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory and individual creativity towards organization performance. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the research model and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents a description of each factor.</p><p>There are various types of incubators, such as business and technology. Business incubators are meant to develop and stimulate general businesses for specific economic objectives like industrial restructuring and the generation of revenue as well as the beneficial utilization of available resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bollingtoft and Ulhoi 2005)</ref>. Technology incubators aim to bolster the technology development stage of enterprises and new businesses being promoted by business incubators <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Smilor 1987)</ref>. The first technology incubator to be established in the Saudi Arabia was BADIR-ICT, which was launched in January 2008 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Al-Mubaraki et al. 2010)</ref>. As the first incubator to become operational within a short time, this incubator started to accept its initial projects while working as a part of the National Badir Technology Incubator Initiative of Saudi Arabia's national research institute at the King Abdul Aziz City for Science and Technology.</p><p>Knowledge donation and knowledge collection are the two knowledge-sharing processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lin 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Van Den Hooff and De Ridder 2004)</ref>.These terms illustrate the process where knowledge is exchanged, transmit and created between staff. The literature review shows the influences of knowledge-sharing are categorized into two groups: individual influences and organizational influences <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Connelly and Kevin Kelloway 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lee and Choi 2003)</ref>. In knowledge-sharing individual extent, the majority of related literature studied the individual influences of self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lin 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Wasko and Faraj 2005)</ref>, enjoyment in sharing knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lin 2007)</ref>, and interpersonal trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bijlsma and Koopman 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Davenport and Prusak 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Fukuyama 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ma et al. 2008)</ref>. Also, looking at organizational knowledge-sharing organizational, the majority of related literature discussed motivational influences that consist of management support <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Artail 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Riege 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Song 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Yew Wong 2005)</ref>, information technology infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(De Vries et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hsu 2008)</ref>, and inducements and rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bartol and Srivastava 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Davenport and Prusak 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Yew Wong 2005)</ref>.</p><p>To consider the impact of the individual (self-efficacy and enjoyment), organizational (top management support, organization rewards) and technology factors (the use of IT) on the knowledgesharing practices regarding am organization's innovation capability, as developed in Lin's a model <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lin 2007)</ref>. The results show that organizations can enhance their innovation performance through developing a knowledge-sharing culture. Choi and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lee (2003)</ref> developed a model to examine the relationship between knowledge practices and enablers (such as organizational content and technological content) on organizational creativity and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Lee and Choi 2003)</ref>. Moreover, the relation between knowledge-sharing, innovation, and organizational performance was investigated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Wang and Wang 2012)</ref>. Their findings show that financial and operational performance is affected by innovation speed and knowledge-sharing.</p><p>Incubation has been recognized as a part of the creative process. For-example, incubation process results were highlighted in novel and useful ideas through unconscious recombination of thought elements that were stimulated through conscious work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amabile et al. 2005)</ref>. "Creativity is generally defined as the production of novel, useful ideas or problem solutions. It refers to both the process of idea generation or problem solving and the actual idea or solution." <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Amabile 1997)</ref>. Hence, creativity refers to the implementation of creative ideas in an incubator context. Creativity is both a desired outcome of an incubator, in the sense of creating more creative and innovative firms, and a part of the process because creativity is required to both develop the new ideas and determine how they are best applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Patton 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies highlight a range of conditions required for fostering individual creativity in general <ref type="bibr">(Woodman et al. 1993b)</ref>. Indeed, there is no current consensus on the most valid and reliable way of measuring individual creativity as of the time of this study, with most scholars choosing to take one of two positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Park et al. 2016)</ref>. However, at an individual level, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Amabile 1997)</ref> extensive body of research suggests three major factors for the individual creativity of employees within organizations: Such as, expertise, creative thinking skill, and intrinsic task motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Amabile 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amabile et al. 2005)</ref>. Thus, Amabile's individual creativity, comprised of the three factors of expertise, creative thinking skill, and intrinsic task motivation is adopted in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Amabile 1997)</ref>. Since one of the roles of technology business incubators is to prompt greater innovation in a new industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mian 1997)</ref>, individual creativity is a highly relevant factor in understanding how technology business incubators perform, and the theory of individual creativity underpins the study.</p><p>Innovation has been widely considered as a factor in a firm's business performance. Diffusion of innovation theory denotes various dimensions that can be used to analyses the characteristics of new phenomena in the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Rogers, 2003)</ref>. Diffusion of Innovation theory suggests five perceived innovation characteristics: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, observability, and trialability. In the context of this study, relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity are used because they are considered as the most significant constructs in relationship to incubator performance.</p><p>Regarding the technology business incubator performance, there is no defined and single explained standard to measure incubator performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Phan et al. 2005)</ref>. There are several studies that have discussed different indicators to determine incubator performance (M'Chirgui 2012). For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rothaermel and Thursby (2005)</ref> examined the university based incubators by the performance of tenant, revenues generated, total funds raised, venture capital funding obtained and whether the firm graduated, failed, or stayed in the incubator <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Rothaermel and Thursby 2005)</ref>. This approach focused on success as defined in terms of how well the resulting businesses performed, a valid approach but not necessarily the ideal one. In general, although incubated firms are significantly more likely to succeed than non-incubated firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Somsuk and Laosirihongthong 2014)</ref>, the likelihood of failure remains high .</p><p>Therefore, rather than taking a firm-based approach to assessing the performance of a technology business incubator, a notion more firmly grounded in the program itself would seem more appropriate.</p><p>In the vein of this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Mian (1997)</ref> defines four categories of performance outcomes for the university technology business incubator, which are (a) the program sustainability and growth, (b) tenant firm's survival and growth, and (c) contributions to the sponsoring university's mission, (d) community-related impacts. This approach is more holistic. Since the success or failure of incubated firms does somewhat reflect on the quality of the incubator <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Tang et al. 2013)</ref>, this factor is an appropriate part of defining performance. Success may be the overall goal of the incubated firms, but their success only partially reflects on the incubator program and is also only part of its own mission. However, the incubator is ultimately a part of the university running it <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Wonglimpiyarat 2016)</ref>. Therefore, it is appropriate that assessing its performance should consider a factor representing how the incubator program actually helps the host university. Additionally, since there is a strong emphasis on using local research innovations to develop local businesses in an incubation program <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mian 1997)</ref>, it is also appropriate that a holistic measure of incubator performance should include a factor assessing how the program affects the community at large. If the incubator program failed to provide a positive impact on the local community, or created businesses with a detrimental effect on that community, this should be reflected in evaluating its performance. Finally, since establishing the incubator represents an investment on the part of the university, and requires that the program is maintained and expanded as needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Patton 2014)</ref>, the sustainability and growth factor is also an important part of understanding success. No matter how successful the incubated firms may be, it would be hard to consider an unsustainable incubation program a success.</p><p>Thus, giving due consideration to the literature supporting all of these factors, the researcher decided that a holistic approach to assessing incubator performance was the most appropriate for the study.</p><p>Accordingly, in the context of the current study, the researcher used Mian's assessments of incubators performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Mian 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Mian 1997)</ref>.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Approach</head><p>The data collection method of this research is survey instrument. The Survey instrument provides a numeric or quantitative trends description of population's opinions and attitudes based on studying a sample of this population <ref type="bibr">(Creswell, 2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Babbie (2013)</ref> states "surveys are particularly useful in descripting the characteristics of a large population because they make large samples feasible" (2012,p.7). The survey was provided in English and Arabic in this study. The survey questions applied closed-ended questions technique. In this technique, a small set of participants produces accurate answers. The participants are asked to select or rank answers instead of to responding to the questions or providing their expressing their opinions. In order to get a high response rate for the survey, there are some techniques were applied. First, designing the survey considered that 14 minutes as a maximum time to complete it. Second, using the procedures proposed by <ref type="bibr">Sekaran (2003)</ref>, such as, making the survey brief as much as possible and introducing the participants to the research objectives and the significance of the survey to the study by providing a cover sheet including this information.</p><p>Therefore, in this study applied the survey method to collect numerical data from participants in The research model is tested using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) statistical technique <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al. 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hair et al. 2011b)</ref>, which is considered to be suitable for this study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Henseler et al. (2014)</ref> provided a detailed analysis of PLS-SEM over CB-SEM. PLS-SEM is now a well-recognized analysis method in business information systems research because it does not require a large sample size, does not require normality and subsequently works without distributional assumptions and with nominal, ordinal and interval-scaled variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hair et al. 2014)</ref>. PLS-SEM allows the researchers to concurrently evaluate structural path coefficients and measurement model parameters. In this research model, all constructs were modeled as reflective indicators because they are viewed as effects of latent variables.</p><p>The survey was sent to 170 participants, and 150 participated in the survey. After removing incomplete responses, a total of 140 responses have been used for data analysis. Data collection lasted from November 2016 to January 2017. The descriptive analysis shows that 70% of the participants were male and 30% were female. 65% were in the age of 26-35 years, 25% participants are 36-45 years, and 10% are above 45 years. 65% of the respondents hold master's degree; followed by 25% bachelor's degree and 10% hold a doctoral degree. 55% of participants have more than 5 years of work experience, followed by 30% between 3-5 years. 25% of the participants have work experience of 1-3 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data Analysis</head><p>We apply partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to estimate our research model using SmartPLS version 3.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Ringle et al. 2015)</ref>. PLS-SEM is particularly suitable when the model has a large number of latent variables because it does not lead to estimation problems or improper results <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Henseler et al. 2009)</ref>. Also, PLS path modeling results include latent variable scores which are required for providing diagnostic information about technology incubators performance and our attempt to execute an importance performance analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Measurement Model Analysis</head><p>Previously validated survey instruments were used in order to ensure the measures are adequate and representative. The loadings of all items on their factors are significant (p &lt; .01) and greater than 0.7, which ensures indicator reliability. The Cronbach's alphas of the model factors range from 0.71 to 0.87. The PLS model estimation reveals that all model constructs exhibit satisfactory internal consistency. Composite reliability values range from 0.79 to 0.88 and average variance extracted (AVE) estimates range from 56% to 79%. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows constructs reliability and validity. In addition, we test the discriminant validity of the latent variables in the PLS model using the criterion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fornell and Larcker 1981)</ref>. The AVE of each latent variable should be greater than the latent variable's highest squared correlation with any other latent variable. As we show in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, each of the latent variables meets these requirements, in support of discriminant validity.</p><p>PLS method requires practically no bias when estimating data from a composite model population, regardless of whether the measurement model is reflective or formative <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Sarstedt et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Concerning Goodness-of-fit (GoF) indices for partial least squares path modelling, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Henseler and Sarstedt (2013)</ref> show that goodness-of-fit index is not appropriate for model validation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Structural Model Testing</head><p>In order to test the proposed hypotheses, the structural model was tested by analyzing the significance of the paths between factors using t-test calculated with the bootstrapping technique at a 5 percent significance level. We apply a nonparametric bootstrapping procedure (5000 subsamples) to evaluate the significance of the path coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Henseler et al. 2009)</ref>; we provide the path estimates in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows the path co-efficient mean, standard deviation and t-statistics and p-value for each of the proposed hypotheses. The recommended t-values are t &gt;1.96 at p &lt; 0.05, t &gt; 2.576 at p &lt; 0.01, t &gt; 3.29 at p &lt; 0.001 for two-tailed tests. The coefficients of the causal relationships between factors are determined by the significance of the path coefficients and the (R²) variance of the dependent construct. The percentages of explained variance (R²) for the knowledge sharing donation, knowledge sharing collection, and the tech. incubator performance are 0.56, 0.63, and 0.76, respectively.</p><p>Therefore, the result of the R² shows a satisfactory level of explanation. In addition, in order to address the predictive relevance of the PLS model, we measured the Stone-Geisser criterion Q 2 using the blindfolding method to compute the construct cross-validated redundancy for assessing the predictive relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Henseler et al. 2009</ref>). In our analysis, Q 2 values range from the 'technology incubator performance' construct (i.e., 0.31) above the threshold value of zero, thus indicating a strong predictive relevance.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, the results confirm the relationship in not significant for hypotheses H1a, H3b, H4b, H9, H10, and H11. However, all other hypotheses are accepted at p &lt; 0.05. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows the path testing.  Importance-performance map analysis: We also measure the importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) for generating additional findings and conclusions for managerial actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Christian and Sarstedt 2016)</ref>. The IPMA is explained in detail by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Christian and Sarstedt 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hock et al. 2010)</ref>. Performing an IPMA requires determining a targeting construct, such as knowledge sharing collection, knowledge sharing donation, and technology incubator performance in our PLS path model. The performance of each construct measured on a scale from 0 to 100. The closer the value to 100 the higher the performance of the variable.</p><p>All total effects (importance) larger than 0.10 are significant at the p ≤0.10 level. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> -6 and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> to 5 shows the IPMA result of the three target constructs (knowledge sharing collection, knowledge sharing donation, and technology incubator performance). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> presents the IPMA results of the "knowledge sharing collection" and "knowledge sharing donation" target constructs, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> the highest importance towards "knowledge sharing collection" is "enjoyment in sharing" factor followed by "rewards." This means that the target construct "knowledge sharing collection" would increase by 0.31 total effects of enjoyment in sharing" and 0.27 total effects of "rewards." In a similar way, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> the most important factors for the "knowledge sharing donation" target construct are "self-efficacy" followed by "enjoyment in sharing."  Regarding the "technology incubator performance," as presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> the highest performance construct is "relative advantage" followed by "knowledge sharing collection." This means the increase in "relative advantage" performance would increase the performance of the target construct "technology incubator performance" by the size of the total effect. The shows the "technology incubator performance" would increase by a value of 0.28 of "relative advantage" and 0.23 value of "knowledge sharing collection." </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>According to the path testing as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, the order of effects among the knowledge sharing organizational factors that have a significant effect on "knowledge sharing donation" is "management support", and on "knowledge sharing collection" is "rewards". This indicates that giving incentives to employees helps to encourage knowledge-sharing processes. Previous studies resulted that rewards positively influence employees' willing for sharing knowledge <ref type="bibr">(Wang and</ref><ref type="bibr">Noe, 2010, Jolaee et al., 2014)</ref>. This could be attributed to the fact all the participants in the survey were Muslims. As per Islamic belief, rewards are encouraged by religion which is consistent with Prophet Mohammed's recommendation. Additionally, participants' knowledge-sharing information is influenced by the degree of top management and IT support. This is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Yew Wong 2005)</ref>. This is also align with the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gupta and</ref><ref type="bibr">Govindarajan 2000, Othman et al., 2014)</ref>, which underlines that senior management support is important in knowledge sharing and that employees are influenced by the degree of senior management support.</p><p>In addition to this, the order of significance among the knowledge sharing individual factors that have a significant effect on "knowledge sharing donation" is "enjoyment is sharing," on "knowledge sharing collection" are "interpersonal trust" and also "enjoyment is sharing." This shows that employees enjoy helping each and others and having a good level of faith in each other regarding their capabilities to organize and execute courses of action required to achieve specific levels of performance. Finally, knowledge-sharing processes (collection) would enhance technology incubator performance such as tenant firms' survival and growth, contributions to sponsoring universities' missions and community-related impacts (such as sales, revenues, taxes, experience and graduate employment). These findings are consistent with the literature carried on "enjoyment is sharing" <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lin 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">, McLure Wasko and Faraj 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">, Wasko and Faraj 2005)</ref> which shows that incubatees enjoy helping each other and that plays a significate role in knowledge sharing process in the incubators and "self-efficacy" <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gist and</ref><ref type="bibr">Mitchell 1992, Bandura 1997</ref>) which underlines that the individual sense of self-efficacy is affected by tendency of individuals to take actions such as level of problems, expressed interest, persistence and task effort. Moreover, the findings of "interpersonal trust" that shows that incubatees are having a good level of faith in each other regarding their sharing knowledge are compatible with the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bijlsma and Koopman 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">, Ma et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Davenport and Prusak 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Fukuyama 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Creativity and innovation are critical to the success of any organizations <ref type="bibr">(Michael et al. 2012)</ref>. The complexity of an innovation may have a strong influence on its likelihood of spreading because simple innovations are considerably easier to adopt, while more complex innovations may require external pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Zhu 2014)</ref>. Compatibility is also a natural determinant in that, even if a new approach is clearly better, it will be considerably harder to adopt if it is incompatible with existing approaches and therefore requires significant retooling to implement <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Sharp and Miller 2016)</ref>. Thus, firms will consider compatibility seriously in adopting innovations, especially considering that incompatibility has a significant cost in time and equipment, as well as potentially the related expertise. Finally, relative advantage represents how much of an actual benefit the innovation offers. Even if an innovation is simple and easily compatible, it may not spread easily if firms do not perceive a significant advantage inherent in its adoption compared to existing techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Arfken et al. 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The results show "intrinsic motivation" and "relative advantage" has the highest effect on "technology business incubator performance." These findings are consisted with the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Rogers 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, Autant-Bernard et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Arfken et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Creativity, along with knowledge and expertise, is one of the central human resources that can help to achieve the technological commercialization competence (Chen and Schaeffer 2009). As such, the recruitment of knowledgeable, skilled and creative personnel can be integral to the overall performance of incubators. Individual Expertise may contribute to creativity in unexpected ways; team members who exhibit considerable dissimilarity in expertise to other members of their team demonstrate statistically significant increases in individual creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Huang et al. 2014)</ref>. The recruitment of young graduates who have creative and innovative ideas plays in the transfer of technology to industry <ref type="bibr">(Al-Mubaraki et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In conclusion, this study has fulfilled its main aim to examine technology business incubator performance by studying the incubation process, such as the knowledge-sharing process, which is important in the developmental process of new ventures. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows summaries the stakeholder's view in the study analysis. </p></div>

First, the number of samples is not large enough, and the data were collected in Saudi Arabia only. Therefore the generalizability of the findings may be limited. Second, the study did not consider all possible factors that could impact technology business incubator. This research model did not cover all aspects of knowledge sharing process.
