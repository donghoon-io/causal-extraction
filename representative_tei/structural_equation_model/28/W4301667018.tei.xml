<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Social isolation of the seafarers -which induces human factor in marine accidents -is an important problem driver in the ship environment. Emotional competencies and satisfaction with life are able to reduce effects of social isolation. Ordinary participation in leisure activities can enhance individual emotional intelligence, provide physical and mental health as well as an improved social interaction and produce life satisfaction. The aim of this study is to classify seafarers based on their leisure participation level, and to compare them each other in terms of leisure satisfaction, life satisfaction and emotional intelligence by structural equation modeling. Providing leisure facilities for seafarers and supporting them to join leisure activates as serious participants can eliminate negative effects of social isolation by enhancing the emotional intelligence and producing life satisfaction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In modern society, people separate varied behavioral roles, that are part of their daily lives such as family life, work, recreational activities, recuperation and they appoint particular spaces for these aspects to take place in. On the other hand, the ship is a total institute; both leisure activities and work take place within the same limited area. The ship is not only workplace for seafarers, but it is also their living place for an extended period of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Social isolation is a well-known fact that every seafarer is exposed to this situation while they are on-board. They are being away from land, their family life, and their friends for many months. Day by day, crew numbers have fallen, responsibilities and paperwork have increased. Besides, seafarers have few faces for companionship, and on the top of that they come from different cultures, rigidly hierarchical ranks and speak different languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The long and short of it is that seafarers are inherently isolated from social world while they are serving on-board.</p><p>The human element is considered as a main factor contributing to incidents at sea <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The reason of human factor causing marine incidents and marine retentions is mostly based on social isolation and its effects on seafarers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Emotions serve social and communicative functions which are coordinating social encounters by conveying information about people"s thoughts and intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. So, emotional abilities are considered to be important for social interaction. Therefore, it is required to handle emotional information and dynamics intelligently to maintain the social world <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In other words, emotional competencies are able to break social isolation which induces human factor in marine incidents. Besides, subjective well-being and life satisfaction have been found to be negatively related to social isolation and loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. There is correlation between life satisfaction and social life. It can be said that the happier life produces the livelier social life <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and also more intense social life boosts more life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Moreover, it is suggested by some researchers that ordinary participation in leisure activities and positive leisure satisfaction can enhance individual emotional intelligence by cutting back personal anxiety, depression, and anger <ref type="bibr">[10 and 11]</ref>. Also, leisure activities provide physical and mental health as well as an improved social interaction, psychological security, happiness and self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In this point of view, leisure activities can break social isolation by improving the emotional intelligence and producing life satisfaction as well as health and wellbeing.</p><p>Beside of those, there has been conducted various researches to identify types of leisure such as passive/active, consumptive/nonconsumptive, intellectual/physical, serious/casual or the like. One of them, serious leisure and casual leisure, has comprehensive and rich history of qualitative research that contributes to the leisure literature quantitative concept so as to validate and test existing knowledge, and is still capable of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In this context, the aim of this study is to classify participants into two groups as serious leisure or casual leisure, and to compare serious and casual leisure groups each other based on leisure satisfaction, satisfactions with life and emotional abilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE</head><p>In the literature, there is only one research on seafarer"s leisure participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and there are few research on social isolation of seafarers <ref type="bibr">[2, 15 and 16]</ref>. Those studies are not intent to solve seafarers" problems, but to reveal current situation of seafarers" on-board life. To fill in this gap in the literature and solve seafarer"s social isolation and leisure participation problems, this study aims to reveal benefits of leisure participation on overcoming social isolation by improving emotional intelligence and life satisfaction. With this point of view, this research is unique in the studied field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>In this section, in order to suggest relevant hypothesis, establish suitable conceptual framework and find appropriate measurements, it is conducted detailed literature review on leisure participation, leisure satisfaction, life satisfaction, emotional intelligence and their relationship between each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Serious and Casual Leisure Participation</head><p>The concept of the serious leisure has emerged through the extensive ethnographic studies of Stebbins <ref type="bibr">[17 and 19]</ref> and identified as "the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer core activity that is highly substantial, interesting, and fulfilling and where, in the typical case, participants find a career in acquiring and expressing a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. On the other hand, casual leisure is identified as "an immediately, intrinsically rewarding, relatively short-lived pleasurable activity requiring little or no special training to enjoy it" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. There are few international serious leisure measurement scales in the literature <ref type="bibr">[13 and 21]</ref>. Generally, most of researchers have been carried out studies to measure serious leisure participation and as stated by <ref type="bibr">Stebbins (20)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Leisure Satisfaction</head><p>Principal benefit of participation in leisure activities is satisfaction. According to Beard and Beard and Ragheb <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, leisure satisfaction is composed of "the positive perceptions or feelings which an individual form, elicits, or gains as a result of engaging in leisure activities and choices" (p:22). Satisfying individual needs provides participants to gain positive feelings. There are two approaches to measure leisure satisfaction; those are multiple dimensions" measurement and global measurement. Multiple dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> is to identify the source of satisfaction, global one <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is to measure the intensity level of satisfaction. Thus, purpose of study is decisive factor to choice leisure satisfaction measurement approach. In this study, it is aimed to evaluate level of participants" leisure satisfaction to find out correlations. Therefore, global approach is more suitable than multiple dimensions for this study. There is only one leisure satisfaction measurement based on global approach for Turkish culture which is leisure satisfaction scale (LSS) developed by Akyıldız Munusturlar (25).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Life Satisfaction</head><p>Pavot and Diener <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> emphasize that "life satisfaction is a conscious cognitive judgment of one"s life in which the criteria for judgment are up to the person" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. High score of life satisfaction provides meaningful life and sharing goals and values which are important for them. Diener, Emmons, Larsen, and Griffin <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> regard life satisfaction as a cognitive-judgmental process. They develop a multiitem scale called as "Satisfaction with Life Scale" (SWLS) to measure globally one"s own life satisfaction. The SWLS is a short instrument comprising 5-items and probably the most commonly used and cited measure for life satisfaction in scientific literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Durak, Senol-Durak, and Gencoz <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>, translate SWLS into Turkish Language and examine the psychometric properties of adapted version in different Turkish samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Emotional Intelligence</head><p>The emotional intelligence term is expressed by Salovey and Mayer <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> as "the subset of social intelligence that involves the ability to monitor one"s own and others" feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one"s thinking and actions" <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. After the publication of the book Emotional Intelligence by <ref type="bibr">Goleman (31)</ref> SEIS is unique in that it is one of the few emotional intelligence tests available for public use <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Also, this scale is relatively brief compared with other commercial trait EI measurements, such as the Bar-On EQ-I <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> which has 133 items. However, this scale has a lack of reverse-keyed items which could potentially lead to a deviation of SEIS score <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Thus, Austin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> design modified version of the SEIS comprising a higher proportion of reverse-keyed items. They add eight new items in order to increase reliability of factors. Final scale has 41-items with 20 forward-keyed and 21 reverse-keyed items. This scale is also adapted to Turkish by Tatar et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Relationship between Leisure Participation, Leisure</head><p>Satisfaction, Life Satisfaction, Emotional Intelligence In literature, it is found that different leisure activities have different leisure satisfaction levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and there is positive relationship between leisure participation level and leisure satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Participation in leisure activities is negatively correlated with depression, anxiety and loneliness and positively associated with high life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. In other words, leisure participation is predictive of better enhanced health and perceived greater life satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Also, there is correlation between leisure participation and emotional intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Ordinary participation in leisure activities and positive leisure satisfaction can enhance individual emotional development by cutting back personal anxiety, depression, and anger <ref type="bibr">[10 and 11]</ref>. Also, intense serious leisure participation can support social interactions owing to its unique characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. There are many researches on relationship between leisure satisfaction and life satisfaction and relationship between life satisfaction and emotional intelligence. Classifying leisure participants into two groups as serious and casual is the most popular way in leisure literature <ref type="bibr">[17 and 20]</ref>. Serious leisure participation supplies higher leisure satisfaction than casual leisure participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Heo, Stebbins, Kim, and Lee <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> conduct a research on relationships among serious leisure, life satisfaction, and health.</p><p>They separate leisure participation in three clusters as high/medium/low involvement groups.</p><p>Results reveal that there are significant differences among the clusters on life satisfaction. Stebbins <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> indicates that both the immediate leisure experiences (casual leisure) and the long-term serious pursuits (serious leisure) are influenced by emotions, whether positive or negative. In the light of those research, hypothesizes are proposed and conceptual model of research divided into two model is established to test those relationships among seafarers as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">The Instruments</head><p>Data has been collected by Likert type scales which are SCLM, LSS, SWLS and SEIS. Fitness of data set is analysed in order to identify psychometric qualities of scales for this research sample. In this context, missing values and outliers are defined and multicollinearity, singularity and normality tests are conducted. A visual inspection of histograms, normal q-q plots and box plots shows that all scales are approximately normally distributed and Shapiro-Wilk"s test p values are more than .05 as shown in the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>. In terms of reliability, all scales have adequate internal consistency coefficients (α&gt;.80). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Procedure</head><p>In order to test first model of conceptual framework, cluster analysis is conducted to classify seafarer leisure participants based on each factors of SCLM. After cluster analysis, discriminant analysis is applied to find out whether factors" discriminant powers are significant and valid or not <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Also it is to evaluate importance level of factors gathered from SCLM and to identify which factors make a better distinction between clusters. Difference between clusters is identified by crosstabs including leisure satisfaction, life satisfaction and emotional intelligence scores and chi-square analysis is utilized to recognize whether results are statistically significant. Structural Equation Model (SEM) with Maximum Likelihood (ML) method is used to test second model to break social isolation of seafarers via improving emotional intelligence and boosting life satisfaction by participation in leisure activities. It is aimed to examine regression and path coefficients between latent factors and observed variables in accordance with established conceptual model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS 5.1. Cluster Analysis</head><p>In this research it is decided to use the best cluster algorithm which is Fuzzy C-means method to determine clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Before applying Fuzzy C-means cluster analysis, number of clusters should be defined. For this purpose, "NbClust package" <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> is utilized in latest version of R Studio.</p><p>Euclidean distance measurement based on square distance is selected and Ward and K-means aggregation methods are employed and interpreted together. Output of NbClust is shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, Also, Hubert and D indexes which are graphical method of determining the number of clusters are presented in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. In the plot of those indexes, algorithm seeks a significant knee that corresponds to a significant increase of the value of the measure. According to those results, the best number of clusters is found as two.  <ref type="formula">50</ref>) is conducted by "cmeans" command in "e1071 package" <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> in R studio to situate participants into one of those two group. Eucliden distance measure based on the mean square error is employed. The results of clusters" sizes and centers are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. Membership values of data points are presented as 3d Plots by "scatterplot3d package" <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> in R studio shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.</p><p>One can easily infer that centers of cluster 1 are more than centers of cluster 2. It means that cluster 1 refers to "serious leisure participation" and cluster 2 refers to "casual leisure participation". There are 108 serious and 109 casual leisure participants according to results of FCM cluster analysis.  As a result of cluster analysis, the alternative hypothesis H1 which refers to significant difference between serious leisure and casual leisure groups is found to be acceptable at the level of .001. It means that seafarers can be classified into two group as "serious leisure participant" and "casual leisure participant" based on their levels of leisure participation defined by SCLM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Discriminant Analysis</head><p>Discriminant function analysis is practical for determining whether a group of variables is efficient in expecting category membership <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. 9 factors of SCLM are assigned as independent variables for this discriminant analysis. Independent variables are normal for each level of the grouping variable with acceptable level of skewness and kurtosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Homogeneity of covariance is tested with Box's M statistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. It is observed that results of Box-M statistic are not significant (p&gt;.05) and it means that covariance matrices are equal and there is homogeneity of covariance matrices. Besides, it is observed that inter correlations between all variables for each factor is less than .90 and accordingly, there is no any multicollinearity issue for all independent variables. After assumption of discriminant analysis are satisfied, linear discriminant analysis is utilized to predict a categorical dependent variable (clusters) by independent variables (factors of SCLM). Canonical correlation, eigenvalue, Wilk"s Lambda and Chi-square are evaluated to identify significance of linear discriminant function. Eigenvalue of this function (2.385) explains %100 of cumulative variance and provides good discrimination. Square of canonical correlation value (.84) shows that this model explains % 71 of variance of dependent variable and there is high relationship between discriminant function and grouping variable. Wilks"s Lambda value is found as .294 and accordingly Chi-square value is found as 256.66. Discriminant function is significant at the p level of .001 and comments and predictions on results can be made.</p><p>After determining validity of discriminant function, relationship between clusters (dependent variable) and factors (independent variables) are evaluated. Also, standardized canonical discriminant function coefficients and discriminant loadings of each factors in structure matrix are essential to assess importance of independent variables. As shown in Tables 4, "Sense of Competence" has the highest discriminant function coefficient and it is the most powerful variable that separates the two groups from one another. However, "Personality congruence" has the lowest discriminant function coefficient and it is the weakest variable that separates the two groups from one another. Discriminant loadings in structure matrix show relationship between each independent variables and discriminant function. It is considered that variables which have discriminant loadings above of .30 are valid, below of 0.30 are invalid. All this information shows that all factor loadings are above of .30 and discriminant power of all of them has significant and valid. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Crosstabs</head><p>Crosstabs are utilized to display comparison between casual and serious leisure participants depend on all variables' scores. Chi-square statistic is applied for each comparison to test significance of analysis. Findings are as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>.</p><p>It is found that clusters of leisure participants are significantly distinct from one another based on their level of leisure satisfaction, satisfaction with life and emotional intelligence (p&lt;.01). Therefore, H2, H3, H4 is found to be acceptable at the level of .001. First of all, for both SL and CL clusters, participants are mostly doing leisure activities several times a week (46.5%). When considering leisure satisfaction, emotional intelligence and life satisfaction, it is revealed that there is statically significant difference between clusters and those variables. While majority of SL participants has very high level leisure satisfaction (41.7%), very high level emotional intelligence (29.6%) and very high level life satisfaction (%30.6), majority of CL participants has low level leisure satisfaction (37.6%), very low level emotional intelligence (33.0%) and low level life satisfaction (28.4%). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Test of Conceptual Model by SEM</head><p>If the research"s data meet all the requirement of parametric assumptions, the finding will be meaningful by using the Covariance Based Structural Equation Modeling (CB-SEM) rather than Variance Based Structural Equation Modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. All parametric assumptions are satisfied for each variables of conceptual model. Therefore, CB-SEM is developed to test relationships between level of leisure participation, leisure satisfaction, emotional intelligence and life satisfaction. Proposed model is tested with Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation method.</p><p>In this established SEM, serious and casual leisure participation is assigned as latent exogenous variable; leisure satisfaction and life satisfaction are assigned as latent endogenous variable; emotional intelligence (sum of SEIS) is assigned as observed endogenous variable.</p><p>Residual error terms are included for each endogenous variable in order to treat disturbance of them as latent variables. Chi-square to df ratio (χ2/df), RMSEA, NFI, CFI, GFI, TLI model fit indices are used to evaluate model fit of established SEM. SCLM is called reflective construct since it predicts those observed variables namely "Leisure career", "Sense of competence", "Psycho-social benefits", "Therapeutic benefits", "Unique ethos", "Identity", "Personality congruence", "Perseverance" and "Personal effort".</p><p>This exogenous latent construct is a predictor of LSS, SWLS and SEIS.</p><p>LSS is second order latent construct since it is measured using five items. This endogenous latent variable predicted by SCLM is formative construct for SWLS and SEIS. On the other hand, SWLS is also second order construct since it is measured using five items. SWLS predicted by SCLM and LSS is assigned as formative construct of SEIS. Finally, SEIS is an observed variable called sometimes as a directly measured variable. This observed variable is formed (predicted) by SCLM and LSS and SWLS. Hypotheses proposed in second conceptual model are can be explained in SEM as follows: hypotheses H5, H6 and H7 are testing for casual effects and hypotheses H8 and H9 are intended to test the mediation effects, while another hypothesis namely H10 is testing the moderation effect in the model. Before testing of conceptual model, bivariate correlations with Pearson correlation coefficients between all variables are utilized. Results of correlation are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>. There are statistical significant correlations between all variables. All correlations are positive direction. There is a large correlation between seafarers' leisure satisfaction and seafarers" emotional intelligence (.55) and there is a medium correlation with seafarers' satisfaction with life (.40). Besides, there is also large correlation between seafarers' satisfaction with life and seafarers' emotional intelligence (.51). While leisure satisfaction has medium and large correlations with factors of SCLM, life satisfaction has small and medium correlations with them. Also, emotional intelligence has medium and large correlations with those factors. Those results provide support to established conceptual model of research. After correlation analysis, CB-SEM is conducted with ML estimation method. Path coefficients and regression loads related to tested conceptual model is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> and z values of variables are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>.  As a result of SEM analysis, relation between SCLM and SWLS and SEIS have no statistically significant critical ratio value (z value). Accordingly, paths which has insignificant z values should be excluded from SEM. Therefore paths between SCLMSWLS and SCLMSEIS are removed and SEM is re-established. Critical ratios for all other regression weights are acceptable at the 0.001 level <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Path coefficients and regression loads related to re-established conceptual model is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> and z values of variables are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">8</ref>.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">9</ref>. According to path coefficients and z values, H6 which is relationship between leisure participation and life satisfaction and H7 which is relationship between leisure participation and emotional intelligence are not acceptable (p&gt;.05). H5, H8, H9, H10 are found acceptable at the level of 0.001. All acceptable hypothesizes of whole conceptual model are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The results show that leisure participants can be divided into two groups as a serious and casual. Serious leisure participants have more leisure satisfaction, life satisfaction and emotional intelligence than causal ones. Besides, as a result of SEM, one can conclude that high level of leisure participation of seafarers is correlated with a positive attitude toward leisure satisfaction and it produces more satisfaction with life and more emotional intelligence. Also, there is directly positive relationship between life satisfaction and emotional intelligence. The greater life satisfaction is a sign of improved emotional intelligence. Furthermore, there has been conducted many studies that show positive relation between work performance and emotional intelligence <ref type="bibr">[60 and 62]</ref>. In addition, high level of satisfaction with life refers to meaningful life, well-being and brings out work performance <ref type="bibr">[27 and 63]</ref>. In this point of view, proper using of recreational facilities provided on-board boosts seafarers" leisure satisfaction, so it enhances emotional intelligence and boosts satisfaction with life, and accordingly promotes motivation and work performance as well as health and well-being. Besides, providing decent accommodation and suitable recreational facilities offers also lots of benefits from the perspective of the company <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. As Progoulaki and Roe has advised that "a competent, rested and well-motivated crew is an essential factor in reducing operational costs by increasing efficiency, safe operations and protecting the owner"s investment in expensive vessels and equipment" <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. By considering all steps, one can easily obtain that there is a lot of benefits of leisure time activities for both seafarers and maritime companies. As a result of all findings, providing leisure facilities both on-board and onshore for seafarers, and supporting and encouraging them to join leisure time activates as a serious participant can boosts the emotional intelligence and life satisfaction, breaks social isolation, promotes motivation and work performance as well as health and well-being, increases efficiency and operational safety and protects owner's investment by reducing operational costs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, the emotional intelligence become popular in field of academic psychology. According to Schutte et al. (32), the most cohesive and comprehensive modes of emotional intelligence are original model of Salovey and Mayer (30) and Mayer and Salovey (33) revised model. Although, revised model emphasizes emotional development phases through being excellent process-oriented model, the original model of Salovey and Mayer (30) is able to conceptualize the various dimensions of an individual"s emotional development state and comprise most dimensions of other models<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Thus, Schutte's Emotional Intelligence Scale (SEIS), which is self-report measure, is based on original model of EI of Salovey &amp; Mayer.</figDesc></figure>
