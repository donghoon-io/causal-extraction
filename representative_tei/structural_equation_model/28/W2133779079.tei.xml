<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The concept of e-Government was first developed and implemented in industrialised countries. Consequently, it should not be assumed that this concept is automatically appropriate for developing countries. This study aims to examine the roles of perceived support quality and support satisfaction in the context of government-to-citizen (G2C) transactions towards beh avioural intention and usage in developing countries. To test the proposed model, the official website of Kuwait Government Online Services (KGOS) was selected. A survey with a total of 628 responses was analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) t o investigate the goodness of fit of the model and the underlying indicators. The findings confirm the significance of support quality perceived by citizens and provide insights to explain citizens' intention to use e-Government systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Information communication technologies (ICTs) have transformed the way governments deliver services to its citizens <ref type="bibr">(Jacob et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Seo and Hasan, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rabaa'i, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">West, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">West, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">West, 2004)</ref>. Public sectors around the globe have invested increasingly in ICTs to improve productivity and to cut costs without sacrificing service quality. An expanding array of government services is now available online for their citizens.</p><p>e-Government projects can create numerous benefits and opportunities for both governments and citizens in the world: Governments have realised cost reductions and improved efficiency, while citizens access services faster and more conveniently. e-Government services have potential to reshape public sectors: the services revise relationships between citizens, businesses, and the government by enabling open communication, participation, transparency, and public dialogue in formulating national regulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bhattacharya, Gulla and Gupta, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">West, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">West, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>ICTs have dramatically revolutionised the processes, operations, and structure of public sectors, which are almost universally adopted or on the verge of being adopted by both developed and developing countries. However, the primary problem of technology-enabled modernisation is that decision makers often do not consider user expectations and preferences. Rather, to some extent, they only focus on cost efficiency and e-government systems design <ref type="bibr">(Rabaa'i, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Verdegem and Verleye, 2009)</ref>. Thus, a challenge facing e-Government services is not solely technological issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Heinze and Hu, 2005)</ref>; indeed, the challenge is to use those technologies to improve the abilities of government's institutions while improving the quality of citizens' lives by redefining the relationship between them and their governments <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gautrin, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Lots of efforts are being invested in the use of ICTs to improve delivery of government services to citizens in developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Basettihalli et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Pudjianto et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Weerakkody, Molnar and El-Haddadeh, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hien, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">AlAwadhi and Morris, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Al-Shafi et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Verdegem and Verleye, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Galpaya, Samarajiva and Soysa, 2007)</ref>. Accordingly, the improvement of e-Government services has been one of the most popular research topics within this research area over the last decade <ref type="bibr">(Barrett et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Andersen, Henriksen and Medaglia, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kanat and Özkan, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Carter and Weerakkody, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">West, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Norris and Moon, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gilbert, Balestrini and Littleboy, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Heeks, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Layne and Lee, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Venkatesh and Morris, 2000)</ref> . One of the initiatives is to evaluate and improve e-Government services from the citizens' perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cruza et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rabaa'i, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Abu-Shanab, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">B. Gupta, Dasgupta and Gupta, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">D. N. Gupta, 2007)</ref>. The adoption and use of e-Government services remain restricted in the most countries due to being guided largely by supply side factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Verdegem and Verleye, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kolsaker and Kelley, 2007)</ref> . Governments must realise that the success of e-Government does not depend only on the supplier side, but also on the demand side and the willingness of citizens to adopt the online service <ref type="bibr">(Anthopoulos et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rabaa'i, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Carter and Bélanger, 2005)</ref> .</p><p>The dilemma of e-Government service adoption and usage is its complexity and multidimensionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Al-Hujran, Al-dalahmeh and Aloudat, 2011</ref>). e-Government was developed and implemented firstly in industrialised countries; it should not be assumed that the concept of e-Government is innately appropriate for developing countries. Consequently, it should not be assumed that the concept is automatically appropriate for developing countries. Thus far, e -Government still faces major challenges as it continues to expand in developing countries. Moreover, when introducing e-Government to developing nations, it is anticipated that more effort s will be necessary than in developed countries.</p><p>The end-users of e-Government systems are more diverse than e-Commerce, with comparisons of wider layers of user groups (for example, elderly, less welleducated people and less familiar with technology usage) who are more likely to encounter problems while interacting with e -Government systems. IS literatures confirmed that users' technical capabilities and management support are influenced by user's technical knowledge and expertise. Therefore, this research argues that perceived support quality is a new way of looking at citizens' ad option and usage in the e-Government system's field and a major factor of e -Government system's acceptance, particularly in developing countries.</p><p>The objective of various e-Government initiatives has moved in the past decade towards establishing services offering greater accessibility for citizens <ref type="bibr">(Rabaa'i, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Al-Hujran et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Carter and Bélanger, 2005)</ref>. As a result, it is necessary to examine all possible factors to explain citizens' adoption and usage of such systems. Until now, e-Government services have been more concerned with quantity rather than quality <ref type="bibr">(Weerakkody, Molnar and El-Haddadeh, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">West, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">The Economist, 2008)</ref>. While there have been numerous researches on e -Government adoption in developing countries, little has been known about the role of perceived support quality on e-Government adoption. This is important because citizens require continuous guidance while interacting with the system. However, the perceived support quality in an e-Government system has not been looked at closely yet. What is more, the concept e -Service has been studied less in the public sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Wang and Liao, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Buckley, 2003)</ref>. Therefore, this research argues that perceived support quality is a new way of looking at citizens' adoption and usage in the e-Government system's field and the major factor of e -Government system's acceptance, mainly in developing countries. According to the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Wixom and Todd (2005)</ref>, the perceived support quality is a weaker predictor of systems usage than technology acceptance. But, we found that the perceived support quality is one of the major success factors of e-Government system in developing countries that increase the e-Government system usage.</p><p>Thus, the objective of this paper is to advance our knowledge in the field of e -Government by revealing the roles of perceived support quality and its satisfaction towards behaviour intention and usage of e -Government services in developing countries. We review relevant studies and theories regarding e -Government adoption and information in Section 2 and the research model of the stu dy is discussed in Section 3. The research methodology of the study is presented in Section 4, followed by the data analysis and results in Section 5 . We conclude the study in section 6 with discussion and recommendation .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Conceptual Background</head><p>There are several definitions in the existing literature that attempt to classify the concept of e-Government systems according to their scope, perspectives, and the objective of their activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hu et al., 2009)</ref>. However, this study will focus on the definitions relating to citizens' perspectives towards e -Government services. As per the report on "Auditing e-Government" prepared by the INTOSAI Standing Committee on IT <ref type="bibr">Audit (2003)</ref>, the definition of e-Government is: "the online exchange of government information with, and the delivery of services to, citizens, businesses and other government agencies". Similarly, then United Nations and the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) ( <ref type="formula">2002</ref>) defined e-Government as, "utilizing the Internet and the World-Wide-Web for delivering government information and services to citizens". Furthermore, Deloitte Research (2000:1) defines e-Government as the ″use of technology to enhance the access to and delivery of government services to benefit citizens, business partners and employees."</p><p>As noted in the above three definitions, the Internet is defined as a requirement and a possible medium for e-Government, which emphasises the importance of ICT in this environment. Additionally, all definitions of e -Government include the use of technology to enable information and service delivery by transforming internal and external relationships, and can be defined as a method "of delivering government information and services digitally to citizens and businesses" <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Molla and Licker, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>There is a number of empirical studies undertaken in different countries to study e-Government adoption; for example, in Turkey <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Ozkan and Kanat, 2011)</ref>, the USA <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Carter and Bélanger, 2005)</ref>, the Netherlands <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Horst, Kuttschreuter and Gutteling, 2007)</ref>, the UK <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dwivedi and Williams, 2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Kuwait (AlAwadhi and Morris, 2009)</ref>, Qatar <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Al-Shafi and Weerakkody, 2009)</ref>, Saudi Arabia (Al-Sobhi, Weerakkody and Al-Shafi, 2010) and Jordan <ref type="bibr">(Rabaa'i, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Abu-Shanab, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Each study contributes to providing a strong theoretical understanding of the factors explored in their research model. Nations are motivated globally to make improvements in their governments, build stronger relationship with citizens, improve efficiency and effectiveness of government agencies and reduce cost s of service delivery in the form of e-Governments <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Shahkooh, Abbasi and Abdollahi, 2008)</ref>. Therefore, the expectations from implementing e -Government systems in developing countries are high and regarded as a prerequisite for economic and social development (Weerakkody, <ref type="bibr">Dwivedi and Kurunananda, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schuppan, 2009)</ref> . Some of the social challenging to use e-Government services as outlined by Weerakkody, <ref type="bibr">Dwivedi and Kurunananda (2009)</ref> are accessibility of e-Government services and language barriers.</p><p>During the last decade, numerous reports and articles were published in the field of e-Government emphasising the beneficial services offered in developed countries <ref type="bibr">(Hien, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Song, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sharifi and Zarei, 2004)</ref> ; for example, health, education, immigration, traffic, and many other service s provided electronically.</p><p>Many international agencies and developed countries including the UN, World Bank, OECD, US, the UK make reports as a form of institutional and academic publications. Those reports and articles discuss the progress of nations in t erms of delivering e-Government systems by highlighting: (1) the critical factors that influence the success or failures of such systems; (2) evaluating the results from the implementation of e-Government; and (3) adding recommendations for future improvements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chatfield and Alhujran, 2009)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr">(Venkatesh et al., 2003 :467)</ref>. Thus, the model serves as a benchmark for the technology acceptance literature and aims to explain user intentions to use IS and subsequent usage behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(AlAwadhi and Morris, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Venkatesh et al., 2003)</ref>. Nonetheless, despite the credited work of integrating various models in UTAUT, the model lacks important variables, such as web quality, assurance of service by service providers and responsiveness of service providers (Sambasivan, Wemyss and Che Rose, 2010). Furthermore, compared with the TAM model, UTAUT has been less studied in the context of e -Government. To reduce this gap, we develop a unified model for the study.  <ref type="bibr">and Jiang, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Carter and Bélanger, 2005)</ref> . Despite the considerable interest in the D&amp;M IS success model, few efforts were made concerning the third critical success factor, ′service quality′, in the context of e -Government <ref type="bibr">(Saha, Nath and Salehi-Sangari, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Song, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Wang and Liao, 2008)</ref> . The proposed integrated research framework is comprised of ten constructs; one dependent variable and nine independent variables (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3 -1</ref>). The dependent variable is behavioural intention to use e -Government systems while the independent variables are: (1) information quality, (2) information satisfaction, (3) system quality, (4) system satisfaction, (5) performance expectancy, (6) effort expectancy, (7) social influence, (8) perceived support quality and (9) support satisfaction. The constructs in the proposed integrated research framework have been used frequently in IS research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">DeLone and McLean, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">DeLone and McLean, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Venkatesh et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">DeLone and McLean, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Molla and Licker, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Seddon, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Seddon and Kiew, 1996)</ref> . However, other constructs than the perceived support quality and support satisfaction do not directly relate to our study, so we did not develop and test the hypotheses related to these constructs .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Theoretical Framework</head><p>For the integrity of the research model, the process of defining and verifying each construct proceeded. Accordingly, three hypotheses were formulated to test the research model. The intention-behaviour relationship is well documented in the technology acceptance literature and has been found to be distinct when applied to a variety of technology contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kim, Chun and Song, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Venkatesh et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Davis, Bagozzi and Warshaw, 1989)</ref>. As a result, the link between intention to use a technology and actual usage is well established and either variable may be used to measure technology acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(DeLone and McLean, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Taylor and Todd, 1995a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mathieson, 1991)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Perceived Support Quality</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceived Support Quality and Support Satisfaction</head><p>The current study attempts to examine role of perceived support quality and support satisfaction in the context of e-Government. The support delivered by the service providers, government's administration and the personal IT towards intention to use e-Government systems, could be a critical factor in explaining the behavioural intention towards, and usage of, e-Government systems. Most of the IS acceptance models in previous studies consider end-users to be homogeneous in terms of their technology skills. However, in developing countries, citizens are mostly novices in terms of using IT. On the one hand, IS users in the workplace are more skilled and ready to use such systems, due largely to the training they receive. Alternatively, the reverse is evident in e-Government systems. Their users, citizens, may include those who are less familiar with technology-enabled systems; for example, elderly, less well-educated people, the disabled and the less ICT savvy, who are more likely to encounter problems while interacting with e -Government systems. Such systems have wider layers of user groups compared with other IS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Phang et al. (2006)</ref> state that the provision of e-Government services to citizens should cover all sections of the public: rich, poor, young and elderly. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Galpaya, Samarajiva and Soysa (2007:</ref>2) declare: "Decreasing existing disparities in access, is, in fact, the holy grail of e-Government projects." In view of these prior studies, based on the integration of the two models, the construct 'service quality' from the updated D&amp;M IS success model and the construct 'facilitating conditions' from the UTAUT model are merged and renamed 'perceived support quality' in an attempt to explain the behaviour intention to use e-Government services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Service Quality and Facilitating Conditions</head><p>Facilitating conditions is defined as the "degree to which an individual believes that an organizational and technical infrastructure exists to support the use of the system" <ref type="bibr">(Venkatesh et al., 2003:453)</ref> . The literature indicates that facilitating conditions has a positive effect on innovation use and is considered a significant predictor of technology use <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Venkatesh et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chau, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Taylor and Todd, 1995b)</ref> . Facilitating conditions reveal workplace environmental conditions that support employees' use of technology; that is, the availability of computers, and having the necessary resources, knowledge and opportunities to use the system.</p><p>Notwithstanding, in the realm of e-Government, citizens require more than environmental conditions to support their use of online services.</p><p>Due to the advent and growth of e-Commerce, DeLone and McLean added the construct of service quality to their updated model and declared that it "may become the most important variable" in an IS context <ref type="bibr">(DeLone and McLean, 2003:25)</ref>. One of the most important distinguishing features of the terms ′service quality′ and ′electronic services′ is "the replacement of interpersonal interaction with human-machine interaction" <ref type="bibr">(Bressolles and Nantel, 2008:3)</ref>. Thus, due to the lack of personal communication between users and website managers, service quality measure has become a vital issue in the web environment and could be the most important variable in the update DeLone and McLean model <ref type="bibr">(Tam and Oliveira, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ahn, Ryu and Han, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, online services that meet users' needs and are able to solve their problems are described as electronic services or e-Services <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hoffman, 2003)</ref>. Nevertheless, it is a subjective assessment of the service citizens expect to receive and is usually based on citizens' special assessment. As a result, when these two constructs are combined, the criteria may yield to a stronger overall measure of perceived support quality. In an e-Government setting, technical and managerial support to citizens is fundamental as they are likely to seek help while interacting with the system. Therefore, the greater the citizens' perception of the quality of support received online, the more likely they are to be satisfied and inclined to use the e-Government system again. The discussions above lead to the following hypothesis being formulated: H1: Perceived support quality is related significantly to support satisfaction of an e-Government system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Support Satisfaction and Intention to Use</head><p>The findings of a study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Al -adaileh (2009)</ref> in the context of Arab countries revealed that the use of IS is influenced by users' technical capabilities and the management support provided. High -quality services and users' satisfaction are recognised as predictable dimensions that lead to continues use of e-service (Tam and Oliveira, 2017). To be precise, 'use' and 'user satisfaction' are closely interrelated <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(DeLone and McLean, (2003)</ref>; therefore, when citizens are satisfied with the support of the e-Government system, they are more likely to use the system. Thus, the discussions above lead to the following hypothesis: H2: Support satisfaction is related significantly to intention to use e-Government system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Support Satisfaction and System Satisfaction</head><p>According <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Molla and Licker (2001)</ref>, the previous experience of high-quality online customer support might affect repeated use of the commercial site. That is, the system can be perceived as successful if the quality of online helpdesk support is high, thereby satisfying the users. Moreover , in discussing the concept of IS success in Germany, the perception of 'help-desk support quality' emerged from the analysis <ref type="bibr">(Agourram, 2009: 134)</ref>. Therefore, when citizens perceive high online support while interacting with e-Government systems, they will be satisfied. In turn, this will lead to ease-of-use of the system or 'effort expectancy'. Thus, the discussions above lead to the following hypothesis: H3: Support satisfaction is related significantly to system satisfaction. Perceived support quality is related significantly to support satisfaction of e-Government system. H2 Support satisfaction is related significantly to behavioural intention to use e -Government system. H3 Support satisfaction is related significantly to system satisfaction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Research Methodology</head><p>Technology adoption research is a well -established field within the literature.</p><p>Therefore, to achieve the research aim and meet the objectives, the study focuses on measurement techniques to understand the behaviour intention to use e -Government systems and their sustained use. Hence, a quantitative empirical approach was best suited to this approach, considering the ′what′ and the ′how′ research questions. Accordingly, the study is categorised under the scientific method following a hypothetico-deductive approach. From the perspective of the philosophy of science, the validation of the positivist research instruments is a necessity for discovering the truth <ref type="bibr">(Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994)</ref>. Therefore, in line with the positivist paradigm, a deductive research would be an applicable approach when considered against its philosophical background. As a result, this research sought a theoretical argument through the deduction of a sequence of hypotheses. These are identified as important variables according to Wixom and Todd's tested theory by applying those variables in the e -Government context and then, collecting appropriate data via questionnaire to be analysed empirically in the following chapter. The aim of the methodology is to ensure systematic and relevant research into the phenomena under investigation.</p></div>

During and after, items from the original scales were eliminated (PE8, EE5, EE6, and PSQ1) while others were modified to suit the current study. The participants for the main survey were selected based on convenient sample method and the survey materials were distributed using the following tools; paper-based, e-mail, and online survey tool.</p><p>The total number of citizens who participated in the survey was 1225. The total of the citizens who completed the survey was 947, with a response rate of 77.30 per cent. After deducting the outliers, the analysis of this study indicated that the data contained a few univariate outliers. Based on this criterion, 35 cases were deleted from the data using multiple regressions and data was reduced from 663 to 628.</p><p>The frequencies and percentages for the demographic variables describing the sample are displayed in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Instrument Validations</head><p>Harman's (1967) single factor test was performed to examine the existence of common method bias among the variables in this study <ref type="bibr">(Podsakoff, MacKenzie and Lee, 2003)</ref>. The results of Harman's single factor test indicated that the sample lacked a significant presence of common method variance. Thus, there is no concern for common method bias in this study. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</ref> suggested, the combination of the measurement model and the structural model enables a comprehensive, confirmatory assessment of construct validity (convergent validity and discriminant validity). The authors used a two -step approach to perform SEM analysis. The first consisted of the measurement model, while the second is comprised of the structural model related to the depend ent and independent variables of the study. The representation of latent variables, based on their relation to observed indicator is one of the major characteristics of SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Garson, 2012)</ref>. Therefore, the first step provided a basis for assessing the validity of the structural theory and was performed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using the interrelationships between observed indicators and latent variables. The second step was related to dependent and inde pendent variables to test the hypotheses specified in the model.</p></div>

According to the proposed model, the most important issues that need attention when implementing an on-line G2C system are: Performance Expectancy, which is influenced by satisfaction generated by the information in e-Government systems; Effort Expectancy, which is the outcome of the satisfaction of the characteristics of the system; and finally, the support citizens experienced while interacting with such systems. Citizens will have more positive attitudes and will value online services more when they perceive that they could interact within the system with more confidence. The study also implies that the government organisations should keep improving the quality of their websites. Undoubtedly, providing up -to-date, complete, and relevant information to citizens about online services, assuring easy navigation, quick response time, availability of the link-reliability and the perceptions of support, There is no doubt that numerous factors may influence behavioural intention to use e-Government systems in both developed and developing countries. In particular, a replication of the current study might yield different results in a mandatory setting. To date, using e-Government services is more voluntary than mandatory.</p><p>And this study investigated the relationships in a voluntary setting.

The basis of the hypothetical model of this study is based on Wixom and Todd theoretical i ntegrated model (2005). Using Ajzen and Fishbein's (1988) conceptualisation of attitudes; object-based versus behavioural beliefs, the authors integrated the two research streams recommending more predictive means of measuring systems usage and tested it in a database application environment and poses that there are two welldeveloped streams in the literature that seek to measure IS success: (1) usersatisfaction literature; and (2) technology acceptance literatur e. The model recognises that user-satisfaction is a weaker predictor of systems usage than technology acceptance. To fulfil the goals of this study, a modified model of Wixom and Todd integrated model was used , which made some changes to the original model of Wixom and Todd. Firstly, the present study employs the UTAUT model as a replacement for the TAM model, which was used in the original Wixom and Todd theoretical model. The line of research in technology acceptance literature is crowned by UTAUT. The empirical test of the original UTAUT provides strong support for the model and was developed as "a definitive model that synthesizes what is known and provides a foundation to guide future research in this area"</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Secondly, the updated De Lone and McLean's IS success model (2003) is employed as a replacement for the 1992 De Lone and McLean IS success model (D&amp;M IS success model), to include the service quality construct in framework. Livari (2005:8) outlined that, regardless of the popularity of the D&amp;M IS success model, it was tested empirically on 16 studies only: "there is a dearth of studies that tested DeLone-McLean model empirically." In this aspect, IS literature has been silent about what really contributes to the success of e-Government websites (Teo, Srivastava</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><head>3. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The Quality Constructs of the Updated D&amp;M IS Success Model DeLone and McLean (2003) posit that there are three scopes of quality in any system: system quality (technical level); information quality (semantic level); service quality (the support that users receive from the IT support personnel); all of which impact the dimensions of satisfaction (DeLone and McLean, 2016). Additionally, to receive the maximum benefit of e -government service, there should be a continued usage of e-Government services (Alalwan, 2013). In the e-Government domain, citizens use an internet -based application to search and conduct transactions; therefore, they require e -Government systems to provide high-quality information and first-class service. Doing so will satisfy citizens' needs and encourage them to re-use e-Government systems. 3.2 The UTAUT Constructs The original UTAUT model comprises three indirect determinants of behavioural intention and two direct determinants of use behaviour. The three core constructs of the original UTAUT model that declare to impact behavioural intention directly to use technology are: (1) performance expectancy, (2) effort expectancy and (3) social influence. Behavioural intention and facilitating conditions are declared to impact directly use behaviour. However, the moderators (age, gender, experience and voluntariness of use) were not included in this study since Wixom and Todd did not include any of the moderators in their study. The dependent variable in this study is behavioural intention to use e -Government systems. The intention to use technology is a central factor in TAM and UTAUT models and can also be used to predict the citizens' actual technology usage. Due to the difficulties of interpreting the multidimensional aspects of use, DeLone and McLean (2003) suggest intention to use as an alternative measure in some contexts.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>information systems (IS) are successful(DeLone and McLean, 2016). To answer the research questions, and to test the proposed model, the state of Kuwait's official website (KGOS, http://www.e.gov.kw/) was chosen as an application area. Kuwait is a small oil-rich country located in the Middle East. Due to its substantial oil resources, it is considered the second wealthiest country in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). However, even in rich and booming countries, organizations seek effectiveness and success in their investments in information systems(DeLone and McLean, 2016).OnJune 30, 2008, the population of Kuwait was estimated at 3,328,136 people. In this census, the number of Kuwaitis reached 1,038,598, while the remainder comprised non-Kuwaitis. The KGOS portal was launched in 2005, presenting governmental information and services to all citizens, residents, and visitors in addition to business sectors. KGOS provides many services online such as traffic offenses for individuals and transfer of residence; license declarations and tenders; and online services for visitors like information about the climate in Kuwait. Finally, KGOS provides e-Payment system to assist the electronic payment of governmental fees at any time in a fast and secure way. The total payments by e-Payment through KGOS amounted 7,721,956 KD (around USD 27 million) and the total number of visitors was 2,147,257 for the first half of 2013. By 2006, more than 50 government services were available through the e-Government official website. The launch of KGOS signified a basic change to the concept of presenting information and delivering government services. According to the Internet Usage Statistics, 74.2% of Kuwait population has Internet access (Internet World Stats, 2012). However, according to a survey was taken on March 7, 2010 by one of the leading newspapers in Kuwait, 56% of people in Kuwait use the Internet for entertainment and recreation purposes. In addition, 38% were unsatisfied with the Internet services in general (Alqabas Newspaper, 2011). There are three main reasons for choosing Kuwait as the setting for this study. First, according to the World Bank Group (2004) classification, Kuwait was categorised by the United Nations as a developing country in 1995, despite its high per capita income. The developing countries includes Hong Kong (China), Israel, Kuwait, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (2004). It is the main reason to choose Kuwait in this study that Kuwait is one of the developing countries. Second, the lack of IT skills in implementing effective e-Government system in Kuwait makes Kuwait a good application area. Third, Kuwait is one of the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) which consists of Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The GCC countries have similar political systems based on Islamic beliefs, joint destiny, and common objectives. Nevertheless, Bahrain has emerged as the new leader in the region, while Kuwait has slipped to a lower position (United Nations, 2010).</figDesc></figure>

After reviewing the literature, all constructs were defi ned with some modifications. However, the perceived support quality construct has not yet been examined empirically in the context of e -Government. Consequently, the current study captures the previous literature review in the IS field and identifies the main indicators used previously by academics to measure e -Service and facilitating conditions from IS literature.</figDesc></figure>

To evaluate overall model fit for CFA and SEM, eight GOF indices, each describing the model fit from a different perspective, were reported for this study. The fit statistic and indices for the proposed measurement model are summarised in Table 5-1. Having an average fit, the proposed model did not fit the data well. The normed chi -square was below three (2.39), while the RMSEA (.04) and SRMR (.04), and TLI (.93) were within the acceptable range. However, the AGFI (.87), GFI (.89), and CFI (.94) were only close to the acceptable benchmarks. Further, the standardised residuals of a correct model should be less than the absolute value of two; whereas the absolute value of the highest standardised residual was high at 4.34.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_12"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>support satisfaction towards intention to use and usage in the context of e -Government in developing countries. The perceived support quality delivered by the service providers, government administrations, and the IT person nel indicated its significance as a critical factor in explaining the behaviour intention and usage of e-Government services. The perceived support quality had a significant influence on support satisfaction. It indicates that the higher citizens perceive the quality of the support received online, the greater their satisfaction with the support offered; thus, they become inclined to use the e -Government systems. The finding in our study is threefold. Firstly, it demonstrates that research on e -Government adoption can and should consider both streams of literature; that is, the user-satisfaction literature and the technology acceptance literatur e. Wixom and Todd (2005) built a theoretical logic model that links object -based beliefs into a system with behavioural-based beliefs in predicting users' usage of specific software. However, because of the nature of e-Government systems, which is based on virtual interactions, the prior study lacks the third dimension of DeLone and McLean's IS success model: service quality. In e -Government environments, the construct e-Service should be included to capture the tec hnical services provided by the authorities, particularly when citizens seek an online help. Secondly, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the integrated model of Wixom and Todd was not validated previously in an e-Government setting. Wixom and Todd's model represents a theoretical integration of user satisfaction and technology acceptance theories. The strength of the integrated model lies in its ability to guide both IT design of governments' Websites (object-based attitudes and beliefs expressed in the quality of dimension of DeLone and McLean's IS success model), which affects the behavioural beliefs that are captured in (UTAUT constructs) and predict usage behaviours towards system usage. Thus, validating the concept from user satisfaction literature and technology acceptance literature into a single unified model, empirically provide the conceptual understanding of the difference between object-based beliefs and attitudes and behavioural beliefs and attitudes toward use as suggested by (Wixom and Todd, 2005). The study supports that the precision of object -based beliefs in e-Government settings should not be based on the direct relationships of these factors to explain behaviour intentions and usage of such systems. However, such relationships can only be understood by examining proper mediating factors related to behavioural beliefs towards use, and behavioural intention as indicated in the UTAUT model. Thus, integrating object-based beliefs represented in DeLone and McLean's IS success model and behavioural beliefs, as in UTAUT and TAM, yields a better understating of behavioural intentions to use e -Government systems. Accordingly, from a theoretical view, the perceived support quality factor embedded in Wixom and Todd's model enriches the model to the prediction of e -Government adoption.</figDesc></figure>

The results also indicate that managers should pay less attention to the Social Influence factor and consider improving the quality of online services being offered. More emphasis should be placed on ensuring that the citizens use the technology efficiently and effectively, as user satisfaction leads to a positive impact on behaviour intention to use the systems.In fact, the support provided to users emerged as one of the most critical factors in an early study of end-users' computing(Bergeron et al., 1990). Later, due to the lack of in-person communication between users and website managers, service quality has become a vital issue within the web environment. Likewise, evidence was provided in this study to support the view of the perceived support quality, which included the concept of service quality as an antecedent to behavioural beliefs by affecting object-based beliefs, mainly in developing countries.Despite the findings of this study, the results should be discussed in the context of its limitations. First, convenient sampling techniques were applied in this study instead of random sampling. Though 74.2 percent of Kuwait's population have access to the Internet(Internet World Stats, 2012), the usage of e -Government is not prevalent in Kuwait. Thus, it was hard to use users of e-Government services in Kuwait as a sampling framework. Second, the sample size covered the most experienced users of the e-Government systems, especially after making the decision to distribute the survey online.</figDesc></figure>
