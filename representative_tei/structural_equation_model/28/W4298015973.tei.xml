<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>It can be stated that educators who are supposed to keep a balance of equality and justice among their students cannot sometimes hold the balance and give adequate support to all their students. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bradley, Werth, and Hastings (2012)</ref> specified, the means of providing such a balance of equality and justice for all the classes in a society have been argued by different philosophers from Aristotle and Socrates to contemporary activists such as Freire and Beauvoir on a large scale. In the very essence of these arguments, there lies the interaction between education and society. When this interaction is considered from the point of education, it can be said that "education is not the ultimate lever for social transformation, but without it transformation cannot occur" <ref type="bibr">(Freire, 1998, p. 37)</ref>. When assessed from the society's perspective, "it is vital that the school and community recognize the importance of community involvement in education and the involvement of students in the community" <ref type="bibr">(Goulet &amp; Goulet, 2014, p. 210)</ref>. Altogether, these two outlooks disclose the fact that the interaction between education and society has an undeniable significance. This perspective has enhanced studies by educators intending to provide equal educational opportunities for students who have come from different social structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Capper &amp; Young, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Constantine, Hage, Kindaichi, &amp; Bryant, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Goodman et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lemley, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Leonard &amp; Moore, 2014)</ref>. In the essence of these studies, there exist social justice objectives which are intended to support cultural pluralism.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Prilleltensky (2001)</ref>, social justice should "promote fair and equitable allocation of bargaining powers, resources, and obligations in society in consideration of people's differential power, needs, and abilities to express their wishes" (p. 754). Correspondingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fouad, Gerstein, and Toporek (2006)</ref> also argue that social justice requires being fair and equitable in distributing social resources for every member of the society, regardless of their race, gender, ability status, sexual orientation, physical makeup, or religious creed. To realize all of these, the society itself has to work in a collaborative, democratic, participatory and inclusive way <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bell, 2007)</ref>. Therefore, it can be argued that allowing social justice applications in learning environments which display themselves in a micro-dimensional size in social structure will lead to positive contributions to the structure of the society.</p><p>In social justice applications, the interaction among teacher, student and learning environment is crucial. Teachers and students do not only bring their own cultural backgrounds into the classroom, but also interpret the classroom culture and social life they find there <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lalas, 2007)</ref>. In light of these interpretations, the notions of equality and justice gain profound importance for the stakeholders in the learning environments as many studies point out. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aydin and Tonbuloglu (2014)</ref> stated that educators primarily emphasize equality, democracy and justice in learning environments. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fuentes, Chanthongthip, and Rios (2010)</ref> concluded that university students who had social justice education have more attention to equality and justice. In another study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Torres-Harding, Diaz, Schamberger, and Carollo (2015)</ref> mentioned that taking service-learning courses was related to university students' social justice attitudes, intentions and actions. Also Littenberg-Tobias (2014) stated that participating in some service programs may influence university students' attitudes and understandings of social justice. Thus, the students' sensitivity to these concepts in human life is closely associated with social justice education <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Banks, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Goodman &amp; Burton, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Leonard &amp; Moore, 2014)</ref>. It is because social justice education, which has a student-centered, cooperative, empirical, intellectual, analytical and multicultural structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wade, 2004)</ref>, enables students to see not only their differences, but also their common ground <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Capper &amp; Young, 2014)</ref>. The key role in this context is played by teachers.</p><p>Teachers who aim to create differences in their students' lives should be sensitive to the notion of equal opportunities in education <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Villegas, 2007)</ref>, should help students develop strategies to solve social problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brown &amp; Brown, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wade, 2004)</ref> and should support their students in having an effective voice in terms of social justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Garii &amp; Rule, 2009)</ref>. In order to realize this necessity, it is thought that teacher training education should include social justice subjects. Related studies carried out in this context also support this view. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Leonard and Moore (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Page (2009)</ref> found that prospective teachers taking social justice education gave more attention to equality and justice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tinkler, Hannah, Tinkler, and Miller (2015)</ref> mentioned that social justice service-learning experiences support the social justice goals of prospective teachers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Rios and Montecinos (1999)</ref>, in a similar study, found that prospective teachers pointed out the importance of social justice in their education and that the notion of social justice should be a part of their instructional curriculum. On the other hand, a study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tomul, Celik, and Tas (2012)</ref> revealed that according to prospective teachers, in-service teachers behave in a discriminative way in terms of students' socio-economic features, political views and beliefs. In a similar study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ersoy (2014)</ref>, it was detected that, since teachers do not have adequate knowledge and experience concerning effective and democratic citizenship education, primary students belonging to lower socio-economic levels cannot exercise their rights adequately compared to those who come from higher socio-economic levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Thomas (2007)</ref> in his study argues that teachers who intend to maintain social justice implementations are not supported enough. The inadequacy of social justice implementations of in-service teachers reveals the fact that problems emerge in the transition of social justice from theory to practice.</p><p>Even though the notions of equality and justice are frequently emphasized in literature, there have been arguments over how to implement social justice in learning environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Speight &amp; Vera, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Vera and Speight (2003)</ref> argue that solely focusing on theoretical knowledge could be important for researchers; however, allotting efforts to implementation will enable social justice to exist as a dynamic structure. Correspondingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Torres-Harding, Siers, and Olson (2012)</ref> underline the fact that the relationship between attitudes and actions requires more applied research. Therefore, though not sufficient for now, it can be stated that in the literature there is an increasing tendency concerning implementation of the notion of social justice in studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bradley et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>At this point, there appears to be a question over how the teachers' behaviors towards social justice implementations will be evaluated and directed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Torres-Harding et al. (2012)</ref> hold that a scale that can be developed in the field of social justice will help researchers and educators in terms of understanding the process of moving from attitudes to action. Analyzing the literature, it is clear that there are scales which evaluate individuals' behaviors concerning social justice in general; however, the number of scales used to evaluate which factors at what levels effectively influence behaviors is limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Colquitt, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rasinski, 1987)</ref>. In order to remove the stated limitation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Torres-Harding et al. (2012)</ref>, developed the Social Justice Scale (SJS) based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ajzen's (1991)</ref> social cognitive model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ajzen (1991)</ref> in his model states that individuals' attitudes towards the action, subjective norms around the action and their perceived behavioral control of the action predict the behavioral intention.</p><p>The component of behavioral intention in the model points out that an individual's intention to act affects their behavior in the future; the component of attitudes towards the action is related with the individual's evaluation of the behavior's convenience level; the component of subjective norms relates to the individual's perception of social support or pressure from his/her environment in terms of performing the action; the component of perceived behavioral control of action refers to the individual's perception of self-efficacy about himself/herself regarding the difficulty of behavior. The three elements in the model could show differences in accordance with the significance level of behavioral intention and situation, as well as the feature of the behavior. In other words, these three predictors may affect behavioral intentions independently or all together.</p><p>All in all, SJS was developed in order to measure attitudes concerning social justice, values, perceived behavioral control and behavioral intentions. It is thought that searching the psychometric characteristics of SJS's Turkish form, and thus bringing it into the literature, will contribute to the researches regarding social justice and social justice implementations to become integrated into learning environments. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to analyze linguistic equivalence, validity and reliability of SJS. The secondary aim is to test <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ajzen's (1991)</ref> model upon whose basis the scale was constructed. Within the framework of the second aim, the effects of "social justice attitudes," "subjective norms" and "perceived behavioral control" (independent variables) on "behavioral intentions" (dependent variable) were investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Design</head><p>This research is comprised of two different studies: scale adaptation and structural equation modeling (SEM). In scale adaptation, since the existing situation remained to be determined, the data gained through SJS were analyzed by applying a survey method, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fraenkel and Wallen (2009)</ref> suggested. In the SEM study, as it was thought that, based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ajzen's (1991)</ref> model, there would be a cause and effect relationship between "social justice attitudes," "perceived behavioral control," "subjective norms," and "behavioral intentions," causal research design was preferred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Sample</head><p>This research was carried out in two different study groups; the first group being in the scale adaptation study, the other being in the SEM. The first study group was comprised of 515 prospective teachers attending pedagogical formation programs at Marmara University, Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University and Yildiz Technical University in the 2013-2014 Academic Year. The second study group included 410 prospective teachers attending pedagogical formation programs at Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University in the 2014-2015 Academic Year. The demographic characteristics of the participants are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Instrument and Procedure</head><p>The data of the study were collected through SJS developed by Torres-Harding et al. <ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref>. The scale has four factors (social justice attitudes, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms and behavioral intentions) and 24 items in total. The first factor consists of 11 items concerning social justice attitudes. An example of these items includes, "Allow others to have meaningful input into decisions affecting their lives." In the second factor, there are five items intended to measure the individuals' perceived behavioral controls about social justice. An example of these items includes, "I am capable of influencing others to promote fairness and equality." The third factor contains four items to measure subjective norms about social justice. An example of these items includes, "Other people around me are supportive of efforts that promote social justice." The fourth factor is comprised of four items to measure behavioral intentions toward social justice in the future. An example of these items includes, "In the future, I will do my best to ensure that all individuals and groups in my community have a chance to speak and be heard." Responses were scored on a 7point scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).</p><p>In order to adapt SJS into Turkish, permission was obtained from S.R. Torres-Harding via e-mail. Three lecturers who are experts in psychological counseling and guidance, curriculum development and instruction, measurement and evaluation were asked for their opinions on the scale's cultural convenience, clarity etc. During the process of translation, two English Language experts translated the scale into Turkish and then two other experts made the reverse translation. In accordance with the common opinions of the experts and the researcher, the problematic items were corrected on the Turkish form of the scale. Then, the Turkish form was examined by Turkish Language experts in the context of language and expression. English and Turkish forms of the scale, respectively, were applied to English Language Teaching students attending their 4 th class in a four-week interval, and the consistency between the forms was examined. Applying the scale to the participants was realized by four lecturers including the researcher. The participants were informed of the aim of the study, features of the scale and privacy of the data in order to get them to involve themselves in the study voluntarily.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Validity and Reliability</head><p>The factor structure of the original scale was analyzed through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). After the analysis, it was discovered that the fit indices, χ 2 =789.14, df=246, p=.00, RMSEA=.09, NFI=.95, CFI=.97, GFI=.80, AGFI=.75, PGFI=.65, were at an acceptable level. The factor loading values of the items were calculated between .55 and .91, and after reliability analysis, the Cronbach Alpha coefficients in factors were found to range from .82 to .95. Finally, the inter-factor correlation coefficients were determined to be between .34 and .58.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>In the process of linguistic equivalence, the consistency between English and Turkish applications was analyzed through Pearson Correlation Coefficient. As the scale's factor numbers and consistency between factors and indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kline, 2011)</ref> were specified in the original form, factor consistency with the data obtained from the first study group was tested through CFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bentler &amp; Bonett, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brown, 2015)</ref>. In order to specify the internal consistency of the scale, the Cronbach Alpha Coefficients of the factors and the total of the scale were examined. For the purpose of specifying on what level the items differentiate the participants, corrected itemtotal correlation was calculated and independent samples t test was realized between the lower 27% and the upper 27% groups. The external consistency of the scale was calculated through test-retest applications performed in four-week intervals. The effects of social justice attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on behavioral intentions were analyzed by means of SEM. SEM is a comprehensive and flexible approach in modeling the relationships between observed and latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hoyle &amp; Smith, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1998)</ref>. Additionally, its capability to provide the chance of evaluation and correction about a theoretical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988)</ref>, its offering the chance of controlling measurement errors and its utility to provide information about the consistency level of the model make SEM an influential method <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Frazier, Tix, &amp; Barron, 2004)</ref>. LISREL 8.80 and SPSS 17.0 were used for the analysis of the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linguistic Equivalence</head><p>Between four-week interval applications of the SJS's English and Turkish forms (N=33), a positive and significant correlation was found in items .63 and .84; in factors .76 and .84; in the total of the scale .86, p=.00, p&lt;.01 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Findings show that the consistency between applications is at an acceptable level. Thus the scale's linguistic equivalence was acquired. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First-Order Confirmatory Factor Analysis</head><p>In the factor analysis, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brown (2015)</ref> suggested, to arrange the relationships between indicators, maximum likelihood technique, which enables a statistical evaluation over how to perform a better factor analysis, was applied. After CFA, the fit indices χ 2 =671.15, df=246, χ 2 /df=2.72, GFI=.90, AGFI=.88 were found to be at an acceptable level; RMSEA=.05, NFI=.96, NNFI=.97, CFI=.97, SRMR=.04 indices showed good fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hoyle &amp; Smith, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Schermelleh-Engel, Moosbrugger, &amp; Muller, 2003)</ref>. The explained variances ranged from .29 to .51 in social justice attitude factor; ranged from .48 to .54 in perceived behavioral control factor; ranged from .56 to .83 in subjective norms factor; and, ranged from .55 to .76 in behavioral intention factor. As for factor loadings (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), they ranged from .54 to .71 in the first factor; from .70 to .73 in the second factor; from .75 to .91 in the third factor; and, from .74 to .87 in the fourth factor. Findings showed that the scale, as in the original form, consisted of 24 items falling under four factors. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Second-Order Confirmatory Factor Analysis</head><p>As <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kline (2011)</ref> suggested, in order to test for whether the four factors are components of a higher latent structure (social justice behaviors), something which cannot be measured directly, the second order CFA was applied. The fit indices of the second order CFA were found to be similar to that of the first order CFA fit indices: χ 2 =671.64, df=248, χ 2 /df=2.70, GFI=.90, AGFI=.88, RMSEA=.05, NFI=.96, NNFI=.97, CFI=.97, SRMR=.04. When explained variances were examined, it was found that 45% of the variability of social justice behavior was expressed by social justice attitude factor; 49% by perceived behavioral control factor; 24% by subjective norms factor and 88% by behavioral intention factor. The factor loadings of the second order CFA were found to be the same as the first order CFA factor loadings (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). When the levels of factor effect on social justice behaviors are taken into consideration, it was specified that standardized direct effect size of the first factor was .67; of the second factor .70; of the third factor .49 and of the fourth factor .94. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kline (2011)</ref> determined standardized direct effect sizes as &lt;.10 small; about .30 medium and &gt;.50 large. Values found showed that factors significantly explained the latent variable of social justice behavior. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internal Consistency</head><p>The internal consistency coefficients of the scale in factors were found to fall between .84 and .92; in the total of the scale they were found to be .92. This finding showed that the internal consistency coefficients of the scale were high. Corrected item-total correlations in factors ranged from .55 to .82, and in total scale ranged from .41 to .73 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Correspondingly, t test fulfilled between the grades of lower 27% and upper 27% demonstrated that the difference between all items was significant p=.00, p&lt;.05. Findings suggested that items could differentiate the participants. Positive and significant relationships ranged from .26 to .61 in factors and from .61 to .85 in the total scale p=.00, p&lt;.01 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Correlation coefficients between factors indicated that factors measured different sub-dimension though they belonged to the same primary structure. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>External Consistency</head><p>In order to determine the external consistency of the scale, test-retest applications (N=31) were performed in four-week intervals. At the end of applications, correlation coefficients in items were found between . <ref type="bibr">70 and .91; in factors between .85 and .95; and,</ref> in the total of the scale they were found to be .95, p=.00, p&lt;.01 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). The results disclosed that the consistency between the two applications was at an adequate level, and the external consistency of the scale was obtained. Within the framework of the study's second aim, the effects of social justice attitudes, perceived behavioral control and subjective norms on behavioral intentions were analyzed through SEM (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Among the fit indices, the values of χ 2 =570.93, df=246, χ 2 /df=2.32, GFI=.90, AGFI=.87 showed that model data consistency was at an acceptable level; the values of RMSEA=.05, NFI=.95, NNFI=.97, CFI=.97, SRMR=.05 demonstrated a good fit. When standardized direct effect sizes were taken into consideration, it was noted that attitude (.35) and perceived behavioral control (.47) affected behavioral intention at a medium level; on the other hand, subjective norms (.11) affected behavioral intention at a low level. Analyzing the explained variances, attitudes, perceived behavioral control and subjective norms predicted 56% of the variance of behavioral intention. From the findings, it can be stated that the model was verified and the total effects of attitude, perceived behavioral control and subjective norms on behavioral intention were positive and significant. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Recommendations</head><p>The primary aim of this study was to adapt SJS, developed by Torres-Harding et al. ( <ref type="formula">2012</ref>), into Turkish. High consistency level between SJS' English and Turkish applications showed that the scale provided linguistic equivalence. At the end of the first order CFA, it was found that model data consistency was adequate and explained variances ranged from .29 to .83. From the findings, the Turkish form of the scale, similar to its original form, consists of 24 items grouped under four factors (social justice attitudes, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms and behavioral intentions). The fit indices gained from the second order CFA showed that factors explained the latent variable of social justice behavior significantly. Correlation coefficients between factors indicated that factors measured different sub-dimensions though they belonged to the same primary structure.</p><p>High internal consistency coefficients of the scale in factors and in the total of the scale indicated that the scale was reliable. Similarly, high levels of corrected itemtotal correlation and the difference between the lower 27% and the upper 27% being significant in all items displayed demonstrates that items can differentiate the participants. Correlation coefficients after the test-retest applications were at an acceptable level, which demonstrated that the external consistency of the scale was ensured. In conclusion, the data gained from the Turkish form of SJS exhibited adequate evidences in terms of validity and reliability.</p><p>The second aim of the study was to investigate the effects of "social justice attitudes," "perceived behavioral control" and "subjective norms" (independent variables) on "behavioral intentions" (dependent variable). After applying SEM, model data consistency proved to be adequate, and the effects of independent variables on the dependent variable were found to be positive and significant. It was determined that the independent variables explained 56% of the variance of the dependent variable. From the findings, it was concluded that the model was verified and prospective teachers' evaluation of social justice behaviors' convenience level, perception of social support or pressure from their environment in terms of acting behaviors or not, and their perception of self-efficacy with regard to difficulty level of the behavior all predicted their intention to implement the aforesaid behaviors in the future.</p><p>When interpreting the findings, some limitations should be taken into consideration. Firstly, the data was gained from prospective teachers attending three universities in Istanbul. With data which can be obtained from different in-service teachers and prospective teachers attending different universities, the reconstruction of the reliability and validity analysis could increase the generalizability of the scale. Therefore, the researchers can survey prospective teachers' views concerning social justice via longitudinal studies throughout their educational process, as well as views concerning their duties. Secondly, the scale's concurrent validity could not be analyzed. Concurrent validity of the scale can be examined through the scales related to social justice issues. Thirdly, prospective teachers' views about social justice were measured through SJS. However, their behaviors regarding social justice were not tested via this scale. It is thought that studying prospective teachers' behaviors by observing them, and in this way determining SJS' prediction level for these behaviors, is worth further investigation.</p><p>Outside of its limitations, this study has strengths, as well. In the literature, there is no Turkish scale to measure prospective teachers' views concerning social justice. </p></div>

Birinci düzey doğrulayıcı faktör analizi sonucunda uyum indekslerinden χ 2 =671.15, df=246, χ 2 /df=2.72, GFI=.90, AGFI=.88 değerleri kabul edilebilir düzeyde; RMSEA=.05, NFI=.96, NNFI=.97, CFI=.97, SRMR=.04 değerleri ise iyi düzeyde uyuma işaret etmiştir. Faktörlerin açıkladıkları varyanslar, .29 ile .83 arasında değişmiştir. İkinci düzey doğrulayıcı faktör analizi sonucunda saptanan uyum indeksleri ise şöyledir: χ 2 =671.64, df=248, χ 2 /df=2.70, GFI=.90, AGFI=.88, RMSEA=.05, NFI=.96, NNFI=.97, CFI=.97, SRMR=.04. Açıklanan varyanslar .24 ile .88 arasında değişmiştir. Ölçeğin iç tutarlık katsayıları faktörlerde .84 ile .92 arasında; toplam ölçekte ise .92 olarak bulunmuştur. Düzeltilmiş maddetoplam korelasyonları faktörlerde .55 ile .82; toplam ölçekte ise .41 ile .73 arasında değişmiştir. Bununla birlikte, t testi sonucunda tüm maddelerde farkın anlamlı olduğu görülmüştür p=.00, p&lt;.05. Ölçeğin dış tutarlığı için yapılan test-tekrar test sonucunda korelasyon katsayıları, maddelerde .70 ile .91; faktörlerde .85 ile .95 arasında; toplam ölçekte ise .95 olarak bulunmuştur p=.00, p&lt;.01. Araştırmanın ikinci amacı çerçevesinde, sosyal adaletle ilgili tutumların, algılanan davranış kontrolünün ve öznel normların, davranış eğilimleri üzerindeki etkileri incelenmiştir. Uyum indekslerinden, χ 2 =570.93, df=246, χ 2 /df=2.32, GFI=.90, AGFI=.87, değerleri model veri uyumunun kabul edilebilir düzeyde olduğuna; RMSEA=.05, NFI=.95, NNFI=.97, CFI=.97, SRMR=.05 değerleri ise uyumun iyi düzeyde olduğuna işaret etmiştir. Açıklanan varyanslar incelendiğinde, tutumun, algılanan davranış kontrolünün ve öznel normların birlikte davranış eğilimlerindeki varyansın yüzde 56'sını açıkladığı saptanmıştır.Araştırmanın Sonuçları ve Önerileri: Ölçeğin İngilizce ve Türkçe uygulamaları arasındaki tutarlığın yüksek olması dilsel eşdeğerliğinin sağlandığını göstermiştir. Birinci düzey doğrulayıcı faktör analizi sonucunda, model veri uyumunun yeterli düzeyde olduğu tespit edilmiştir. Ölçeğin Türkçe formunun, özgün ölçeğe benzer olarak, dört (sosyal adalete yönelik tutum, algılanan davranışsal kontrol, öznel normlar, davranışı sergileme eğilimi) faktör altında 24 maddeden oluştuğu saptanmıştır. İkinci düzey doğrulayıcı faktör analizi sonucunda elde edilen uyum indeksleri, faktörlerin, sosyal adalete yönelik davranış örtük değişkenini anlamlı biçimde açıkladığına işaret etmiştir. Ölçeğin iç tutarlık katsayılarının faktörlerde ve toplam ölçekte yüksek olması güvenilir bir ölçme aracının elde edildiğini göstermiştir. Düzeltilmiş madde-toplam korelasyonlarının yüksek olması ve alt %27 ve üst %27'lik grupların puanları arasındaki farkın anlamlı olması maddelerin puanlayıcıları ayırt edebildiğine işaret etmiştir. Test-tekrar test korelasyon katsayılarının kabul edilebilir düzeyde olması ölçeğin dış tutarlığının sağlandığını göstermiştir. Yapısal eşitlik modellemesi sonucunda sosyal adaletle ilgili tutumların, algılanan davranış kontrolünün ve öznel normların, davranış eğilimleri üzerindeki etkilerinin olumlu yönde ve anlamlı olduğu saptanmıştır. Alanda, öğretmen adaylarının sosyal adaletle ilgili düşünüşlerini ölçecek Türkçe ölçme aracı bulunmamaktadır. Bu nedenle, ölçeğin Türkçe formunun alandaki boşluğu dolduracağı düşünülmektedir. Araştırmacılar ve eğitimciler, ölçek aracılığıyla öğretmen adaylarının sosyal adalete ilişkin düşünüşlerini değerlendirerek uygun sosyal adalet eğitimleri düzenleyebilirler. Yapılacak araştırmalarda, farklı üniversitelerdeki öğretmen adaylarından ve görev başındaki öğretmenlerden elde edilecek verilerle geçerlik ve güvenirlik analizlerinin yeniden yapılmasının ölçeğin genellenebilirliğini artıracağı söylenebilir. Sosyal adalet konularıyla ilgili farklı ölçekler kullanılarak ölçeğin uyum geçerliği araştırılabilir.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Güvenirlik analizleri sonucunda, alfa katsayılarının faktörlerde .82 ile .95 arasında</cell></row><row><cell>değiştiği bulunmuştur.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>İlker Cırık</head><p>The Turkish form of SJS is thought to fill this deficiency in the field. Evaluating prospective teachers' views concerning social justice, researchers and educators can arrange convenient social justice educational environments. Researchers can study prospective teachers' opinions, especially those who have graduated from related fields, regarding social justice by analyzing social justice topics in the instructional curriculum. In this way, they may contribute to associated instructional curriculum with prospective teachers' social justice education. Researchers can evaluate the efficiency and productivity of learning environments which are arranged for prospective teachers' social justice education. Lastly, by using the Turkish and English forms of SJS, social justice views of prospective teachers who come from different cultures can be studied comparatively.</p></div>			</div>
