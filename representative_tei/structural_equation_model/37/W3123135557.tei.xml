<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With economic considerations exerting an ever-increasing influence on soccer club activities, fan satisfaction has become an essential focus for these organizations. Despite the obvious relevance of this topic, the literature has paid little attention to the measurement of fan satisfaction. Based on a thorough literature review and an empirical study of soccer fans, this paper outlines the development of a formative measurement index for fan satisfaction. Using data from a second soccer fan sample, the proposed fan satisfaction (FANSAT) index is assessed and applied to predict fan attendance. The results of a partial least squares structural equation modeling analysis imply that aspects of the stadium, club management, and the fan-based support for the club are the most important determinants of fan satisfaction and therefore affect their leisure experiences. The FANSAT index offers the marketing managers of soccer clubs guidance on measuring and improving their fans' leisure experiences. Further, from a methodological perspective, this paper illustrates the application of partial least squares structural equation modeling to develop a formative measurement approach within a leisure research context.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that the sporting industry is increasingly emphasizing the satisfaction of those fans who are interested in personalized experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Grove, Pickett, Jones, &amp; Dorsch, 2012)</ref>. Moreover, economic aspects increasingly influence the activities of sport organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Buhler, Heffernan, &amp; Hewson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Mason, 1999)</ref>: sport clubs no longer just compete on the sport field, but also for revenues from broadcasting and sponsoring rights, tickets, and merchandise. Running professional sporting clubs means managing corporate businesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Desbores, 2007)</ref> and creating memorable leisure experiences for fans. Therefore, "customer" (fan) satisfaction is of great importance to sport organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson, Fornell, &amp; Mazvancheryl, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson &amp; Mittal, 2000)</ref>. For example, the impact of fan satisfaction on favorable behaviors such as event attendance <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Matsuoka, Chelladurai, &amp; Harada, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Shonk &amp; Chelladurai, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Wakefield &amp; Blodgett, 1994)</ref>, intentions to return <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chang, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Theodorakis, Kambitsis, &amp; Laios, 1991)</ref> and loyalty to the sport club <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Theodorakis et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Trail, Anderson, &amp; Fink, 2005)</ref> are well-recognized. In addition to the direct revenue that sport clubs obtain through ticket sales, which is a major proportion of their revenues, fans also enable successful merchandising. Thus, an ability to understand and manage fan satisfaction is fundamental for creating valued leisure experiences.</p><p>Ultimately, it is fundamental for the financial success of any sport club, particularly since satisfaction has been identified as an important driver of stock returns (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Raithel, Sarstedt, Scharf, &amp; Schwaiger, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>A comprehensive understanding of sporting events as leisure experiences and of approaches to affect fan satisfaction should be based on knowledge of the key factors that contribute to satisfaction and, thus, the multitude of experiences associated with sporting events. More specifically, those managing sporting events cannot rely exclusively on aspects that are integral to the sport, but should also rely on those which, in principle, they can influence directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Trail et al., 2005)</ref>. Given the importance of this issue, the paucity and limitations of empirical research in this area, and the diversity of fan satisfaction components, this study makes several important contributions to the leisure literature.</p><p>First, we outline exploratory research undertaken to develop a measurement approach for fan satisfaction by specifying the relevant dimensions that constitute fan satisfaction in the context of soccer. Leaning on <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Woodruff, Cadotte, and Jenkins (1983)</ref>, as well as <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Homburg and Rudolph (2001)</ref>, we conceptualize fan satisfaction as a multi-attribute model. We assume that fans use a combinatory function to reach their overall satisfaction judgments; a process which is based on their evaluations of prior experiences with a sports club and on all aspects related to the service provided to date. We also argue that fan satisfaction judgments are derived through a multi-variable linear function (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kellar &amp; Preis, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Preis &amp; Kellar, 2003)</ref>. There is, however, no knowledge of a consistent set of dimensions that characterizes the experiences that comprise the fan satisfaction construct. Similarly, there is a lack of understanding of how such specific dimensions affect overall satisfaction. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bolton and Drew (1991)</ref> found that customers accord different weights to a service's core and facilitating aspects to evaluate their service satisfaction. Nevertheless, we develop and assess a measurement index for fan satisfaction (FANSAT) in the context of soccer events that is based on a large-scale dataset and by focusing on fans as a specific sub-group of customers who show increasing levels of involvement with the leisure experiences embedded in sporting events (as, for example, conceptually suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Sutton, McDonald, &amp; Milne, 1997)</ref>. The combination of our broader multi-attribute conceptualization and our empirical results provides a more nuanced understanding of the influence that potentially relevant dimensions have on overall fan satisfaction. We therefore extend existing research in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Yoshida &amp; James, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Second, this study makes an important contribution by explicitly considering the epistemic nature between the fan satisfaction construct and its measures, which is of fundamental importance when measuring complex phenomena with multi-item measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Diamantopoulos, Riefler, &amp; Roth, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Diamantopoulos &amp; Winklhofer, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Jarvis, MacKenzie, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003)</ref>. Prior studies in the field (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Greenwell, Fink, &amp; Pastore, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hill &amp; Green, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Yoshida &amp; James, 2010)</ref> univocally assume a reflective measurement model operationalization in which indicators are regarded as functions of the latent variable, whereby changes in the latent variable are reflected in changes in all the associated manifest variables. Conversely, formative indicators are assumed to "cause" a latent variable; that is, changes in the indicators evoke changes in the latent variable's value. It is crucial to consider the measurement perspective explicitly, since reflective and formative item purification guidelines use fundamentally different criteria to retain and exclude indicators. The latter generally encourages eliminating items with high inter-item correlations, while the former drops items with low inter-item correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Diamantopoulos et al., 2008)</ref>. In particular, the meaning of formative constructs can be substantially altered by applying reflective scale purification techniques and may ultimately lead to materially different multi-item measures in terms of content, parsimony, and criterion validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Diamantopoulos &amp; Siguaw, 2006)</ref>. Thus, the choice of measurement perspective is of fundamental importance when measuring constructs, which various studies show (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Diamantopoulos &amp; Siguaw, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Sarstedt &amp; Schloderer, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Past studies on fan satisfaction mostly do not explicitly consider this matter and treat formative constructs as reflective ones. For example, authors such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kennett, Sneath, and Henson (2001)</ref> and, more recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Yoshida and James (2010)</ref> set out to capture some elements of fan <ref type="bibr">(and spectator)</ref> satisfaction. They developed and tested valid measurement models for those elements. However, through the process these authors applied (e.g., examining the measures' internal consistency), they excluded items that did not measure what they intended to measure, although these are items potentially associated with other aspects of the fan experience. Furthermore, these aspects could be revealed in a more comprehensive multi-attribute conceptualization of the overall fan satisfaction.</p><p>The authors thus excluded items that could potentially have been formative measurement components of a model for measuring overall fan satisfaction. While the mentioned studies, and similar ones, are valid in that they measured what they intended to measure, they may not capture the multi-facetted nature of overall fan satisfaction. Against this background, this paper employs a formative measurement approach to overall fan satisfaction to assess the influence that various peripheral and core leisure elements (more specifically, the service quality dimensions) have on it.</p><p>We selected soccer as the fan context. Soccer is the world's most popular sport and a multibillion dollar industry. According to Joel Ewanick, the global marketing chief of General Motors, a major sponsor of soccer clubs worldwide, there are an estimated 3.5 billion soccer fans worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(AutomotiveNews, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Following a comprehensive review of the relevant literature to conceptualize the fan satisfaction construct, we discuss two empirical studies that allow for the iterative development and testing of our model of fan satisfaction. The first study develops and refines a comprehensive measurement approach for fan satisfaction by using data from a sample of soccer fans. The second study assesses the criterion validity of the index with regard to fan attendance. Through this approach, we take an important step towards developing a more comprehensive measurement model for overall fan satisfaction than any previously models. We argue that this approach is a basis on which to draw to develop satisfaction indices for different leisure contexts. In addition to the conceptual and applied methodological contributions, the FANSAT index offers managers of soccer clubs guidance on measuring and improving fan satisfaction. This study's findings can stimulate soccer club managers to assess the different drivers of fan satisfaction and allocate efforts accordingly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THEORETICAL BACKGROUND</head><p>Research on sports usually relates satisfaction to a single discrete transaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Marcum &amp; Greenstein, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Matsuoka et al., 2003)</ref>. While this practice appears feasible for ordinary fans with low identification levels, vested fans have higher levels of identification with, and emotional attachment to, a team <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Pons, Mourali, &amp; Nyeck, 2006)</ref>. Potentially they also maintain long-lasting relationships with a specific club, which <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Sutton et al. (1997)</ref> suggested conceptually. Consequently, it is more plausible to consider fan satisfaction as an overall evaluation of the leisure experience that the sport event organizer or club provides. Fan satisfaction is therefore based on the entire consumption experiences with the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gustafsson &amp; Johnson, 2004)</ref>. In general, leisure experiences are multi-dimensional <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kelly, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Tinsleya &amp; Tinsleya, 1986</ref>). These experiences with individual dimensions can differ: some of the dimensions may include satisfying experiences, while others may not <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Lee &amp; Datillo, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Accordingly, we incorporate a multi-dimensional conceptualization of overall fan satisfaction by constructing a multi-attribute model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Ringle, Sarstedt, &amp; Zimmermann, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Woodruff et al., 1983)</ref>. This conceptualization of fan satisfaction provides a basis to capture the notion that fans can simultaneously be satisfied or dissatisfied with one or more element(s) of their leisure experience. Furthermore, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Woodruff et al. (1983)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Crosby and Stephens (1987)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gudergan and Ellis (2007)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Homburg and Rudolph (2001)</ref>, in general, the multi-attribute nature of overall satisfaction and, as we argue, of overall fan satisfaction suggests that fans use a combinatory function. This combination is based on their evaluations of their satisfaction with aspects of the service to date, which allows them to reach their overall satisfaction judgments. Therefore, following the arguments put forward by <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Preis and Kellar (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kellar and Preis (2003)</ref>, we postulate that fans' judgments of their overall satisfaction are derived through a multi-variable linear function. Specifically, we specify our model of fan satisfaction as one in which satisfaction is a linearly additive function of the fans' experiences with all the service aspects and with each aspect weighted according to its importance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">LaTour &amp; Peat, 1979)</ref>. Thus, overall fan satisfaction is a cumulative judgment that is based on fan experiences over time, rather than on transaction-specific evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Johnson, Anderson, &amp; Fornell, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Johnson &amp; Fornell, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Oliver, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the significance of fan satisfaction, very few studies have examined its determinants more comprehensively <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Van Leeuwen, Quick, &amp; Daniel, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Yoshida &amp; James, 2010)</ref>. Instead, most studies focus on the isolated effects of fan satisfaction in that they neither capture a suitably exhaustive set of customer experiences, nor assess their relative importance in driving a fan's overall satisfaction. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Madrigal (2006)</ref> proposed the FANDIM scale to measure what sports fans take into consideration when engaging in such leisure experiences. The author specified two higherorder factors (autotelism, appreciation), of which the first comprises three unidimensional factorsfantasy, flow, and evaluation-and the second one consists of personalities, physical attractiveness, and aesthetics. Further, past research has investigated the role of specific sportscape factors, including the stadium layout, functionality, and aesthetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Greenwell et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Höck, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Wakefield, Blodgett, &amp; Sloan, 1996)</ref>. Other studies have evaluated the role of team characteristics, such as the number of star players <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baade &amp; Tiehen, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Schofield, 1983)</ref> or the team success <ref type="bibr">(Branvold, Pan, &amp; Gabert, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">DeSchriver, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Pan, Gabert, McGaugh, &amp; Branvold, 1997)</ref>. Yet other studies have examined aspects of competitor characteristics such as rivalry ranking <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Wall &amp; Myers, 1989</ref>) and the quality of the opponents <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Madrigal, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Marcum &amp; Greenstein, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Zhang et al., 1997)</ref>.</p><p>While these studies provide valuable insights into the effects of individual factors on fan satisfaction, only a few studies offer empirical assessment of the multitude of factors comprising fan satisfaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Madrigal (1995)</ref> provides empirical evidence of the influence of two affective components (enjoyment and basking in reflected glory) on fan satisfaction. Other researchers report that these affective components mediate the effects of various cognitive elements-such as the disconfirmation of expectations, as well as team identification and the quality of the opponent <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Martínez Caro &amp; Martínez García, 2007</ref>)-on satisfaction. While these results underline that leisure experiences generated by sporting events and fan satisfaction with corresponding experiences are based on cognitive and affective elements, they provide little guidance on what precisely has an effect on these two types of elements. Likewise, conceptual models for spectator satisfaction¾for instance, the sport spectator model <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Van Leeuwen et al., 2002)</ref>¾underline the importance of the core and peripheral dimensions of leisure experiences and spectators' identification with a club. To date, <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Yoshida and James (2010)</ref> have developed the most comprehensive framework for evaluating fan satisfaction. Their framework distinguishes between game and service satisfaction, but is limited to a subset of potential antecedent factors of overall fan satisfaction. We build on this research by assuming that a multitude of antecedent factors drive overall fan satisfaction and integrate this literature into a model which we examine empirically in two quantitative studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPROACH &amp; EMPIRICAL STUDIES</head><p>The approach employed in this research to develop a more comprehensive and valid measurement model for overall fan satisfaction entails identifying the multitude of components (or dimensions) that are accounted for within overall fan satisfaction judgments. Likewise, we need to develop the measurement scales that apply to the overall construct and its attributes which capture the dimensions that make up overall fan satisfaction. In addressing these two elements, we develop a measurement model for overall fan satisfaction, to which we will refer as the FANSAT index. This requires an explicit consideration of the epistemic nature of the relationship between the construct of overall fan satisfaction, its antecedent dimensions that measure satisfaction with aspects of the event experiences, and their respective measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gudergan, Ringle, Wende, &amp; Will, 2008)</ref>. After providing a synthesis of our review of the relevant literature on fan satisfaction, we use data from a sample of 251 soccer fans to examine a preliminary structure of the fan satisfaction antecedent dimensions in Study 1. Building on these findings, in Study 2, we use a large-scale sample of 600 fans to empirically estimate and test our proposed FANSAT index within the context of a selected German Premium Soccer League club. The results allow for assessing the predictive relevance and criterion validity of each of the sub-dimensions and their respective measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>In the first stage of operationalizing the fan satisfaction construct, we draw on a comprehensive synthesis of the literature to identify potential categories of drivers that act as antecedents of the overall fan satisfaction construct. The review includes studies that evaluate a range of factors assumed to influence fan satisfaction and attendance (TABLE <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>). Our review reveals that a multitude of aspects make up fan satisfaction judgments. These illustrative aspects of fan experiences with an event can be classified into seven broad categories that, in turn, contribute to making up overall fan satisfaction. TABLE 1 summarizes these seven categories, which relate to different service quality dimensions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Greenwell et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hill &amp; Green, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wakefield &amp; Blodgett, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Yoshida &amp; James, 2010)</ref> that capture fans' experience of the service environment (i.e., different stadium characteristics), as well as of the service personnel (e.g., stadium employees, players, or the coach).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE</head><p>Team-related antecedents: One of the most critical aspects that contribute to fan satisfaction is the sport event itself (i.e., the game), which is the core element of sport services and leisure experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Greenwell et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hill &amp; Green, 2000)</ref>. Successful team performance and game outcomes increase fan satisfaction and stimulate future attendance. For example, different facets of team performance-such as the current success (win or lose) and the quality of the team's playhave been shown to contribute significantly to the fans' satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Matsuoka et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>However, the core element of team success is unpredictable and beyond managerial control <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Yoshida &amp; James, 2010)</ref>. Therefore, prior research into sports service quality has focused on the ancillary elements of the leisure experience, such as the number of star players <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baade &amp; Tiehen, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Schofield, 1983)</ref> or the players' interaction with the fans <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Ko &amp; Pastore, 2004</ref>) and the coach <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Kwon, Trail, &amp; Anderson, 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Competitor characteristics:</head><p>Prior research studies evaluate aspects associated with the competing teams' performance. For example, in his seminal study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Madrigal Madrigal (1995)</ref> shows that the quality of the opponent has a positive effect on spectators-they can bask in reflected glory-and on their enjoyment. Conversely, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Marcum and Greenstein (1985)</ref> reveal that an opponent's past successes lead to lower game attendance. Hence, aspects that are linked to competing teams and the focal team's standing within a league are therefore likely to be taken into account when fans form their satisfaction judgments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sportscape characteristics:</head><p>Prior research has primarily focused on the role the sportscape plays in the fans' satisfaction with, and their willingness to attend, events. These studies rely primarily on <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bitner's (1992)</ref> conceptual framework of the servicescape environment, which suggests that positive evaluations of the service environment can improve customers' evaluations of their leisure experiences. When evaluating sportscapes, customers may rely on the physical environment as a tangible cue to the tangible and intangible aspects of the event and its supporting leisure elements. In the context of this study, such tangible evidence exerts an influence on fan satisfaction and behavior, since "the servicescape provides a visual metaphor for an organization's total offering" by suggesting "the potential usage and relative quality of the service" <ref type="bibr">(Bitner, 1992, p. 67)</ref>. Specific aspects relate to, for example, the cleanliness of the facilities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Höck et al., 2010)</ref>, the audio experience (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Uhrich &amp; Benkenstein, 2010)</ref>, the seating comfort (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Wakefield et al., 1996)</ref>, the parking facilities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kennett et al., 2001)</ref>, as well as the facility's design and layout (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Yoshida &amp; James, 2010)</ref>. Prior research suggests that all of these aspects exert a significant direct or indirect influence on spectator attendance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chang, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hill &amp; Green, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Wakefield &amp; Sloan, 1995b)</ref> and satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chang, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Höck et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Shonk &amp; Chelladurai, 2008)</ref>. Accordingly, we argue that when fans judge their overall satisfaction, they take aspects associated with the sportscape into consideration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stadium security:</head><p>The increase in the importance of security issues at major sport events has characterized the last decade. Event organizers place greater emphasis on effective risk management, but also ensure that the safety measures do not unduly deter spectators from enjoying the event, while these measures simultaneously meet the spectators' security expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Taylor &amp; Toohey, 2006)</ref>. Several studies provide evidence of the importance of security aspects in leisurerelated service encounters (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Wakefield et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Wakefield &amp; Sloan, 1995b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Yoshida &amp; James, 2010)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Höck et al. (2010)</ref> identify visitors' perceived security as a crucial element of the service delivery process in multi-purpose stadiums. Their analysis shows thattogether with the stadium atmosphere-stadium security has the strongest influence on visitor satisfaction. The security inside and outside the stadium, the presence and behavior of security personnel, and the perception of crowding are all aspects that comprise visitors' perceived security (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hill &amp; Green, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Wakefield &amp; Sloan, 1995b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Yoshida &amp; James, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Peripheral services: In a similar vein, researchers have examined the role peripheral services play in spectator attitudes and behaviors. Several studies show that aspects such as the quality and price of the merchandise <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kennett et al., 2001)</ref>, as well as of the food and beverages <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hill &amp; Green, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Höck et al., 2010)</ref>, influence fan satisfaction because they help create the total fan experience.</p><p>Likewise, favorable evaluations of the frontline service employees can positively influence customer evaluations of a leisure experience, regardless of the outcome of the experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bitner, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, ticket sellers, merchandisers, ushers, and concessionaries may also contribute to fans' evaluations of the leisure experience (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Höck et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kennett et al., 2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fan-based activities:</head><p>In addition to the importance of the peripheral services encountered during a stadium visit, previous research has underlined the importance of extraneous services which help maintain and strengthen the ties with fans. Such activities comprise, for example, the organization of excursions, or the offering of social events (e.g., meet and greet sessions) that are exclusively for members of the official fan club <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Blatter, Fritschi, &amp; Oberholzer, 2000)</ref>. However, such fan-based activities may also apply to a broader audience with lower levels of fan involvement. In this context, offering special events for families or open training sessions may significantly contribute to fan satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Armstrong, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Shank, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Club characteristics: Professional sports clubs pursue a multitude of goals to offer their members the best-possible service experience (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Grove et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Nagel (2008)</ref> finds that it is crucial for the club goals to correspond to the fans' expectations and interests, as this drives their commitment to the club. The author shows that the relevant elements in this context are, amongst others, the quality of the club (e.g., in terms of the quality of those organizing the club, the trainers, the board members, and of the youth work) and its sociability (e.g., with regard to maintaining the club's tradition and offering services beyond sports). In particular, the club's heritage and tradition are an important element <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abosag, Roper, &amp; Hind, 2012)</ref>. This categorization into seven factors differs from previous research's categorizations. For example, Yoshida and James (2010) apply a less granular categorization and distinguish between service satisfaction and game satisfaction factors. Basically, team-related and competitive-related antecedents involve game satisfaction drivers, while sport-scape-related and peripheral services satisfaction drivers involve service satisfaction drivers.</p><p>In addition to these seven categories of antecedents, researchers have also considered other categories of potential satisfaction drivers; these include, for example, tickets (e.g., their price and purchasing convenience) and team identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kennett et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Madrigal, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Trail et al., 2005)</ref>. Empirical evidence also indicates that team identification has a moderating effect on the relationship between the evaluation of a leisure experience and future attendance intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Theodorakis, Koustelios, Robinson, &amp; Barlas, 2009)</ref>. Hence, although most aspects can be classified into the antecedent categories described above, there are others that cannot. Furthermore, the set of aspects addressed in previous studies may not cover those that exhaustively make up overall fan satisfaction. At the same time, some previously considered aspects might only apply to a particular context and, hence, are not relevant for our research. Therefore, we did not initially engage in a confirmatory research setting by operationalizing each of the seven antecedent dimensions of fan satisfaction and testing their role in a nomological network. Instead, we used this categorization to guide an exploratory search for items that-in accordance with the formative measurement concept-capture all aspects related to the antecedent dimensions of fan satisfaction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ITEM GENERATION</head><p>Based on the previously identified set of antecedent dimensions of fan satisfaction (i.e., team, competitor, sportscape, peripheral services, stadium security, fan-based activities, and the club), we generated a pool of items to capture all aspects related to fan satisfaction. Specifically, we engaged in a two-step process in which we first compiled indicators from previous studies on the satisfaction of spectators and fans (as described in the literature review section). Next, we complemented this initial list by adding further items, capturing aspects that have thus far been neglected in previous empirical studies. In doing so, we drew on the input of soccer fans and a board member of a German Premium Soccer League club with more than 20 years' experience with marketing soccer. Their feedback was used to add, adapt, redraft, and re-structure various items. In a concluding pre-test stage, five individuals, who were not familiar with the details of the research project, assessed the clarity of the items. This assessment led to minor changes in the item wordings. This procedure generated a list of 108 items that relate to various aspects of soccer fan satisfaction (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">A2</ref> in the Appendix for the full list of items).</p><p>The next step involves creating categories of items with some similarity and which are possibly associated with a particular antecedent dimension of overall fan satisfaction but not with another one. Note that the set of antecedent dimensions leans on the preliminary set identified in the literature review, but not necessarily. To establish such a preliminary factor structure, we carried out an empirical study of soccer fans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DATA</head><p>To collect data from a wide sample of soccer fans, we invited members of various soccer internet fan forums not affiliated to any particular club to participate in our study. The questionnaire included a global overall fan satisfaction statement, the previously identified 108 items, and several demographic variables. The measurement of each item was based on a 7-point scale (ranging from "very dissatisfied"/"very low" to "very satisfied"/"very high"); an additional "don't know" option allowed respondents not to rate items <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Lietz, 2010)</ref>. A pre-test with 21 university students provided important information with which to assess issues concerning the questionnaire design and the time required to complete the survey (10-15 minutes). During the data collection phase, which took four weeks, a total of 495 individuals completed the online survey. However, some responses needed to be excluded from the analysis. First, we deleted outliers (i.e., those who only selected the best possible or only the worst answer for a particular soccer club). Second, the link to the survey was forwarded to and then appeared in several club-affiliated internet forums, which resulted in an overrepresentation of some clubs. To eliminate this bias, respondents from the overrepresented clubs were randomly removed to produce a more balanced club representation. Consequently, the preliminary empirical analysis and development of the model were based on the 251 remaining observations. Even though there is no publically available demographic information on soccer fans in Germany, the fan demographics of this sample (e.g., age and gender) were very similar to the fan data of a specific club to which we had access.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD</head><p>To establish a preliminary factor structure of the 108 items, we followed the steps that authors such as d <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">'Astous and Boujbel (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gao, Sirgy, and Johar (2010)</ref> suggested and ran a principal components analysis (PCA) on the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Mooi &amp; Sarstedt, 2011)</ref>. It is important to note that this procedure was only used to derive a preliminary factor structure. In carrying out the PCA, we do not assume that, nor do we test whether, the measurement models for the antecedent dimensions are reflective in nature. Indeed, our argument is that the antecedent dimensions are formative in nature, as we will argue theoretically and substantiate empirically in Study 2.</p><p>In formative measurement models, the indicators, as a group, jointly determine the conceptual and empirical meaning of the construct. Therefore, a census of indicators is (ideally) required to fully capture the meaning of a formatively measured construct; omitting relevant indicators is equivalent to restricting the domain of the construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(MacKenzie, Podsakoff, &amp; Jarvis, 2005)</ref>. As formative indicators do not necessarily correlate, standard scale purification procedures, which build on cross-item correlations, are not applicable <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Diamantopoulos &amp; Winklhofer, 2001)</ref>. In this context, <ref type="bibr">Jarvis et al. (2003, p. 202</ref>) point out that "following standard scale development procedures-for example dropping items that possess low item-to-total correlations-will remove precisely those items that would most alter the empirical meaning of the construct." Against this background, we do not further analyze the loadings of the items and do not consider reliability and validity criteria commonly applied in the context of reflective measures. Most importantly, we do not remove any items on empirical grounds (e.g., due to low communalities) in order to ensure that each antecedent dimension's content domain is fully captured. Rather, we used the resulting factor structure as a starting point for focus group discussions whose purpose was to reconsider the initial factor structure and re-arrange, if necessary, the items between the antecedent dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Running a PCA on the data yields a total of 20 factors with an eigenvalue greater than one.</p><p>Jointly, these factors explain 73.68% of the total variance ( The resulting factor structure was then subjected to a focus group discussion with three academics and two doctoral students. Prior to this discussion, the participants were shown the initial factor structure and asked to change it by reassigning items if they considered that certain items were conceptually more aligned with a different category of items and an associated antecedent dimension than another one (as the formative measurement mode would logically require). The participants were also asked to assign a name to each ensuing dimension. The group discussed the results, revealing a high degree of agreement on the nature of the underlying factors. For example, all the participants uniformly identified factors relating to the stadium, team, club management, and security. However, two empirical factors were ambiguously perceived. Therefore, the related items (e.g., waiting time outside the stadium, extent of the admission security, and the stadium's name)</p><p>were reassigned to other antecedent dimensions, which was justified by the content being better associated with these. To achieve model parsimony, those individual items that contributed very little to the content of and differentiation between the antecedent dimensions were excluded. After this stage of the analysis, the FANSAT index comprised 17 factors representing in total 99 items. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPLICATION AND EVALUATION OF THE FANSAT INDEX MODEL (STUDY 2)</head><p>In Study 1, we created 17 categories of items that have some similarity and are possibly associated with a particular antecedent dimension of overall fan satisfaction but not with another one. This set of categories potentially includes those antecedent dimensions that make up overall fan satisfaction. Notwithstanding the factor structure on which we have drawn to group the items, we neither theoretically nor empirically argue that the measurement mode is reflective. That is, although it is a necessary condition for reflective measurement models to demonstrate high degrees of internal consistency, this is not a necessary condition for measurement models with a formative mode; the latter, however, can display high factor loadings. In Study 2, we assess whether the 17 Acknowledging the limitations of single item measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Diamantopoulos, Sarstedt, Fuchs, Kaiser, &amp; Wilczynski, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Sarstedt &amp; Wilczynski, 2009)</ref>, we chose this approach nevertheless because such a single item allows respondents to simultaneously consider all those parts of the construct that they consider important (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Wanous, Reichers, &amp; Hudy, 1997)</ref>. Correspondingly, several researchers suggest using single items to validate formative measurement models in the course of a redundancy analysis (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Diamantopoulos &amp; Winklhofer, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hair, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In the structural model, overall fan satisfaction is conceptualized as having the 17 antecedent dimensions that Study 1 generated (TABLE <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">A3</ref> in the Appendix provides an overview of these antecedent dimensions and corresponding items). The measurement model for these antecedent dimensions, we argue, is formative (i.e., with a relationship from the item to its corresponding antecedent dimension). When reviewing the items for each of the antecedent dimensions, it becomes apparent that they fully meet the characteristic criteria for the formative measurement mode that <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Jarvis et al. (2003)</ref> suggest. For instance, each of the items is assumed to represent independent facets that determine their respective antecedent dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Diamantopoulos &amp; Winklhofer, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gudergan et al., 2008)</ref>. The statements that have been retained in Study 1 match this assumption.</p><p>That is, based on their content, they do not necessarily have to correlate (but can) as fans can experience different levels of satisfaction with respect to those items that have been classified together. For example, a fan can be satisfied with specific stadium-related aspects, such as the comfort of the seats or the video scoreboards, but not necessarily be satisfied with the condition of the restrooms or the signposts inside and outside the stadium. Statistically, high correlations between these indicators are not necessarily expected. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr">Chin's (1998, p. ix)</ref> guiding question "Is it necessarily true that if one of the items (…) were to suddenly change in a particular direction, the others will change in a similar manner?" can be answered with a resounding "no." This likewise implies a formative measurement model set-up. Lastly, from a conceptual perspective, measuring fan satisfaction formatively conforms to the multi-attribute nature of overall fan satisfaction. This suggests that fans use a combinatory function to reach their overall satisfaction judgments , which they base on their evaluations of their satisfaction with the aspects experienced <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(LaTour &amp; Peat, 1979)</ref>. The results of the confirmatory tetrad analysis further support these theoretical arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gudergan et al., 2008)</ref>, which empirically supports the formative measurement model set-up. The results will be presented later.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EMPIRICAL DATA</head><p>The main survey used to examine our model consists of three parts. It includes questions on demographic characteristics and fan-related aspects (e.g., fan club membership and average number of games visited per season), as well as the 99 items generated in Study 1. The questionnaire also contains items to capture overall fan satisfaction and a fan's intention to attend future games.</p><p>Following the pre-testing of our questionnaire, an online survey was carried out to collect responses from fans of a German Premier Soccer League club. The survey took place during the pre-season to minimize potential bias from recent match results.</p><p>Within two weeks, a total 1,054 fans agreed to participate in the online survey. Not only did we explicitly request that only fans of the particular club should participate in the survey, but we also asked specific questions (e.g., the number of stadium visits in the past twelve months) to assess whether the data was provided by 'true' fans. A notably high number of 623 fans returned their questionnaires (response rate: 59.11%), yielding 600 usable responses after excluding 23 incomplete questionnaires. In comparison with the fan database of a German Premier Soccer League club, our respondents show a typical fan structure demographic: for instance, 76% of respondents were male and 74% of them were between 18 and 50 years old. We examined the possibility of a non-response bias by comparing the first and last wave of respondents on all the examined variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Armstrong &amp; Overton, 1977)</ref>. There were no statistically significant differences (p &lt; 0.01), which implies that there is no systematic non-response bias that would affect our conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD</head><p>The application of SEM to our data allows for generating insights into the influence that our antecedent dimensions have on overall fan satisfaction. Amongst other criteria to select a suitable SEM method <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hair, Hult, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2013)</ref>, PLS-SEM is particularly appropriate when the research goal is prediction-oriented <ref type="bibr">(Henseler &amp; Sarstedt, 2013)</ref>, when formative measurement models are used <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hair, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2011)</ref>, and when the model is highly complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Reinartz, Haenlein, &amp; Henseler, 2009)</ref>. Since these arguments apply to our study, it is appropriate to use the PLS-SEM method to estimate the structural equation model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Our PLS path model estimation uses the statistical software application SmartPLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Ringle, Wende, &amp; Will, 2005)</ref>. The criteria and procedures proposed in the literature, for example, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Henseler et al. (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Hair, Sarstedt, Ringle, et al. (2012)</ref>, are included in the evaluation of the results. Prior to estimating whether our set of antecedent dimensions affects overall fan satisfaction, the measurement model for each of the constructs representing these antecedent dimensions needs to be assessed. Given the nature of the items representing the 17 potential antecedent dimensions that affect overall fan satisfaction, this study draws on formative measurement models (based and assessed on outer weights), which differ from reflective measurement models (based and assessed on outer loadings).</p><p>In an initial step, we evaluated indicator multicollinearity to assess our measurement models <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chin, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Henseler et al., 2009)</ref>. This analysis revealed that the highest variance inflation factor has a value of 3.46, which is well below the commonly suggested threshold of 5 in the context of PLS-SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hair, Hult, et al., 2013)</ref>. Hence, multicollinearity is relatively low and does not pose a problem in this study. We then applied the bootstrapping method <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref> to identify those items with weights that do not differ significantly from zero, and could thus be potentially omitted (i.e., they do not significantly affect the antecedent factor and, accordingly, can be considered for removal to refine the measurement model). The parameter settings in our study include 600 cases per sample, no sign changes, and a total of 5,000 samples. The analysis showed that 41 items do not exert a significant influence on their corresponding construct (p &lt; 0.10) (TABLE <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">A3</ref> in the Appendix provides an overview of the analysis results). Formative indicators constitute distinct facets of a construct and do not represent a homogeneous sample from the item universe¾as the domain-sampling approach would suggest, which is only relevant for reflective items.</p><p>Consequently, formative items often have low weights, especially in complex models <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chin, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hair, Hult, et al., 2013)</ref>, which also applies to this research. To ensure a parsimonious measurement of overall fan satisfaction in a soccer context, we decided to omit non-significant items in the course of the model refinement. It is important to note that this reduction in model complexity does not yield significant changes in the structural model. All path coefficients and the R² value of the endogenous construct remain at the same level when rounded to a hundredth.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> illustrates the results with the standardized path coefficients, the corresponding t-values (in brackets), and the final model's R² value. The model explains about 50% of the endogenous latent construct's (overall fan satisfaction) variance which is a reasonable proportion of variance explained <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>. On the other hand, 50% remain unexplained, which is likely due to performance aspects beyond managerial control (e.g., perceptions of team performance). The computation of the Stone-Geisser criterion, which draws on the blindfolding procedure to compute cross-validated redundancies <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Henseler et al., 2009)</ref>, yields a Q² value of 0.31, underlining the model's predictive relevance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE</head><p>An analysis of the standardized inner model path coefficients shows that fan satisfaction with the stadium exerts the strongest influence on overall fan satisfaction (path coefficient: 0.23).</p><p>Satisfaction with the team, club management, and the club's fan-based support, which have lower path coefficients (ranging between 0.13 and 0.16), follow. The atmosphere experienced during the visit to the stadium (path coefficient: 0.08) and the website (path coefficient: 0.06) are significant but less important antecedent dimensions. The negative coefficient concerning entertainment in the stadium seems implausible at first glance. However, a possible explanation for this phenomenon could be that fans regard the accompanying program, such as the half-time entertainment show, in a generally positive light, but are fixated on the game and therefore find an extensive entertainment program distracting, or are simply indifferent to it. In addition to the relative importance of significant antecedent factors in explaining overall fan satisfaction, the PLS-SEM analysis reveals numerous factors that are not relevant. For example, accessibility by car and public transport, entrance fees, merchandise, and the team's coach do not significantly affect overall fan satisfaction.</p><p>In the next stage of our analysis, we focus on examining the criterion validity for our measurement model. In the context of overall fan satisfaction, attendance behavior can serve as a meaningful criterion variable (i.e., satisfaction with the leisure experience will likely have an influence on intentions to attend such leisure events again), as supported in various previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Laverie &amp; Arnett, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Murray &amp; Howat, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Shonk &amp; Chelladurai, 2008)</ref>. We examine this by establishing a separate path model with the fans' intention to attend future games as a criterion variable (i.e., instead of overall fan satisfaction, fans' intention to attend future games is the dependent variable in the PLS path model). The analysis reveals an R² value of 0.36, indicating that antecedent fan satisfaction dimensions are moderate predictors of a fan's intention to attend future games. The Q² value of 0.25, which indicates a sufficient degree of predictive relevance concerning the criterion variable's antecedent factors, supports this notion <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>. Consistent with prior research and theory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Laverie &amp; Arnett, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Murray &amp; Howat, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Shonk &amp; Chelladurai, 2008)</ref>, the empirical results confirm that overall fan satisfaction is a predictor of intention to attend future games. TABLE <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref> summarizes the PLS-SEM results with regard to overall fan satisfaction and fan attendance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE</head><p>In a final step, following authors such as Hair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hair et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hair, Ringle, et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hair, Sarstedt, Ringle, et al., 2012)</ref>, we empirically tested the formative mode of measurement. We therefore applied the confirmatory tetrad analysis (CTA-PLS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gudergan et al., 2008)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE</head><p>This study contributes to the leisure literature by examining the antecedents of satisfaction with the sports event experience in two important ways. Conceptually, this study extends existing research in this area (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Laverie &amp; Arnett, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Madrigal, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Matsuoka et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wakefield et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Wakefield &amp; Sloan, 1995a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Yoshida &amp; James, 2010)</ref> by providing a broad multi-attribute conceptualization of satisfaction with sport events in general and of soccer fan satisfaction in particular. This enables researches and practitioners to develop a more nuanced understanding of the influence that potentially relevant dimensions have on overall fan satisfaction.</p><p>Methodologically, and unlike prior studies in the field (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Greenwell et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hill &amp; Green, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Yoshida &amp; James, 2010)</ref>, this study explicitly considers the epistemic nature between the overall fan satisfaction construct and its antecedent dimensions. This is of fundamental importance for measuring and managing complex phenomena with multi-item measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Diamantopoulos et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Diamantopoulos &amp; Winklhofer, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Jarvis et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, we find that, primarily, satisfaction with the club stadium affects fan satisfaction.</p><p>This result underlines the sportscape's role in fan satisfaction and behavior, which has been subject</p><p>to considerable research over the past few years <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chang, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Greenwell et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Höck et al., 2010)</ref>. Likewise, the fans' satisfaction with the team-specifically the players' identification with the club and the quality of the team composition-plays a vital role with regard to overall fan satisfaction. The club management and the fan-based support, which prior research has not explicitly considered, are also of significant importance.</p><p>While the team and club characteristics, as well as the game itself are core elements of fan experiences (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Mullin, Hardy, &amp; Sutton, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Van Leeuwen et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Yoshida &amp; James, 2010)</ref>, venue-specific factors and fan-based support belong to the peripheral elements. These results further differentiate <ref type="bibr">Harris and Ogbonna's (2008, p. 396</ref>) findings, which suggest that "soccer fans derive a key aspect of their experience and satisfaction from the team itself [i.e., core aspect] rather than from external sources [i.e., peripheral aspects]." The present study shows that this notion holds for many of the peripheral leisure elements studied here (e.g., merchandise, office, accessibility by car and public transportation), with the exception of fan-based support and especially the sportscape, which adds considerably to the leisure experience of soccer fans.</p><p>For example, the German soccer club Bayern Munich increased its average game attendance in terms of the stadium capacity utilization from about 84% to 100%, although there has been little change in the team success through the years (ESPNFC, 2013). In the 2005/06 season, the club moved from the old Olympic Stadium to the new Allianz Arena. Many soccer fans refrained from visiting the old Olympic Stadium because it does not have a full roof, is therefore very cold in winter, and its entertainment facilities lack impact due to the distance between the spectators and the pitch. The new Allianz Arena comes is very close to the spectators' conception of an ideal soccer stadium.</p><p>Other authors have also stressed the importance of such peripheral (non-game) aspects (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Tomlinson, Buttle, &amp; Moores, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Wakefield &amp; Blodgett, 1994)</ref>. They have found that venuespecific peripheral aspects influence satisfaction. By focusing on the core and peripheral leisure elements that have a significant impact, this study proposes a model that achieves a suitable model fit comparable, if not better, than those reported in previous studies in this domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Greenwell, Fink, &amp; Pastore, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Matsuoka et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, some satisfaction drivers which seem to be conceptually very important-security aspects, entrance fees, or the accessibility of stadium-do not impact the overall fan satisfaction significantly. This seems counterintuitive but does not necessarily imply that these satisfaction drivers are unimportant in general. Rather, this finding is in line with dual-factor motivation theories that classify individual needs broadly into two categories: basic, lower-order, or hygiene needs and growth, higher-order, or motivator needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Herzberg, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Wolf, 1970)</ref>. Improving the performance of hygiene fulfillment beyond the minimum expected threshold does not have an incremental impact on overall satisfaction. For example, as long as spectators feel safe while attending the game, increasing the number of cameras or police officers will not change this feeling and, thus, not improve their satisfaction).</p><p>However, improving motivator needs, like the atmosphere and team performance, does affect overall fan satisfaction as long as basic needs are fulfilled. Since the soccer club in this study fulfills their basic needs, the motivator needs have a non-significant impact on overall fan satisfaction.</p><p>Replicating this study by using data from other soccer clubs or other countries where some of these basic needs might not be fulfilled-for example, compared to Germany, soccer fans in the UK regularly complain about tickets being too expensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Connor, 2013)</ref> and Italian soccer is plagued by violence inside and outside stadiums, which drives ordinary soccer fans away <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Molinaro &amp; Doyle, 2013</ref>)-could yield different results. Hence, in line with the logic that underpins formative measurement approaches, we do not recommend that managers necessarily neglect the drivers that our study identified as having no significant impact on overall satisfaction, unless replications in different contexts verify our findings consistently. This implies, sports event managers should measure all seven dimensions and focus on those that have a significant impact on overall satisfaction in their specific context.</p><p>In summary, the FANSAT measurement index provides soccer event operators with the information needed to more effectively measure and manage overall fan satisfaction, a key area of concern to affect profitability and the long-term success of an increasingly competitive multi-million dollar business. The proposed FANSAT measurement index, with the associated development approach, may be a basis on which to develop similar models that could apply to other sports-based leisure experiences (e.g., baseball, cricket, ice hockey, football, and ruby). Such models could fine tune the measurement and improvement of fans satisfaction in those contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH</head><p>Although this study reveals the antecedent dimensions of overall fan satisfaction and underlines the importance of the sportscape, team, and club management, 50% of overall fan satisfaction remains unexplained. This is evidence of the potential relevance of situational factors, or other factors that this study might have overlooked. Future research could therefore expand the FANSAT measurement index by including further aspects of fan satisfaction such as enjoyment or basking in reflected glory.</p><p>An analysis of how groups of heterogeneous fans perceive the various antecedent dimensions of overall fan satisfaction differently offers an additional opportunity for further research. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Harris and Ogbonna (2008)</ref> categorize fans into seven categories (armchair supporters, social fans, old-timers, leisure switchers, anti-fans, club-connected supporters, and die-hard fanatics) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Pons et al. (2006)</ref> identify four clusters (social fan, super fan, experiential fan, and fan by default), each with different relational ties with their team and different orientation towards sporting events. Specifically, a comparison of club-connected supporters and die-hard fanatics, whose similarities <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Harris and Ogbonna (2008)</ref> have highlighted, could be promising to evaluate whether strong relationships translate into similar effects concerning the role of antecedent dimensions in explaining overall fan satisfaction.</p><p>When using the FANSAT index to predict, for example, fan attendance, future research could also consider unobserved heterogeneity, which observable traits cannot accounted for <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Sarstedt, Henseler, &amp; Ringle, 2011)</ref>. Past research has shown that considering unobserved heterogeneity is of utmost importance when estimating complex path models. This is especially true in the context of satisfaction research <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Rigdon, Ringle, Sarstedt, &amp; Gudergan, 2011)</ref> as significantly different effects in latent groups of respondents become confounded when the model is estimated at the aggregate data level (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Rigdon, Ringle, &amp; Sarstedt, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Sarstedt, 2008)</ref>. PLS-SEM offers the necessary complementary techniques to consider heterogeneity, for example, by means of the finite mixture PLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Ringle, Sarstedt, &amp; Mooi, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Sarstedt, Becker, Ringle, &amp; Schwaiger, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sarstedt &amp; Ringle, 2010)</ref>, PLS prediction-oriented segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Becker, Rai, Ringle, &amp; Völckner, 2013)</ref>, or PLS genetic algorithm segmentation approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Ringle, Sarstedt, &amp; Schlittgen, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Ringle, Sarstedt, Schlittgen, &amp; Taylor, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>We used single-item scales for our 'global fan satisfaction judgment' and 'a fan's intention to attend future events' constructs. Authors such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Wanous et al. (1997)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Drolet and Morrison (2001)</ref>,</p><p>and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bergkvist and Rossiter (2007)</ref> argue and find single-measure items in general agreement with multiple-measure items. However, other authors, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bollen (1989)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Sarstedt and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Wilczynski (2009), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Yang, Watkins, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Marsick (2004)</ref>, raise questions regarding the use of single-item scales. In this research context, future studies could explore this dilemma by drawing on the criteria that <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Diamantopoulos et al. (2012)</ref> suggested for deciding between multiple-and single-item scales.</p><p>Such studies may endeavor to develop a complementary multiple-item scale to measure fan satisfaction summatively.</p><p>Furthermore, our results only apply to German soccer fans and their satisfaction with event experiences. Future research should include different countries since cultural differences may matter, as prior research has suggested. For example, Yoshida and James (2010) find that satisfaction with peripheral aspects is more important for Japanese spectators than for US spectators.</p><p>Finally, future research could focus on the potential non-linear impact of satisfaction drivers and examine which dimension could be classified into basic, lower-order, or hygiene factors and growth, higher-order or motivator factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Herzberg, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Wolf, 1970)</ref>. This would enable managers to define the minimum expected performance threshold for hygiene factors. By not improving these factors beyond this minimum threshold, managers can use the extra resources to drive motivator factors that have a higher impact on relevant outcomes like overall fan satisfaction and a fan's likelihood of attending a game.</p><p>In conclusion, this study extends research on the relevance and relative influence of the antecedent dimensions of overall fan satisfaction. Our exploratory results provide a basis on which researchers and practitioners can draw to deepen their understanding of how overall fan satisfaction in particular and sports event satisfaction in general are formed. Given the operationalization of our FANSAT measurement index for soccer fans, adapting this model to other sports events in particular and to other leisure events like concerts seems promising to develop a more general leisure event satisfaction index. </p></div>

If at least one of the non-redundant model-implied vanishing tetrads of a measurement model with at least four indicators is significantly different from zero, we reject the null hypothesis (i.e., reflective measurement model) and accept the alternative measurement model (i.e., formative measurement model). All antecedent dimensions with four and more indicators meet the requirement of this analysis by having at least one non-redundant model-implied vanishing tetrad that differs significantly from zero. This result gives additional empirical justification for the a-priori assumed formative measurement model mode for the fan satisfaction antecedent factors.DISCUSSIONThis paper describes the exploratory development of the FANSAT index aimed at measuring and explaining overall soccer fan satisfaction. A comprehensive synthesis of the literature and an initial empirical study (Study 1) contribute to establishing a preliminary factor structure. The PLS-SEM analysis, which draws on data from a second large-scale empirical survey, yields additional insights into the relevant antecedent dimensions of overall fan satisfaction, as well as into behavioral outcomes such as intention to attend a game (Study 2).</figDesc></figure>
