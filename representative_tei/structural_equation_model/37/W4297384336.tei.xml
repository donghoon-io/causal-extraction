			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background With the advent of an aging society and the increase in chronic diseases, the role of primary health care has become increasingly important, and it has become increasingly reliant on collaboration among interprofessional people. In this interprofessional cooperation team, the role of community nurses is crucial, even dominant, so the post competence of community nurses deserves our attention. In addition, organizational career management can affect nurses in some way. The study is to study the current situation and relationship among organizational career management, interprofessional team collaboration, and post-competency of community nurses. Methods Questionnaire surveys were conducted among 530 nurses in 28 community medical institutions. Descriptive analysis was used for analysis and structural equation model was used to hypothesize and verify the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Compared with other dimensions of nurses' post competency, ensuring quality and helping roles scored the lowest. The teaching-coaching and diagnosis function played a mediating role. Nurses with longer seniority or were transferred to administrative departments had lower scores and the difference was statistically signi cant (p&lt;0.05). In the structural equation model, CFI=0.992, RMSEA=0.049, which shows that the model t well, suggests that organizational career management had no statistically signi cant effect on post competency (β=-0.006, p=0.932), but interprofessional team collaboration had a statistically signi cant effect on post competency (β=1.146, p&lt;0.001), and organizational career management had a statistically signi cant effect on interprofessional team collaboration (β=0.684, p&lt;0.001).</p><p>Conclusions Attention should be given to improvement of community nurses' post competence in ensuring quality ,helping roles, teaching-coaching and diagnosis function. Moreover ,we should focus on the decline of community nurses' ability with longer seniority or in administrative departments.The structural equation model shows that interprofessional team collaboration is complete intermediary between organizational career management and post competency.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The aging population, chronic disease prevalence, popularity of COVID, and nancial restructuring have increased people's demand for health services, showing multilevel and diversi ed characteristics <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. Nurses, as the core force in the eld of primary health care, need to have su cient ability to cope with the increasingly complex and onerous nursing work to meet people's health needs <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Research shows that post-competence (PC) is the core embodiment of nurses' ability and the basic guarantee of providing high-quality nursing service <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, which is closely related to the quality of medical care, nurses' work e ciency, and people's satisfaction. It is also the ability that nursing education should focus on <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Another study de nes post competency as a series of personality characteristics that can distinguish between excellent performance and ordinary performance in a workplace, which is composed of knowledge, skills, values, and so on <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>.Post Competence of nurses refers to the sum of personal characteristics, knowledge, and skills that nurses can be competent for their work and produce excellent job performance in medical care.</p><p>In modern health care system, the provision of medical services has changed from independent practice to cross-disciplinary team-based approach, which involves multiple professionals with different educational backgrounds, training and professional knowledge with a common goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Lack of collaboration among health professionals will greatly increase possibility of providing the wrong health care, drug error-related deaths, surgery at the wrong site and increased staff turnover in a complex medical environment <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. The task of improving interprofessional team collaboration has received considerable attention, as it is a key factor in improving the e ciency of medical care <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Interprofessional team collaboration (ITC) refers to a cooperation mode in which two or more medical professionals and their clients participate, cooperate, coordinate and make common decisions on health and social issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Interprofessional team collaboration is considered to be a cost-effective method of medical practice to address this situation, and its importance has been recognized by various organizations and individuals. However, in clinical practice, due to certain communication problems among medical staff, differences in the sense of cooperation, change of partners, unfamiliarity with each other's abilities, and other reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, interprofessional team collaboration cannot achieve the ideal state and is thus unable to provide perfect medical services.</p><p>It is very important to understand the impact of hospital organizational factors and the nursing delivery process on medical safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Organizational career management (OCM) refers to a series of management methods implemented by the organization that aim to develop the potential of employees, retain employees, and enable employees to realize themselves. Career management research has obtained some valuable results <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. L Long, L Fang and W Ling <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> stated that if an organization attaches importance to employees' career management, it can not only fully develop employees' human resources to improve their quality but also keep these trained employees in the organization and actively contribute to the development of the organization to achieve a win-win goal. This shows that organizational career management is of great signi cance to personal ability development. Therefore, organizational career management may affect the post competence of community nurses.</p><p>A literature review showed that the research objects related to nurses' post competence are relatively important department nurses (operating room, emergency, pediatrics, etc.), junior nurses and nursing students in large general hospitals <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Research reports on the status quo of post competency of community nurses engaged in primary health care are relatively rare. However, the role of community nurses in health care cannot be underestimated. Moreover, the interprofessional team collaboration ability of nurses is very important to the quality of the primary health care services they provide <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In addition, organizational career management provided by community medical institutions may affect their post competence through community nurses' psychology and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to use a structural equation model(SEM) to assume and verify the relationship among organizational career management, interprofessional team collaboration, and post competency and to analyse the in uencing factors so that we can put forward corresponding intervention measures to improve primary health care.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis model</head><p>In this paper, we mainly explore the impact of organizational career management and interprofessional team collaboration ability on the post competency of community nurses. The hypothetical model we set up is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, and we made the following hypothesis: H1: The organizational career management of community nurses is positively correlated with their post competency. H2: The interprofessional team collaboration ability of community nurses is positively correlated with their post competency. H3: The organizational career management of community nurses is positively correlated with their interprofessional team collaboration ability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research design and participants</head><p>We designed questionnaires aimed at interprofessional team cooperation ability, organizational career management and post competency of community nurses, investigated community nurses in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, and collected 530 valid questionnaires. More speci c characteristics of the nurses we investigated can be seen in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research instruments</head><p>We designed a questionnaire to investigate community nurses. The questionnaire we designed includes four parts. The rst part is the basic information of community nurses, and the second part is the nurse post competency scale. The third part is the scale of interprofessional team collaboration, and the fourth part is the scale of organizational career management. The rst part of the questionnaire mainly collected the basic information of the respondents, such as gender, professional title, education background, working years, working organization and working department. This part of the data can provide feedback on the basic data distribution and survey scope of respondents.</p><p>Our investigation and evaluation of the competency of community nurses mainly referred to the nurse competence scale proposed by researchers[26], and we translated the scale into Chinese and made cross-cultural adjustments to meet the competency requirements of Chinese nurses. In this part, we mainly asked community nurses to make a real evaluation of their behavior in daily nursing practice, with a score of 0 to 100 points for each item. In addition, according to the actual situation, we evaluated the frequency of clinical practice activities, which was divided into four grades: never, rarely, occasionally and often. We quanti ed the competency of community nurses in seven aspects: helping role, teaching coaching, diagnostic function, management function, therapeutic intervention, ensuring quality and work role. The helping role mainly refers to nurses specifying nursing plans according to people's needs, supporting their strategies, helping them adapt to the environment and making nursing decisions in accordance with professional ethical codes. Teaching-coaching means that nurses can carefully analyse the needs of people, plan rehabilitation education activities, guide nursing students and take measures to maintain and improve their professional skills. The diagnostic function means that nurses can analyse people's health status from multiple perspectives, such as physiology, psychology, and society, and guide other nurses to observe illness and use equipment. Management functions refer to the ability of nurses to identify and deal with situations that pose a threat to people at an early stage, to respond to changes in clinical situations and to keep equipment running.</p><p>Therapeutic intervention refers to the ability of nurses to exibly designate nursing activity plans according to speci c clinical conditions and to support and promote the development of clinical pathways. Ensuring quality means that nurses can abide by nursing concepts, continuously improve nursing quality, and systematically evaluate satisfaction with nursing. The work role refers to the ability of nurses to identify the support and help they need at the same time, to be familiar with the division of responsibilities and writing of nursing work and to ensure the smooth progress of the work.</p><p>Regarding the assessment of the interprofessional team collaboration ability of community nurses, we refer to the Interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale proposed by researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and the Chinese translation of the scale <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. The questions in this part describe the direct collaboration between nurses and colleagues of different professions, such as doctors, in their daily work. The questions with a total of 23 items are divided into three parts, namely, partnership, team cooperation and team coordination, each of which uses the Likert 5-point scoring method. A scale of 1 to 5 means never, rarely, sometimes, often, and always. Partnerships involve team members maintaining communication, discussions, and adjusting treatment and care plans with people and their family, and all team members are involved in treatment and goal setting. Team cooperation values team members' rights sharing, mutual respect and trust. Team coordination includes the ability to adjust team leaders as people need change, team members to recognize and implement treatment and care con ict resolution processes, and so on.</p><p>Based on the research of Long <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we constructed a community nurse organizational career management scale, which re ected the organizational career management of community nurses from four parts: professional self-perception, paying attention to cultivate, providing information and fair promotion. Each item is assessed on a 4-level Likert score, where 1-4 indicate very disagree, less agree, somewhat agree, and very agree, respectively. Among them, professional self-perception includes activities organized by the organization to understand its own professional characteristics, the organization has planned to change jobs and provide performance feedback, and the organization helps to plan and choose a career development path. Paying attention to cultivate includes reimbursement of academic education funds by the organization, conducted training, provided learning conditions and materials, and estimated onthe-job training. The providing information includes the promotion route information, job vacancy information, job quali cation information and guidance work provided by the organization. Fair promotion includes promoting the organization according to personal ability and work performance, and the competitive environment is fair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection and analysis</head><p>We designed online questionnaires about community nurses' post competency, interprofessional team collaboration and organizational career management and distributed links to community nurses in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China. The questionnaire used in this study has 14 dimensions, so the sample size was calculated using the dimensions of the scale. The sample size = [Max (number of dimensions) x 20] x (1 + 15%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and the sample size should be no less than 322.We collected a total of 530 valid questionnaires from 28 community medical institutions during the period from November 2021 to April 2022. Inclusion criteria: Registered nurses who have worked in community medical institutions for more than 1 year and volunteered to participate in this study. Exclusion criteria: Staff who did not willing to participate in this study were not included in this study. In order to reduce the bias, the study adopted the Doubleblind method for both the persons who issued the questionnaires and the persons who lled in the questionnaires.</p><p>We conducted statistical comparisons and Bonferroni tests on the post competence, interprofessional team collaboration and organizational career management scores of 530 community nurses under different demographic characteristics. The details are shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>In this study, we used IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and AMOS (Analysis of Moment Structure)version of 28 to perform statistical analysis and structural equation modelling analysis on the collected data. The mean, standard deviation, etc., are used to describe the demographic characteristics of the data. The correlations among organizational career management, interprofessional team collaboration ability and the post competency of community nurses are analysed using covariance-based structural equation modelling. We employ maximum likelihood estimation and path analysis to determine their relationship. We use the ratio of chi-square degrees of freedom, root mean square residual (RMR), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative t index (CFI), goodness-of-t index (GFI), normed t index (NFI) and other indicators to evaluate the t of the model. In general, we believe that the model t is better and the analysis results can be accepted in the following cases. For example, the ratio of chi-square degrees of freedom is between 1 and 3, both RMR and RMSEA are less than 0.5, and GFI, CFI, and NFI are greater than 0.9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variable and descriptive statistics</head><p>According to the questionnaire design, we set interprofessional team collaboration, organizational career management and post competency as the latent variables of the study. Helping role, teaching coaching, diagnosis function, management function, therapeutic intervention, ensuring quality and work role are the observed variables of post competency. Partnership, team cooperation and team coordination are the observation variables corresponding to interprofessional team collaboration. Professional self-perception, paying attention to cultivate, providing information and fair promotion are the observed variables corresponding to organizational career management.</p><p>Since the score index calculation of each part of the questionnaire was inconsistent, we calculated the mean value of the items completed by community nurses under each observation variable and normalized the data. Then, we calculate the correlation between the observed variables, and the correlation matrix is shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. We nd that teaching-coaching and diagnostic functions, diagnostic functions and self-professional cognition, partnership and team coordination, and team cooperation and team coordination all have strong correlations. The correlations between helping roles and work roles, ensuring quality, therapeutic intervention, and management functions are weaker.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement model</head><p>We perform factor analysis on the variables in the measurement model. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value obtained by the KMO and Bartlett sphericity tests is 0.93, and the signi cance of the Bartlett sphericity test is less than 0.001, indicating that our data are suitable for factor analysis. The speci c analysis results are shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. The factor loadings of the observed variables we calculated ranged from 0.767 to 0.928, all of which were greater than 0.7, showing statistical signi cance. In addition, we also carry out factor rotation analysis of the maximum variance method. After shielding the value less than 0.5, we nd that the observed variables can just be divided into three groups corresponding to the latent variables, which veri es the feasibility of the measurement model established by us.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parameter estimation and result analysis</head><p>We build the structural equation model based on the hypothesis model and use Amos for veri cation analysis. In addition, we also modify the relationship between model observation variables and residual errors based on tting results and model modi cation suggestions, and the model tting index results are shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. The ratio of the chi-square to the degrees of freedom of model tting is 2.28, the RMSEA value is 0.049, and the CFI value is 0.992( Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>These tting coe cient values indicate that the model built by us has good tting performance and can accurately re ect the relationship between variables explored to a certain extent.</head><p>Amos is used to t the structural equation model, and the results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. We nd that the organizational career management of community nurses has no statistically signi cant effect on post competency (β =-0.006, p = 0.932), so H1 is rejected. However, the interprofessional team collaboration ability of community nurses has a statistically signi cant and positive effect on their post competency (β = 1.146, p &lt; 0.001), so we accept H2. Moreover, organizational career management among community nurses has a statistically signi cant impact on interprofessional team collaboration, and community nurses' organizational career management has a positive effect on their interprofessional team collaboration behavior (β = 0.684, p &lt; 0.001), so we accept H3. Therefore, we can also judge that community nurses' interprofessional team collaboration ability has a complete mediating effect between organizational career management ability and post competency. In addition, we also found that the helping role has a positive and signi cant impact on teaching coaching (β = 0.452, p &lt; 0.001), teaching coaching on the diagnosis function (β = 0.577, p &lt; 0.001), and the diagnosis function on the management function (β = 0.455, p &lt; 0.001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The scores of community nurses' PC in this study were as follows: management function (85.28 ± 16.25), work role (84.28 ± 16.09), diagnosis function (83.15 ± 17.14), teaching-coaching (83.02 ± 16.72), therapeutic intervention (82.65 ± 17.99), ensuring quality (82.19 ± 18.50) and helping role (79.95 ± 17.80). This study is consistent with the survey data of Faraji, Karimi, Azizi, Janatolmakan and Khatony <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> in the top ranking. So management functions is the best function of all both in our study and Faraji's study.</p><p>From the data of this study, management function and work role of community nurses are the two highest scoring dimensions, and ensuring quality and helping roles are the lowest. This may be related to the fact that community nurses in China undertake more public health and preventive health services, for example, infectious disease management, chronic disease management, vaccination and so on, so these can help the management functions and work roles to do better than others while neglecting the role of ensuring quality and helping role, which is closely related to medical safety and satisfaction. However, the study said that medical safety is a major concern, both in hospitals and primary health institutions, and needs more effort to improve safety culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>The helping role of community nurses has a signi cant positive effect to teaching-coaching and teaching-coaching to the diagnostic function and then the diagnostic function to the management function. This shows that teaching-coaching is the complete intermediary of the helping role to the diagnosis function. Diagnosis function is the complete intermediary between teaching-coaching and the management function. Nurses are found to be most suitable to carry out tasks concerning health education <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Therefore, improving the teaching-coaching role is helpful to enhance the diagnosis directly and management function indirectly of community nurses, which we can give some advice to the managers.</p><p>In this study, there were signi cant differences in the evaluation of organizational career management, interprofessional team collaboration and post competency among community nurses with different seniorities and departments. Interestingly, the results of our study show that the longer seniority is, the lower the self-evaluation results are. In addition, the self-evaluation of community nurses who work in administrative departments is worse than that of nurses in inpatient and outpatient departments. This may be because the human resources of other majors in community medical institutions are relatively inadequate <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, and nurses who have longer seniority are often transferred from clinical nursing work to routine administration. As a result, there is a decline in the post competence of these nurses. At the same time, nurses with longer seniority mainly engaged in routine work, such as health statistics, and the opportunities for interprofessional team collaboration decreased, so the ability of interprofessional team collaboration decreased gradually. Moreover, because community nurses with longer seniority or administrative departments mainly engaged in auxiliary work rather than clinical work, their importance in community medical institutions might be ignored. Therefore, the opportunities for them, such as information feedback, training guidance and fair promotion, are also reduced. The organizational career management for senior or administrative department nurses is not as good as for inpatient or outpatient department or junior nurses. Other studies have shown that junior nurses generally overestimate their post competency level, and junior evaluators tend to evaluate their competency level higher than senior evaluators <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>. Other studies have shown that nursing relies on information technology more and more nowadays, and the social media use pro le bene ts both social skills and nurse-patient interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr">38]</ref>. Junior nurses may be more familiar with information technology than senior nurses. These ndings can explain why junior nurses had higher self-scoring results than senior nurses and why the scores of community nurses in the inpatient and outpatient departments are higher than those in administrative department.</p><p>Defensive strategies to minimize some di culties are the support of hierarchical superiors and the empowerment of the community in primary health care <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>So organizational career management should have a signi cant positive impact on the post competence of nurses, despite the lack of government incentives <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Community medical institutions can improve post competence of community nurses through professional self-perception, paying attention to cultivation, providing information, and fair promotion. However, interestingly, after the veri cation of our model, it is found that the effect is not signi cant, which indicates that community medical institutions may, because of the shortage of human resources or for the sake of economic bene ts <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, let nurses replace the work of other members in some places <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Therefore, it ignores the organizational career management of community nurses after work and does not provide community nurses with relevant information about career and ignores the opportunity for fair competition for community nurses. In addition, the shortage of human resources and heavy daily work <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref> forces community nurses to repeat work for a long time. It is also not conducive to the continuous improvement of the post competence of community nurses, which can explain our results.</p><p>The ability of nurses requires changes in the education and continuity of their quali cations [41]and organizational career management has a signi cant impact on nurses' ability through psychodynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Some scholars believe that organizational career management improve their interprofessional team collaboration through education and training <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. The ability of interprofessional team collaboration pays more attention to partnership, teamwork and team coordination, which are closely related to communication and mutual respect <ref type="bibr">[42]</ref>. Community medical institutions think that nurses play an important role in interprofessional team cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr">43]</ref>, so organizational career management place more emphasis on cultivating the ability of interprofessional team collaboration. Our study also validates these points.</p><p>Disease prevention and management are important contents in community medical institutions. Single-handed practices are gradually being replaced by team practices; that is, the management of many diseases can rely not only on a single person but also on more cross-disciplinary teamwork <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr">44]</ref>. In a team formed by doctors, nurses, pharmacists and managers, nurses are core force and even leaders of the team <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr">45]</ref>, and interprofessional team collaboration ability of nurses is directly related to the success or failure. Interprofessional team collaboration is important to achieve high-quality care and positive patient outcomes <ref type="bibr">[46]</ref>. Therefore, interprofessional team collaboration ability has a signi cant positive impact on their post competence, and our study also validates this nding.</p><p>nurses' post competency is not signi cant, but the impact on interprofessional team collaboration is signi cant, while the impact of interprofessional team collaboration on post competency is signi cant, so our study validates that organizational career management can affect post competency through interprofessional team collaboration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The limitation of this study is that only community nurses in Chengdu, China, were selected. In addition, this study only carries out relevant analysis, discussion and judgment through the self-assessment results of community nurses, which is somewhat subjective. In the next step, we will try to extend this study to other cities to make the sample size larger and more credible. At the same time, we will try to include other people's multiangle evaluations of community nurses, such as doctors, patients, managers, etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Attention should be given to improvement of community nurses' post competence in ensuring quality ,helping roles, teaching-coaching and diagnosis function.
