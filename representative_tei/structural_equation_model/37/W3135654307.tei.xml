<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose -Student loyalty is important if universities are to stay in business by recruiting and retaining satisfied students who provide positive evaluations of their university to others.

Several models have previously examined the relation between corporate social responsibility and general consumer loyalty, but these have limited applicability to the education sector. The data in this study support a model showing that USR supports student loyalty through its positive impact on perceptions of service quality, student satisfaction, and student trust. The findings suggest that USR could be a marketing tool that supports student loyalty, as long as USR initiatives increase students' perceptions of service quality, satisfaction and trust in their university.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The global trend to marketize higher education has led to increasing competition among universities for students <ref type="bibr">(Latifet al., 2019)</ref>. Universities are becoming managed as businesses, some students are beginning to identify as consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bunce et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tomlinson, 2017)</ref> and concepts such as "customer" satisfaction are now central to evaluations of a university's success. Although equating students with consumers and universities with service providers sits uncomfortably with academics <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(King and Bunce, 2020)</ref>, and can have a negative relation to academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bunce et al., 2017)</ref>, successful universities, like businesses, need to take customer satisfaction seriously. Satisfaction, however, is just one factor that is implicated in the broader concept of customer loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chaudhuri and Holbrook, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dick and Basu, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Customer loyalty can be defined as "the level of commitment of the average consumer towards a brand or service provider" <ref type="bibr">(Mandhachitara and Poolthong, 2011, p. 123)</ref>. Loyalty includes dimensions such as positive word-of-mouth evaluations to others, recommending the service to others and defending the service providers' virtues. Customer loyalty can also be considered a behavioral intention to maintain an ongoing relationship with a service provider <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Singh and Sirdeshmukh, 2000)</ref>. In a higher education context behavioral loyalty can, for example, be measured with respect to the number of students staying at their university (retention) and the number of students undertaking further study within the higher education institution (HEI). Building a loyal customer base, therefore, is vital for retaining and growing market share and for developing a sustainable competitive advantage <ref type="bibr">(Popli, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kotler and Armstrong, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dick and Basu, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Several studies from consumer research have investigated possible antecedents to customer loyalty. Most notably, these include: (1) service quality, (2) customer satisfaction and (3) customer trust. Importantly, these three antecedents are also interdependent: high service quality predicts customer satisfaction, which in turn predicts customer trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Annamdevula and Bellamkonda, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rojas-Mendez et al., 2009)</ref>. While there is a plethora of research on customer loyalty in sectors such as business, retail and the services industry, there is comparatively less in this increasingly important area for research in higher education. Understanding the predictors of student loyalty is important for the higher education sector because it is likely to have the same benefits as customer loyalty to other service providers, including building a loyal customer base and growing market share. Loyal students are more likely to continue a relationship with their university after graduation, consider engaging in further study at their university <ref type="bibr">(Rojas-Mendez et al., 2009)</ref> and are less likely to leave the university <ref type="bibr">(Popli, 2005)</ref>. They are also more likely to make future financial contributions to the institution and advocate for their university by recommending it to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ali et al., 2016)</ref>. Recently, social responsibility has been identified as a significant contributor to improved customer loyalty. Abundant literature is available on the link between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and customer attitudes and behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Green and Peloza, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Tian et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Srinaruewan et al., 2015)</ref>. For example, studies have shown a significant impact of corporate social responsibility on service quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Butt and Asghar, 2013)</ref>, customer satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Luo and Bhattacharya, 2006)</ref>, trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Swaen and Chumpitaz, 2008)</ref> and loyalty <ref type="bibr">(Maignan et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Du et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rashid et al., 2015)</ref>. However, there is a lack of empirical research on university social responsibility (USR) and how it can affect students who are an integral component to the commercial success of HEIs <ref type="bibr">(Sanchez-Hernandez and Mainardes, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fernandes et al., 2013)</ref>. The need to study the potential impacts of social responsibility in HEIs is warranted because it has yet to find its place as a performance indicator in university ranking system <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Shek and Hollister, 2017)</ref>. Universities are now recognizing the value of both increasing and promoting the ways in which they demonstrate social responsibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Vazquez et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>There have been some studies that have examined the impact of social responsibility on employee attitudes and behaviors in HEIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Asrar-ul-Haq et al., 2017)</ref>. This study found that perceived CSR has a significant relationship with job satisfaction and organizational commitment. A small number of studies have also begun to examine how USR might be promoted by universities as a tool to enhance student outcomes, such as student satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Vazquez et al., 2015)</ref>. This research is based on the premise that a socially responsible university can lead to better student attitudes and behaviors and increased loyalty. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Vazquez et al. (2015)</ref> revealed that the overall perception of USR was significantly related to quality of service and student satisfaction. Additionally, El-Kassaret al. ( <ref type="formula">2019</ref>) have called for further research in the area of USR to deepen knowledge of USR and its impact on students' and perceptions of university-related outcomes such as perception of university quality of service, as well as student satisfaction. Such understanding will eventually determine the practical applications of USR that will support the HEIs' survival and progress.</p><p>It is worth noting that most studies on CSR and USR have been conducted in European countries and the United States of America, but the current study was conducted in Pakistan. This makes an important contribution to the literature because it will be useful to demonstrate if the consequences of social responsibility are the same in a developing country <ref type="bibr">(Malik and Kanwal, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Asrar-ul-Haq et al., 2017)</ref>. Examining these issues from another cultural perspective could also benefit HEIs in terms of understanding how to develop loyalty among international students.</p><p>As social responsibility is concerned with the relationship between an organization and its stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Crowther and Seifi, 2013)</ref>, it is viable to assume that students would be affected by the ability of their institution to be socially responsible. The present study argues that USR would lead to improved student loyalty, just as CSR leads to improved customer loyalty. The aim of this research was to examine the former possibility. This paper makes a unique contribution to this body of research in several ways. First, it provides an original addition to the limited literature on USR and its relations with student loyalty. Several models have previously examined the relation between CSR and general consumer loyalty, but these have limited applicability to the education sector. Second, this study will provides a new short measure of USR adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Latif (2018)</ref>. Third, the research will examine the mechanisms through which USR impacts student loyalty, and, finally, the study utilises a sample from a developing country to explore whether the role of USR in student loyalty are generalizable in this context. The literature review will now consider the three main antecedents to customer loyalty: (1) service quality, (2) customer satisfaction and (3) customer trust.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Service quality</head><p>Irrespective of their industry, organizations focus on the quality of services that they provide to their customers because these have an integral role in developing competitive advantage and in attracting new and retaining existing customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ugboma et al., 2007)</ref>. In education, loyalty requires developing a solid relationship with students <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Annamdevula and Bellamkonda, 2016)</ref>; ignoring service quality is likely to be detrimental to student loyalty <ref type="bibr">(Aliet al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Sultan and Wong, 2013)</ref>. In a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hennig-Thurau et al. (2001)</ref> 1,162 students studying at six German universities completed a questionnaire to assess the impact of relationship quality with their university on student loyalty. They asked students, for example, whether they would choose the institution again and whether they would recommend it to others. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hennig-Thurau et al. (2001)</ref> found that teaching q u alit y w as hi g hl y r el at e d t o st u d e nt l o y alt y, m e a ni n g t h at st u d e nts w h o r at e d t e a c hi n g as hi g h er q u alit y w er e als o m or e l o y al.   To verify the factor structure of this shortened version, 215 students from one university in Pakistan completed the questionnaire. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using SPSS 20 revealed the expected three factors solution; however, three items did not fit the factor structure and were removed: one item from research and development was removed because it failed to load onto its respective factor, and two further items were removed because they did not show acceptable loadings (&lt; 0.50) (one item from research and development and one item from philanthropic responsibilities). The final three factor structure explained 60.80% of the total variance in USR. The results of EFA are summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis and results</head><p>Following the recommended two-stage analytical procedures by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</ref>, we first tested the measurement model to explore the validity and reliability of each of the questionnaires using SPSS 20. Subsequently, we tested the structural model to examine the hypothesized relationships between the variables (using SmartPLS 3.2.7, Ringle et al., 2015) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hair et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Test of the measurement model: reliability and validity. The measurement model was developed and tested for reliability and validity. The factor loadings and other measurement properties for each construct are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. All loadings within each construct exceeded the recommended level of 0.60 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chin, 1998)</ref>, resulting in confidence that all items helped in estimating each underlying construct. Instrument reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability (CR).</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Cronbach's alpha and CR exceeded the 0.70 threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Wasko and Faraj, 2005)</ref>, meaning that all constructs in the study had internal consistency. Convergent validity was acceptable because the average variance extracted (AVE) and CRs were all higher than 0.50 and 0.70, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Discriminant validity was assessed using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref> criterion. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref>, AVE is established if the square root of constructs' AVE (shown in italics along the diagonal in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) is greater than the inter-correlations of other constructs. The results show that the AVE was greater than the squared correlation between each pair of constructs, thus providing evidence for discriminant validity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural model assessing the relation between university social responsibility and loyalty.</head><p>First, we examined the amount of variance explained by the independent variables on the various outcome variables. Loyalty was predicted by USR, service quality, satisfaction, and trust, and together, these variables explained 59.1% of the variance in loyalty. USR explained 53.4% of the variance in service quality, while USR and service quality combined explained 55.4% of the variance in satisfaction. USR and satisfaction explained 49.7% of the variance in trust. These can be described as moderate <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chin et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>To assess whether the relation between USR and student loyalty was mediated by service quality, satisfaction, and trust, we examined R2, beta (β) and the corresponding t-values via a bootstrapping procedure with 5,000 samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>. The study involved a total of five variables. USR was the predictor variable, service quality, satisfaction, and trust were the mediating variables, and loyalty was the outcome variable. We first tested the direct effects by testing the hypotheses that USR predicts loyalty, and USR predicts the mediating variables service quality, satisfaction, and trust. Subsequently, we explored the relations between the mediating variables to determine whether service quality predicted satisfaction, which in turn predicted trust. Finally, we tested indirect effects to examine the hypothesis that service quality, satisfaction, and trust mediated the relation between USR and loyalty (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>).</p><p>Direct effects. The results supported H1. First, USR positively and significantly predicted loyalty (β = 0.181, t = 3.995, p &lt; 0.001), meaning that the more that students agreed that their university demonstrated USR the more loyal they were. USR also positively and significantly predicted all three mediators: service quality (β = 0.731, t = 35.185, p &lt; 0.001), satisfaction (β = 0.292, t = 6.554, p &lt; 0.001), and trust (β = 0.356, t = 8.655, p &lt; 0.001); thus, the more that students agreed that their university demonstrated USR, the more likely they were to agree  that their university provided service quality, they were more satisfied, and they had higher levels of trust in their university.</p><p>Next, the direct effects of the mediating variables on loyalty were assessed. There were significant positive relations for all three mediating variables on loyalty: service quality (β = 0.155, t = 2.872, p = 0.004), satisfaction (β = 0.168, t = 3.409, p = 0.001), and trust (β = 0.375, t = 8.149, p &lt; 0.001), meaning that higher perception of service quality, more student satisfaction, and more trust were associated with increased loyalty.</p><p>Indirect effects. The three indirect effects of USR on student loyalty through service quality, satisfaction, and trust were significant (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). This means that service quality, student satisfaction, and student trust partially mediated the influence of USR on student loyalty and supports H1.</p><p>Relations between the mediators. Finally, the relations between the mediating variables were assessed to test H2, which proposed that service quality, satisfaction, and trust predicted each other in turn. The analysis supported this hypothesis: service quality positively predicted satisfaction (β = 0. 5 0 4, t = 1 1. 3 9 5, p &lt; 0. 0 0 1), a n d s atisf a cti o n p ositi v el y pr e di ct e d tr ust ( β = 0. 4 1 7, t = 9. 0 4 3, p &lt; 0. 0 0 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dis c ussi o n</head><p>T  <ref type="bibr">, 2016)</ref>. This suggests that to attain student satisfaction in higher education, there is a need to Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. Indirect effects of service quality, satisfaction and trust on the relation between USR and loyalty provide high-quality educational services. A high level of student satisfaction could be the result of student service expectations being met. The current study also found a significant positive impact of student satisfaction on student trust, supporting the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Grossman (1999)</ref>. This is perhaps not surprising because a high level of satisfaction, as a result of receiving good service quality, would be associated with trust that such quality would continue in the future. Universities can build trust by offering consistently good service quality, e.g. by treating students in a consistent and equitable manner, managing and meeting student's expectations and handling student complaints in a caring manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Elliott and Healy, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>The current study finally assessed the mediating roles of service quality, student satisfaction and student trust on the link between USR and student loyalty. The results revealed that service quality, satisfaction and trust mediated the relation between USR and loyalty. These findings indicate that the implementation of USR indirectly increases student loyalty if it is embedded in the university in a way that improves service quality, builds student levels of satisfaction and makes the university more trustworthy. Although there is a significant lack of literature on the role of USR in the education sector, the marketing and management literature has consistently found similar results. For example, Mandhachitara and Poolthong (2011) demonstrated that service quality and student satisfaction both mediated the relationship between social responsibility and repeat patronage intentions (behavioral loyalty). The results of the present study also support previous research showing that trust mediates the relation between USR and loyalty (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Vlachos et al., 2009)</ref>. USR initiatives may not, therefore, support the development of loyalty unless they also raise students' perception of service quality, satisfaction, and trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Shin and Thai, 2015)</ref>. The results indicate that university administrators should recognize that investing in USR could have a significant interaction with positive student responses (e.g. loyalty in the present study).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future research directions</head><p>There are some limitations to the study that may impact on generalizability. The first is that participants were from universities in Pakistan, which has a one-tier university system, unlike in many Western countries that have a two-tier system (e.g. Ivory League versus mainstream universities in the USA and research-intense versus teaching-intense universities in the UK).</p><p>Therefore, more research is required to determine the generalizability of the findings to different types of universities in Western countries. Furthermore, cultural or other differences between students studying in Pakistan and Western countries may impact on generalizability, e.g. Pakistan is a collectivist society, whereas many Western countries are individualistic societies, meaning that USR may be perceived differently according to cultural context. Another limitation of the present study is that it was based on correlational data, meaning that the cause and effect could not be determined. Experimental studies will be needed to support the suggestion that increasing USR will lead to an increase in student loyalty. The current data do not rule out the possibility that students who are more loyal to their university are more likely to perceive their university as engaging in more USR. Future studies may also assess the impact of USR on other relevant variables such as university image or relationship quality with students and determine the impacts on student outcomes such as level of academic performance. This will create a more complete view of the impact of USR on its student body.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications and conclusions</head><p>The main contribution from this study stems from confirmation of the hypothesized relations between USR initiatives, service quality, student satisfaction, student trust, and student loyalty. This study also supports the idea that USR in the higher education sector creates "added value" for students and is associated with positive perceptions of service quality, higher student satisfaction, higher trust and increased student loyalty. Hence, USR represents an opportunity for offering value to students, which improves the HEI's image and consequently makes it easier to attract and retain students. These findings could be relevant to all HEIs that have a "customer-oriented" environment, where students seek more for their money and whose evaluations affect their university's position in league tables. The study suggests that education administrators could create programs that promote, establish, develop and maintain successful long-term relationships with both current and former students through identification of antecedents that play a role in establishing USR. The findings of this study also suggest that HEIs should invest in USR and in communicating their USR initiatives. This could help to improve the reputation of the university and lead to positive attitudes and behaviors in students such as trust and loyalty. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>g h-q u a lit y s er vi c es l e a d t o s atisfi e d c ust o m ers ( A n n a m d e v ul a a n d B ell a m k o n d a, 2 0 1 6).
