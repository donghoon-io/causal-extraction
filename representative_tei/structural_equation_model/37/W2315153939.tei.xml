<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Online social media has become a popular way to communicate and develop interpersonal relationships. Facebook use in particular has become an important topic for researchers and clinicians, as young adults are increasingly integrating this use into their daily lives and social behavior. As empirical work on the personality traits and interpersonal competency associated with use and the potential consequences of use on social behavior is still emerging, the present study sought to investigate the interrelationships among constructs relevant to the developmental tasks associated with emerging adulthood, including adult attachment style, Five Factor Model personality traits, interpersonal competency, and Facebook use. Using data collected from 617 emerging adults in college, we utilized structural equation modeling to develop a model explaining the interrelationships among the constructs under study in order to further the research in this area. Results yielded a well-fitting model that explained the interrelationships among these latent constructs in the data, which suggested that insecure attachment had direct and positive effects on neuroticism, direct and negative effects on extraversion, direct and negative effects on interpersonal competency, and indirect effects on Facebook use. In addition, only extraversion and not neuroticism was related to interpersonal competency and Facebook use, when first accounting for attachment style.</p><p>Interestingly, interpersonal competency did not seem to play a prominent mediating role between these personality traits and Facebook use. These results highlight the role of attachment style, and its importance in both developing personality traits, interpersonal</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Since its inception in the 1960s and popularization in the 1990s, the internet and its most used feature, the World Wide Web, has been an increasingly pervasive presence in the lives of North Americans. Its seminal idea was, in essence, communication as government scientists sought to invent a new medium through which to share ideas and information. This same basic purpose persisted throughout its evolution, as everyday users communicated through email, online chatting, and web pages. Internet use has consistently increased over the past decade, with 79% of all adults reporting online activity this year with 95% of adults ages 18-33 <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">(Zickuhr, 2010)</ref>. These statistics and recent research suggest that young adults are increasingly incorporating the internet into their daily lives, especially as a means of communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Correa, Hinsley, &amp; de Zúñiga, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ellison, Steinfeld, &amp; Lampe, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Ross et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Although only rising to prominence in the past 8 years, social media and social networking sites (SNSs) have became a wildly popular <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">(Pempek, Yermolayeva, &amp; Calvert, 2009)</ref> online medium through which to communicate and share information <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">(Ross et al., 2009)</ref> (for a history and comprehensive definition of SNSs, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Boyd &amp; Ellison, 2007)</ref>. Originally created for young adults in college, Facebook (<ref type="url" target="http://www.facebook.com">http://www.facebook.com</ref>) has become the most used SNS for this population <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Cheung, Chiu, &amp; Lee, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Ross et al., 2009)</ref>. Founded fairly recently in 2006 for public use, Facebook has become "nearly universal" on North American college campuses <ref type="bibr">(Pempek et al., 2009, p. 228)</ref>. Investigations into typical use patterns in this population show frequent and consistent use ranging from 10-30 minutes daily <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Ellison et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Ross et al., 2009)</ref> to hours each day <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">(Raacke &amp; Bonds-Raacke, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Pempek et al. (2009)</ref> found that Facebook users communicated most often with "friends seen regularly" (48% of users) and less often with "hometown friends not seen regularly (35%) and "college friends not seen regularly" (19%). As young adults increasingly integrate Facebook into their daily social routines <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Correa et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">Steinfield, Ellison &amp; Lampe, 2008)</ref> new research must seek to understand the characteristics of these social media users and the potential impact of this use on their development, especially in the social domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Brown, 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emerging Adulthood Theoretical Framework</head><p>Although many developmental theories postulate that true change begins to slow after reaching 18 years of age, new research suggests that young adults continue to show prominent developmental changes into their mid 20s <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Arnett, 2000)</ref>. Arnett"s "emerging adulthood" developmental theory grew out of three well-known theories of development:</p><p>Erikson"s (1968), <ref type="bibr">Levinson"s (1978)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Keniston"s (1971)</ref> theories, all of which extend past adolescence in some way to explain the development of young adults. However, Arnett argues that these theories fail to comprehensively and accurately capture the development of young adults, especially those in the present era. Indeed, Erikson"s theory becomes less concrete and detailed after his adolescence stage, focusing on occupational identity and generativity for young adults. Arnett notes that the experience of young adults after high school is quite different in the 21 st century, as many are not content to simply decide upon a trade or career and in fact continue their search for a stable sense of self and place in the world. In fact, Arnett"s theory stresses the continued and intensive identity exploration that occurs after adolescence when previous theorists suggest that it slows significantly. Similarly, Levinson lumps together adults from ages 17 to mid 30s into the same category and describes their primary developmental tasks as building an established life and finding a place in the world. Lastly, Arnett argues that Keniston"s theory was encapsulated in his era of youth movements and politics, with an overemphasis on the struggle between a young adult and her society. <ref type="bibr">Arnett"s (2000)</ref> theory suggests that young adults from approximately 18 to 25 years of age develop through an intense period of change as they work to form a stable sense of identity and explore meaningful relationships. He highlights the observed instability of this age group as evidence of this intense change, as they exhibit pronounced diversity in living arrangements, primary life tasks (e.g., work, college attendance), and relationship status. He argues that this stage is unique from adolescence, in that these adults face a drastically different set of responsibilities, developmental tasks, and possibilities to explore. Through this theory"s lens, emerging adults discover and begin to solidify their sense of self based on their own budding values, personality characteristics, and interests. In addition, they experiment with platonic and romantic relationships, seeking companionship with others that compliment their own emerging identities. Thus, this period is characterized by continued personal growth and development, resulting in "more enduring choices in love, work, and worldviews" <ref type="bibr">(Arnett, 2000, p. 479)</ref>. Other researchers support this conceptualization of young adults, suggesting that intrapersonal and interpersonal developmental activities continue past traditional adolescence into young adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Montgomery, 2005</ref>). Arnett"s theory forms the developmental theoretical framework for the present study, and will be one of the theories used as a lens through which to examine the associations between emerging adults" personality characteristics, interpersonal competency, and Facebook use.</p><p>For emerging adults in today"s technology-saturated society, many of their developmental tasks are being carried out online <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Brown, 2006)</ref>, especially through SNS like Facebook. A recent study highlighted how a process commonly associated with identity development was reflected on participants" Facebook pages: users expressed "salient and highly elaborated" ethnic identities through their Facebook pages just as they would in the real world <ref type="bibr">(Grasmuck, Martin &amp; Zhao, 2009, p. 179)</ref>. Constructing an online profile page can be seen as a purposeful act, one that reflects a user"s identity and self in a social environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Manago, Graham, Greenfield, &amp; Salimkhan, 2008)</ref>. In this way, emerging adults express themselves, representing aspects of their personality via this online medium with distinctly social motivations. Thus, developmental processes associated with emerging adulthood such as identity formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Peluchette &amp; Karl, 2010)</ref> and social behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Gordon, Juang &amp; Syed, 2007)</ref> often manifest online through SNS such as Facebook.</p><p>Emerging adults also develop relationships through Facebook, maintain established relationships, and use this medium for interpersonal communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Ellison et al., 2007)</ref>. Platonic and romantic relationships are of great concern throughout emerging adulthood, and sites like Facebook are increasingly used to maintain these types of connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(Reich, 2010)</ref>, maintenance which requires interpersonal communications skills and competence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">Subrahmanyam, Reich, Waechter and Espinoza (2008)</ref> found that the internet was important in the participants" lives and that one of their most frequent activities online was using social networking sites (SNS) to maintain social connections. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Reich (2010)</ref> concluded that these sites more often foster "networked individualism" than a "sense of community <ref type="bibr">" (p. 703)</ref>. This supports the idea that individuals use these sites as an extension of the self, an online manifestation of their personality and a tool for interpersonal relationships. In this way, SNS profiles can represent a user"s overall personality, as these pages embody and demonstrate to a viewer specific personality traits, values, beliefs, and interpersonal relationships. In this way, SNS such as Facebook play a prominent role in the developmental domains of emerging adulthood, and researchers must seek to understand the potential ramifications of its use for individual identity and personality development, social behavior, and interpersonal communication with this population of users <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">(Thayer &amp; Ray, 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attachment Theoretical Framework</head><p>John Bowlby developed his theory of attachment in the 1940s and 1950s. This theoretical framework emphasizes the importance of early relationships and nature of the connection between child and caretaker, which is most often the parent-child bond <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bowlby, 1969)</ref>. Bowlby theorized that these early relationships help to form a child"s style of attachment, which can impact relationships and personality characteristics throughout later development and the life span. He focuses on the quality of this initial child-caretaker bond, and emphasizes the level of security that the child feels in the world and in exploration thereof <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bowlby, 1969)</ref>. Informed by these early attachment relationships, the child builds an internal model for his or herself in relationships with others that persist through adolescence and adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bowlby, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Zimmerman, 2004)</ref>. Thus, although initially used to describe early relationships, attachment theory states that attachment style continues to dictate the formation and maintenance of adult relationships as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Bowlby, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Fraley &amp; Shaver, 2000)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Kenny and Rice (1995)</ref> reviewed relevant research in applying attachment theory to the developmental challenges of what <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Arnett (2000)</ref> later conceptualized as the emerging adulthood stage. Essentially, they theorized that parental attachment plays an important role in the developmental processes of late adolescents in college, especially in their identity development, social behavior, and interpersonal relationships. <ref type="bibr">Wei, Russel, and Zakalik (2005)</ref> state that research supports the link between attachment and social competency as well as social self-efficacy, finding in their study that high attachment avoidance and anxiety were associated with lower levels of social self-efficacy. Healthier adult attachment has also been associated with better college adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Lapsley &amp; Edgerton, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Mattanah, Hancock &amp; Brand, 2004)</ref>, psychosocial adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(DiTommaso, Brannen-McNulty, Ross &amp; Burgess, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Engels, Finkenauer, Meeus &amp; Deković, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Hiester, Nordstrom &amp; Swenson, 2009)</ref>, greater self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Kenny &amp; Sirin, 2006)</ref>, and increased interpersonal competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(DiTommaso et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Engels et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">Ross &amp; Fuertes, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The most current way of conceptualizing adult attachment style <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rholes, Peatzold &amp; Friedman, 2008)</ref> was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Brennan, Clark and Shaver (1998)</ref> as a two-component, dimensional model of attachment (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Their model defined two orthogonal dimensions, called "anxiety" and "avoidance," on which an individual can vary from "low" to "high" on these two continuums. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Brennan et al. (1998)</ref> provided a more refined way of conceptualizing the previous four-category <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Bartholomew &amp; Horowitz, 1991)</ref> model of attachment (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and this dimensional model was used to conceptualize adult attachment style in the present study; individuals scoring lower on attachment anxiety and avoidance were considered more securely attached and those scoring higher as more insecurely attached. A growing body of research supports the central role of attachment style in major developmental processes of emerging adults, so attachment theory will be used as an additional theoretical lens through which to view this investigation into the relationships between personality characteristics, interpersonal competency, and online social behavior.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attachment and FFM Traits</head><p>Since early work investigating the relationship between adult attachment style and FFM personality traits by <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Shaver and Brennan (1992)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Carver (1997)</ref>, research methodology and measurement techniques have developed significantly. These early studies have been backed by later work that supports the positive correlation between secure attachment styles and extraversion and agreeableness, and negatively associated with neuroticism, while anxious and avoidant attachment styles were positively correlated with neuroticism and negatively correlated with extraversion and agreeableness <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Backstrom &amp; Holmes, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Picardi, Caroppo, Toni, Bitetti &amp; Di Maria, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Shaver &amp; Brennan, 1992)</ref>. However, more recent work has concluded that the attachment-FFM relationships are fairly consistent but weak and should be expected given the nature of these constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Picardi et al., 2005)</ref>. As research on attachment and FFM personality traits in childhood suggests that attachment is an important predictor of these traits, especially extraversion, openness, and neuroticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Hagekull &amp; Bohlin, 2003)</ref>, I will incorporate the developmental nature of this relationship throughout the present study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personality Traits and Interpersonal Competency</head><p>Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Ozer and Benet-Martínez (2006)</ref> recently lamented the dearth of research investigating interrelationships among FFM traits and social competence, they also provided support in their review for the significant relationship between personality traits and social skills, which in turn affect relationship quality. They also noted that the body of literature in this area provides support for the FFM traits Extraversion and Neuroticism as the most important predictors of social relationship outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Barrett &amp; Pietromonaco, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Berry &amp; Hansen, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b231">White, Hendrick &amp; Hendrick, 2004)</ref>. Actually, FFM traits have been associated with many aspects of interpersonal communication competency and a wide variety of relationship outcomes, such as relationship satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Goodboy &amp; Booth-Butterfield, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Ozer &amp; Benet-Martínez, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b226">Watson, Hubbard &amp; Wiese, 2000)</ref>, satisfaction with sex <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Fisher &amp; McNulty, 2008)</ref>, conflict resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">(Wood &amp; Bell, 2008)</ref>, and marital satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Donnellan, Larsen-Rife &amp; Conger, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Karney &amp; Bradbury, 1995)</ref>. Although other authors have found that Extraversion and Agreeableness have the strongest association with social skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Cuperman &amp; Ickes, 2009</ref>), there appears to be ample and comprehensive support for the significant impact of FFM traits on social interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ansell &amp; Pincus, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Back,</ref> Similarly, attachment style has been repeatedly shown to significantly impact one"s interpersonal communication competency and experience in close relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Fraley &amp; Shaver, 2000)</ref>. More secure attachment styles have been associated with greater interpersonal competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(DiTommaso et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Engels et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">Ross &amp; Fuertes, 2010</ref>), and appears to guide relationships throughout the lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Berlin, Cassidy &amp; Appleyard, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Zimmerman, 2004)</ref>. Also, the link between attachment and relationship satisfaction has clear support in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Fraley &amp; Shaver, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Tucker, &amp; Anders, 1999)</ref> and may be mediated by variables such as communication style <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Guerrero, Farinelli, &amp; McEwan, 2009)</ref>, with a recent study suggesting that attachment style was related to communication style and effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Jang, Smith &amp; Levine, 2002)</ref>. Thus, there is clear support for the theoretical link between attachment style and interpersonal communication competency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personality Traits and Facebook Use</head><p>Although the research is still emerging in this area, an individual"s Facebook presence seems to parallel that person"s offline personality as well (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">Weisbuch, Ivcevic, &amp; Ambady, 2009)</ref>. Recent work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Vazire and Gosling (2004)</ref> found that subjects can form clear, comprehensive impressions about the personality of a personal web page"s author, impressions which tend to correspond accurately to actual in-person ratings of the same person"s personality. This may be explained by what <ref type="bibr">Funder and Colvin"s (1991)</ref> results imply as consistency in "underlying psychological dispositions that can be expressed behaviorally" (p. 777). This idea that viewers can rate a person"s personality factors by judging that person"s social networking profile with consistency and relative accuracy has been demonstrated in other areas as well (c.f., <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Kluemper &amp; Rosen, 2009)</ref>. Related findings have been demonstrated for the trait of interpersonal shyness, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Orr et al., (2009)</ref> suggested that greater shyness was associated with fewer friends for Facebook users as well as real world relationships. Thus, many are calling for more research investigating the personality characteristics associated with Facebook use, especially as they relate to the potential impact of social media use on the social behavior of emerging adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Brown, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">Steinfield et al., 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Five Factor Model Personality Traits and Online Social Behavior</head><p>More stable personality characteristics, such as <ref type="bibr">Bowlby"s (1969)</ref> attachment style, the Five Factor Model personality traits (FFM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Digman, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">McCrae &amp; John, 1992)</ref>, and self-esteem, have been shown to affect social behavior and relationships.

For online relationships, recent research supports the idea that FFM personality traits such as extraversion explain the nature and extent of a user"s social behavior on the internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">(Tosun &amp; Lajunen, 2010)</ref>. In a more comprehensive investigation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Ross et al. (2009)</ref> found that extraversion, openness and neuroticism explained a user"s social behavior on Facebook specifically, results which were supported by subsequent work as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Correa et al., 2010)</ref>. A recent follow-up study to <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Ross et al. (2009)</ref> offered further support to these results, while claiming a more rigorous methodology, suggesting that higher extroversion was associated with increased social behavior on Facebook, higher neuroticism was associated with less self-disclosure, and that openness was associated with more expressive Facebook communication (Amichai- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Hamburger &amp; Vinitzky, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>However, the research on FFM traits and SNS use is still emerging <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">(Zywica &amp; Danowski, 2008)</ref>, sporadic at best, and many studies do suffer from a lack of methodological rigor. For example, although <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Correa et al. (2010)</ref> used a large national sample, they utilized an abbreviated and psychometrically weaker 10-item scale by <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Gosling, Rentfrow and Swann (2003)</ref> to measure FFM traits derived from the standard 44-item Big Five Index (BFI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">John, Naumann, &amp; Soto, 2008)</ref>. Thus far, recent work suggests that personality characteristics play a role in forming and maintaining relationships both in the real world and online. Thus, FFM personality traits may play an important role in social behavior via Facebook, and it is likely that other personality traits such as self-esteem and attachment style are also influential and must be included when investigating social behavior online.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpersonal Competency and Online Social Behavior</head><p>In developing their interpersonal competency questionnaire, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Buhrmester, Furman, Wittenberg and Reis (1988)</ref> found a significant relationship between interpersonal competency and various relational and adjustment outcomes.

As SNSs have become one of the most common manifestations of social behavior and communication online, researchers are beginning to investigate their role in the social lives of everyday users (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">Steinfield et al., 2008)</ref>. Others encourage further research on SNSs with the emerging adult population that uses them most, as this medium is fairly new and as yet has not been studied in depth <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">(Ross et al., 2009)</ref>, especially in relation to social behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">(Raacke &amp; Bonds-Raacke, 2008)</ref>.

This study will investigate how the more stable personality traits commonly associated with relationship quality, relationship satisfaction, and interpersonal communication are associated with perceived interpersonal competence, and the intensity of Facebook use. Building on previous work (e.g., Jenkins-Guarnieri, <ref type="bibr">Wright, &amp; Hudiburgh, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Ross et al., 2009)</ref>, this investigation will include adult attachment and the FFM personality traits Extraversion and Neuroticism. In conducting a thorough literature review, no research has been conducted with the emerging adult population on the interrelationships among personality traits, interpersonal competency, and intensity of online social behavior manifested through Facebook.</p><p>Based on the comprehensive literature review conducted in Chapter II, there was clear theoretical support for attachment directly and positively impacting interpersonal competence (e.g., more securely attached adults, or those scoring lower on the anxiety and avoidance continuums of attachment style, also displayed increased interpersonal competence) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anders &amp; Tucker, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Bippus &amp; Rollin, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Cooley, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Mallinckrodt, 2000)</ref> and extraversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Backstrom &amp; Holmes, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Carver, 1997)</ref>, directly and negatively affecting neuroticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Hagekull &amp; Bohlin, 2003)</ref> as well as indirectly impacting interpersonal competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Guerrero, Farinelli &amp; McEwan, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Johnson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rholes, Paetzold &amp; Friendman, 2008)</ref> and interpersonal factors related to Facebook use <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Bradford, Feeney &amp; Campbell, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schulman, Elicker &amp; Srouf, 1994)</ref> through these two FFM traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Hagekull &amp; Bohlin, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Picardi et al., 2005)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition of Terms</head><p>Social networking sites (SNS). <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Boyd and Ellison (2007)</ref> define Social</p><p>Networking Sites (SNS) as web sites providing users with a suite of services designed to create an online profile describing them, define a list of other users with whom a social connection has been established, and access the profiles and defined lists of other users within the web site. These services combine to form what these authors call a user"s "social networks," which represent a web of interconnected individuals all with some shared social connection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpersonal competency.</head><p>In the present study interpersonal competency will be defined as one"s ability to select, implement, and coordinate programs for social behavior, as well as how well one adjusts these programs of action in response to feedback from the social environment. These programs are comprised of the knowledge and practical procedures necessary for effective communication in a social environment, from choosing specific, impactful words, to clear and uninterrupted speech paired with expressive facial expressions and hand gestures.</p><p>Social self-efficacy. Social self-efficacy represents another way to operationalize interpersonal competence, as it seems to capture perceived confidence in one"s abilities at interpersonal communication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Smith and Betz (2000)</ref> define social self-efficacy as "an individual"s confidence in her/his ability to engage in social interactional tasks necessary to initiate and maintain interpersonal relationships" <ref type="bibr">(Smith &amp; Betz, 2000, p. 286)</ref>. This definition seems to be born out of applying <ref type="bibr">Bandura"s (1997)</ref> basic self-efficacy theory to the domain of social interaction. The present study will use this definition of social selfefficacy, as it parallels both Bandura"s early theory about self-efficacy and more recent support in the psychology literature.</p><p>Attachment style. The term "attachment style" in the present study will refer to the inner working model used by an individual when forming and participating in a close relationship, and the accompanying behavioral and emotional skills developed to accomplish associated relational activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Bowlby, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Fraley &amp; Shaver, 2000)</ref>. This model can be characterized as having high or low levels along two dimensions: attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. When an individual exhibits low levels of anxiety and avoidance, they can be considered more securely attached, while high levels indicate more insecure attachment. These working models can be seen as a personal theoretical lens through which an individual sees themselves in a relationship and interprets the behavior of others, as well as forming expectations of self, others, and the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Pietromonaco &amp; Barrett, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Five Factor Model trait taxonomy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">John et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Agreeableness.</head><p>Factor 2 is called Agreeableness and "contrasts a prosocial and communal orientation toward others with antagonism and includes traits such as altruism, tender-mindedness, trust, and modesty" (p. 120).</p><p>Conscientiousness. Factor 3 is called Conscientiousness and "describes socially prescribed impulse control that facilitates task-and goal-directed behavior, such as thinking before acting, delaying gratification, following norms and rules, and planning, organizing, and prioritizing tasks" (p. 120).</p><p>Neuroticism. Factor 4 is called Neuroticism and "contrasts emotional stability and even-temperedness with negative emotionality, such as feeling anxious, nervous, sad, and tense" (p. 120).</p><p>Openness. Factor 5 is called Openness and "describes the breadth, depth, originality, and complexity of an individual"s mental and experiential life" (p. 120). I will use these descriptions to define the FFM factors throughout this study.</p><p>Facebook use. Prior methods of evaluating Facebook use focused solely on frequency and duration of activity on the site, however, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Ellison et al. (2007)</ref> call for more comprehensive definitions that incorporate a user"s emotional connection to and reliance on the site. In this study, Facebook use will be defined as follows: the extent to which users incorporate the site into daily social behavior, the intensity of users" emotional connections to the site, and the degree to which users actively engage with the site and its various tools for social behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>By closely examining the aspects of personality that impact Facebook use and  <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Arnett, 2000)</ref>. Arnett"s "emerging adulthood" developmental theory grew out of three wellknown theories of development: Erikson"s (1968), <ref type="bibr">Levinson"s (1978)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Keniston"s (1971)</ref> theories, all of which extend past adolescence in some way to explain the development of young adults. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Arnett (2000)</ref> argued that these theories fail to comprehensively and accurately capture the development of young adults, especially those in the present era. Indeed, Erikson"s theory becomes less concrete and detailed after his adolescence stage, focusing on occupational identity and generativity for young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Erikson, 1968</ref>).</p><p>Arnett noted that the experience of young adults after high school is quite different in the 21 st century, as many are not content to simply decide upon a trade or career and in fact continue their search for a stable sense of self and place in the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Arnett, 2004)</ref>. In fact, Arnett"s theory stressed the continued and intensive identity exploration that occurs after adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Arnett, 2004)</ref> while previous theorists suggested that it slows significantly. Levinson combined adults from ages 17 to mid 30s into the same category and described their primary developmental tasks as building an established life and finding a place in the world. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Arnett (2007)</ref> highlighted the "the ambivalence with which many emerging adults view their entry into adult responsibilities" (p. 24). Lastly, Arnett argued that Keniston"s theory was encapsulated in his era of youth movements and politics, with an overemphasis on the struggle between a young adult and her society. <ref type="bibr">Arnett"s (2000)</ref> theory suggested that young adults from approximately 18 to 25 years of age develop through an intense period of change as they work to form a stable sense of identity and explore meaningful relationships. He supported this trend by citing numerous sociological phenomena, such as the sharp increase in the median U.S.</p><p>marriage age in the 1990s and 2000s, the marked increase in geographic mobility for U.S.</p><p>adults between 19 and 29 years of age, and survey data on adults" perceptions of reaching adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Arnett, 2004)</ref>. He highlighted the observed instability of this age group as evidence of this intense change, as they exhibited pronounced diversity in living arrangements, primary life tasks (e.g., work, college attendance), and relationship status.</p><p>He argues that this stage is unique from adolescence, in that these adults face a drastically different set of responsibilities, developmental tasks, and possibilities to explore.</p><p>Through this theory"s lens, emerging adults discover and begin to solidify their sense of self based on their own budding values, personality characteristics, and interests. In addition, they experiment with platonic and romantic relationships, seeking companionship with others that compliment their own emerging identities. Thus, this period is characterized by continued personal growth and development, resulting in "more enduring choices in love, work, and worldviews" <ref type="bibr">(Arnett, 2000, p. 479)</ref>. Other researchers support this conceptualization of young adults, suggesting that intrapersonal and interpersonal developmental activities continue past traditional adolescence into young adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Montgomery, 2005</ref>). Arnett"s theory forms the developmental theoretical framework for the present study, and will be one of the theories used as a lens through which to examine the associations between emerging adults" personality characteristics, interpersonal competency, and Facebook use.</p><p>Attachment theory. John Bowlby developed his theory of attachment in the 1940s and 1950s. This theoretical framework emphasized the importance of early relationships and nature of the connection between child and caretaker, which is most often the parent-child bond <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bowlby, 1969)</ref>. Theories about attachment at the time were dominated by the psychoanalytic framework that focused on an infant"s hunger drive being satisfied by the mother, and also the social learning perspective that emphasized how the pleasure of being fed becomes associated with the mother <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Cassidy, 1999)</ref>. After studying animal attachment behavior and later closely observing human parent-child interactions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Bowlby (1969)</ref> drew on evolutionary theory and postulated that an infant"s need for connection had a biological basis developed through natural selection.</p><p>Essentially, he postulated that an infant"s proximity to its mother would aid in its survival, as the mother could offer protection, social interaction, teach skills, and feed her young. Thus, the infant would engage in what he called "attachment behaviors" such as nursing at a breast, making sounds, crying, and smiling in order to facilitate this physical proximity and the accompanying behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bowlby, 1969)</ref>. Unlike an instinct or a reflex, Bowlby theorized that these types of behaviors are organized into a system of attachment behaviors, as the set of behaviors exhibited by the child respond to stimuli and change depending on feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, &amp; Wall, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Cassidy, 1999)</ref>. The goal of all this behavior is a strong mother-infant relationship, and all the consequences of the associated physical proximity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bowlby, 1969)</ref>.</p><p>Emotions play a key role in <ref type="bibr">Bowlby"s (1973)</ref> theory, as maintaining the attachment bond is associated with positive affect and disruption of these bonds are associated with loss and sadness <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ainsworth et al., 1978)</ref>. These emotional consequences may motivate an infant to maintain the attachment relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Cassidy, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Combining both affective and cognitive material, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Bowlby (1969)</ref> postulated that infants aggregate their experiences with attachment figures into mental representations of these figures. In this way, infants create what he called "internal working models," or representations of their attachment figures, such as their mother and father. In this way, infants can most effectively manifest attachment behaviors, learning from experience and mobilizing effective strategies to implement their attachment behavior system to best maintain their attachment bond <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Cassidy, 1999)</ref>. Informed by these early attachment relationships, the child builds an internal model for his or herself in relationships with others that persist through adolescence and adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bowlby, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Zimmerman, 2004)</ref>. Thus, although initially used to describe early relationships, attachment theory states that attachment style continues to dictate the formation and maintenance of adult relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Bowlby, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Fraley &amp; Shaver, 2000)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Bowlby (1969)</ref> theorized that these early attachment relationships help to form a child"s enduring style of attachment, which can impact relationships and personality characteristics throughout later development and the life span. He focused on the quality of this initial child-caretaker bond, and emphasized the level of security that the child feels in the world and in exploration thereof <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bowlby, 1969)</ref>. This level of security was theorized to persist as the child grew older, and applied to other important relationships throughout his or her life <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bowlby, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Zimmerman, 2004)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Kenny and Rice (1995)</ref> reviewed relevant research in applying attachment theory to the developmental challenges of what <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Arnett (2000)</ref> later conceptualized as the emerging adulthood stage.</p><p>Essentially, they theorized that parental attachment plays an important role in the developmental processes of late adolescents in college, especially in their identity development, social behavior, and interpersonal relationships. <ref type="bibr">Wei, Russel, and Zakalik (2005)</ref> stated that research supports the link between attachment and social competency as well as social self-efficacy, finding in their study that high attachment avoidance and anxiety were associated with lower levels of social self-efficacy. Healthier adult attachment has also been associated with better college adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Lapsley &amp; Edgerton, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Mattanah et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr">), psychosocial adjustment (DiTommaso et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Engels et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Hiester et al., 2009)</ref>, greater self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Kenny &amp; Sirin, 2006)</ref>, and increased interpersonal competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(DiTommaso et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Engels et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">Ross &amp; Fuertes, 2010)</ref>. A growing body of research supports the central role of attachment style in major developmental processes of emerging adults, so attachment theory will be used as an additional theoretical lens through which to view this investigation into the relationships between personality characteristics, interpersonal competency, and online social behavior in the present study.</p><p>Building on prior work with early <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ainsworth et al., 1978)</ref> and adult <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987)</ref> attachment relationships, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Bartholomew and Horowitz (1991)</ref>  Although the empirical support for these four attachment styles is stronger for the theoretically predicted views of self than views of others, overall this theoretical framework of adult attachment styles has sound support and is useful in understanding adult relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Pietromonaco &amp; Barrett, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Moving past <ref type="bibr">Hazan and Shaver"s (1987)</ref> category model of individual differences in adult attachment styles, and expanding on <ref type="bibr">Bartholomew and Horowitz"s (1991)</ref> fourcategory model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Brennan et al. (1998)</ref> proposed a two-component, dimensional model of attachment (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Their model defined two orthogonal dimensions, called "anxiety" and "avoidance," on which an individual can vary from "low" to "high" on these two continuums, and this is how researchers often conceptualize attachment style today <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Rholes et al., 2008)</ref>. The anxiety dimension reflects "the extent to which the attachment system is activated in times of environmental or relationship threat or stress" and the avoidance dimension "reflects the degree to which closeness with an attachment figure is desired" <ref type="bibr">(Rholes et al., 2008, p. 120)</ref>. For example, people with low avoidance and low anxiety are considered to be more securely attached, while a person with high avoidance and low anxiety would exhibit a dismissing-avoidant attachment style. In this way, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Brennan et al. (1998)</ref> provided a more refined way of conceptualizing the four-category model of attachment on the two orthogonal, continuous dimensions of anxiety and avoidance.</p><p>In adhering to a defined search methodology, the specific actions outlined in Appendix A were followed to complete the search process for this literature review. The primary online bibliographic databases selected in this literature search were PsychINFO and ERIC, both hosted by CSA Illumina <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(ProQuest, 2011</ref>). An extensive search of the database thesauruses was conducted in order to identify the relevant descriptor terms and keywords for use in the search; all terms used are listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Next, I established practical screening criteria: a) only peer-reviewed sources were included in the literature search b) publication year for sources ranged from 1985 to 2011 c) articles were published in English. I chose this range of publication years for the included articles as this range will best capture the research linking the more modern conceptualizations of communication theory with more current manifestations of social behavior in the generations of young people developing into emerging adults. <ref type="bibr">Arnett"s (2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">2004)</ref> theory claims that this developmental stage evolved from the unique set of evolving social circumstances and demographic factors that began changing noticeably from approximately the early to mid 1980"s <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Arnett, 2000)</ref>. Thus, the research conducted throughout this time period is also most relevant to the present investigation centering on emerging adults. The defined search terms were combined in numerous searches in various combinations as outlined in the search strategy document detailed in Appendix B.</p><p>Throughout this process, references cited in sources captured by the search were examined and relevant articles included in the search. Lastly, specific journals, review articles, and meta-analyses were reviewed for relevant sources and were included in the search.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> Descriptor especially in interpersonal communication and social behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Gordon et al., 2007)</ref>, and often prefer online resources to offline resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Ogan, Ozakca, &amp; Groshek, 2008)</ref>. In fact, teenagers and emerging adults are increasingly incorporating the Internet and online social networking sites into essential psychosocial developmental tasks such as peer relations <ref type="bibr">(Subrahmanyam et al., 2008)</ref>, sexuality, and identity development <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Manago et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">Subrahmanyam &amp; Greenfield, 2008)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Peluchette and Karl (2010)</ref> found that students made an active decision about what image to portray on their Facebook profiles, and that they accurately portrayed their intended image through the content that they chose to post on their account profiles. In this way, emerging adults are increasingly integrating the online environment and social networking sites specifically into important aspects of their development, especially in social behavior and interpersonal communication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Boyd and Ellison (2007)</ref> defined Social Networking Sites (SNS) as web sites providing users with a suite of services designed to create an online profile describing them, define a list of other users with whom a social connection has been established, and access the profiles and defined lists of other users within the web site. Although each site manifests these features in a slightly different way, these factors are considered common across all SNS. These services combine to form what these authors call a user"s "social networks," which represent a web of interconnected individuals all with some shared social connection. Facebook can be considered a SNS, as it offers users a forum for creating and presenting a personal profile that represents their identity. In addition, it emphasizes the interconnection of users" profiles, linking each person"s page to others who share a social connection. Lastly, users can explore the profiles and social networks of other users. Facebook use was reconceptualized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Ellison et al. (2007)</ref> to incorporate a user"s emotional connection to and reliance on the site, reemerging as a definition of Facebook use intensity.

In this way, a trait can be thought of as a general disposition or a tendency to think, react, and act in given ways.

In the present study, I defined interpersonal communication competency, or communicative competence, through the lens of a Hierarchical communications theory within the Theories of Message Production family of communications theories. This theoretical framework views interpersonal competency as consisting of "procedural knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction, including low-level knowledge," as competent communicators coordinate these multiple levels of action smoothly within a well-timed performance in a given social interaction <ref type="bibr">(Wilson &amp; Sabee, 2003, p. 24)</ref>. Relying on <ref type="bibr">Green"s (1997)</ref> later revisions of Action Assembly Theory, this Hierarchical model sees communicators as unconsciously developing an "associative network model" in long-term memory with each node in the network comprised of a procedural record of "knowledge underlying behavior" <ref type="bibr">(Wilson &amp; Sabee, 2003, p. 26</ref>). These procedural records form "interconnected nodes representing features of actions, outcomes, and situations" (p. 26) that contain all the knowledge and procedures necessary to carry out social actions from specific muscle movements in the face, to more abstract plans for social behavior.</p><p>Competent communicators can effectively implement these programs for action, from general procedures for achieving social goals to the basic words, muscle movements, and ideas needed to achieve social communication goals. With increasing competence, individuals will be able to integrate these action programs together smoothly, stitching together a well-timed social performance that becomes effective communication. A competent communicator effectively integrates and implements stored programs (composed of knowledge and procedures) in order to communicate effectively.</p><p>The individual might choose impactful words spoken clearly and without interruption, pairing them with an expressive gesture and a telling facial expression to communicate a specific meaning and emotional content. Thus, it is in the selection, implementation, and coordination of these programs for action, as well as how one adjusts these actions in response to feedback from the social environment, that determines one"s level of interpersonal competency <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">(Wilson &amp; Sabee, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Communication skills are essential to developing meaningful relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Bruch, Berko &amp; Haase, 1998)</ref> and interpersonal relationships play a major role in psychological wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Diener &amp; Ryan, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Masten et al.

Interpersonal competence has even been studied in relation to the FFM personality traits, as <ref type="bibr">Kanning"s (2006)</ref> German translation of the ICQ found higher values in all social competence subscales as subjects reported higher extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness, and lower neuroticism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">Wolf, Spinath, Riemann, and Angleitner (2009)</ref> found significant relationships between FFM traits and self-monitoring, an important skill in social behavior. Ratings on the ICQ have been shown to be positively related to selfperceptions of level of engagement in conversations <ref type="bibr">(Miller &amp; deWinstanley, 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Hargie and Dickson (2006)</ref> reported that many personality traits may play a role in interpersonal communication. For example, they present initial evidence that, compared to extroverted individuals, introverts tend to talk less frequently with less eye contact and more pauses in conversation.</p><p>Communication competence has been shown to play an important role in close relationships as well and attachment style may be significantly related to these social skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">(Rholes et al., 2008)</ref>. Individuals with higher levels of avoidance have difficulty becoming close to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Bartholomew &amp; Horowitz, 1991)</ref> and disclosed less about themselves while anxiously attached individuals are more dissatisfied with interpersonal interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Bradford et al., 2002)</ref>. In addition, anxious and avoidant people have lower expectations about the availability of emotional support from others in close relationships and report less satisfaction from the social support they actually receive <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anders &amp; Tucker, 2000)</ref>. These results suggest that perceptions of support can significantly impact relationships and that attachment style may contribute significantly. Some researchers have even linked secure early attachments to greater interpersonal social skills in later childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">(Wood, Emmerson, &amp; Cowan, 2004)</ref>, especially with close friendships <ref type="bibr">(Schulman et al., 1994)</ref>.</p><p>For college-aged emerging adults, friendships are often their most important relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">(Welch &amp; Houser, 2010)</ref>. As media, and especially SNS, are increasingly involved in emerging adults" social interactions, researchers have begun to investigate how interpersonal communication via social media is impacted by personality variables such as attachment <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Jin &amp; Peña, 2010)</ref>. These authors found that communication via cellular phone was significantly related to attachment style, as avoidant college students used voice calls less in communicating with their romantic partner. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Buote, Wood, and Pratt (2009)</ref> investigated the role of attachment style in online communication via SNS.</p><p>They found that insecure individuals reported lower friendship quality, and that attachment style uniquely affected online and offline relationships. Taking all these results together, it appears important to investigate the role that interpersonal communication competency and personality traits play in the platonic relationships of emerging adults which often play out online.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpersonal Communication Competence and Online Social Behavior</head><p>Although no research has investigated the link between interpersonal communication competence and Facebook specifically, support for the link between social competence and online social behavior has recently begun to emerge in the literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Ellison et al. (2007)</ref> found that Facebook use was positively associated with increased bridging and maintained social capital, or the "resources accumulated through the relationships among people" (p. 1145). These results suggest that Facebook use may be associated with positive relational outcomes, such as increases in social connectedness and integration into a college community. <ref type="bibr">Mazer et al. (2008)</ref> investigated the relationship between self-disclosure and Facebook use, finding that teacher selfdisclosure on Facebook was associated with student learning outcomes and may encourage student communication and can build a stronger teacher-student relationship.</p><p>In fact, computer-mediated communication may actually foster self-disclosure as internet users may be "better able to express and effectively convey important aspects of their real selves over the Internet" <ref type="bibr">(McKenna et al., 2002, p. 29)</ref>. These authors propose that individuals with decreased social skills may find forming relationships over the internet easier than in face-to-face interactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Ledbetter (2010)</ref> supports these results as well, finding that communication competence plays a role in an individual"s attitude towards online self-disclosure.</p><p>However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">Valkenburg and Peter (2008)</ref> stated that as of 2008, only three studies have investigated the association between online communication and interpersonal communication competence, while their results suggested a positive association between online communication and social competence in the real world. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Caplan (2005)</ref> found that social skills were related to online social behavior, with decreased social skills with selfpresentation being associated with increased interaction online. Similarly, Engelberg and</p><p>Sjoberg"s ( <ref type="formula">2004</ref>) results suggested that decreased social competence was associated with increased internet communication for social purposes. Lastly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Harman et al. (2005)</ref> results suggest that time spent online in general was not associated with changes in level of social skills for the children under study, but that misrepresentation of one"s identity online was related to poor social skills. Thus, although still inchoate and nascent, there is growing evidence supporting the link between interpersonal communication competence, social interaction skills, and online social behavior and communication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Self-Efficacy</head><p>Social self-efficacy is another way to conceptualize a person"s perceptions of their own interpersonal communication competence. <ref type="bibr">Bandura"s (1997)</ref> theory of self-efficacy has received widespread attention and empirical support from counseling psychologists <ref type="bibr">(Gore, 2006)</ref> as a prominent aspect of his social cognitive theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bandura, 1986)</ref>. He</p><p>postulates that beliefs about one"s own abilities to be successful within a given domain of tasks (e.g., math exams, making career decisions) impacts performance in and motivation to complete those activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bandura, 1986)</ref>. These expectations about our own abilities to be successful form our self-efficacy beliefs in a domain, which significantly influences our decision to initiate a behavior, motivation to spend energy completing the behavior, and dedication to overcome obstacles in order to successfully complete that behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bandura, 1986)</ref>. In this way, how we think about our own skills in a given area influences how we actually use associated behavioral skills. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bandura (1997)</ref> theorized that the strength or level of self-efficacy beliefs would contribute significantly to a person"s motivation to complete a given task and their persistence therein. He identified four means for strengthening or weakening selfefficacy: emotional arousal, verbal persuasion, vicarious experiences, and performance accomplishments <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bandura, 1997)</ref>. Performance accomplishments act essentially as a feedback loop, in that perceived success with performing a task will strengthen selfefficacy expectations for that task; this also forms the most effective method of impacting self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bandura, 1997)</ref>. Vicarious experiences take the form of social modeling, in that observing another person being successful with a task increases our own self-efficacy expectations for the same task. Verbal persuasion often takes the form of support and encouragement from respected peers or attachment figures, and serves to bolster our own self-efficacy beliefs. Lastly, our psychological state or level or emotional arousal can impact self-efficacy beliefs as negative or positive emotions can affect our thought process and thus our self-efficacy beliefs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Sherer et al. (1982)</ref> published the term "social self-efficacy" shortly after Bandura created his self-efficacy theory, and used it to describe a component factor in developing their general self-efficacy scale. However, this scale"s disappointing psychometrics (e.g., = .71 and weak factor analysis results), wide scope which conflicts with self-efficacy"s domain specificity, and the lack of research on social self-efficacy with adult populations makes this construct largely underexplored until recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Fan, Meng, Gao, Lopez, &amp; Liu, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Smith &amp; Betz, 2000)</ref>. Therefore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Smith and Betz (2000)</ref> developed a novel social self-efficacy scale in order to measure one"s self-efficacy in the specific domain of social behavior, or one"s confidence in being successful in social interactions. It was designed to capture a person"s confidence in their social skills in various domains and was shown to be significantly negatively related to measures of social anxiety and shyness as might be expected. Thus, social self-efficacy represents another way to operationalize interpersonal competence, as it seems to capture perceived confidence in one"s abilities at interpersonal communication.</p><p>Social self-efficacy has been linked to psychosocial functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Hermann &amp; Betz, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Smith &amp; Betz, 2002)</ref> and relational competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Caprara, Gerbino, Paciello, Di Giunta, &amp; Pastorelli, 2010)</ref> and may play an important role in the development of interpersonal resources "needed to cope successfully with transition into adulthood" (p.</p><p>44). In studying college students, <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">Wei et al. (2005)</ref> found that social self-efficacy mediates the relationship between attachment and psychosocial functioning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Corcoran and Mallinckrodt (2000)</ref> also found that social self-efficacy mediates the empirically supported relationship between attachment and conflict management skills in adults. <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Mallinckrodt and Wei (2005)</ref> supported these results, as their survey study of 430 college students suggested that both attachment anxiety and avoidance were negatively associated with social self-efficacy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">Wei et al. (2005)</ref> explained this association through attachment theory, stating that negative working models of self in anxiously attached individuals explain decreased confidence in interpersonal interactions. In addition, they explained that avoidant individuals have learned through early attachment relationships that self-disclosure risks the pain of rejection and so expect less from self-disclosure and become overly self-reliant.</p><p>A number of studies have linked attachment styles directly to social skills and interpersonal competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(DiTommaso et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Engels et al., 2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">DiTommaso et al. (2003)</ref> found that attachment was related to specific social skills, especially emotional expressivity; in addition, the results also suggested that more securely attached individuals exhibit a more balanced set of social skills, while insecurely attached individuals showed disproportionate levels of social skills. <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">Wright and Perrone (2010)</ref> found that attachment was significantly related to social self-efficacy, results supported by recent research which suggested that high levels of anxiety and avoidance are related to decreases in social competency <ref type="bibr">(Mallinckdrot &amp; Wei, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b227">Wei et al., 2005)</ref>. Thus, attachment has consistently been found to be associated with interpersonal competence, but future research must investigate how other stable personality traits are related as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Conclusions and Support for Research</head><p>A systematic, explicit, comprehensive and reproducible literature search was performed following a defined methodology. The results were synthesized and integrated using both emerging adulthood and attachment theory as two developmental theoretical lenses. Although potentially limited by selection criteria, search strategy, and errors in synthesizing sources, this review attempted to yield a comprehensive overview of the relevant published scholarly literature related to attachment, FFM personality traits, interpersonal communication competency, social self-efficacy, and Facebook use.</p><p>Many psychological theories of development see adolescence and the transition into young adulthood as primarily concerned with questions of identity, interpersonal relationships, finding a sense of place in the world, and occupational roles (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Erikson, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Levinson, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Keniston, 1971</ref>). <ref type="bibr">Arnett"s (2000)</ref> emerging adulthood theory has become a useful way to conceptualize the development of young adults in the modern era, focusing on the period after the transition from adolescents into young adulthood.</p><p>Attachment theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bowlby, 1969)</ref> provides another useful theoretical lens through which to view developmental processes, especially those concerned with interpersonal relationships.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of Literature Review</head><p>This literature review may suffer from a number of limitations. In creating an a priori methodology for conducting this research literature review, I established a number of criterion for inclusion that may have limited the sources available for review. In this way, using the two selected databases may have limited the number of sources available.</p><p>The search used a defined list of descriptors and keywords and employed specific strategies such as reference branching and examining literature reviews, all of which may have unintentionally excluded sources relevant to the research questions. In addition, the search methodology"s established practical exclusion criteria that all sources gathered through the online bibliographic databases had to be published after 1985 in peerreviewed, English journals may have unnecessarily excluded sources. Additionally, this review may have suffered from the "file drawer" phenomenon, in that many studies that Therefore, this study investigated relationships among latent constructs in an attempt to contribute to the established literature by creating a model that explains the interrelationships between personality traits, interpersonal competence, and online social behavior.</p><p>Based on the review of relevant literature, I hypothesized a primary theoretical model and an alternate model relating attachment and FFM traits to interpersonal competence and Facebook use (See Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>; models specified in detail below in the Data Analyses section). In order to test this primary theoretical model, I employed structural equation modeling (SEM) procedures in order to determine the viability of these theorized relationships between unobserved, latent variables. Latent variables are used to represent hypothetical constructs based in theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>, such as the construct of adult attachment style. It cannot be observed directly and there is no perfect measure of this construct, therefore in this example, researchers can use observable variables as indirect measures of constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. Therefore, I used observable scale data (obtained from the measures described below) as indirect measured indicators of the constructs of interest in this study. These indirect indicators or measured variables are not perfect measures of the constructs they attempt to represent and are impacted by measurement error. Thus, I used SEM in order to account for the measurement error inherent in the scales used in this study, as SEM presents an effective way of testing the relationships between latent constructs while accounting for measurement error inherent in operationalizing those constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Byrne, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Of <ref type="bibr">Jöreskog"s (1993)</ref> three strategic frameworks for using SEM, I followed the Model Generating (MG) approach, first testing an a priori primary theoretical model for fit to the data, then comparing this model to alternate theoretical models, and, only if no a priori model is retained, using a combination of theory and results from the data to respecify and evaluate a new model. This approach is useful in arriving at a statistically possible model specifying interrelationships among constructs of interest that is also meaningful in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Byrne, 2006)</ref>. As recent research investigating the interrelationships among all the variables of interest in the present study was sparse at best, I used the model generating approach in order to generate a new theoretical model of interrelationships, instead of Jöreskog"s (1993) Strictly Confirmatory and Alternative Models approaches to using SEM. Thus, in the present research I conducted a nonexperimental cross-sectional study using SEM to investigate the statistical plausibility and practical meaning of theoretical models specifying interrelationships between the following latent constructs: adult attachment style, FFM personality traits (extraversion and neuroticism), interpersonal communication competence, and Facebook use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>All of the participants recruited for this study were first year undergraduate students between the ages of 17 and 22. I recruited participants via email from a medium sized (N = 14,000) Rocky Mountain region university, and all data were collected over the internet using a web-based survey through the company SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey, 2011).

The first two questions ask participants about weekly minutes spent logged on and about number of "Facebook friends," for which they can choose between 9 options of custom ranges adapted for each question (e.g., "0=10 or less, 1=11-50"). For the remaining six questions, participants indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with each item using a 5-point Likert-type rating scale ranging from 1 ("Strongly Disagree") to 5 ("Strongly Agree"). These questions include:</p><p>"Facebook has become part of my daily routine," "I feel I am part of the Facebook community," and "I feel out of touch when I haven"t logged onto Facebook for a while."</p><p>As the answer scales have different ranges of anchors (e.g., 1-9 and 1-5), participant responses are standardized before being included in statistics such as means. For the mean score, higher numbers indicate greater engagement with and investment in Facebook use. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Ellison et al. (2007)</ref> in their original study with college-aged adults found a Cronbach"s α reliability coefficient estimate of .83 and provided initial evidence for this provided support for this scale-shortening approach for use with SEM analyses, and suggested selecting items with the highest factor loadings with medium sample sizes (N = 350). Marsh, Hau, Balla and Grayson"s (1998) simulation studies support this approach as well, and suggested that item-level indicators may perform as well as parcels of items, especially when the number of parcels was low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attachment. Adult attachment was measured using The Experiences in Close</head><p>Relationships-Revised scale (ECR-R; <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Fraley, Waller &amp; Brennan, 2000)</ref> using the anxiety and avoidance subscales composed of 18 items each.

For all 36 items, participants rate their level of agreement or disagreement with each question on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 ("Strongly</p><p>Disagree") to 7 ("Strongly Agree"). For the anxiety subscale, questions focus on participants" level of anxiety related to being abandoned in relationships. Sample items for the attachment anxiety construct include: "I worry that I won"t measure up to other people," "I rarely worry about my partner leaving me," and "I"m afraid that I will lose my partner"s love." For the avoidance subscale, items center on how avoidant a person is in his/her behaviors in relationships. Sample items for the attachment avoidance construct include: "I am nervous when partners get too close to me," "I find it easy to depend on romantic partners," and "I get uncomfortable when a romantic partner wants to be very close."

This measure consists of 44 items with 8 to 10 items for each of the 5 trait subscales. Participants rate their level of agreement with each question, using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 ("Disagree Strongly") to 5 ("Agree Strongly"). All the items begin with the stem "I see myself as someone who…" and some sample endings include: "is talkative," "worries a lot," "is reserved," and "is helpful and unselfish with FFM scales that suggest strong convergent and concurrent validity, and discriminant validity, as well as high validity correlations between self and peer ratings of the FFM traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(John et al., 2008)</ref>.

In addition, they compared self-ratings on the ICS subscales to peer ratings of the participant"s interpersonal competence and found moderate convergence levels.</p><p>The measurement model for the construct of interpersonal communication competency originally consisted of the mean scores of each of the five ICS subscales as well as the PSSE mean score (described below).

Another viable way to conceptualize and operationalize perceived interpersonal communication competence, social selfefficacy captures self-beliefs and self-confidence specific to social behavior. This scale was developed with college students and consists of items designed to capture a participant"s confidence in the social interaction skills involved in beginning and sustaining interpersonal relationships. The PSSE contains 25 items covering interaction skills in six different areas from social assertiveness to making friends, and participants rate their confidence in their ability to successfully complete the item"s task on a 5-pointLikert-type scale ranging from 1 ("No confidence at all") to 5 ("Complete confidence"). Sample items include: "Ask a potential friend out for coffee," "Join a lunch or dinner table where people are already sitting and talking," and "Ask someone for help when you need it." Higher mean scores on this scale indicate greater self-efficacy with social behavior involved in initiating and maintaining social relationships. <ref type="bibr">Smith and Betz"s (2000)</ref> original study demonstrated adequate internal consistency for their scale data (Cronbach"s α = .94), test-retest reliability (coefficient of .82 for a 3-week interval), and provided initial support for its validity. They found support for concurrent validity in that PSSE scores demonstrated a strong positive relationship with other measures of social self-efficacy. They found support for construct validity as well, as PSSE scores displayed a strong positive relationship with related measures such as global self-esteem while showing a negative relationship with social anxiety. In addition, PSSE scores were associated with measures of confidence in skills relevant to the Enterprising Holland"s code <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Holland, 1973)</ref>, while less strongly related to confidence in Investigative and Realistic code skills. Thus, this scale is appropriate for use with college students and has demonstrated adequate psychometrics. </p></div>

SEM analyses were conducted following <ref type="bibr">Kline"s (2011)</ref> guidelines for the appropriate steps in an SEM analysis that align with <ref type="bibr">Jöreskog"s (1993)</ref> MG approach to SEM: 1) specify models, 2) assess model identification, 3) operationalize constructs with appropriate measures, and collect and screen the data for factors that may impact the analyses (e.g., assumptions</p><p>underlying SEM, outliers, collinearity), 4) estimate model, 5) respecify model as necessary, 6) report results of model fit, interpret parameter estimates, consider equivalent or alternative models (and repeat the steps as necessary).</p><p>In the first step, I created the primary theoretical model detailed in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, based on the comprehensive literature review conducted in Chapter II. Ample support was found for the interrelationships between attachment style, FFM traits, and interpersonal communication competence, as well as between these variables and SNS use. However, to the best of my knowledge not one study has sought to investigate the interrelationships between all of these variables. These models essentially represent my hypotheses in visual form by indicating interrelationships in a structural regression model <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. These models are basically comprised of a set of equations that "define the model"s parameters, which correspond to presumed relations among observed or latent variables" <ref type="bibr">(Kline, 2011, p. 92)</ref>. In following <ref type="bibr">Kline"s (2011)</ref> recommendations, I also created an alternative model detailed in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> which reflects re-specified changes to the original model that are theoretically plausible as well given the relevant literature reviewed.</p><p>In the primary theoretical model, I hypothesized the pattern of interrelationships among attachment style, Extraversion and Neuroticism, interpersonal competence, and Facebook use intensity. The primary model postulated that attachment was an exogenous variable that directly and positively impacts interpersonal competence (e.g., more securely attached adults, or those scoring lower on the anxiety and avoidance continuums of attachment style, also displayed increased interpersonal competence) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anders &amp; Tucker, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Bippus &amp; Rollin, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Cooley, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Mallinckrodt, 2000)</ref>, and extraversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Backstrom &amp; Holmes, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Carver, 1997)</ref>, directly and negatively affecting neuroticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Backstrom &amp; Holmes, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Carver, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Hagekull &amp; Bohlin, 2003)</ref> as well as indirectly impacting interpersonal competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Guerrero et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Johnson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Rholes et al., 2008)</ref> and interpersonal factors related to Facebook use <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Bradford et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schulman et al., 1994)</ref> through these two FFM traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Picardi et al., 2005)</ref>. In addition, I found ample research support for the direct impact of neuroticism negatively and extraversion positively affecting interpersonal competency <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Berry &amp; Hansen, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Cuperman &amp; Ickes, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ozer &amp; Benet-Martinez, 2006)</ref> and Facebook use intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Amiel &amp; Sargent, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Back et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Correa et al., 2010)</ref>, as well as indirectly affecting Facebook use intensity through the mediating variable of interpersonal competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Caplan, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Engelberg &amp; Sjoberg, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Harman et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Ledbetter, 2010)</ref>. In the primary alternative nested model (see Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>), the direct and positive affect of extraversion and the direct and negative effect of neuroticism on Facebook use intensity are removed to make interpersonal competency a fully mediating variable between extraversion, neuroticism, and attachment on Facebook use intensity.</p><p>In the second step, I evaluated all of the models for their identification status. A model can be considered identified if "it is theoretically possible for the computer to derive a unique estimate of every model parameter" <ref type="bibr">(Kline, 2011, p. 93)</ref>, which in following <ref type="bibr">Kline"s (2011)</ref> guidelines requires that models must have at least 0 degrees of freedom and that every latent variable be assigned a metric. The models that I created all can be considered to be over-identified, because they contain less free parameters to be estimated than observations. To meet the second criteria for identification, I utilized a unit loading identification constraint on one of each latent variable"s direct effect for one of its indicators in order to set the metric, a commonly used technique in SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. Essentially, this makes one indicator a reference variable for each latent variable.</p><p>In the third step, I selected psychometrically strong measurement scales for each of the hypothetical constructs and adapted them for the study"s web-based survey format described above. One of the most frequently used methods for operationalizing a construct and a frequently used variable in the social sciences can be seen as having "a continuous interval-level underlying distribution and a discontinuous ordinal-level observed (measured) distribution" <ref type="bibr">(O"Brien, 1985, p. 265)</ref>. For example, the psychological trait of extraversion theoretically has a continuous distribution from an absence of this trait to full salience of this trait. However, in order to operationalize and measure this trait, scientists can use an ordinal Likert-type scale as an observable indicator of this latent variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">(Yang-Wallentin, Jöreskog &amp; Luo, 2010)</ref>. In choosing measures for use in this study, I took care to select scales with ample support for construct and criterion validity as well as internal consistency for resulting data collected in samples similar to the one used in the present study. Psychometrically strong measures have been highly recommended for SEM analyses in order to yield practically useful model interpretations <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. The score validity for each of the study's measures is described above in the instrumentation section, along with previously obtained reliability estimates for data collected with these measures. In addition, I calculated a Cronbach's alpha coefficient reliability estimate for the data obtained with each of the study's scales (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>_</head><p>Next I proceeded to collect the data as described earlier and imported it into the statistics software program. Data preparation and screening included screening for any potential problems with collinearity, assessing the range for each scale"s data to check for data entry errors and analyzing standardized residuals plots to assess for outliers, assessing for multivariate normality and specification errors as the assumptions underlying SEM, and addressing missing data using the listwise deletion method. I attempted to screen these data for any evidence of collinearity, a potential cause of nonpositive definite data matrices, which adversely affects most estimation algorithms in SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. Squared multiple correlations between each variable and the others included in the analysis were calculated and inspected for values larger than .90, as those larger than this criterion may suggest significant collinearity problems (see correlation matrix in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>), and variance inflation factors (VIF) were inspected for any values greater than 10, which may suggest the presence of redundancy among variables or extreme collinearity <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. I assessed these data for multivariate normality by evaluating the univariate distributions of all continuous variables to check for the normality assumption required by SEM (including skew and kurtosis), along with the scatter plots for each variable to check for the linearity and homoscedasticity assumptions of data analyzed using SEM, and skew and kurtosis greater than the absolute values of 2 and 7, respectively, were considered significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Hoyle, 1995)</ref>. I addressed any missing data using the listwise deletion method in order to avoid underestimation of error variances associated with single-imputation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. Lastly, I checked for gender differences in using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) designed with the gender as the independent variable and each of the study"s scale means as dependent variables in order to test for statistically significant differences between participant gender in the measurement scale data.</p><p>To conduct the SEM analysis, evaluate model fit, and interpret parameter estimates, I used the program EQS, Release 6.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Bentler, 2008)</ref>. After importing, preparing, and screening the data as described above, I began by specifying my primary</p><p>and alternate theoretical models in the EQS program. Then I followed a two-step process for conducting SEM analyses by first analyzing and estimating the fit to the data with the measurement models and then analyzing and estimating the measurement and structural models together <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. In this approach, the researcher first conducts confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on each scale and its indicators in order to evaluate the fit of the observed indicators to the latent constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">(Weston &amp; Gore, 2006)</ref>. In this way, the full theoretical model can be treated as a CFA measurement model so that the researcher can evaluate and focus on the measurement aspects of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. In the second step, the researcher conducts model estimation and evaluation of the full structural model, which focuses on the theoretical relationships among latent variables and test for the significance of the structured paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">(Weston &amp; Gore, 2006)</ref>. The primary theoretical model can also then be compared to the alternate models using the chi-squared difference test, which evaluates potential statistical significance of "decrement in overall fit as free parameters are eliminated or the improvement in fit as free parameters are added" <ref type="bibr">(Kline, 2011, p. 215)</ref>. In essence, the chi-squared difference test assesses the statistical significance of change in model fit upon adding or removing structural paths <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">(Weston &amp; Gore, 2006)</ref>. Thus I repeated the remaining steps that follow, first for the measurement model and then for the full structural models.</p><p>In the fourth step, I estimated the primary theoretical model detailed in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, and evaluated the results for overall model fit, assessed the practical meaning of parameter estimates, and interpreted parameter relationships. The most common default method for estimating parameters is based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation method, the assumptions of which include that the variables included as observations approximate normal distributions and that the variables are continuous in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Byrne, 2006)</ref>. A number of simulation studies have found that Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation when treating ordinal data as ordinal instead of as continuous produces more accurate estimates of parameters and standard errors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Babakus, Ferguson, &amp; Jöreskog, 1987)</ref> but can potentially produce biased fit statistics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Johnson and Creech (1983)</ref> echoed these results in their study suggesting that the categorization errors that often accompany the use of ordinal data create bias in SEM models with multiple indicators, although they did not find a great deal of distortion in parameter estimates.</p><p>These conclusions and recommendations by researchers seem to hold true proportionally to the degree of non-normality in the data: when ordinal data begins to deviate from the ML estimator"s normality assumption results become increasingly biased <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(DiStefano, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>However, estimation methods that seem to best address ordinal type data such as Weighted Least Squares (WLS) often have exacting restrictions that detract from their usefulness (e.g., high number of subjects) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Byrne, 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Bentler and Chih-Ping (1987)</ref> suggested that ML can be used with ordinal data that approximates a normal distribution as long as multiple fit indicators are used to assessment global fit. Green, Akey, Fleming, Hershberger and Marquis" (1997) results support the use of ML with ordinal data when the scales contain a greater number of categories and the distributions of resulting data approximate normal distributions. The chi-squared statistic appears to become biased primarily when the data display significant non-normality <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Hutchinson &amp; Olmos, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Muthen &amp; Kaplan, 1992)</ref>. Therefore, I will treat the data as continuous and use ML to estimate my theoretical model if the data collected display reasonable normality, and treat the data as ordinal and use Robust ML with the Satorra-Bentler chi-squared statistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(Satorra &amp; Bentler, 1988)</ref> if the data displays significant nonnormality, following recommended guidelines for significant skew and kurtosis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Hoyle (1995)</ref>.</p><p>Approximate fit indices are another method for evaluating the fit between a hypothesized model and observed relationships in the data. They are different from standard test statistics in that they are not used to test a hypothesis, but are treated as continuous statistics reflecting the degree of fit between model and data. The Comparative Fit Index (CFI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Bentler, 1990)</ref> and the Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Bentler &amp; Bonett, 1980)</ref> have been shown to be less affected by nonnormality in data <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Hutchinson &amp; Olmos, 1998</ref>) when using ML estimation and are used to assess the "goodness of fit" between the structural model and the null model <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. They range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better fit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Hutchinson and Olmos (1998)</ref> also recommended using the Steiger-Lind root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Steiger, 1990)</ref> and the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Bentler, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1986)</ref>, as they were less affected by sample size or model size and complexity. Although still scaled from 0 to 1, these two approximate fit indices are used to indicate "badness of fit" between the model and the data where lower values indicate less misfit between model and data. The RMSEA can be considered a parsimony-adjusted index, meaning that its value decreases with greater number of degrees of freedom <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Beauducel and Wittmann (2005)</ref> investigated fit statistics in models with a small degree of misspecification, as is often found in social psychology research using scales, such as with personality trait measures. This study was meant as an adjunct to the classic work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Hu and Bentler (1999)</ref>, which is commonly used as a reference for fit statistic cutoff criterion, and suggested a raised incremental fit statistics" cutoff criteria of .95 for goodness of fit indexes (e.g., CFI &amp; NNFI). <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Beauducel and Wittmann (2005)</ref> describe how Hu and Bentler (1999) used higher secondary loadings in their models, which is often not the case for those found in personality trait scale psychometrics which are often significantly lower given the complexity of the hypothetical constructs under study (e.g., neuroticism). These new results suggest that incremental fit indices may be less likely to accept models in personality research contexts, as "there will always be some small distortion of simple structure" <ref type="bibr">(Beauducel &amp; Wittmann, 2005, p. 72</ref>) and when the loadings are small (e.g., .40 or .50) as is the case with many trait measurement scales.</p><p>Thus, they recommend using the RMSEA and SRMR, as well as their use in combination as outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Hu and Bentler (1999)</ref> , when conducting research on personality traits using scale data.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Kline's (2011)</ref> recommendations for evaluating model fit, I calculated the model chi-squared statistic along with its degrees of freedom and p value. A nonsignificant chi-squared statistic would indicate perfect model fit of the observed covariances <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b230">Weston &amp; Gore, 2006)</ref>. However, in studies with fairly large sample sizes, this exact fit method for evaluating model fit using the chi-squared statistic</p><p>In the sixth and final step, I followed established guidelines (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Kline, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b230">Weston &amp; Gore, 2006)</ref> in reporting the results in Chapter 4 from this multi-step SEM analysis. These results included the overall model fit statistics described above and used in evaluating the fit of the model to the data as well as unstandardized and standardized parameter estimates first for the measurement model and then for the full structural models along with their accompanying t statistics and standard errors. In addition, I reported all chi-squared statistics used in chi-squared difference tests used to compare decrement or improvement in fit between the models. Lastly, I reported all specific model modifications made in re-specifying the primary theoretical model and all results from the data used in making these decisions (e.g., modification indices).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Of the 630 Participants who completed the study informed consent process, 619 reported having a Facebook.com account and were included in the study. Two participants (ages 29 and 30) were then excluded as they were not considered to be emerging adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Arnett, 2000)</ref>, which yielded 617 participants that were included in the study. Based on this final sample, 439 reported being female (71.2%) and 177 reported being male (28.7%); gender was not reported for one participant. The mean age of the sample was 18.43 (SD = 1.041; range of 17 -26), and 72.9% identified as Caucasian, 11% Multiple races/ethnicities, 9.2% Hispanic, 4.5% African American, 1.3% Asian American, .5% Native American, and .3% Pacific Islander. Due to attrition from participants deciding to exit the web-based survey before completing it by closing their web browser, data from 456 participants were available for all the study variables using listwise deletion, as missing data were not considered missing completely at random.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection of Indicators Using Exploratory Factor Analysis</head><p>I first submitted all the items comprising the BFI Extraversion (8 items) and</p><p>Neuroticism (8 items) subscales to two separate exploratory factor analyses (EFA) in order to select the four items from each subscale with the highest loadings as indicators for subsequent CFA analyses. According to guidelines published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Mundfrom, Shaw, and Ke (2005)</ref> for an EFA with a variables-to-factors ratio of 6, low communality, and a coefficient of congruence K &gt; .98 (meets "excellent" criteria), the sample size clearly meets and exceeds the minimum requirement of 200 participants. Descriptive statistics and correlations among all the continuous variables used in the CFA/SEM analyses are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>. For the Extraversion subscale, data were available from 588 participants after listwise deletion of missing data due to omitted responses, and I utilized a maximum likelihood extraction method while forcing the extraction of 1 factor. All items displayed skew and kurtosis values within acceptable ranges (skew &lt; 2, kurtosis &lt; 7) <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Hoyle, 1995)</ref>, there was no evidence of collinearity in these data, and both the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure (KMO = .870) and Bartlett"s Test of Sphericity (p &lt; .001)</p><p>supported the factorability of these data <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">(Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001)</ref>. Factor 1 had an Eigenvalue of 4.060 and accounted for 50.752% of the variance, the factor matrix coefficients for the included items are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref>. Based on these analyses, BFI items 36, 21, 1, and 31 were used as indicators for the Extraversion latent construct in subsequent CFA/SEM analyses.</p><p>For the BFI Neuroticism subscale, data were available from 584 participants after listwise deletion of missing data due to omitted responses, and I utilized a maximum likelihood extraction methods and forced the extraction of 1 factor. There was no evidence of collinearity in these data, all of these items displayed skew and kurtosis values within acceptable ranges (skew &lt; 2, kurtosis &lt; 7), and both the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure (KMO = .828) and Bartlett"s Test of Sphericity (p &lt; .001) supported the factorability of these data <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">(Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001)</ref>. Factor 1 had an Eigenvalue of 3.389 and accounted for 42.358% of the variance; the factor matrix coefficients for the included items are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref>. Based on these analyses, BFI items 9, 19, 14, and analyses. for the Facebook Use construct items 5, 7, and 4 were used as indicators.</p><p>To select the three items with the highest loadings for the Facebook Use Intensity scale for use as indicators of the latent construct Facebook use in later SEM analyses, this scale"s 8 items were subjected to an EFA using maximum likelihood extraction methods.</p><p>Using available data from 614 participants due to omitted responses, both the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure (KMO = .866) and Bartlett"s Test of Sphericity (p &lt; .001)</p><p>supported the factorability of these data <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">(Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001)</ref>, while all skew and kurtosis values for these items fell within acceptable ranges (skew &lt; 2, kurtosis &lt; 7) and there was no evidence of collinearity. Only 1 factor was extracted, had an Eigenvalue of 4.053, and explained approximately 50.657% of the variance; the factor matrix coefficients for these items are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref>. Although the a priori model specified that the first two more factual items from this scale would be used as indicators, as well as the mean of the remaining six items, these results suggested that the first two items were actually the weakest items measuring the construct of Facebook use in this sample.</p><p>In addition, the statement contents for items 3 and 5 were essentially redundant, and so item 3 was excluded as a potential indicator. Given these results, the highest loading items 5, 7, and 4, were used as indicators for Facebook use in subsequent CFA/SEM analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model Confirmatory Factor Analysis Results</head><p>After selecting the indicators for the Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Facebook Use constructs, I followed <ref type="bibr">Byrne"s (2006)</ref> guidelines in conducting confirmatory factor analyses to evaluate the fit of the observed indicators to the data for the measurement model for each latent construct. Each CFA was conducted using Robust methods ML, while treating the data as continuous, and fit was assessed using the ideal, conservative guidelines described in Chapter III (χ 2 /df &lt; 3, NNFI and CFI &gt; .95, SRMR &lt; .08, and RMSEA close to .06), and the less stringent guidelines suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">Weston and Gore (2006)</ref> (NNFI and CFI &gt; .90); the results for each model are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">4</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>. The Attachment construct was not subjected to a CFA due to the model being under-identified, however, these two subscales have previously been used successfully in structural models to measure this latent construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">(Wright &amp; Perrone, 2010)</ref>, and this measure has previously demonstrated excellent psychometrics when used with samples of college-aged adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Fairchild &amp; Finney, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Sibley &amp; Liu, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">Sibley et al., 2005)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr">(Byrne, 2006, p. 199)</ref>. The largest standardized residual from these data was .256, and parameter estimates were all statistically significant and practically meaningful which suggested good component fit; overall model fit statistics are shown in  <ref type="bibr">(Byrne, 2006, p. 199)</ref>. The largest standardized residual from these data was -.048, and parameter estimates were all statistically significant and practically meaningful which suggested good component fit;</p><p>overall model fit statistics are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref>. The results from model 1 suggested that this measurement model demonstrated good fit to the data, with approximate fit statistics falling within acceptable ranges: RMSEA = .023 (90% confidence interval of .001 -.113), CFI = .999, and a χ 2 SB which was not statistically significant (p = .257), and suggested good exact model fit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Equation Model Results</head><p>After assessing the fit of the measurement models, the full structural model was submitted to structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses using the measurement models specified above (using the modified measurement models where indicated). Data were available from 456 participants using listwise deletion due to omitted responses, which far surpassed the minimum requirement of 200 for most SEM applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>, and was the approximate ideal sample size of 460 for the original theoretical model calculated from <ref type="bibr">Jackson"s (2003)</ref> more conservative formula for computing sample size with SEM analyses. The revised full structural equation model (see Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>) was submitted to SEM analyses using the previously established measurement models, using</p><p>Robust ML and treating these data as continuous. The largest standardized residual from these data was .352, skew (ranged from -.925 to .591) and kurtosis (ranged from -1.068 to .302) statistics all fell within acceptable ranges, and 2 cases were removed due to large relative contributions to normalized multivariate kurtosis (cases 43 and 156) based on "strikingly different" estimates produced by EQS compared to all the other cases analyzed <ref type="bibr">(Byrne, 2006, p. 199)</ref>  .116</p><p>Model 2 was submitted to SEM analysis with these additional two freed parameters and the three structural paths removed. The results of model 2 are displayed in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>, and suggested marginal fit to the data (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">6</ref>), and so model modifications were made based on unusually large univariate Lagrange Multiplier test statistics, which suggested the addition of two error covariances between the BFI item 36</p><p>and ICQ Initiation subscale mean score, as well as between BFI items 31 and 21. In addition, one case was removed due to its unusually large relative contributions to normalized multivariate kurtosis (case 339). The results from Model 3 are displayed in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>, and suggested adequate to good fit to the data (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">6</ref>). The χ 2 statistic for exact model fit can be overly sensitive and biased by a number of model characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>, and thus I used the revised criteria of χ 2 /df &lt; 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Iacobucci, 2010)</ref>. Although the χ 2 SB was statistically significant, suggesting inexact fit, the χ 2 SB /df ratio of 2.85 was &lt; 3, and therefore met the revised criteria. The RMSEA was .064 (90% confidence interval of .056 -.072), which meets the criteria of being close to .06. The SRMR was .070, which meets and exceeds the criteria of being less than .08, the CFI was .926, and the NNFI was .910. Although these values were less than the predetermined cutoff criteria of &gt;.95 for these fit statistics, they still meet <ref type="bibr">Hu and Bentler"s (1999)</ref> criteria for being close to .95 for adequate fit. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">Weston and Gore (2006)</ref> suggested using less stringent criteria for samples less than 500 (CFI &gt; .90, NNFI &gt; .90). Given the complexity of the model, the number of parameters to be estimated, and taking all the fit statistics together, this final primary model (model 3, Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>) demonstrated adequate to good overall fit to the data. In addition, this model demonstrated good component fit, as all parameter estimates were statistically significant and practically meaningful (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">7</ref>).  <ref type="bibr">, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ozer &amp; Benet-Martinez, 2006)</ref> and Facebook use intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Back et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Correa et al., 2010)</ref>, as well as indirectly associated with Facebook use intensity through the mediating variable of interpersonal competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Caplan, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Engelberg &amp; Sjoberg, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Harman et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Ledbetter, 2010)</ref>. The alternate model (see Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> and 9) posited equally plausible relationships given the available research on these constructs, with the direct effects between Extraversion and Neuroticism and Facebook use removed to make interpersonal competency a full mediator between the personality traits and Facebook use in this model. Therefore, the following research questions were created to evaluate two theoretical models that explained the interrelationships among attachment, Extraversion and Neuroticism, interpersonal competency, and Facebook use intensity:</p><p>Q1 Does a primary theoretical explanatory model (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) adequately fit the observed relationships in the data, conceptualized with attachment directly and positively affecting extraversion and interpersonal competency, directly and negatively impacting neuroticism while indirectly affecting Facebook use intensity through these mediating variables, with extraversion positively and neuroticism negatively and directly impacting interpersonal competency and Facebook use intensity while indirectly affecting Facebook use intensity through interpersonal competency, and with interpersonal competency directly and positively affecting Facebook use intensity?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q2</head><p>Does the primary theoretical model demonstrate statistically better fit to the observed interrelationships between these constructs in the data than the alternate model (see Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>) which removes the direct effects of Extraversion and Neuroticism on Facebook use, making interpersonal communication competency a full mediator between personality traits and Facebook use intensity?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attachment Style</head><p>In evaluating the final primary a priori model (see Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>), the results from these data supported the theoretical links between attachment style and the FFM personality traits Extraversion and Neuroticism. Similar to both earlier work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Carver, 1997)</ref> and later work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Backstrom &amp; Holmes, 2001)</ref> supporting similar results, the present study found significant relationships between attachment style and these two FFM personality traits. Specifically, the results indicated that insecure attachment style was positively associated with Neuroticism and negatively associated with Extraversion, with approximately equal strengths in both of these relationships. In addition, insecure attachment style was negatively related to interpersonal competency, results which align well with previous research linking more secure attachment and greater competence with effective communication skills <ref type="bibr">(Cooney et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Jang et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Pietromonaco et al., 2004)</ref>, even when focusing on nonverbal communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">(Tucker &amp; Anders, 1998)</ref> and when using distinctly naturalistic methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Kafetsios &amp; Nezlek, 2002)</ref>. Additionally, more secure attachment has been shown to be related to concepts closely related to interpersonal competency, such as perceptions of social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Bernardon et al., 2011)</ref> and relationship satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">(Welch &amp; Houser, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>These results also follow theoretical predictions based on Bowlby"s (1969) attachment theory, as attachment style was postulated to be significantly related to interpersonal skills as well as confidence and comfort in forming close relationships. For example, less securely attached individuals would be expected to have less interpersonal competence and exhibit greater difficulties in forming close relationships (see below for a full discussion of theoretical implications). Lastly, these data demonstrated indirect effects of Attachment on interpersonal competency and Facebook Use through Extraversion and Neuroticism as mediating variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Five Factor Model Personality Traits</head><p>The results indicated that only Extraversion was significantly related to interpersonal competency and Facebook use intensity, while Neuroticism did not exhibit significant relationships with other constructs in these data. In the final primary model (see Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>), Extraversion was positively related to both interpersonal competency and Facebook Use, with the former association approximately twice as strong as the latter.</p><p>This parallels research investigating the interrelationships among these constructs, as</p><p>Extraversion has previously been shown to be associated with interpersonal competency <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Cuperman &amp; Ickes, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Ozer &amp; Benet-Martínez, 2006)</ref>. For example, higher Extraversion and lower Neuroticism have been related to increased quality and quantity of interpersonal communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Berry &amp; Hansen, 1996)</ref>. Similarly, research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Back et al. (2009)</ref> demonstrated that Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Agreeableness were reliably associated with interpersonal behavior. In the same vein, these two FFM traits have been shown to be associated with online social behavior, with higher Extraversion associated with increased usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Jackson et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Tosun &amp; Lajunen, 2010)</ref>. Thus, the present study"s results support the positive links between Extraversion and interpersonal competency and Facebook use intensity.</p><p>However, the present study"s results also suggested that Neuroticism did not have a direct effect on interpersonal competency when first accounting for insecure attachment style. This suggests that attachment style may be the more influential construct in predicting interpersonal competence and online social behavior, and should be accounted for when investigating the predictors of these constructs. Although ample empirical support was found for the link between Neuroticism and interpersonal competency <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Back et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Berry &amp; Hansen, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Cuperman &amp; Ickes, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b231">White et al., 2004)</ref> and Facebook use intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Correa et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Ross et al., 2009)</ref>, this support did not account for attachment style and thus may have excluded this relevant variable from analyses. Given the significant link between Attachment and Neuroticism (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>), these results suggest that Attachment may explain significant portions of the variance in interpersonal competency and Facebook use. In this way, the variance in interpersonal competency and Facebook use explained by Neuroticism may actually be better explained by Attachment, implying that Attachment represents a significant portion of the variance in Neuroticism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpersonal Competency</head><p>Results from these SEM analyses suggested that in the final primary model, interpersonal competency was not related to Facebook use, although Extraversion"s direct effect on Facebook use may account for this finding. In the alternate model with the direct paths between Extraversion, Neuroticism and Facebook use removed, most of the same relationships emerged with similar strengths as in the primary model. However, when the path between Extraversion and Facebook use was removed, interpersonal competency acted as a mediator between Extraversion, attachment style and Facebook use, with a significant, positive, and small effect of interpersonal competency on Facebook use. These results suggested that attachment style and Extraversion may have indirect relationships with Facebook use through the mediating variable of interpersonal competency (see Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>). However, the links between Extraversion and Facebook use and interpersonal competency and Facebook use seemed to be mutually exclusive in these data: initially the final primary model (see Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>) displayed a significant relationship between Extraversion and Facebook use and a nonsignificant relationship between interpersonal competency and Facebook use, while the final alternative model displayed a significant relationship between interpersonal competency and Facebook use when the path between Extraversion and Facebook use was removed (see Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>). Therefore, the question still remains as to whether Extraversion or interpersonal competency acted as the primary mediator between Attachment style and Facebook use. In addition, there may be some underlying third construct/variable related to interpersonal interaction that explained the variance in these relationships. Further research is needed in this area to examine these interrelationships and to investigate the specific links and their relative strengths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall Model Interpretation</head><p>Based on the results of the final primary and alternate models, the present study"s results suggested that emerging adults with higher levels of insecure attachment reported lower levels of Extraversion, higher levels of Neuroticism, and less developed interpersonal competency. In addition, those who reported higher Extraversion also  <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. In essence, these investigations would seek to understand whether the individual items, overall structure of items and factors, and even the rating scales used operate equivalently for different groups of people. For example, it may be the case that the present study"s results are more applicable to female emerging adults than males due to differences in how these two groups responded to the scales. Thus, future research should investigate the potential role of demographic variables in explaining the interrelationships among the constructs related to social media use and interpersonal competency. Additionally, future research on the personality characteristics of online social media users may benefit from accounting for these types of demographic variables that may influence SNS use.</p><p>Although the present study"s results suggested that interpersonal competency may act as a mediating variable between attachment style, Extraversion and Facebook use, further research must replicate these results with similar populations of participants. In addition, future research could examine whether this mediating role is supported in different populations, as well as the specific mechanisms of this mediation. By examining different model constructions, researchers may reach a better understanding of how these constructs are interrelated, as well as glean insight into other relevant constructs that may play a significant role in explaining these interrelationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>Through the lens of <ref type="bibr">Bowlby"s (1969)</ref> Attachment theory, the present study"s results align well with the basic tenets of this theoretical framework. This theory as well as later empirical work both support the important role of Attachment style in the formation and maintenance of relationships throughout the lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Fraley &amp; Shaver, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Zimmerman, 2004)</ref>, suggest that Attachment style is related to formative personality characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Backstrom &amp; Holmes, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Hagekull &amp; Bohlin, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Shaver &amp; Brennan, 1992)</ref>, and link Attachment to later developmental processes associated with social behavior and interpersonal competency of adults in college <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Kenny &amp; Rice, 1995)</ref>. Similarly, the present study"s results suggest that Attachment style was related to Extraversion and Neuroticism, two personality traits from the FFM found to be significantly related to interpersonal competency and online social behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Ozer &amp; Benet-Martínez, 2006)</ref>. Specifically, the data from the present study suggested that more insecure attachment was associated with greater levels of Neuroticism and lesser levels of Extraversion. Viewed through a theoretical lens, these results parallel <ref type="bibr">Bowlby"s (1969)</ref> explanations of behavior that more secure attachment is associated with greater comfort and capability in social interactions. Extraversion is defined in this same way, with higher levels associated with greater comfort and capability in interpersonal interactions. Attachment theory also posits that more secure attachment is linked with more positive emotional states and greater life satisfaction in general, and this mirrors the practical definition of lower levels of Neuroticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(John et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the present study"s data, higher levels of insecure attachment displayed a strong negative relationship with interpersonal competency, which fits well with Attachment theory"s suggestion that more secure attachment yields greater comfort in and skills with close relationships. According to the theory, more secure attachment leads to adopting more adaptive internal working models, which a person then uses to build and maintain strong, close interpersonal relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bowlby, 1969)</ref>. Additionally, securely attached individuals benefit from increased learning of social skills and emotional regulation that can benefit a person throughout the lifespan in social interactions. The results suggesting that Attachment may be indirectly related to Facebook use align with the theoretical framework as well, in that online social behavior can be seen as an extension of offline interpersonal social behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Ellison et al., 2007)</ref>, and so similar relationships as those found between Attachment and interpersonal interactions would be expected in the online social environment as well. <ref type="bibr">Arnett"s (2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">2004)</ref> emerging adulthood theoretical framework, which suggests that college-aged adults, like those who participated in the present study, continue to develop throughout this era of their life and discover a more stable sense of self based on their own budding values, personality characteristics, and interests. In addition, they focus intently on platonic and romantic relationships, and engage in intrapersonal and interpersonal developmental activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Montgomery, 2005)</ref> in seeking companionship with others that compliment their own emerging identities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Arnett, 2000)</ref>. The present study"s results align with Arnett"s theory in that the explanatory model based on these data also demonstrated strong links between personality characteristics and interpersonal competency. Specifically, the relatively strong relationship between Extraversion (a trait in the FFM closely associated with social behavior) and interpersonal competency mirror this theoretical framework"s suggestion of strengthening connections between developing personality traits and interpersonal relationships for emerging adults. The same type of relatively strong link can be seen between Attachment and interpersonal competency in the model as well, offering more support of the strengthening the theoretical importance of intrapersonal traits with interpersonal ramifications as described in Arnett"s theory.</p><p>Emerging empirical evidence has suggested that some of the developmental activities of emerging adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Arnett, 2000)</ref> may be occurring through online mediums <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Brown, 2006)</ref>. For example, a recent study highlighted how a process commonly associated with identity development was reflected on participants" Facebook pages: users expressed "salient and highly elaborated" ethnic identities through their Facebook pages just as they would in the real world <ref type="bibr">(Grasmuck et al., 2009, p. 179)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practice Implications</head><p>A number of practice implications emerged for counseling psychologists in light of the present study"s results. Given the significant role of Attachment in the model based on these data, practitioners in this field should acknowledge the influence of attachment style on personality traits, interpersonal competency, and online social media use when working with clients. This implication necessitates the exploration of early relationships and success with attachment behaviors in order to understand behavioral tendencies and interpersonal difficulties that may arise in the course of therapy. In this way, clinicians may be able to identify motivations behind social behaviors and contributing factors to interpersonal strife that are based on insecure attachment and plan treatment accordingly.</p><p>Therapists may follow a similar approach in examining the role of personality traits as well, given the significant roles of Neuroticism and Extraversion in the present study"s results. For example, clinicians can target potential negatively biased interpretations of events that may lead to decreased competence in interpersonal interactions, as increased</p><p>Neuroticism is associated with a tendency toward negative emotionality, sadness, nervousness, and tension <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(John et al., 2008)</ref>, thus making potentially negatively biased information processing more likely. In these ways, practice implications for counseling psychologists based on the present study"s results suggest that practitioners incorporate the potential role of Attachment, personality traits, and interpersonal competency in related issues that arise in clinical work.</p><p>Given the increasing prominence of online social media in the daily lives of adults, counseling psychologists may need to increasingly interface with social media in their clinical work. For example, many organizations, such as the Veterans Health Administration, are relying on social media as an effective outreach strategy and an entry point to access mental health care. In light of these trends and the present study"s results, counseling psychologists should acknowledge the role of attachment style, personality traits, and level of interpersonal competency in determining the effectiveness of online social media as an access point for care for clients.</p><p>Given the study"s results suggesting the potential influence of Attachment, Extraversion, and interpersonal competency in Facebook use intensity, clinicians may wish to assess clients" levels of these constructs when planning how best to communicate with and engage clients about their mental health treatment. As certain personality traits may be associated with less engagement with social media, clinicians could incorporate clients levels of these traits in order to better predict their likelihood of integrating social media into their daily lives. With these potential clues, clinicians may be better able to plan communication strategies regarding treatment. For example, clients with more insecure attachment and lower levels of Extraversion may benefit more from direct phone contact than from online social media contact for communication, treatment scheduling, and outreach efforts. Thus, the present study"s results may be useful in helping clinicians plan more effective communication about treatment planning and scheduling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>As can be expected given the fairly recent popularity of SNS and Facebook The generalizations of study findings are limited to the unique demographic characteristics of the sample used, and may only apply to emerging adult populations in college. The study sample consisted primarily of first year, first time undergraduate college students from a medium (N = 13,000), Rocky Mountain region university. In addition, the sample included few individuals identifying as ethnic/racial minorities, and substantially more females answered the study"s invitation email and completed the online study survey, which could also complicate generalizations made from this study"s findings. Lastly, the data were collected from a nonrandom sample, as potential participants voluntarily chose to participate in this research. Given this inclusion method, personality traits associated with participation may also have influenced the results by biasing the way that they responded to the study survey. <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Kraut et al. (2002)</ref> identified control variables known to influence internet use, variables which may influence online social behavior as well (i.e., age, gender, race, income, education, and the size of one"s place of upbringing; urban or rural). However, when reviewing the literature, no research has sought to identify variables known to influence Facebook use specifically. The present study attempted to incorporate background and contextual variables shown to influence internet use and social behavior, however, its current design may have failed to account for demographic variables that</p><p>research has yet to identify as important factors to control for in similar investigations.</p><p>Previous research on Facebook users most often incorporated gender, age, and race/ethnicity into their analyses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Ellison et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Orr et al., 2009)</ref> and occasionally education and income levels (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Correa et al., 2010)</ref>. Given the lack of clarity and cohesiveness in these findings, the present study did not attempt to account for these types of background characteristics of users that may impact Facebook use, an aspect of this study"s design that may limit the generalizability of these results as well.</p><p>Lastly, this study may suffer from a mono-method bias, as only scale data were used to represent each construct.

Thus, overall this literature review provides an adequate census of the relevant published scholarly sources germane to the research questions outlined in Chapter 1 of the present work.Implications and Future DirectionsResearch appears to be lacking in a number of areas relevant to emerging adults" personality traits associated with Facebook use and interpersonal competency. As the research is still emerging, little is known about the personality characteristics associated with the nature and intensity of Facebook use. Although initial links between attachment and interpersonal competency and social self-efficacy have been suggested (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Mallinckrodt &amp; Wei, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b238">Wright &amp; Perrone, 2010)</ref>, more research is needed to fully understand this connection. As Facebook use continues to become more seamlessly integrated into the daily lives of emerging adults, the relationship between interpersonal competency, social self-efficacy, and online social behavior through SNS use must be more thoroughly explored.CHAPTER IIIMETHODSThe present investigation utilized a cross-sectional design that examined the interrelationships between personality traits and interpersonal communication competence as well as online social behavior. I examined how stable personality traits previously shown to affect social relationships and behavior, specifically attachment and FFM traits, were associated with interpersonal communication competence and online social behavior manifested in Facebook use. I recruited undergraduate college student participants via email to complete a web-based survey comprised of multiple scale measures as described below.Johnson"s (2005)  review of web-based survey protocol validity suggested that web-based personality measures are approximately similar to paper-and-pencil measures as long as appropriate steps are taken to prevent invalid subject response patterns. In the present study, I employed the recommended methods for detecting multiple submissions, same-response category inattentiveness, protocol consistency, and patterns of missing data. The measurement scales included in the present study were used to operationalize the constructs of interest under investigation, as attachment theory and the FFM trait taxonomy support the conceptualization of attachment and FFM traits as latent constructs. In addition, the Hierarchical communication theory introduced in chapter 2 supports the idea that interpersonal competence can be represented as a latent construct and operationalized by measuring utility with (interpersonal competence) and confidence in social interaction and relationship maintenance skills (social self-efficacy and interpersonal competence).</figDesc></figure>

It has been used in recent years with college age students (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Ross et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Valenzuela, Park, &amp; Kee, 2009)</ref> as a measure of engaged use and continues to be used in social psychology research.

High scores on the measure"s subscales, representing the two attachment anxiety and avoidance dimensions, indicate more insecure attachment while low scores indicate more secure attachment. The measurement model of the attachment construct consisted of two indicators: the means scores of the Anxiety and Avoidance subscales.</figDesc></figure>

Therefore, the final measurement model for Interpersonal Competency consisted of the five ICS subscale mean scores, with an error covariance between the Emotional Support and Conflict Resolution indicators.</figDesc></figure>

Data for this study were collected from participants entirely online through the web-based survey program SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey, 2011). First, I generated a list of email addresses belonging to first year students at the university where this research was conducted using an institutional database web-based application for running data reports, called Insight. Next I emailed an invitation (see Appendix C) to participate in the study to all first year students as of the Fall 2011 semester, including a link to the study"s web-based survey hosted on the SurveyMonkey web site. When potential participants clicked on this link, they were directed to the study"s online survey introduction page and invited to review the study"s informed consent document before deciding to participate.Informed consent process. The informed consent process required by the IRB was completed entirely online as well. After reaching the introduction page and clicking a button labeled "continue," the next page displayed the IRB-approved informed consent letter (see Appendix D) describing the study in detail, outlining all that would be involved in study participation, and reviewing any risks involved in participation. After reading the informed consent letter, potential participants could choose to participate in Psychologists that stipulate a minimum sample size of 200 for any SEM analysis, and recommend larger sample sizes whenever possible.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_14"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>specifically, the communication and psychology literatures display a dearth of research on the personality characteristics related to Facebook use and its potential effects on interpersonal relationships and interpersonal competency. In addition, my extensive literature review found that most work in this area was found in the communications literature, in journals such as Cyberpsychology &amp; Behavior, Computers in Human Behavior, and the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication. Although some studies focusing on these issues are being published in psychology journals, such as the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, further research from the perspective of the psychological sciences are needed to better understand the psychological constructs associated with the nature and extent of Facebook use, as well as its potential impact on psychosocial functioning. Therefore, the present study may suffer from a sparse research base and underdeveloped theoretical foundation from which to launch a carefully constructed investigation and thereby contribute meaningfully to research in this area.</figDesc></figure>

Specifically, more secure attachment was related to higher Extraversion, lower Neuroticism, and increased perceptions of interpersonal competency. Higher levels of Extraversion were related to increased interpersonal competency and Facebook use, while interpersonal competency may act as a mediator between attachment style and Extraversion and Facebook use.

Including the variable of attachment yielded results that diverged from previous research in this area, suggesting that Attachment may be an especially relevant variable in investigations seeking to explain the personality characteristics related to social media use and Facebook use specifically. Future research should incorporate Attachment as a relevant variable to be included in the earlier steps of similar models, given the strong theoretical and empirical support for its early emergence in infancy and early childhood<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bowlby, 1969)</ref>.

Lastly, researchers could include other theoretically relevant constructs in examining similar interrelationships, such as self-esteem, relationship self-efficacy, and other FFM traits. Previous research has shown that a number of specific demographic variables may be associated with internet use, and the present study did not incorporate multiple demographic variables into analyses. Future research could clarify which among these demographic variables are associated with Internet use, and specifically with online Use Intensity.

Participants indicated their voluntary informed consent by writing their name on the same page below the consent letter, and clicking an "okay" button which linked to the study survey. The survey consisted of the specific measures detailed below, adapted to a web-based survey format. Data were collected from each participant"s set of responses to the survey items and stored on SurveyMonkey.com"s secure servers until being downloaded and imported into a statistical software package and stored on a secure network hard drive accessible by the researcher"s university computer.</p><p>A recent pilot study with similar research questions investigated in the same population of students using very similar recruitment methods <ref type="bibr">(Jenkins-Guarnieri et al., 2012)</ref> obtained data from a sample of 463 participants and found a mean age of 18.36, with 75.8% females, and 76.9% identifying as Caucasian, 10.2% as multiracial, 8.9% as Hispanic/Latino, and 2.2% as African American. This study"s participant demographic profile closely matched the overall demographic profile for the university, although females were overrepresented by 12% in the study sample. For the present study, I expected to obtain a comparable sample, as the recruitment and data collection methods will be quite similar.</p><p>the study by clicking on a button labeled "I Agree To Participate" in order to proceed to the study survey items or on a button labeled "I Decline To Participate" in order to exit the study survey. After completing the study survey, participants were offered the opportunity to input their email address in a text box on the final page of the survey in order to be entered into a drawing to win the incentive for participation. As an incentive to participate, the first 25 participants received a $1 iTunes gift card and all participants received an entry into a random drawing from among all the study participants for a $100 Visa Gift Card. Finally, each participant was presented with a paragraph designed to debrief them on the nature and purpose of the study (see Appendix E). Survey response rate and study sample size. <ref type="bibr">Shih and Fan"s (2008)</ref> metaanalysis on survey methodology found that the mean response rate for web-based surveys was approximately 34% and that incentives and follow-up reminder emails can significantly improve response rate. A pilot study conducted with similar research questions and subject recruitment methods in the same population showed an overall response rate of approximately 18% for a similar web-based survey <ref type="bibr">(Jenkins-Guarnieri et al., 2012)</ref>. Thus, I expected a similar response rate in the present study for a total sample of approximately 400 subjects. Most applications of SEM require a fairly large sample size (N &gt; 200) <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>, so participant recruitment and final sample size will be important elements of this study. <ref type="bibr">Jackson"s (2003)</ref> more conservative guidelines for determining adequate sample size in SEM analyses that has received recent empirical support <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>, suggested an N:q ratio of 10:1 to be considered adequate; N represents the number of cases or participants and q represents the number of parameters to be estimated in the SEM model of interest. Forty-six parameters were estimated in the primary theoretical model, meaning that sample size following this approach should exceed 460 participants. As moderately large sample sizes such as this may not be practically feasible, <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Kline (2011)</ref> established a minimum adequate sample size of 200 for most SEM analyses, and this guideline was adopted as the minimum sample size considered adequate for the present study. This aligns with recent guidelines by <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">Weston and Gore (2006)</ref> for Counseling is often overly sensitive and biased by a number of factors including multivariate nonnormality and sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>. I also calculated the matrix of correlation residuals and described this pattern of residuals for the overall model in order to assess for patterns in relationships among variables that may suggest misspecification. Next, I assessed the following approximate fit statistics suggested by Kline: RMSEA, Bentler Comparative Fit Index (CFI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Bentler, 1990)</ref>, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Bentler, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1986)</ref>, and the Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Bentler &amp; Bonett, 1980)</ref>. I utilized the suggested cutoff criterion for these fit statistics: &gt; .95 for the NNFI and CFI, &lt; .08 for the SRMR, and close to .06 for the RMSEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Beauducel &amp; Wittmann, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">Weston and Gore (2006)</ref> suggested that NNFI and CFI values greater than .90 can be considered adequate to good for smaller samples (N &lt; 500), and so these less stringent criteria will also be considered in final model evaluation. Any differences between models evaluated for improvement of fit will be assessed using the chi-squared difference test <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b230">Weston &amp; Gore, 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study</head><p>In the fifth step, I used the same methods described above to estimate the primary and secondary alternate models and evaluate them for overall fit and interpretability of parameter estimates; I followed <ref type="bibr">Cohen"s (1988)</ref> guidelines for interpretation of parameter estimate values. If no model could be retained, then I used a combination of theoretical rationale and results from the SEM analysis to re-specify the initial primary theoretical model in order to improve fit to the data and generate a meaningful model demonstrating the interrelationships among the constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Kline, 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Interpretation</head><p>The alternate a priori model (see Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>) was similar to the primary a priori model, but excluded the structural paths from Extraversion and Neuroticism to Facebook Use. This alternate model was submitted to SEM analyses using the same measurement model specified above (estimating the same four error covariances that were estimated in the final primary a priori model) using Robust ML while treating the data as continuous.</p><p>All skew and kurtosis statistics fell within acceptable ranges (skew &lt; 2, kurtosis &lt; 7), the largest standardized residual from these data was .357, and 2 cases were removed (43 and 156) based on <ref type="bibr">Byrne"s (2006)</ref> criteria for significant contributions to multivariate kurtosis. Data from 454 participants were available after addressing missing data using listwise deletion. All parameter estimates were statistically significant and practically meaningful (see Table <ref type="table">7</ref>), except for the path from Neuroticism to Interpersonal Competency, and suggested good component fit (see Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>). Overall fit statistics for this structural regression model fell within acceptable ranges: χ 2 (125) = 393.711, χ 2 SB = 369.438, RMSEA = .066 (90% Confidence Interval: .058 -.073), SRMR = .073, CFI = .922, NNFI = .905. Given the complexity of the model, the number of parameters to be estimated, and considering all of the fit statistics together, this alternative model demonstrated adequate to good overall fit to the data.</p><p>on Facebook Use through the mediating variables of Extraversion and Interpersonal Competency. Neuroticism did not have any direct effects, and did not act as a mediating variable. This model explained approximately 2.5% of the variance in Facebook Use.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Given the increase in internet use among young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">(Zickuhr, 2010)</ref>, especially as a means of communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Correa et al., 2010)</ref> and for social purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">(Pempek et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Ross et al., 2009)</ref> through online social media such as Facebook.com <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Cheung, Chiu, &amp; Lee, 2011)</ref>, new research must seek to understand the characteristics of these social media users and the potential impact of this use on their development, especially in the social domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Brown, 2006)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">Thayer and Ray (2006)</ref> call for more research on how increased internet use may impact the relationships and communication skills of users. As SNSs have become one of the most common manifestations of social behavior and communication online, researchers are beginning to investigate their role in the social lives of everyday users <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">(Steinfield et al., 2008)</ref>. Others encourage further research on SNSs with the emerging adult population that uses them most, as this medium is fairly new and as yet has not been studied in depth <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">(Ross et al., 2009)</ref>, especially in relation to social behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">(Raacke &amp; Bonds-Raacke, 2008</ref>). The young adult population uses Facebook more than any other age group <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">(Zickuhr, 2010)</ref>, and is increasingly incorporating its use into their social lives and daily routines <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Brown, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Ellison et al., 2007)</ref>. Thus, the present study examined the interrelationships among characteristics of college-aged social media users shown to be associated with online social behavior through the developmental lens of <ref type="bibr">Arnett"s (2000)</ref> emerging adulthood theory as well as the attachment theoretical framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bowlby, 1969)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Rationale and Purpose</head><p>The specific goal of the present research was to develop a model that explains the interrelationships among early-forming and stable personality characteristics, Based on the comprehensive literature review, there was clear theoretical support for attachment directly and positively affecting interpersonal competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anders &amp; Tucker, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Bippus &amp; Rollin, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Cooley, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Mallinckrodt, 2000)</ref> and Extraversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Backstrom &amp; Holmes, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Carver, 1997)</ref>, directly and negatively affecting Neuroticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Backstrom &amp; Holmes, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Carver, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Hagekull &amp; Bohlin, 2003)</ref> as well as indirectly impacting interpersonal competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Guerrero et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Johnson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Rholes et al., 2008)</ref> and interpersonal factors related to Facebook use <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Bradford et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schulman et al., 1994)</ref> through these two FFM traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Hagekull &amp; Bohlin, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Picardi et al., 2005)</ref>. In addition, I found ample research support for the direct impact of Neuroticism being negatively and Extraversion being positively related to interpersonal competency <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Berry &amp; Hansen, 1996</ref>; Cuperman</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Implications</head><p>Given the current measurement instruments available for capturing social media use and Facebook use specifically, further research is needed to develop new measures to assess this construct with strong validity evidence and psychometrics. Perhaps because the social media phenomenon is still relatively nascent, much of the recent research published on social media and Facebook has utilized inadequate measurement instruments to operationalize associated constructs such as intensity of use, investment in use, and frequency of use (Jenkins-Guarnieri, <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Wright, &amp; Johnson, 2012)</ref>. This body of research often used single items as indicators (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">Wilson et al., 2010)</ref>, scales developed for the same study with inadequate psychometric statistics reported (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Ross et al., 2009)</ref>, and single item behavioral frequency measures such as the average number minutes per week of active use (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Baker &amp; Oswald, 2010)</ref>, which has been questioned as a complete and representative measure of social media use <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Ellison et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jenkins-Guarnieri, et al., 2012)</ref>. In addition, some researchers advocate for measuring beyond behavioral frequency of use, and in addition capturing emotional connection to use and incorporation of use into social routines <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Ellison et al., 2007)</ref>. With improved instrumentation, researchers may be able to use psychometrically stronger measures of latent constructs with evidence of validity, utilizing multiple scales or multiple subscales as indicators instead of single item indicators as was used in the present study"s design.</p><p>Thus, further research is needed to develop novel measures of social media use and related constructs in order to progress research in this domain.</p><p>In the same vein, future research could also utilize improved methods for measuring the Attachment style construct by separating this variable into its two did not appear to have significant relationships with other constructs under study after accounting for attachment style. This study highlights the importance of attachment style and its role in explaining FFM personality traits, interpersonal competency, and Facebook use. Paralleling <ref type="bibr">Bowlby"s (1969)</ref> original attachment theory, these results</p><p>suggest that individuals with more secure attachment will feel more comfortable and capable in interpersonal relationships and social behavior, and by implication online social behavior. These results are especially relevant for emerging adults in college, and future research may investigate whether these interrelationships hold true for other segments of the U.S. population.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION OF RESEARCH</head><p>A methodologically rigorous and comprehensive search of relevant literature was conducted to find published peer-reviewed articles, books, edited books, bound monographs, and online material. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Fink (2005)</ref> calls for research literature reviews to be "a systematic, explicit, reproducible method for identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing the existing body of completed and recorded work produced by researchers, scholars, and practitioners" (p. 3). In following this approach, I first outlined a reproducible methodology for conducting the search which consisted of the following steps: a) chose appropriate research questions, b) selected article databases, c) chose relevant search terms from database thesauruses, d) chose practical screening criteria (e.g., year range), e) adapted literature search protocol in light of results. This process was documented in detail, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Aveyard (2007)</ref> recommends that researchers record the steps and strategies of the search process itself to ensure that it is explicit and reproducible. Documentation of the search process consisted of a detailed list of specific searches conducted, including descriptors and keywords used and the combination thereof, results gleaned from each search, and adaptations made to the search strategy based on these results; literature search strategy documentation available upon request. In addition, review and metaanalysis articles, relevant journals, and online bibliographic databases were searched for relevant sources as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Lipsey and Wilson (2001)</ref>  Participation in this research project involves answering questions through an online survey about your experience using Facebook.com, your relationships with other adults your age, and how you relate to other people. In addition, you will be asked questions about how you view yourself and how you experience yourself in the world. We are interested in your responses so that we can understand more about how college-aged adults use Facebook, how they experience the relationships they form, and how aspects of personality may be related to these relationships and Facebook use.</p><p>Your responses to the online survey will be collected through SurveyMonkey.com, a web-based survey service. In addition, the we will email all participants who complete this study survey in three weeks time with a link to another online survey hosted by the same web site containing a smaller subset of the same survey questions in order to collect your responses again. Data will be treated as confidential and stored on the web site"s secure servers. The lead researcher will be the only individual that will have access to the confidential data. Once data has been collected, any identifiable information will be removed and replaced with numerical indicators. It will take approximately 30 minutes to fill out the survey. We foresee no risks to you beyond that which typically occurs in filling out a survey or those normally encountered during regular classroom participation. One benefit of participating in this study is that you may increase your self-awareness in the following areas: relationship interactions, Facebook use, and personality traits. There are also indirect benefits to the discipline as a result of what is learned from the research project.</p><p>We will not ask for any identifying information that could connect you to your responses and the results from your participation will be treated as confidential.
