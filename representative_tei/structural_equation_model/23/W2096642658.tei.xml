<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> <ref type="bibr">Eid and Diener (2006)</ref> <p>observed that multimethod research designs are nowadays preferred to single method designs in almost all areas of psychological research. Developmental psychology is no exception, as is proven by an increasing number of longitudinal studies in the field that use multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) <ref type="bibr">designs.</ref> Recent examples of such multitrait-multimethodmultioccasion (MTMM-MO) studies include multimethod investigations of adolescent popularity, social adaptation, and deviant behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allen, Porter, McFarland, Marsh, &amp; McElhaney, 2005)</ref>; childhood depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cole, Martin, Peeke, Henderson, &amp; Harwell, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Tram &amp; Cole, 2006)</ref>; parenting effects on the mental health of bereaved children <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kwok et al., 2005)</ref>; temperament in early childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Majdandzic &amp; van den Boom, 2007)</ref>; the development of aggressive behavior in children <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Ostrov &amp; Crick, 2007)</ref>; and the relation between parental warmth/positive expressiveness and children's empathy-related responding and social functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Zhou et al., 2002)</ref>.</p><p>In this article, our goal is to demonstrate how structural equation modeling (SEM) can be used to analyze change in MTMM-MO studies in a comprehensive and sophisticated way. SEM allows researchers to test an overall theoretical model and to account explicitly for measurement error in the observed (change) scores. Furthermore, SEM has been applied successfully to the analysis of cross-sectional MTMM data (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dumenci, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Eid, Lischetzke, &amp; Nussbeck, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Marsh, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Widaman, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wothke, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>MTMM-MO designs have become increasingly popular for several reasons. First, panel studies that rely on only a single method (e.g., a single item or scale) or a single source (e.g., self-rating) are often less informative than are studies that combine multiple sources of information. Second, the generalizability of multimethod investigations tends to be broader than that of singlemethod studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Morris, Robinson, &amp; Eisenberg, 2006)</ref>. Results based on a single method may be specific to that particular measurement instrument (e.g., test, rater, or observation) and thus limited in scope. Third, in contrast to monomethod studies, MTMM-MO designs make it possible to update the convergent and discriminant validity information about the measures each time measurement takes place. This is important given that the degree of validity of a particular method (e.g., rater, questionnaire, test, observation) might change in the course of a longitudinal study.</p><p>Changes in the validity and other psychometric properties of the measures over time are a serious problem in many longitudinal studies. Imagine, for example, a study that investigates the development of aggressive behavior from childhood to adolescence using self-report questionnaires. The question arises, are the same questionnaires appropriate for both children and adolescents? By using MTMM-MO designs, researchers can test whether the convergent and discriminant validity of their measures remains constant throughout their study.</p><p>Finally (and perhaps most importantly), changes in the underlying construct might not be correctly identified by a single method. Furthermore, different methods might disagree as to the kind or amount of change that occurs. Collectively, these constitute problems pertaining to the "convergent validity of change." For example, parents might underestimate the amount of change in depression of their children compared with the children's selfreports. Compared with mono-method designs, MTMM-MO designs provide more information about such changes in the underlying construct (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hertzog &amp; Nesselroade, 2003</ref>, for an overview about measurement of change).</p><p>MTMM-MO data sets tend to be large and complex. The analysis of such data requires careful consideration. Some investigators simply examine correlations among manifest variables. Others conduct separate MTMM analyses for each wave. A drawback of such approaches is that no overall theoretical model for the entire data structure is ever tested. Analyses that are solely based on manifest correlations have the additional disadvantage that measurement error is not taken into account. Consequently, estimates of the relations among the underlying constructs may be biased (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bollen, 1989)</ref>. One might, for instance, underestimate the stability of interindividual differences in anxiety or depression over time. One might also obtain biased estimates of crosssectional associations among constructs, potentially affecting estimates of the convergent and discriminant validity at a given point in time.</p><p>Measurement error also affects the assessment of change. Change scores based on observed variables may be especially affected by measurement error, in part, because the unreliability of both the pretest and the posttest score affects an observed difference score. Clearly, we need adequate methods for taking measurement error into account as we model change in MTMM-MO designs.</p><p>In this article, we show how these problems can be handled with an SEM approach. Using SEM, an overall theoretical model can be formulated and tested against the data. Furthermore, change can be analyzed in terms of latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(McArdle, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">McArdle &amp; Hamagami, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Steyer et al., 1997)</ref>. We show how latent change can be analyzed simultaneously for different methods. In particular, we present a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach to analyzing change in MTMM-MO studies. This approach is an extension of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">McArdle's (1988)</ref> latent difference (LD) model (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">McArdle &amp; Nesselroade, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Steyer et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Steyer, Partchev, &amp; Shanahan, 2000)</ref> to accommodate multiple constructs and multiple methods.</p><p>Our article is organized as follows. We first provide a brief review of existing SEM approaches for modeling MTMM-MO data and motivate the need for a multimethod change model. Second, the conventional (single-method) CFA model of change <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(McArdle, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">McArdle &amp; Hamagami, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Steyer et al., 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Steyer et al., , 2000) )</ref> is introduced. Third, we illustrate the usefulness of extending this model to multiple methods. Fourth, an application of the multimethod change model to the development of childhood depression and anxiety is presented as an illustrative example. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this approach and show links to other recently developed methods for analyzing MTMM-MO data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SEM Approaches to Modeling MTMM-MO Data</head><p>To date, relatively few comprehensive statistical models have been developed for the analysis of MTMM-MO data in developmental psychology. Exceptions include <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cudeck's (1988)</ref> multiplicative approach; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cole and Maxwell's (2003)</ref> multi-occasion correlated uniqueness (CU) approach; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Burns, Walsh, and Gomez's (2003)</ref> extension of the correlated trait-correlated method (CT-CM) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Marsh, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Marsh &amp; Bailey, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Marsh &amp; Grayson, 1995)</ref> to a multioccasion CT-CM model (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Burns &amp; Haynes, 2006)</ref>; and the development of multimethod latent state trait (LST) models <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Courvoisier, Nussbeck, Eid, Geiser, &amp; Cole, 2008</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Vautier, 2004)</ref>. The primary focus of these models is on analyzing latent states (LSs). These models do not focus on change; they do not even include latent change variables. Nevertheless, change is often the primary focus in developmental psychology. In the present article, we present a model for analyzing change. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Vautier, Steyer, and Boomsma (2008)</ref> have developed a latent change model that takes method effects (because of indicatorspecific [IS] effects) into account. In contrast to the approach presented here, the model discussed by <ref type="bibr">Vautier et al.</ref> is not specifically designed for MTMM-MO investigations, does not provide coefficients for quantifying the convergent and discriminant validity of change, and does not allow for a comparison of change scores across different methods. Furthermore, Vautier et al.'s model assumes that method effects are perfectly stable over time, whereas the model presented here provides for all of these possibilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Single-Method LS and LD Models</head><p>Let us assume that a researcher is interested in the development of child depression and wants to find out whether (a) children differ in their level of depression at each point in time, (b) the mean level of depression changes over time, (c) some children show a stronger increase or decrease of their depression scores over time than do other children (i.e., whether there is interindividual variability in the amount of change), and (d) other variables (such as, e.g., gender, parenting, social support, change of personal competences) can predict why some children's depression scores change more than others'. These important research questions can be answered by LD models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">McArdle (1988)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Steyer et al. (1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Steyer et al. ( , 2000) )</ref> have shown how the basic longitudinal CFA measurement model can be reformulated as a LD model to study interindividual differences in intraindividual change with respect to a single construct. In contrast to these authors, we assume the more general case in which one has to deal with multiple con-structs throughout this article. Below, we discuss the extension to multiple methods.</p><p>In line with Steyer and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Steyer et al., 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Steyer et al., , 2000))</ref>, we present models for multiple indicators per construct-methodoccasion (CMO) combination. Multiple indicator models have several advantages compared with single indicator models. For example, multiple indicator models allow researchers to investigate the degree of homogeneity versus indicator-specificity of different indicators of a construct. Most important, these models make it possible to test the assumption of measurement invariance over time. Both advantages are illustrated in detail below.</p><p>We first introduce the basic longitudinal CFA measurement model that serves as the base for analyzing latent change. To be in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Steyer, Ferring, and Schmitt's (1992)</ref> classical article on LS and LST theory, we refer to this model as the LS model. In contrast to the LD model, the LS does not contain LDs as latent factors but just a time-specific latent factor for each construct at each time point. As these time-specific factors capture the true state of an individual with respect to a particular construct at a particular time point, the variables are called LS factors and hence the name LS model (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Steyer et al., 1992)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The LS Model</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref> shows an LS model for three manifest variables or indicators Y ict (i ϭ indicator; i ϭ 1, 2, 3; e.g., items or test scores) measuring two constructs (c ϭ 1, 2; e.g., depression and anxiety) on two time points (t ϭ 1, 2). In the LS model, there is a time-specific latent factor S ct (c: construct; t: occasion of measurement) for each construct at each measurement occasion. Each LS factor S ct is measured by the same indicators Y ict at each measurement occasion. For example, depression might always be measured by the items of the Child Depression Inventory (CDI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kovacs, 1985)</ref>. Each factor S ct represents the latent scores of individuals on a particular construct at a given point in time (e.g., the depression scores on a specific measurement occasion corrected for measurement error). Hence, these factors characterize the LS of individuals (i.e., the degree of depression) at a given time point and are therefore called LS factors. 1 (The meanings of the IS ic latent variables are explained in detail below.)</p><p>Note that the covariance structure and the mean structure of the variables are part of the model. That is, means are also analyzed, especially because changes in latent factor means are also of interest in most longitudinal studies. (In contrast, most crosssectional structural equation analyses focus only on the covariance structure.) Further, note that for reasons of clarity, we do not present the mean structure in the figures to avoid cluttering and to reduce the complexity of the figures; however, we emphasize that the mean structure is included in all models presented in this article. Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref> implies the following general measurement model for the indicators Y ict :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y ict ϭ ␣ ict ϩ ict S ct ϩ ε ict .</formula><p>(1)</p><p>Equation 1 shows us that each indicator Y ict has a factor loading ict on the corresponding factor. The factor loading can be interpreted as a discrimination parameter. For example, the higher the loading of a depression scale, the greater the scale discriminates between individuals with different latent depression scores. It is common practice to fix the loading of one indicator per factor to 1.00 to identify the scale of each LS factor. 2  In addition, each indicator has an additive constant (intercept) ␣ ict . The intercept ␣ ict can be interpreted as a difficulty parameter-the greater ␣ ict , the easier the scale. For example, the statement "sometimes, I feel sad" is probably easier to endorse than the statement "I feel sad all the time." To identify the means of the LS factors S ct , it is convenient to fix the intercept of those indicators to 0.00 whose state factor loadings are fixed to 1.00. Again, this choice is arbitrary; other possibilities exist to identify the latent means (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Steyer et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>In the general LS model, the loading and intercept parameters both carry three indices, i, c, and t. This implies that the loadings and intercepts can be different for each indicator and can also be different for the same indicator at different time points. However, as we see below, when LD scores are considered, one has to impose measurement invariance constraints on these parameters to make the LD scores meaningful. More specifically, one usually holds these parameters equal for the same indicator over time.</p><p>The variable ε ict is a residual variable with a mean of zero. The residual variable captures measurement error and variable-specific effects (indicator-specificity). Indicator-specificity refers to reliable effects that are unique for an indicator and not shared with other indicators. These effects might be due to a specific response format, item wording, or content. For example, one depression scale might focus more strongly on sadness, whereas another scale might capture aspects of depression that are more related to lethargy. The variance of the residual variable, Var͑ε ict ͒, tells us something about the degree of unreliability of the indicators and about the degree of indicator-specificity: the greater Var͑ε ict ͒, the more unreliable and/or specific variance is present in a scale. (As we see below, with longitudinal data, we are able to separate the IS variance from random error variance; this is not possible with cross-sectional data, in which measurement error and indicatorspecificity are confounded.)</p><p>The model in Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref> assumes that the common state factors S ct are uncorrelated with all residual variables ε icЈtЈ , and that all residual variables ε ict are uncorrelated with each other.</p><p>Measurement invariance. An important assumption that should generally be tested in longitudinal investigations is the assumption of measurement invariance over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Meredith &amp; Horn, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Tisak &amp; Tisak, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Widaman &amp; Reise, 1997)</ref>. In the longitudinal context, measurement invariance means that the rela-1 Note that in LST theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Steyer et al., 1992)</ref>, the time-specific LS factors S ct are further decomposed into a latent trait (stable component) and a latent occasion-specific residual factor (situation-specific component). However, in the present case, our goal is not to separate trait and state components but to model change over time as a latent variable. Note also that in the present context, a LS variable does not refer to a categorical latent variable (i.e., latent class variable) but to a continuous latent variable (i.e., a factor).</p><p>2 Identification generally refers to the question of whether enough information is available so that a unique solution can be determined for each unknown model parameter, for example, factor loadings, factor variances, and so forth. The present restrictions for identifying the scale of the state factor are arbitrary; the metric of this factor could also be identified by other restrictions, for example, by fixing its variance to 1.00 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bollen, 1989, for</ref>  tion between the observed variables and their underlying latent variables do not change over time. In other words, the observed (item, scale, test, etc.) scores should have the same meaning at each point in time. Measurement invariance is particularly important in the LD model, as this model is concerned with differences between latent variables. To make sure that these differences are meaningful (that one does not subtract "apples from oranges"), measurement invariance has to be established. How can measurement invariance be represented in the parameters of the LS model? An important aspect of measurement invariance is that the links between the indicators and the latent factors should remain the same over time. In the LS model, these links are represented by the factor loadings ict and intercepts ␣ ict . If both the factor loadings ict and the intercepts ␣ ict are timeinvariant (i.e., if, for the same indicator, these parameters take on the same values on each measurement occasion), the condition of strong measurement invariance is satisfied <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Widaman &amp; Reise, 1997)</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref>Time-invariant intercepts and loadings imply that the measurement structure of the construct has not changed over time. In contrast, variation in the intercepts over time would indicate changes in the difficulty of a scale, and variation in the factor loadings would indicate that the discrimination of a scale has changed over time. Under the condition of measurement noninvariance, one would be faced with changes in the metric and meaning of the underlying latent variables. This would lead to complications when researchers want to compare, for instance, latent means over time, given that in cases in which measurement invariance is severely compromised, apples would be compared with oranges.</p><p>Does measurement invariance always hold? No, but fortunately, we are able to test this assumption empirically in the LS model. This is possible because the LS model makes use of multiple indicators for each LS factor at each time point. For this purpose, we can specify a restricted version of the LS model, in which all loadings and intercepts are constrained to be equal over time. When such invariance constraints are imposed on all intercepts and loadings, the measurement model in Equation 1 simplifies to</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y ict ϭ ␣ ic ϩ ic S ct ϩ ε ict .</formula><p>(2)</p><p>We can see that the index t for the measurement occasion has now been dropped from the intercepts and loadings. This indicates that these parameters can no longer vary over time. In practical applications, the fit of this restricted model can be statistically tested against the fit of the more general model in Equation 1 to investigate whether the assumption of measurement invariance is tenable. When the more constrained model with time-invariant parameters fits worse than the model with freely estimated parameters, measurement invariance is not tenable for at least some indicators.</p><p>If invariance of intercepts and loadings is only tenable for some, but not all indicators, one speaks of partial measurement invariance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Byrne, Shavelson, &amp; Muthe ´n, 1989)</ref>. Partial invariance can be sufficient to warrant proper interpretation of differences in the structural model (e.g., differences in latent means over time). According to <ref type="bibr">Byrne et al. (1989, p. 458)</ref>, a sufficient degree of partial invariance is present if, in addition to the indicator whose loading and intercept are fixed to set the scale of the latent factor, at least one additional indicator has invariant parameters over time.</p><p>However, this is a rather arbitrary rule. In practice, researchers need to think carefully of the possible causes and consequences of violations of measurement invariance even if just one indicator is non-invariant.</p><p>What does the LS model tell us about development and change? If we go back to our depression and anxiety example, the variance of a factor S ct tells us something about interindividual differences in the true (i.e., error free) scores at a given time point. For example, the question "how large are true interindividual differences in depression at the first measurement occasion?" can be answered by estimating the variance of S 11 . Factor means for the same construct can be compared over time to discover whether the average level of depression and anxiety has changed over time.</p><p>The correlations among factors pertaining to the same construct over time [i.e., Cor͑S ct , S ctЈ ͒] inform us about the stability of interindividual differences over time. If these correlations equal 1.00, then interindividual differences on the same construct are perfectly predictable from the preceding measurement occasion (note that this would not preclude mean changes over time).</p><p>A limitation of the LS model is that it does not allow direct analysis of interindividual differences in change (in terms of LD scores). The following reformulation of the LS model to an LD model allows us to analyze latent change variables that can be used to relate interindividual differences in change to other variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(McArdle, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Steyer et al., 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Steyer et al., , 2000))</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The LD Model</head><p>The basic idea of LD modeling is that a latent factor S ct can be decomposed into the initial status (Time 1 ϭ T1) factor S c1 plus a LD factor ͑S ct Ϫ S c1 ͒, where ͑S ct Ϫ S c1 ͒ represents latent change (growth or decline) from T1 to time t:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S ct ϭ ͑S ct ϩ S c1 Ϫ S c1 ͒ ϭ 1S c1 ϩ 1͑S ct Ϫ S c1 ͒. (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>Equation 3 is a simple restatement and does not contain any restrictive assumptions. Basically, we just added a variable ( S c1 ) and subtracted the same variable at the same time. This might seem weird at first sight, but it allows us to consider true change as a latent variable in the SEM. By implementing Equation 3 in the structural model (as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref>), the LS model can be transformed into a LD model (the measurement model remains unchanged). The LD factors ͑S ct Ϫ S c1 ͒ represent true interindividual differences in intraindividual change from T1 to time t on construct c. The term true here means that the difference scores are corrected for measurement error. Therefore, these models have also been referred to as true change models <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Steyer et al., 1997)</ref>.</p><p>To illustrate, we can imagine that each individual has a score on the LD factor ͑S ct Ϫ S c1 ͒. A negative score indicates a true decline in depression for an individual, whereas a positive score indicates a true increase, and a score of zero indicates no true change at all. The LD factor mean and variance can also be estimated. The LD factor mean reflects the average growth or decline between the two time points for this sample. With regard to the depression example, a positive mean would indicate that on average, individuals show an increase in depression over time. The LD factor variance reflects the degree of true variability (interindividual differences) in change. In our example, a high variance would indicate that individuals differ a lot in the degree to which their true depression level changes over time.</p><p>LD modeling offers a direct approach to investigating change. The LD model is statistically equivalent to the LS model, as it is just a reformulation. That is, one does not specify a new model but just makes the information about change more accessible <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Steyer et al., 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Steyer et al., , 2000))</ref>. Furthermore, LD models are quite flexible. LD variables can be included for investigating change between a given occasion of measurement and the first time point or for change between any specific pair of state factors that is of interest (e.g., to study change between adjacent time points; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Steyer et al., 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Steyer et al., , 2000))</ref>. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1C</ref>, LD models can be used as endogenous variables (outcomes) or predictor variables in slightly expanded models. For example, one might be interested in finding predictor variables that explain why depression scores increase more for some people than others or why intervention programs cause greater changes in cognitive abilities in some children than in others. Alternatively, change scores may themselves be used as predictors of other variables (e.g., change in cognitive abilities may cause or at least predict change in school grades). Given that LD models focus on interindividual differences in intraindividual change, they can also be very useful for analyzing treatment effects in intervention studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IS Effects</head><p>As we noted before, the residual variables ε ict in an LS or LD model capture both indicator-specificity and random measurement error. Consequently, in longitudinal studies in which the same indicators are repeatedly measured, these residuals are often correlated over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(So ¨rbom, 1975)</ref>. Such auto-correlated errors indicate that the error variables do not only contain random measurement error but also reliable IS effects that generalize across time <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Jo ¨reskog, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Marsh &amp; Grayson, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Raffalovich &amp; Bohrnstedt, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Tisak &amp; Tisak, 2000)</ref>. Even though such effects are not usually of substantive interest, failure to account for them in the model can lead to specification error, misfit, and biased parameter estimates (e.g., the overestimation of construct stability).</p><p>One possible way to model IS effects in the LS and LD model is to allow for correlations between residual variables pertaining to the same indicator (so-called CU approach; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cole &amp; Maxwell, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kenny, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lance, Noble, &amp; Scullen, 2002</ref>; see discussion above). High correlations between residual variables indicate a high degree of indicator-specificity. The CU approach is a straightforward method to represent indicator-specificity in longitudinal studies. However, it is limited in that it does not explain systematic sources of variance by additional latent factors. As a consequence, IS variance and random error variance remain confounded in this approach. The inability to separate these variance components leads to an underestimation of the reliable variance of an indicator. Furthermore, when the number of indicators is large, the CU approach lacks parsimony, as many residual correlations need to be estimated. Therefore, we recommend an alternative approach in which indicator-specificity is represented by IS factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Eid, Schneider, &amp; Schwenkmezger, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Raffalovich &amp; Bohrnstedt, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Tisak &amp; Tisak, 2000)</ref> rather than correlated error variables. Figures <ref type="figure">1A</ref> and<ref type="figure">1B</ref> show the LS and LD models with additional IS factors. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Eid et al. (1999)</ref>, it is not necessary to include an IS factor for each repeatedly measured indicator. These authors have shown that it is sufficient to use i -1 indicator specific factors per construct (i.e., one IS factor less than there are indicators per factor). Specifying all i IS factors per construct can cause underidentification and other estimation problems. The extended LS model with i -1 IS factors is given by the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Y ict ϭ ͭ ␣ 1ct ϩ 1ct S ct ϩ ε 1ct , for i ϭ 1 ␣ ict ϩ ict S ct ϩ ␥ ict IS ic ϩ ε ict , for i 1 , (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where the first indicators (i ϭ 1) have been selected as "reference indicators" for which no IS factors are specified. The constant ␣ ict again denotes the intercept, ict denotes the factor loading on the state factor S ct , ␥ ict is the factor loading on the IS factor IS ic , and ε ict is a residual variable with a mean of zero. It is assumed that IS ic also has a mean of zero and is uncorrelated with all state factors S ct that belong to the same construct.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">foot_3</ref> Furthermore, it is assumed that the residual variables ε ict are uncorrelated with all other latent variables and with all other residual variables. Note that in contrast to S ct , the factor IS ic is time-unspecific and therefore carries no occasion index t, because IS ic represents IS effects that generalize across time.</p><p>We recommend that IS factors be included in longitudinal models whenever indicators show IS effects over time. If such effects are not present (i.e., because of a high degree of homogeneity of the indicators or long time intervals between the measurements), these factors can be dropped, leading to the simpler model in Equation 1. In the final section of this article, we discuss some specific problems that may occur with IS factors in practical applications and appropriate solutions for these problems.</p><p>In the extended LS model with IS factors, measurement invariance can also be tested. For this purpose, one simply constrains the intercepts and factor loadings to be time-invariant and then compares the fit of such a restricted model with the fit of an unconstrained model in which the intercepts and loadings are free to take on any value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Multimethod Change Model</head><p>The LS/LD approach can easily be generalized for use in an MTMM-MO design. For example, imagine that a researcher wants to assess change in depression and anxiety as measured by two different methods (e.g., self-and parent report). As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, the only difference is that the variables and constants in the new model receive an additional index m to represent the method. For example, the indicators Y icmt now carry four, and the state factors S cmt carry three indices (i ϭ indicator, c ϭ construct, m ϭ method, t ϭ time point). An LD model can then be specified for each construct-method unit. To our knowledge, an application of such an extended LD model to MTMM-MO data has not yet been presented in psychology.</p><p>The multimethod change model is especially relevant to researchers analyzing MTMM-MO data. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Campbell and Fiske (1959)</ref>, different methods should converge in measuring the same attribute (convergent validity). In addition, a new measure or construct should be distinguishable from an already established measure or construct (discriminant validity). For example, a new test should not correlate too highly with an existing test supposed to measure a different construct. If we transfer Campbell and Fiske's guidelines to the measurement of change, we can assess the convergent validity of change by correlating the LD variables pertaining to the same construct but different methods [e.g., ͑S 112 Ϫ S 111 ͒ and ͑S 122 Ϫ S 121 ͒ in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>]. High correlations indicate that different methods are in agreement as to the assessment of interindividual differences in intraindividual change. Individuals with high change scores according to one method would also have high change scores according to the other method.</p><p>In addition, the means of the LD factors can be compared across different methods measuring the same construct. Convergent validity with respect to mean change suggests that different methods agree with regard to the direction of mean change over time: mean increase, mean decrease, or mean stability. For example, do selfand parent reports converge with regard to the assessment of mean change in depression and anxiety over time? Note that mean  comparisons across methods are only meaningful if the different methods (e.g., raters) used equivalent scales (e.g., a self-and a parent rating form of the same questionnaire, where both forms contain equivalent items). We can also apply <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Campbell and Fiske's (1959)</ref> concept of discriminant validity to variables that measure change. Correlations among change variables that belong to the same method, but different constructs [e.g., ͑S 112 Ϫ S 111 ͒ and ͑S 212 Ϫ S 211 ͒ in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>] can be interpreted in terms of discriminant validity of change. High correlations might indicate that a method is not sufficiently sensitive to differences in change processes for the two different constructs. For example, parents rating the depression and anxiety of their children might be unable to distinguish change in depression from change in anxiety. More broadly, one can ascertain whether the pattern of correlations among change scores pertaining to different constructs is consistent from one method to another. An application of Campbell and Fiske's criteria to the measurement of change is shown in the illustrative example discussed below.</p><p>The present model can also be used to determine the reliability of observed change scores ͑Y icmt Ϫ Y icmtЈ ͒. If we assume timeinvariant intercepts ␣ icm , time-invariant state loadings icm , and time-invariant IS loadings ␥ icm , we can express the observed difference scores as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">͑Y icmt Ϫ Y icmtЈ ͒ ϭ icm ͑S cmt Ϫ S cmtЈ ͒ ϩ ε icmt Ϫ ε icmtЈ .</formula><p>(5)</p><p>Note that there is no intercept in Equation 5 because we assume ␣ icmt ϭ ␣ icmtЈ ϭ ␣ icm , so that the intercepts cancel out. Given the assumption of equal loadings ␥ icm over time, the IS factors also cancel out-IS effects do not affect the difference score under this condition. Assuming uncorrelated error variables, the variance of the difference score, Var͑Y icmt Ϫ Y icmtЈ ͒, can be decomposed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Var͑Y icmt Ϫ Y icmtЈ ͒ ϭ icm 2 Var͑S cmt Ϫ S cmtЈ ͒ ϩ Var͑ε icmt ͒ ϩ Var͑ε icmtЈ ͒. (6)</formula><p>Notice that Equation <ref type="formula">6</ref>shows us why observed difference scores often are so unreliable: The error variances of both time t and time tЈ affect the variance of the difference score. We may calculate the reliability for ͑Y icmt Ϫ Y icmtЈ ͒ as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Rel͑Y icmt Ϫ Y icmtЈ ͒ ϭ icm 2 Var͑S cmt Ϫ S cmtЈ ͒ Var͑Y icmt Ϫ Y icmtЈ ͒ , (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">)</formula><p>where icm 2 and Var͑S cmt Ϫ S cmtЈ ͒ are parameters to be estimated on the basis of the model, and Var͑Y icmt Ϫ Y icmtЈ ͒ is the modelimplied difference score variance.</p></div>

For the present models, a convenient way to identify the scale and mean of each LS factor is to fix the loading of one indicator to 1.00 and the intercept of the same indicator to 0.00. Furthermore, if IS factors are included, one can identify the scale of these factors by also fixing the loading of one indicator to 1.00. As noted above, these restrictions are arbitrary. Other, equivalent possibilities to identify the model exist (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Steyer et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>It is important to note that identification problems may arise in measurement designs with only two time points. In this case, the model part related to the IS factors may not be identified. The following guidelines can be provided for these cases:</p><p>1. If there is only one construct measured by only two indicators pertaining to only one method on only two time points, the IS factor is underidentified when the second loading is left to be freely estimated, unless the IS factor is substantially correlated with an external covariate in the model. If there is no external covariate or if the IS factor is not substantially correlated with the covariate, one has to fix both IS factor loadings (e.g., to 1.00) to achieve identification. </p></div>

The parameters of the models can therefore be estimated using estimation methods (e.g., maximum likelihood [ML]) available in conventional SEM software (e.g., AMOS, EQS, LISREL, Mplus, Mx).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Details on the Statistical Analysis</head><p>Model structure. The LS/LD models estimated for the present data had the same basic structure as the model shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, with the exception that we considered three (instead of two) occasions of measurement and used two (instead of three) indicators per state factor. Hence, there were a total of 16 latent factors in the LS version of the model: 12 state factors (three state factors for self-reported depression, three state factors for self-reported anxiety, three state factors for parent-reported depression, and three state factors for parent-reported anxiety) and four IS factors (one for the second indicator of self-reported depression, one for the second indicator of self-reported anxiety, one for the second indicator of parent-reported depression, and one for the second indicator of parent-reported anxiety). The LD version additionally contained eight LD factors (one difference factor for self-reported depression T2 -T1, one difference factor for self-reported depression T3 -T1, one difference factor for self-reported anxiety T2 -T1, one difference factor for self-reported anxiety T3 -T1, one difference factor for parent-reported depression T2 -T1, one difference factor for parent-reported depression T3 -T1, one difference factor for parent-reported anxiety T2 -T1, and one difference factor for parent-reported anxiety T3 -T1).</p><p>We estimated two versions of the LS/LD model (referred to as Model 1 and Model 2 in the following) to test whether measurement invariance across time was tenable. In Model 1, we imposed no measurement invariance constraints over time (i.e., all loadings and intercepts were free to take on any value except those fixed to ensure identification). In Model 2, all factor loadings and intercepts were held equal over time (we also constrained the IS factor loadings to be equal over time). A statistical comparison of the fit of Model 1 and Model 2 allowed us to test the assumption of strong factorial invariance (i.e., time-invariant intercepts and loadings). If Model 2 fit worse than Model 1, the assumption of strong factorial invariance for all indicators would need to be rejected.</p><p>Factor indicators. In principle, we could have used the single items of the CDI and RCMAS as manifest indicators in the models; however, two considerations led us to use parcels instead. First, the item responses were measured on a 3-point scale and thus represented discrete (ordered categorical ϭ ordinal) rather than continuous variables. Ordered categorical outcomes require the use of specific models and estimators (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Finney &amp; DiStefano, 2006)</ref>. The treatment of these issues is beyond the scope of this article.</p><p>Second, the large number of items per construct would have led to extremely large models with an excessive number of estimated parameters. Therefore, we created two parcels per CMO unit (CMOU; i.e., there were two parcels for depression measured by child report on each occasion of measurement, two parcels for depression measured by parent report on each occasion, and so on). We created the parcels by calculating the mean of half of the items for each CMOU. Parcels consisted of identical items on each occasion of measurement. Each depression parcel thus consisted of 13 items, and each anxiety parcel consisted of 14 items. We wish to emphasize that in an actual substantive application, researchers should conduct detailed preliminary item analyses to make sure that the use of item parcels instead of single items is warranted (T. D. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Little, Cunningham, Shahar, &amp; Widaman, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Clustering of observations. A complication that often arises in psychological studies is that observations are not independent but clustered within a hierarchical structure. For example, in the present data set, the children were nested within 49 school classrooms. Such complex sample structure is often referred to as multilevel structure and requires a special treatment. When the nonindependence of observations is ignored, standard errors and test statistics in conventional covariance structure analyses can be biased <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Julian, 2001)</ref>. In the present analysis, we handled this problem by using robust ML estimation in which a so-called Sandwich estimator is used to obtain adjusted standard errors and test statistics that are robust to clustering and nonnormality of the data (B. O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Muthe ´n &amp; Muthe ´n, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">-2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">B. O.

Little &amp; Rubin, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Wothke, 2000)</ref>. The FIML method relies on the assumption that missing values are missing at random. Missing at random requires that missing data are either missing completely at random or that the missing information depends "on variables that are included in the statistical model (which in the longitudinal setting usually includes previous measurements of the same variable)" <ref type="bibr">(Ghisletta &amp; Lindenberger, 2005, p. 566)</ref>. The FIML method is generally preferred to listwise deletion and other ad hoc approaches to handling missing data <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Schafer &amp; Graham, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Wothke, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Goodness-of-fit assessment. Goodness of fit was assessed using the chi-square test, the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Steiger, 1990)</ref>, and the comparative fit index (CFI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bentler, 1990)</ref>. A nonsignificant chi-square value indicates that the assumption of exact fit in the population is not rejected, suggesting a good fit of the model to the data. The RMSEA coefficient is a measure of approximate fit. RMSEA values smaller than .05 point to an acceptable fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1999)</ref>. The CFI compares the fit of the target model with the fit of a baseline model. The baseline model is a null model that assumes zero covariation among the observed variables. For a good model, the CFI should be greater than 0.95 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hu &amp; Bentler, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Schermelleh-Engel, Moosbrugger, &amp; Mu ¨ller, 2003)</ref>. To test for measurement invariance, we performed chi-square difference tests to statistically compare nested models. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> As an additional descriptive index for model comparisons, we use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Schwarz, 1978)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goodness of Fit</head><p>We first tested measurement invariance over time. For this purpose, we compared the fit of Model 1 (without invariance restrictions on loadings and intercepts) against Model 2 (with loadings and intercepts held equal over time for all indicators). Both models fit the data well. Model 1 had a nonsignificant chi-square value: 2 (132) ϭ 142.86, p ϭ .24. Approximate fit indices were also good (RMSEA ϭ .010; CFI ϭ .999).</p><p>The chi-square value of the more constrained Model 2 was also nonsignificant, 2 (156) ϭ 161.02, p ϭ .38, and the model showed a very good fit according to the other indices as well (RMSEA ϭ .006; CFI ϭ 1.000). A chi-square difference test revealed that Model 2 did not fit significantly worse than Model 1, ⌬ 2 (24) ϭ 19.03, p ϭ .75. Model 2 also had a lower BIC value (BIC Model 2 ϭ -4,704) than Model 1 (BIC Model 1 ϭ -4,566). The results thus indicate that the assumption of measurement invariance was tenable. Hence, we present detailed outcomes for Model 2. We first discuss important findings from the measurement model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Model: Indicator-Specificity and Reliability</head><p>The measurement model provides us with information on the degree of homogeneity and reliability of the indicators. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows that the unstandardized intercepts, factor loadings, and residual variances are very similar for the indicators of the same LS factor (e.g., the intercepts, state factor loadings, and residual variances for DS11 and DS21 are very similar). This shows that the item parcels are essentially homogeneous.</p><p>Standardized factor loadings (see the fifth and eighth columns of Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) can be interpreted as correlations between the indicator and the corresponding LS and IS factors, respectively. Squared standardized loadings represent variance components (see the last three columns in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) that give the percentage of variance explained by the LS and IS factors, respectively. The sum of the squared standardized loadings on both types of factors equals the reliability of an indicator.</p><p>In the present example, all indicators show high standardized factor loadings on the state factors (range ϭ .85-.96), whereas the standardized loadings on the IS factors are substantial but much smaller (range ϭ .22-.37). This shows us that although IS effects are present and nonnegligible, they play a minor role in the present application.</p><p>Overall, the variance components indicate that 72%-92% of the observed variance is due to the corresponding state factor, whereas only 5%-14% of the observed variance is due to reliable IS effects. That is, the different indicators generally measure the same latent dimension. Further, the reliability coefficients are high for all indicators (range ϭ .83-.92).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model: Convergent and Discriminant Validity of States and Change</head><p>The structural model provides us with information on convergent and discrimimant validity and change. The latent MTMM-MO correlation matrices estimated in the state and change versions of the multimethod change model are shown in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, respectively. These matrices contain coefficients of convergent validity, discriminant validity, and stability among latent factors that are corrected for measurement error. In both matrices, convergent validity coefficients are printed in bold face, whereas discriminant validity coefficients are italicized. Stability coefficients are framed in boxes in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>. The MTMM-MO matrix obtained from the change version allows us to study the convergent and discriminant validity of change.</p><p>From the moderate to small bold-face correlations we can see that convergent validity is low for both the state scores (range ϭ .26 -.36; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>) and the LD scores (range ϭ .14 -.28; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>). The coefficients are higher for depression (range state factors ϭ .32-.36; range difference scores ϭ .22-.28) than for anxiety (range state factors ϭ .26 -.28; range difference scores ϭ .14 -.18). Although the differences are not large, we speculate that parents may find it easier to judge their children's depression than their anxiety. Further, the convergent validities are higher for the state than for the change scores.</p><p>The convergent validity of change is very low. That is, interindividual differences in intraindividual change estimated from the selfratings do not correspond well with interindividual differences in intraindividual change estimated from the parent ratings. Consequently, an important substantive finding of the present modeling is that conclusions about change in depression and anxiety drawn from the parent ratings would be very different from conclusions drawn on the basis of the self-ratings. This finding could indicate three different things: Change scores based on the self-report may not be valid; change scores based on the parent report may not be valid; or both types of change scores may not be valid. One important consequence of these findings is that researchers interested in studying change in depression and anxiety of children would be ill-advised if they based their assessment on a single method only. Another important consequence is that in the next step, researchers should study the causes of these large discrepancies between the two rater types in more detail to find out which method should be trusted more. One way to investigate method effects in more detail would be to add covariates that might explain why parents judge their children's depression and anxiety so differently than do the children themselves (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Eid et al., 2006)</ref> or to add additional (possibly more objective) measures or methods and study their association with the child and parent reports.</p><p>With regard to discriminant validity, we can see that the depression and anxiety state factors are highly positively correlated. This is the case for both the self-report (range ϭ .74 -.76) and the parent report (range ϭ .79 -.83), indicating that the discriminant validity of the two constructs is rather low for both types of ratings. Depression and anxiety represent two closely related concepts. Not surprisingly, their change scores are also highly positively correlated (range ϭ .56 -.83). According to both methods, change in depression is strongly related to change in anxiety. Interindividual differences in both depression and anxiety remained relatively stable over time as shown by the high stability coefficients in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> (range ϭ .61-.85).</p><p>The latent means and variances are shown at the bottom of Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>. All variances are different from zero, indicating that there is significant variability in the LS scores and in intraindividual change over time (i.e., children differ in their status and in the degree of change over time). If we compare the state means for depression and anxiety across self-and parent ratings (see the bottom of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>), we find that the parents reported consistently lower levels of both depression (self-rating ϭ 0.29 -0.32; parent rating ϭ 0.18 -0.20) and anxiety (self-rating ϭ 0.56 -0.72; parent rating ϭ 0.44 -0.50) compared with the self-report.</p><p>The means of the latent change factors (see the bottom of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>) are all negative. This indicates that both constructs show a mean decline over time. Although this mean decline is rather small, it is consistent across both methods. However, the amount of mean decline differs between self-and parent ratings. That is, parent ratings show lower mean change over time (especially with regard to anxiety) than do self-ratings (self-rating depression ϭ -0.03; parent rating depression ϭ -0.02; self-rating anxiety ϭ -0.10 to -0.16; parent-rating anxiety ϭ -0.04 to -0.06). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref> In sum, the latent  means point to a lack of convergent validity of mean level and mean change. Parent ratings appear to be less sensitive measures for assessing change in their children's depression and anxiety than are the children's self-ratings.</p><p>In summary, we notice that <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Campbell and Fiske's (1959)</ref> criteria for convergent and discriminant validity are not met in the present example. The convergent validity of self-and parent reports as well as the discriminant validity between depression and anxiety are very low. As one reviewer of this article noted, researchers may view these findings as rather discouraging. It should be noted, however, that the present results are rather typical for multimethod studies of personality traits (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Fiske &amp; Campbell, 1992)</ref>, especially when traits with a rather low level of "visibility"-such as depression and anxiety-are considered (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Funder, 1995)</ref>. In such cases, low convergent validity is not unusual. With regard to the low level of discriminant validity, one must keep in mind that depression and anxiety represent two rather closely related concepts for which high correlations must be expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Model: Prediction by Sex</head><p>To illustrate the use of covariates, we estimated an extended model in which the variable sex (dummy coded with 0 ϭ boy, 1 ϭ girl) was used as a predictor variable for all latent factors. The extended model also fit the data well, 2 (164) ϭ 162.66, p ϭ .52; RMSEA ϭ .000; CFI ϭ 1.000. Because we had no specific hypotheses and because there were 12 regression paths of interest (we did not attempt to interpret paths between sex and the IS factors), we used two-tailed z tests in conjunction with a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level of .05/12 ϭ .004 to identify significant relations with sex.</p><p>In the state version, sex was a significant predictor of all three anxiety self-report state factors (T1-T3; standardized path coefficients ␤ ϭ .22, .26, .27; SEs ϭ .03, .03, .04; z scores ϭ 6.63, 8.34, 7.67; ps Ͻ .001, respectively), indicating a sex difference in self-reported anxiety. Girls tended to report more anxiety than did boys. Interestingly, this sex difference is not evident on the basis of the parent reports. All paths from sex to the parent report state factors are close to zero (range ϭ -.10 to .003) and not significantly different from zero according to the Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level.</p><p>For self-reported depression, a similar trend emerged (girls were somewhat more likely to be depressed), but the coefficients were smaller and significant only at T3 (␤ ϭ .16, SE ϭ .04; z ϭ 3.69, p Ͻ .001). Latent change in depression and anxiety was not related to sex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Multimethod measurement is routinely used by many developmental psychology researchers. In this article, we have discussed an SEM approach that is useful to study change in longitudinal MTMM studies. In the final section of this article, we summarize advantages and limitations, provide guidelines for applied researchers, and show links to other models for MTMM-MO data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advantages</head><p>Why should a researcher prefer the present approach to conventional data analytic strategies for analyzing MTMM-MO data? The main advantage is that using SEM allows us to formulate and test a model for the entire data structure. At the same time, SEM allows us to take measurement error into account. As a consequence, we obtain more reliable estimates of convergent validity, discriminant validity, and stability because the relevant correlation coefficients are corrected for measurement error.</p><p>In addition, we can use the model to study latent change for different methods simultaneously and to test important assumptions such as, for instance, the assumption of measurement invariance over time. Furthermore, we can assess important properties of the measures such as convergent validity, discriminant validity, indicator-specificity, and reliability. Studying the convergent validity of change is very important as different methods may lead to different conclusions about change. For example, in the present application, we found that self-and parent reports of depression and anxiety showed poor convergent validity of change-with respect to both, interindividual differences in change and mean change over time.</p><p>A very useful feature of the multimethod change model is that it provides a latent MTMM-MO correlation matrix. This matrix is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Campbell and Fiske's (1959)</ref> MTMM matrix, but it has the important advantage that the correlations are estimated among latent factors and thus are corrected for measurement error. The latent MTMM-MO matrix available in the LS version of the model allows quantifying the convergent and discriminant validity as well as the stability of constructs. The MTMM-MO matrix obtained from the LD version allows researchers to apply Campbell and Fiske's criteria for convergent and discriminant validity to the measurement of change.</p><p>Another advantage of the SEM approach is its flexibility. For example, the multimethod change model can be used to study change with respect to a baseline measurement occasion or between adjacent measurement occasions <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Steyer et al., 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Steyer et al., , 2000))</ref>.</p><p>In addition, the model can easily be expanded to include predictors, outcomes, or covariates of the latent factors already in the model. In this way, we can, for example, relate latent change in one construct to change in other constructs. We can also include predictor variables to explain why some individuals change more than others or to study the causes of low convergent validity of different methods.</p><p>To investigate why methods show low convergent validity, we can test whether outcome variables are differentially related to change variables on the basis of different methods (convergent validity of prediction). For instance, in the present reanalysis, we identified sex as a significant predictor of anxiety states as measured by self-report (there was a tendency for girls to have higher latent anxiety scores) but not of any of the parent report states or any change scores. As noted by an anonymous reviewer of this article, this might either indicate that the gender differences represent a method artifact of the self-report method or that parents are insensitive to gender differences in anxiety.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Sample size. The model presented here requires relatively large samples. We encourage researchers who are in doubt as to whether their sample size is sufficient to conduct an applicationoriented simulation study <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bandalos, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Paxton, Curran, Bollen, Kirby, &amp; Chen, 2001</ref>). B. O. Muthe ´n and Muthe ´n <ref type="bibr">(2002)</ref> discussed how such a simulation can easily be implemented in the Mplus program.</p><p>Number of time points. Although the model presented here can in principle be applied to any number of time points, readers should be aware of a potential limitation that emerges when only two time points are used. This limitation has to do with the specification of IS factors to capture IS effects. When only two occasions are used, identification and estimation problems (e.g., improper solutions with out-of-range parameter estimates) occur more frequently (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ciesla, Cole, &amp; Steiger, 2007)</ref>. The problems are often related to the IS factors, whose identification status can be deficient when there are only two time points (see our discussion of remedies in this case above).</p><p>Also, models with IS factors may not fit well if IS effects are not unidimensional. For example, residual covariances among indicators that are due to IS effects might follow an autoregressive structure rather than the unidimensional (one-factor) structure implied by the model with IS factors. With more than three time points, deviations from unidimensionality would be indicated by a lack of fit.</p><p>Another problem related to IS effects that does not depend on the number of time points occurs if these effects account for a large portion (say more than 20 -30%) of the variance of the indicators. This would indicate that the indicators are rather heterogeneous and mirror distinct facets of a construct. The results obtained from the structural model (e.g., the MTMM-MO matrix or correlations with covariates) might then strongly depend on the choice of the reference indicators for which no IS factors are specified.</p><p>The best way to avoid all these problems is to identify and select homogeneous indicators for each construct. For homogenous indicators, no IS factors are needed, and a less complicated version of the model without these factors can be used. If this is not possible and if IS effects do not follow a unidimensional structure, then the use of a CU approach (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cole &amp; Maxwell, 2003)</ref>, in which the residual variables for the same indicators are allowed to correlate over time, is an appropriate alternative modeling strategy.</p><p>If IS factors account for a large portion of the indicator variance, researchers should conduct sensitive analyses using different reference indicators. If the parameter estimates for the structural model differ significantly for different reference indicators, then it is important to carefully select the reference indicator on the basis of substantive considerations: Which indicator can be seen as the "gold standard" that best represents the construct? Measurement invariance. A requirement for the proper interpretation of the LD factors is that the measurement model for each construct is invariant over time. At least strong factorial invariance (time-invariant intercepts and factor loadings) is required to ensure that model parameters related to the LD factors are interpretable. As we showed above, this assumption is testable, and in the present application, it was not rejected by the goodnessof-fit criteria. If measurement invariance were not tenable, the interpretation of the LD factors would be compromised. In some cases, however, researchers will be able to establish partial measurement invariance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Byrne et al., 1989)</ref>. As mentioned above, partial measurement invariance means that invariance is tenable at least for some indicators of a construct, a condition that can re-enable judicious interpretation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Links to Other Models</head><p>Finally, we think that it is useful to point out some links to other models for analyzing MTMM-MO data. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cole and Maxwell's (2003)</ref> CU approach, three types of shared method variance can be represented by correlations among residual variables ("uniquenesses"): (a) within-wave, cross-construct CUs for indicators pertaining to the same method mirror method effects on a given time point; (b) cross-wave, within-construct CUs for the same indicator capture method variance caused by stable IS effects; and (c) cross-wave, cross-construct CUs may be admitted to account for additional effects due to the same method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cole and Maxwell's (2003)</ref> approach of modeling different types of shared method effects through residual correlations parallels <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kenny's (1976)</ref> correlated trait-CU model for cross-sectional MTMM data (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lance et al., 2002)</ref>. The advantage of Cole and Maxwell's model is that method and error effects are taken into account so that structural (e.g., mediational) hypotheses can be more accurately tested.</p><p>On the other hand, the CU approach has a number of limitations: (a) many uniqueness correlations need to be estimated in designs with many indicators, constructs, methods, and time points; (b) random measurement error cannot be separated from IS variance and shared method variance leading to an underestimation of the reliabilities of the measures; and (c) variance components due to construct, method, indicator-specificity, and error are not available.</p><p>A model that overcomes some of the limitations of the CU approach is <ref type="bibr">Burns et al.'s (2003;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Burns &amp; Haynes, 2006)</ref> multi-occasion extension of the CT-CM model <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Marsh, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Marsh &amp; Bailey, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Marsh &amp; Grayson, 1995)</ref>. Instead of including various kinds of CUs, Burns et al.'s model uses occasion-specific method factors to capture cross-sectional method effects. The model represents an extension of the LS model with one state factor for each construct and one method factor for each method on each occasion of measurement. <ref type="bibr">Burns et al.'s (2003)</ref> approach allows separating occasionspecific variance due to a construct from occasion-specific method variance and error influences. Furthermore, different methods can be correlated and external variables can be included to explain method effects. A potential shortcoming is that this approach is based on the cross-sectional CT-CM model and thus might be prone to similar identification, estimation, and interpretation problems. Like <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cole and Maxwell's (2003)</ref> model, the model presented by <ref type="bibr">Burns et al.</ref> is a single indicator model. Hence, it cannot be used to study construct-specific method effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Vautier et al. (2008)</ref> recently presented a true change model with method effects. Their model is useful to deal with heterogeneous indicators in longitudinal studies. However, it is not specifically designed to analyze MTMM-MO data. Vautier et al.'s model includes only one indicator per CMOU, whereas the models discussed here are multiple indicator models. As a consequence, Vautier et al.'s model assumes perfect temporal stability of method effects and thus is not suitable for analyzing the convergent and discriminant validity of change. In contrast, the models presented here are specifically designed to deal with changes in all methods. Note, however, that Vautier et al.'s model could be extended to a multiple indicator model in which the assumption of perfect stability of method effects could be tested. Some research questions in developmental psychology are less concerned with measuring change and are more concerned with the assessment of situation-specific fluctuations around a stable trait value. For example, a researcher might be primarily interested in the degree to which situation-specific variables affect the measurement of these constructs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Vautier, 2004)</ref>. If the goal were to separate stable from situation-specific components of variance in a MTMM-MO study, the model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Courvoisier et al. (2008)</ref> can be applied. Courvoisier et al.'s model represents an extension of the conventional LST model <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Steyer, Schmitt, &amp; Eid, 1999)</ref> to a multimethod LST model. A related approach has been presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Vautier (2004)</ref>, who showed how method effects caused by bipolar items can be studied in an extended LST model.</p><p>Readers might wonder how the LD approach discussed here compares with latent growth curve modeling (LGCM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bollen &amp; Curran, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Duncan, Duncan, &amp; Strycker, 2006)</ref>. The difference between LD models and LGCM is that LD models consider change as such, whereas LGCM are concerned with a special component of change (e.g., linear or curvilinear growth; <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Steyer et al., 2000)</ref>. In that sense, LD models are less restrictive than LCGM, as the parameters of a LD model do not imply any specific functional form of change but just consider "pure" change. As a practical consequence, LD models may be used as alternative models if LGCM do not fit because change does not follow a simple pattern, such as, for example, straight line growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Using more than one method or source to assess the concepts of interest in a study is highly recommended in all areas of psychological research <ref type="bibr">(Eid &amp; Diener, 2006)</ref>. Multimethod assessment is of particular importance to developmental psychology research, given that the measurement of change is the focus of many studies. With only a single method or source, it may not be possible to draw valid conclusions about change. MTMM-MO studies enable researchers to study the convergent and discriminant validity of change. Therefore, we encourage developmental researchers to use multiple constructs and multiple methods as well as sophisticated methods of data analysis, such as SEM, not only in cross-sectional investigations but also in longitudinal investigations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.

Correlations between indicator-specific factors are often meaningful and interpretable (e.g., if two items share common method variance because of a similar wording, one would expect their indicator-specific factors to be correlated). In contrast, correlations between indicator-specific factors and other state factors are often difficult to interpret and also close to zero in many cases. In cases in which it is not plausible to assume these correlations to be different from zero, one may consider fixing them to zero a priori for reasons of parsimony.</p></note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>one may consider using standardized mean differences. In the present study, we did not use standardized mean differences because the self-and parent reporters used identical scales so that the raw means were directly comparable across raters. It should be noted that a standardization of mean differences using the standard deviations can also be misleading in some cases. For example, if groups differ in variability, a standardization magnifies the mean difference in the group with smaller variability and attenuates the mean difference in the group with larger variability. We recommend that standardized effect sizes be used only in cases in which measurement instruments are not comparable in terms of their metric. </p></div>			</div>
