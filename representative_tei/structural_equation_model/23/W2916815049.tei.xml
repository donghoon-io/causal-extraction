<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Twenty-First Century Education is a design of instructional culture that empowers learner-centered through the philosophy of "Less teaching but more learning". Due to the development of technology enhance learning in developing countries such as Thailand, online learning is rapidly growing in the electronic learning market. ClassStart is a learning management system developed to support Thailand's educational management and to promote the student-centred learning processes. It also allows the instructor to analyse individual learners through system-generated activities. The study of online learning acceptance is primarily required to successfully achieve online learning system development. However, the behavioural intention of students to use online learning systems has not been well examined, in particular, by focusing specific but representative applications such as ClassStart in this study. This research takes the usage of ClassStart as research scenario and investigates the individual acceptance of technology through the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, as well as technological quality through the Delone and McLean IS success model. A total of 307 undergraduate students using ClassStart responded to the survey. The Partial Least Squares method, a statistics analysis technique based on the Structural Equation Model (SEM), was used to analyze the data. It was found that performance expectancy, social influence, information quality and system quality have the significant effect on intention to use ClassStart.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Background of the Study: Online learning in Thailand</head><p>According to the observation of the uses of ICT by the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization: SWAMEO, it was found that Thailand was considered as a member of the group 2 countries: most developments and uses of ICT were in the infusing step in almost all aspects because the action plans and policies regarding ICT for learning were developed. Nevertheless, it was considered that there were development gaps among the urban and rural areas.</p><p>Consequently, the developments in some aspects were only in the applying or emerging steps.</p><p>Moreover, it was found the developments of ICT in Thailand and Vietnam were more significant than those in Indonesia and Philippines <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(SEAMEO, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Thai education still focused on improving the education with ICT as a tool for providing the education in order to reduce the learning gaps through online learning. The ministry of Thai education allocated the budgets from creating the technological infrastructures and preparing the instructors' and learners' abilities to use tools. The latest policy encouraged the uses of online learning in higher education institutes for 15 years <ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2009)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2013)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2014)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2015)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2016)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2017)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2018)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2019)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2020)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2021)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2022)</ref> by focusing on providing online learning subjects in universities <ref type="bibr">(Commission on Higher Education, 2007)</ref>. Thai universities also actively changed their traditional teaching method into online learning method. For example, Prince of Songkla University developed the online learning system, "ClassStart", that is available for other universities in Thailand to use this application for free.</p></div>

Since the procedure of transferring the learning process takes place, it is no less important than the content gained from learning. The transfer of knowledge through regular recording allows learners to connect their learning and learning processes, so that learners can recognize the content and learn more effectively. In addition, it continually monitors student feedback. The instructor can plan the lesson to repair the teaching activities to complete as well.</p><p>Although the popularity of the online learning is improving in developing countries such as Thailand, previous studies found that technical problems and the lack of support from relevant individuals resulted in the acknowledgement of the limited value of online learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Jairak, Praneetpolgrang, &amp; Mekhabunchakij, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">James, 2011)</ref>.

However, to transfer the technologies from the developed countries to the developing countries, there are different cultures and social characteristics to be considered. Hence, the findings from the developed countries cannot be generalized to the developing ones.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Related works</head><p>Online learning adoption has been examined under various contexts in both developing and developed countries. The majority of the previous researchers have studied online learning They point out that the two main variables from UTAUT are performance expectations and effort expectations combined system interactivity contribution to e-learning adoption. In addition, they also found an indirect effect between the area of scientific expertise on behavior and the use of elearning through performance expectation variables. In line with the result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dečman (2015)</ref> who found that performance expectancy contribute to the acceptance of e-learning in mandatory environments of higher education which applied the UTAUT model together with the two moderators variables (students' previous education and gender). However, the results of the study did not find any element statistically significant in the model fit. confirms the relationship between these three variables on behavior intention. The detail of comparative analysis of online learning acceptance in an academic environment is shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, in which the symbols used to confirm that the two variables are statistically correlated they are +, for example (PE + BI).</p><p>However, from the literature review, we found that the majority of online learning ignores quality factors; this could be a factor for the success of online learning. Thus, quality studies in all terms are still necessary, especially in terms of learner's opinions towards the system. Another important issue is previous studies lack of in-depth research of specific application in Thailand. Therefore, this research focuses on the ClassStart application. This is an important application in the online learning market of higher education in Thailand.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical context and hypotheses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)</head><p>According to the literatures, it was found that the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) is a theory that is broadly used in the field of information and communication technology acceptance. UTAUT includes the models from 8 theories: Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) from Fred D. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Davis (1989)</ref>, Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) from F. D. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Davis (1989)</ref> and V. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Venkatesh (2000)</ref>, Motivation Model (MM) from F. D. Davis, Bagozzi, R. P., &amp;Warshaw, P. predictor of behavior intention in analysis the meta-analysis of UTAUT is 27 cases. As same as metaanalysis of Dwivedi, Rana, Chen, and Williams (2011) founded that performance expectancy was only factor from all 25 cases that had a significant effect on behavior intention. Another important factor that has strong influence of UTAUT is effort expectancy. Most users expect that effort expectations should be low. In context of online learning, researchers found that effort expectancy had influence with experienced student using more than inexperienced students.</p><p>The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) has been widely studied in the context of online learning behavior in Thailand. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Jairak et al. (2009)</ref> investigated mobile learning adoption by Thai higher education students. Results showed that performance expectancy highly influenced attitudes toward intention to adopt mobile learning. Most Thai students have knowledge and experience regarding online technology; they readily embrace mobile devices as beneficial for learning. Whilst Chularat Saengpassa (2013) stated that the Cyber University program, with the aim to promote and support e-learning at universities, had been operative in Thailand for more than a decade.</p><p>However, the project has faced obstacles because users as instructors and learners do not fully accept the concept of e-learning. National realization regarding the importance of online learning should be encouraged. Therefore, technology adoption factors applied by the UTAUT theory were examined as part of the research framework. However, UTAUT theory suggests that three variables that determine intentional behavior including: performance expectancy, effort expectancy and social influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chiu &amp; Wang, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Oliveira, Faria, Thomas, &amp; Popovič, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Performance expectancy is the levels that individuals believe that by using the systems, the systems will help him or her achieve a goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bao, Xiong, Hu, &amp; Kibelloh, 2013)</ref>. It involves with perceived usefulness in TAM. Viswanath <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Venkatesh (2000)</ref> found that performance expectancy is an indication factor to predict the usage intention of new technology in operations. In online learning context, students usually find that online learning is useful, convenient, and able to increase study productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Wang, Wu, &amp; Wang, 2009)</ref>. Therefore, it will affect the consistency use of ClassStart.</p><p>Therefore, we made the hypothesis:</p><p>H1: Performance expectancy has a positive effect on behavior intention to use ClassStart.</p><p>Effort expectancy is the levels of simplicity and convenience in order to use the system or the outline that learners believe that using the system is free from attempting <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bao et al., 2013)</ref>. This is because effort expectancy involves with perceived ease of use in TAM. Assuming that any systems that the users realise it is simple to use, thus, there is likely a perception of advantages and intention behavior.</p><p>In the context of Thailand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Siritongthaworn, Krairit, Dimmitt, and Paul (2006)</ref> noted that users were more likely to accept e-learning procedures and processes if they were easy to access and use.</p><p>However, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for teaching and learning often lack service quality and technological problems arise. Relating to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chiu and Wang (2008)</ref>, it was presented that in a case of effort expectancy increases; it is a lead to a better operation. Thus, effort expectancy should have a direct impact on intention. Therefore, we made the hypothesis:</p><p>H2: Effort expectancy has a positive effect on behavior intention to use ClassStart.</p><p>Social influence is personal levels of recognition that people who are close or important to them believe that they should use technology or new systems. Social influence pertains to subjective norm in theory of planned behavior (TPB). It found that users tend to communicate with others to outline their technology acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dečman, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Magsamen-Conrad, Upadhyaya, Joa, &amp; Dowd, 2015)</ref>. The previous study showed that subjective is an important factor that indicates system usage intention relating to a research done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Milošević et al. (2015)</ref>. The researcher found that an influence from surrounded people such as instructors has an impact on the usage intention of online learning by learners. Therefore, we made the hypothesis:</p><p>H3: Social influence has a positive effect on behavior intention to use ClassStart.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Delone and McLean IS success model</head><p>System design and a system with respectable functionality is one of the cornerstones of system development life cycle. It is also key factor to ensuring the success of the implementation of the  <ref type="formula">2003</ref>) for online learning development and assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Wang et al., 2007)</ref>. William <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">H Delone and McLean (2003)</ref> presents that updated IS success model can adjust to fit online learning's challenge assessment.</p><p>According to a study by the Thai Ministry of Education, the country is still struggling to deliver efficient information systems in terms of service quality, adequate technical backup and support, and available resources/courseware developers <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Rueangprathum, Philuek, &amp; Fung, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>However, researchers continue to focus on the quality of e-learning in Thailand. Wannapa <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Khaopa (2012)</ref> recognized Thailand as the online learning hub of the ASEAN region and the country has many cosmopolitan courses and programs which attract international students, especially from ASEAN countries. Online learning is a new electronic learning market that allows students to study at home. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Pruengkarn, Praneetpolgrang, and Srivihok (2005)</ref> studied the quality of e-learning at Thai higher education institutions according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards. They determined the average quality of e-learning websites in Thailand in terms of functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability and portability at 50.34%, which rates as moderately aggressive. Thus, lack of service quality is hampering the use of ICT for teaching and learning. Consequently, this research takes three quality variables in update IS success -system quality, information quality and service quality to study on intention to use ClassStart.</p><p>System quality refer to the quality of the information system that user can use the system easily, as the availability of the system, speed of response (feedback), user-friendly and features of the screen (Interface), which is the quality of the information system will affect the intention to use the system (William H <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Delone &amp; McLean, 2003)</ref>. Poor system quality may result in student dissatisfaction. If the learner finds that the system is difficult to use. This may result in the intention to make the system to fail. The previous researchers found that system quality influences intention to use the information system such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lee and Hsieh (2009)</ref> found that the system quality affects directly to the use of mobile data services. In line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">McFarland and Hamilton (2006)</ref> showed that system quality were affected on perceived use and actual use the system. Therefore, we made the hypothesis:</p><p>H4: System quality has a positive effect on behavior intention to use ClassStart.</p><p>Information quality refer to quality of data that user received when used information system, as relevant, easy to understand, up to date and completeness. Whereof quality of information will affect intention to use and user satisfaction of the system (William H <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Delone &amp; McLean, 2003)</ref>. Poor information quality may affect the reliability of the system for learning. This reduces the impulse to use the system. Consequently, Information quality is an important and required for education.</p><p>Especially for online classes, such as e-learning or m-learning that information quality can be a success factor of the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Williams &amp; Jacobs, 2004)</ref>. Thus, the assessment of information quality is important dimension of quality online learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Byrd, Thrasher, Lang, &amp; Davidson, 2006)</ref>. Therefore, we made the hypothesis:</p><p>H5: Information quality has a positive effect on behavior intention to use ClassStart.</p><p>Service quality is the quality that user receives help or answer questions related to the issue of information systems from the provider system as sincere interest in solving problem, personalization, trust and understand user specific need. And the quality of service will affect in the intended use of the system (William H <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Delone &amp; McLean, 2003)</ref>. Poor service quality, such as when students have problems using the system, whereby the system is delayed or does not meet their requirements. This may result in decreased motivation for the system. A large number of previous studies focused on service quality. In education context found that students are ready to take online learning applications if they perceived that have the quality of service. That is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Milošević et al. (2015)</ref> found that service quality has a direct impact on intention to use m-learning of student in Serbia. E. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Park and Kim (2013)</ref> found that service quality has a direct impact on acceptance the long-term evolution (LTE) service of students in South Korea Therefore, we made the hypothesis:</p><p>H6: Service quality has a positive effect on behavior intention to use ClassStart.</p><p>Therefore, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> shows our model; in addition to the core constructs of UTAUT and IS success model were assumed to affect the intention to use ClassStart. </p></div>

Both dimensions can explain the intention to use the Class Start (R 2 = 58.1%).</p><p>The results of this study are consistent with previous research, which confirmed that performance expectancy was the most important variable to predict the intention to use technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Casey &amp; Wilson-Evered, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gupta et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Zhou et al., 2010)</ref>. In the context of online learning, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahmad (2013)</ref> believes that students with high performance expectations are more likely to accept online learning than those with low expected performance. This is because learners believe that online learning will help them to achieve their expected success as well as improve the efficiency of their learning.</p><p>Effort Expectancy is another important factor to study the intention to use online learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Marchewka, Liu, &amp; Kostiwa, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murali, 2012)</ref> However, this study found that effort expectancy had a negative influence on the intention to use the ClassStart. The results are in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Milošević et al. (2015)</ref>, who studied the intention to use online learning in developing countries such as Serbia.</p><p>This may be because the adoption of technology in developing countries is still in its relative infancy.</p><p>Learners may not be familiar with changing the traditional learning approach to online learning. The students don't feel flexibility and it takes a lot of effort to use the system.</p><p>Social influence also affects the intention to use the ClassStart. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Rogers (1995)</ref> found that interacting with people in the surrounding vicinity influenced the interpretation of IT adoption.</p><p>Because students often communicate with others such as classmates and teachers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lu, Yao, and Yu (2005)</ref> found that a lecturer's influence was an important issue in learners' acceptance of online learning.</p><p>Findings concurred with <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Jairak et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ngampornchai &amp; Adams, 2016)</ref> and research in developing countries such as Ghana <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Boateng et al., 2016)</ref> and China <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Liu et al., 2010)</ref>; learners recognized that the benefits of e-learning affected their acceptance of this novel educational method.</p><p>From the discussion above, we offer the user's perspective on technology adoption. Another issue highlighted in the research is the quality of the ClassStart. This research found that information quality and system quality had some influence on the intention to use the ClassStart. The results of this study are consistent with previous research, which confirmed that system and information quality were important indicators for the adoption of user technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gan &amp; Balakrishnan, 2016)</ref>. In developing countries such as Oman, Al-Busaidi (2013) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sharma et al. (2017)</ref> found that the main issue affecting the acceptance of learners was system quality. Therefore, a successful e-learning system must offer high functionality with exceptional service quality.</p><p>Information quality had the most influence on the intention to use the ClassStart. This is because online learning application programs act as a mediator between the learner and the instructor.</p><p>This finding is consistent with previous research confirming that information quality was an important variable that affected the intention to use technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ahn, Ryu, &amp; Han, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Alla &amp; Faryadi, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">William H Delone &amp; McLean, 2003)</ref>. Possibly because the learner realizes the application presents information that is relevant, timely and easy to understand, which affects the decision-making process to use ClassStart.</p><p>Aside from the previously reported information, this research found that system quality also influenced the intention to use the ClassStart. This result is consistent with previous research that confirmed that the user's decision to use the system utilize will be affected by awareness of system attributes such as high quality, user-friendly accessibility and interactivity promoting ease of use <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gan &amp; Balakrishnan, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>It was surprising that service quality had little or no influence on the intention to use the ClassStart since previous research appeared to confirm that service quality was an important element in the success of information systems. Due to service quality meeting the needs of users in the adoption of information systems, service quality for online learning is an important part of the educational process <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hassanzadeh, Kanaani, &amp; Elahi, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Milošević et al., 2015)</ref>. Moreover, the devices used for online learning also vary such as personal computers, computer networks and mobile devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Milošević et al., 2015)</ref>. Students will use online learning when the quality of the system is perceived to be beneficial to the learner <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chong, Chong, Ooi, &amp; Lin, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">S. Y. Park, Nam, &amp; Cha, 2012)</ref>. However, this study did not focus on the influence of service quality on the intention to use the ClassStart. It may be that ClassStart has not been applied to all subjects, while other subjects are not used continuously. Thus, students have not been through this issue important to the decision to use ClassStart.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>From theoretical implications, this research applies Delone and McLean IS success model and</head><p>The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology to describe the intention to use the ClassStart. We found that the applied variables of two theories could better explain the intention to use with regard to performance expectancy, social influence, information quality and system quality. Thus, study about information systems, especially the education system, should not be concerned only about the user's perspective on technology adoption based on UTAUT and TAM, but should pay attention to the quality of the system. Although users have a positive attitude toward an acceptable information system, they still have problems when using the system, especially quality problems. William H <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Delone and McLean (2003)</ref> stated that when the information system is not available in quality aspect such as an inadequate of the service system and information incorrectness. These may affect learners' acceptance. In the educational system, quality factors play the important role in teaching and learning.</p><p>Importantly, it also resulted in learner's intention <ref type="bibr">(Kibelloh &amp; Bao, 2014b)</ref>. The results presented in this research can be used as the guideline in the context of developing countries like Thailand which is facing with these problems. Thus, future research can apply this research framework to study online learning adoption in various contexts such as mobile learning and web-based learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Practical implications</head><p>From practical implications, our research shows that performance expectancy had the most significant effect on intention to use ClassStart. We also found the influence of information and service qualities on intention to use the ClassStart. Thus, we suggest developers and designers of web-based learning sites concerned with the development of information systems should be aware of the quality of mobile applications because system quality and information quality are predictors of acceptance. It should also be important in the process of analysis, design and implementation as well as developing a reliable, flexible and timely system. By the way, the accuracy of input and output is important and should not be overlooked along with interface design to make it interesting. In addition, educational institutions, educational managers and teachers must continue to push for continuous learning through online learning to make students more familiar with studying online. Also, promoting learners' perspective in using online learning can achieve academic success by offering ease of use and flexibility, which reduces effort expectancy and increases performance expectations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Managerial implications</head><p>From managerial implications, the Ministry of Education, education adminstrator and related agencies should establish a master plan to enhance the use of technology-enhanced learning in the development of educational resources in various areas.</p><p> Improve the learning quality of learners, encouraging learners to take advantage of ICT for learning from a variety of sources and methods.</p><p> Develop the quality of instructors, produce and develop personnel to meet the demand for ICT.</p><p>Encourage training to keep up with the advancement of technology and bring the instructors into a sustainable learning environment.</p><p> Encourage the development of online learning and development of learning analytical tools to analyse and develop an online learning system to meet the needs of future learners as well as develop the quality of online learning in terms of information, systems and services, as well as develop ICT infrastructure to expand the access to education services to the fullest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>There are interesting limitations in this study, First of all, we describe the adoption of the ClassStart Future research can test against online learning acceptance in other countries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">Conclusion</head><p>Due to the ability of technology to enhance learning, many countries have become more aware of technology used to promote education, including developing countries like Thailand. This has changed the focus of student-centered instruction from limited learning in the classroom to learning through the internet. By integrating UTAUT and Delone and McLean IS success model, this research analyzes learner adoption of educational applications. Our results show that learners' technology adoption as well as the quality of the application impact overall adoption.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>It also supports mobile devices. Class Starts has been free for the instructors and learners all over the country. There are over 45,000 members, over 3,500 classes from over 200 educational institutes in Thailand. The features of Class Start include membership, classroom management, announcement, teaching document, classroom web board, learner group, exercise management, learning record, score, and score processing systems.

However, there may be other causes that affect future intention for use. The research may lead to other factors such as computer self-efficacy and perceived mobility. Secondly, we focused on the ClassStart. The sample used in this research was the learner. Future studies should expand on the current research to include the use or focus on other applications or focus on the learning analytical system to bring the data to be analysed and demonstrate the development or learning outcomes of the students. Thirdly, user behavior is dynamic and constantly changing. Long-term research may provide insights into how users will accept use over time. Finally, we carried out research in Thailand, where online learning is still in its early stages.
