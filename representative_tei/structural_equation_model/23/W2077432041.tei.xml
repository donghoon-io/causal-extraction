<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Various biological correlates of general intelligence (g) have been reported. Despite this, however, the relationship between neurological measurements and g is not fully clear. We use structural equation modeling to model the relationship between behavioral Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) estimates of g and neurological measurements (voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging of eight regions of interest). We discuss psychometric models that explicate the relationship between g and the brain in a manner in line with the scientific study of g. Fitting the proposed models to the data, we find that a MIMIC model (for multiple indicators, multiple causes), where the contributions of different brain regions to a unidimensional g are estimated separately, provides the best fit against the data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Although technological advances have expanded the possibilities for empirical research, the nature of the relationship between intelligence and the brain remains a contentious topic. This is partly an embarrassment of riches, as the list of properties that correlate with general intelligence is daunting. Research has shown that gray matter density, white matter integrity, skull volume, cortical thickness, uric acid levels, height, lower amplitude in the averaged evoked potential (a measure derived from the EEG signal), increased and decreased neural activity, functional efficiency, and nerve conduction velocity are associated with g <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Deary, Penke, &amp; Johnson, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Jensen, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jung &amp; Haier, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">and references therein)</ref>. In this paper, we aim to structure these findings by proposing a new modeling framework for studying the relationship between behavioral measurements of general intelligence and neurological measurements of the brain.</p><p>The interpretation of the term "intelligence" is itself the topic of several long-standing debates <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mackintosh, 1998)</ref>. For purposes of clarity, we focus on the interpretation of intelligence that is statistically most clearly defined, namely as the general factor of intelligence (also known as "g"). We consider g to represent a common source of variance in general cognitive ability. Studying the brain in relation to g, some researchers have coined the phrase "neuro g" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Haier et al., 2009)</ref>. This suggests a strong thesis, namely that there is some fundamental biological substrate that acts as a common cause of individual variability in performance on a wide variety of cognitive tests. From this point of view, we could consider the search for neuro g a quest for "[t]he substrate of human intelligence" <ref type="bibr">(Luders, Narr, Thompson, &amp; Toga, 2009, p. 156), undertaken "[t]</ref>o capture the essence of a neural basis of intelligence" <ref type="bibr">(Jung &amp; Haier, 2007, p. 178)</ref>. The above suggests that the aim of neuroscientific research on intelligence is not just to find some (neurological) property that correlates with a common factor extracted from a battery of IQ-test scores, but rather showing g to be a physical property of the brain.</p><p>Recent studies have extended the focus from single measures to integrating multiple lines of evidence. These approaches have combined structural and functional data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Choi et al., 2008)</ref>, structural and functional networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Li et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">van den Heuvel, Stam, Kahn, &amp; Hulshoff Pol, 2009)</ref>, and genetic modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chiang et al., 2009)</ref>. These approaches show that the synthesis of different techniques may be necessary to get a handle on the nature of g and the brain. Despite many advances, however, the identification of a neural property that could be identified with g has not been forthcoming. This has led some scholars to question whether any simple identification should be expected. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bartholomew (2004)</ref> suggests that g is not itself a physical characteristic of the brain, but rather a function of a set of distinct brain characteristics.</p><p>The distinction is comparable to the distinction between the length (height) of a person and his or her physical fitness. If g is similar to "length" (albeit more difficult to measure), then what we have to discover is how to best measure g in the brain, with the least amount of measurement error. However, if g is more similar to something akin to "physical fitness," then searching for a single physical property is ill-advised: Although physical fitness depends on a range of physical properties (e.g., lung capacity, metabolic rates, energy efficiency), the construct of "physical fitness" is best seen as a composite function of these characteristics, and cannot be identified with any single characteristic. If the latter perspective is more accurate, then neuroscientific research on g should not be interpreted as an attempt to find out what g is (i.e., which neural property uniquely defines g), but as a search for a possibly large and heterogeneous set of properties that together determine g.</p><p>Clearly, the relationship between g and the brain can be studied from a wide range of assumptions and hypotheses. However, these assumptions are not always made explicit. In this paper, we show how different assumptions and interpretations can be translated into testable psychometric models. Structural equation models (SEM) have been used profitably in analyzing functional neural systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">McIntosh &amp; Gonzalez-Lima, 1994)</ref>. Excellent introductions in the application and interpretation of SEM include <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bollen (1989)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kline (2005)</ref>. We use SEM in a new way by modeling various competing hypotheses for the relationship between observed and latent variables of g and the brain. We will examine the relationship between a set of representative regions of interest (ROIs) to study which models, with which implications, best represent the empirical data. We first discuss a number of candidate models for representing the relationship between neurological and psychological measurements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models</head><p>We use SEM to fit the following candidate models representing different assumptions and interpretations against the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neuro g 1: Same concept, new measures</head><p>The first psychometric interpretation of neuro g considers neurological measurements to depend on the same property as has traditionally been measured with psychometric instruments (i.e., g, as measured through IQ tests). The measurement model corresponding to this interpretation is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>From this perspective, one can consider neurological measurements (by means of brain scans) to be a new, potentially more precise way of measuring the same property (in this case, g). This model entails several statistical characteristics and conceptual implications explained in more detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kievit et al. (2011)</ref>. This is the simplest model considered here, and is most in line with terminology stressing "the neural substrate of g"or the "biological essence of g."</p><p>Neuro g 2 and Neuro g 3: Different properties, different measures Another conceptualization represents neuro g as a latent variable distinct from psychometric g. It can be seen as the biological "cousin" of psychometric g, and, as such, is a different property.</p><p>From this perspective, represented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, neuro g is a latent variable that represents a unidimensional neurological factor, measured by a set of neurological variables. This neuro g can be seen as a "property of the brain" that is relevant with respect to g, but not identical to it.</p><p>Hence, this model offers a different interpretation of the term "neuro g": namely, as a property of the brain that can be estimated by neurological measurements, and that correlates with g to an extent assessable by empirical study. The purpose of empirical research then is to discover which neurological properties (for instance, "gray matter density in region X," or "white matter integrity in area Y") covary together in a population such that this "neuro g" correlates most highly with g. As such, it could be interpreted as a latent factor that might be called "brain fitness." This perspective can take two psychometrically similar but conceptually distinct routes. In the first route, a single latent variable is conceived of as the aggregate of "brain fitness" variables. Versions of this model were implemented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">MacLullich et al. (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Penke et al. (2010)</ref>. In the second route, one utilizes multiple "neuro g" factors, attempting to caputre the dimensions along which people can vary neurologically. This conceptualization is represented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (neuro g 3) below, in this case with two latent neuro g's, although it could be extended to include more factors if necessary.</p><p>Allowing for multiple latent variables has two additional benefits: Firstly, this may be more neurologically plausible, as it does not require all neurological measurements to be monotonically related, as do models 1 and 2.</p><p>Secondly, such separate latent variables would allow for more substantive interpretation. It may be, for instance, that one neurological latent variable represents an estimate of "perceptual organization," another  represents "processing speed," and yet another represents "verbal ability." Attempting to model such latent variables may allow researchers to get a grip on the structure of different neurological dimensions along which people differ, and this would in turn facilitate interpretation and comparability across studies. This method may also be particularly appropriate for studying lower order factors such as spatial or verbal ability. Previous research suggests that although cognitive abilities are positively correlated, they may rely on different neural subsystems. If this is the case, it is worth examining the psychometric structure of neurological variables at the level of these lower-order factors. Those neural indicators that covary positively with a lower order factor may be especially insightful. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Henson (2005)</ref> discusses how neurological and behavioral measurements may together be able to distinguish between theories that propose either a unitary short-term memory factor or more than one lower-order memory factor, based on convergence of neuroimaging and behavioral data.</p><p>Of course, the structure of covariation between different neurological measurements and their relation to higher-or lower-order ability factors will depend on the nature of those indicators. For instance, that the development of white matter in different regions of the brain, at least in early life, is based on similar genetic mechanisms may suggest that there will be a higher degree of similarity between such measurements within an individual than between, say, white and gray matter values in the same brain region. Such considerations need to be taken into account when modeling. However, the structure of covariation of neurological measurements is ultimately an empirical question, and it is exactly the study of such covariance that may provide valuable insights regarding the neurophysiology of the brain and g.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neuro g 4: The brain determines differences in g</head><p>A final psychometric possibility we consider here is offered by a so-called MIMIC model (for multiple indicators, multiple causes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Jöreskog &amp; Goldberger, 1975)</ref>. This model represents an asymmetrical relationship between cause (formative) and effect (reflective) indicators (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Edwards &amp; Bagozzi, 2000)</ref>. From this perspective, represented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, psychometric g is determined by a constellation of neurological properties, but measured by psychological variables (e.g. an IQ test).</p><p>Here, the neurological properties do not measure but together form or determine an individual's score on g, akin to the "physical fitness" example discussed previously. This is in line with conceptualizations where g is seen as something that is determined by a constellation of brain properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bartholomew, 2004)</ref>. The model is also biologically less restrictive, as it allows for covariance between neurological measurements beyond those explaining variance in g; the neurological part of the model does not have to be unidimensional. The MIMIC model therefore may more naturally accommodate "brute facts" about the physiology of humans with respect to g. However, the model does assume that the neurological indicators have been measured without error, and this may be unrealistic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p>The data consisted of a sample of 80 participants (29 males, 51 females) who completed the Dutch version of the WAIS-III--a fully validated, translated version of the original WAIS (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale) (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wechsler, 2005)</ref>. Participants, who ranged from 18 to 29 years old, with a mean age of 21.1 years (SD ¼ 2.55), received either a financial reward or course credits for their participation. The participants were tested in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the American Psychological Association, and the study was approved by the University of Amsterdam Ethics Committee. The behavioral measurements consisted of four domain indices (Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Organization, Working Memory, and Processing Speed) of the WAIS-III. In addition to the completion of the WAIS-III, all participants were scanned in a 3 Tesla Philips Intera MRI scanner to estimate white matter, gray matter density, and brain volume measurements in eight ROIs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Image acquisition</head><p>Participants were scanned on a 3-T Philips Intera scanner, and all data were analyzed using FSL <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Smith et al., 2004)</ref>, MATLAB (Version 7.10.0, The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA), and Mplus <ref type="bibr">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">-2007)</ref>. A structural MRI scan of each participant was acquired by using a T1-weighted 3D sequence (Turbo Field Echo, TE 4.6 ms, TR 9.6 ms, FA 8 , 182 sagittal slices of 1.2 mm, FOV 250 2 mm, reconstruction matrix 256 2 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Image analysis</head><p>The structural data were analyzed with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) carried out with FSL <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Smith et al., 2004)</ref>. First, structural images were brainextracted <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Smith, 2002)</ref>. Next, tissue-type segmentation was carried out with FAST4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Zhang, 2001)</ref>. The so obtained gray-matter partial volumes were then aligned to MNI 152 standard space using the affine registration. The resulting images were averaged to create a study-specific template, to which the native graymatter images were then nonlinearly reregistered with a method that uses a b-spline representation of the registration warp field <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Andersson, Jenkinson, &amp; Smith, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rueckert et al. 1999</ref>). The registered partial volume images were modulated (to correct for local expansion or contraction) by dividing by the Jacobian of the warp field. The modulated segmented images were smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel with a sigma of 4 mm. In addition, a DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) scan was run (echo planar imaging, TE 94 ms, TR 7.720 ms, FA 90 , 40 slices, FOV 224 2 , reconstruction matrix 128 2 ). The diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were also analyzed with FSL, now using the TBSS (Tract Based Spatial Statistics) package <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Smith et al., 2006)</ref>. The above procedure was applied to the first and second T1 and DWI scans separately, creating two data sets that are independent from the perspective of noise. The first data set was used to identify ROIs. Threshold-free cluster enhancement was applied to all data sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Smith &amp; Nichols, 2009)</ref>. Data were further thresholded at a value of p &lt; .01 (minimum cluster size 50 mm 3 ) for DWI data and p &lt; .01 (cluster size 800 mm 3 ) for VBM data. The second data set was used to extract the actual values from the ROIs yielded by the first analysis. In this way, these ROIs were not artificially inflated in terms of statistical fitting. From both the VBM and DTI data, the two ROIs that were strongest positively correlated with the FSIQ score on the WAIS-III, and the two ROIs that were strongest negatively correlated with FSIQ were used for further analysis. This procedure resulted in eight ROIs (four VBM and four DTI measures), of which the MNI coordinates of the center of gravity are in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. All these ROIs have previously been associated with individual differences in general cognitive abilities (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Deary et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jung &amp; Haier, 2007</ref>, and references therein); Brodmann's area (BA) 9 bordering on 46, BA area 9 bordering on 48, BA area 20, and BA area 18. The DTI loci were also in accordance with previous findings, such as for the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and various sections of the corpus callosum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>We report results for four latent variable models, which were fitted using Mplus <ref type="bibr">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">-2007)</ref> by maximum likelihood estimation. In a covariance structure analysis, the model-implied covariances are compared to the observed covariances. Fit indices represent the deviation or misfit of the observed covariance structure. We evaluate model fit by means of the chi-square test of model fit, the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the comparative fit index (CFI), and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). For discussions on the relative merits of these fit indices, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Schermelleh-Engel, Moosbrugger, and Müller (2003)</ref>.</p><p>For the SEM analyses, a total of 12 observed variables were modeled: four domain scores of the WAIS-III, and measurements of four VBM, and four DTI ROIs. The WAIS sum scores were as follows: Verbal Comprehension (M ¼ 117.16, SD ¼ 9.78), Perceptual Organization (M ¼ 112.10, SD ¼ 11.31), Working Memory (M ¼ 111.32, SD ¼ 13.11), and Processing Speed (M ¼ 116.38, SD ¼ 14.80). We implement a simplified, nonhierarchical g model here for purposes of simplicity and model fitting. This model may be extended to include latent first-order factors without affecting the core ideas of the models.</p><p>To ensure that the indicators of g variables are psychometrically adequate, we first fit a confirmatory model with the four WAIS sum scores and one latent g factor. The chi-square test of model did not reject the one-factor model of g χ 2 (2, n ¼ 80) ¼ 2.15, p &gt; .30. This fit was corroborated by the other fit indices, RMSEA (0.031) and CFI (0.996). We then fitted the four models discussed previously. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows the resulting fit statistics. The standardized parameter estimates for all four neuro g models are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>.</p><p>First, consider the simple, reflective model, in which all indicators are considered to reflect g. This model does not fit: It is rejected by the chi-square test, and other indicators corroborate this poor fit. That is, for this data set, neurological measurements cannot be considered measurements of g. Naturally, this may be a contingent fact about our data set. However, we think that the multifaceted nature of neurological properties that covary with g make this model an unlikely candidate for other data sets as well. For model 1 then, the report seems dire: Although this representation is in line with the terminology of "neuro g," it is not plausible a priori, and fits poorly when tested in a representative data set. In summary, these data indicate that neuro g should not be taken to refer to a unidimensional constellation of neural properties identical to g. Whether or not other constellations of neural indicators not explored in this study will fit such a unidimensional factor coincident with g is an empirical question that is still open, but, for the reasons we give above, we do not consider it very likely.</p><p>Model 2, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, represents neuro g as a separate latent variable that correlates with g. As can be seen in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, this model was also rejected for our data set, reflecting the lack of unidimensionality in the neurological measurements. That is, at least in this data set, a constellation of neurological measurements cannot be considered a unidimensional property of individuals, akin to a kind of "brain fitness factor." Despite the fact that these measures correlate independently with g, they do not intercorrelate positively.</p><p>Model 3 (shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) estimates multiple (in this case, two) latent neural factors that correlate with g. To fit this model, we implemented a new method available in Mplus, namely a combined exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. As Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows (model 3), this model is also rejected, although the fit is considerably less poor than the fit of models 1 and 2. This model, although rejected for this data set, seems more intuitively plausible and offers more in the way of interpretation, and in our view may well be an option worth considering for further research.</p><p>Finally, we consider the formative, or MIMIC model, as represented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. This model is not rejected by the chi-square test of model fit, and other indicators also represent adequate to good fit (see Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, model 4). For this data set, we can consider neurological measurements to jointly predict a unidimensional g, although they do not themselves form a unidimensional scale. This situation is consistent with the idea that the neurological properties together determine individual differences in g. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows this best-fitting model, including standardized parameter estimates of each of the neural indicators.</p><p>Based on this data set, the simplest candidates for neuro g are rejected. The more complex models, which either attempt to capture several latent dimensions of neurological covariation (model 3) or model an asymmetric relationship between g and the brain (model 4), perform better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GENERAL DISCUSSION</head><p>Neuro g is unlikely to be a physical characteristic of the human brain as measured by our neurological indicators, and it is also unlikely to be a unidimensional physical variable correlated with psychometric g. More complex models are needed to explain the joint covariance structure of neurological and behavioral measures. These models feature either an asymmetric relationship between g and the brain, or capture several dimensions of covariation. Thus, it seems at least unlikely that there is a simple "neuro g". Of course, these conclusions are partly contingent on the data we acquired here: It may be that other data sets yield  <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>different conclusions regarding the models. Moreover, there is always the possibility that unobserved third factors are the source of covariation between neurological indicators and intelligence (e.g., white matter, cardiovascular factors, and cognitive ability; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Marks et al., 2007)</ref>, although this problem is not unique for SEM. More generally, although SEM has many statistical benefits over traditional techniques, there are issues that require careful attention, including model equivalence <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lee &amp; Hershberger, 1990)</ref>, model selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Myung &amp; Pitt, 1997)</ref>, and judging model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Schermelleh-Engel et al., 2003)</ref>. In addition, SEM generally requires larger sample sizes than other approaches, although required samples are not prohibitive (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Marsh &amp; Hau, 1999)</ref>. Nonetheless, SEM offers various essential benefits over more traditional methods. Most importantly, they allow for the flexible comparison of various models in such a way that they can be compared across studies. In this paper, we were able to compare various competing hypotheses, reject certain alternatives, and tentatively conclude that the MIMIC perspective currently offers the best explanation of the data analyzed here. Moreover, SEM is a flexible tool: It could be extended by focusing on different neural indicators (that may show higher factor loadings or fit to stricter models), or by examining hierarchical models of g (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carroll, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>This finding is in line with recent work in other fields, such as that of emotion research. <ref type="bibr">Lindquist, Wager, Kober, Bliss-Moreau, &amp; Barrett (in press)</ref> show that, for the relation between emotions and the brain, a model similar to the MIMIC model is better supported empirically than the essentialist view (where the activity of one specialized subsystem is considered the core feature of a particular emotion, as in model 1). In addition, the statistical and conceptual properties of the MIMIC model are most compatible with contemporary perspectives on the genetic influences on g (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Penke, Denissen, &amp; Miller, 2007)</ref>. In terms of the MIMIC model, genetic effects may therefore feature as predictors alongside the neurological variables.</p><p>Our approach emphasizes the importance of conceptual and statistical clarity for neuroscientific research in intelligence. Neuroscientific findings should, whenever possible, go beyond simple measures of association. Psychometric modeling techniques, as discussed in this paper, allow us to see beyond simple correlations. This enables the investigation of conceptual hypotheses on the relation between intelligence and the brain that were hitherto the province of mere speculation. By explicitly representing, modeling, and testing competing hypotheses, we may be able to finally get a grip on this complex problem. We can only hope that, as was the case in the history of general intelligence and the development of factor analytic methods, competing methods and models will lead the way to new conceptual and empirical developments. We think that this will prove to be the most interesting, insightful, and productive road to a better understanding of the neurological basis of intelligence.</p><p>Original manuscript received 22 June 2011 Revised manuscript accepted 27 September 2011</p><p>First published online 18 January 2012</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
