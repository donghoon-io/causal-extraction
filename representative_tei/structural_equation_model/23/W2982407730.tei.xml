<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>What drives performance of small-and medium-sized enterprises remains largely unanswered and this article is an attempt in that direction to fill in the gap and help evolve the body of knowledge. The article is designed to produce theoretical insights on how top management team (TMT) sharing leadership, market culture, and firm innovation capability, relates to firm performance. Drawing on the resource-based and the dynamic capabilities-based view, we propose that firm innovation capability mediates between the linkages of shared leadership and marketoriented culture with firm performance. In this article, we performe structural equation modeling on survey data collected from 336 small-and medium-sized enterprises in the United Arab Emirates to examine the proposed hypothesized model of the study. The results reveal that both shared leadership and market-oriented culture have positive effects on firm innovation capability. This article suggests that market-oriented culture mediates the relationships of TMT-shared leadership and firm innovation capability. Similarly, firm innovation capability mediates the influence of market-oriented culture and firm performance, and the influence of TMT-shared leadership and firm performance. This article contributes to advance theory and practices. This article also makes sound theoretical and practical contributions to the usage of the resource-based and the dynamic capabilities view in the domain of the small-and medium-sized enterprises.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>S MALL-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play criti- cal role in the growth of a country as they have flexible decision-making processes and motivated to respond to the markets quickly than large firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. At the same time, SMEs operate with limited resources and capabilities that impede their ability to conduct in-house research and developmental activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref> to beat competitions, especially in the context of fast changing technology and market environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. Therefore, firms should possess innovation capability to stay competitive as it increases barriers against imitations by the rivals, reduces the cost of production and/or services, and retain old customers as well as attract new ones and to drive firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>. Firm innovation capability refers to the process of collecting relevant market information and knowledge that firms leverage to develop new processes, services, and products to satisfy customers' needs and stay relevant in the markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>. Innovation capabilities of firms depend upon how well it collects relevant information, data, and knowledge about their competitors and customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>. However, SMEs face difficulty to improve innovation capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> as they are new and small in the competitive markets that frequently impede their abilities to benefit from methodical idea generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> to satisfy needs of the customers.</p><p>The extant literature depicts the importance of innovation capabilities in enhancing firms' competitive advantage and helping them sustain superior performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. Several researchers suggest that top management team's (TMT's) shared leadership style <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> and market culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> drives innovation capability and performance in large firms. Moreover, TMTshared leadership favors collective decision making to generate strategic alternatives and work together to reconcile paradoxes, if any <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> for generation of new ideas and creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref> for enhanced firm performance. However, what drives performance of SMEs remains largely unanswered and this article is an attempt in that direction to fill in the gap and helps evolve the body of knowledge. Drawing upon both resource-based view (RBV) and the dynamic capabilities view (DCV) as theoretical lenses, this article explores how do SMEs leverage their strategic resources namely shared leadership and market-oriented culture to improve upon their innovation capabilities for enhanced firm performance. SMEs should possess resources that are valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable, and nonsubstitutable <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and supports innovation capabilities necessary to assimilate, construct, and reconfigure their resources and competencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref> in the dynamic markets.</p><p>We believe that entrepreneurship connects investments in knowledge creation and economic development together <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and this article contributes to advance theory and practices and it primarily makes three key contributions. First, this article advances the RBV and the DCV as theoretical lenses to understand the interplay of TMT-shared leadership and market-oriented culture to influence SMEs' innovation capability and performance. Second, this research is situated in the UAE context wherein entrepreneurship as a profession and passion is highly valued socially and well supported by the governmental agencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, as the SMEs contribute approximately 30% to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the <ref type="bibr">UAE [40]</ref>. This article offers relevant practical suggestions to the UAE government agencies on how to leverage key resources and capabilities to enable SMEs to grow in the dynamic business environment. Last, but not the least, this article advances the aim of IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT with respect to decision making and policy formulation on how to develop and sustain firm innovation capabilities for the benefits of the SMEs, the society, and the country.</p><p>The rest of this article is arranged as follows. Section II presents theory and hypotheses followed by methods in the Section III. We present the findings of this article and theoretical and practical contributions of this article in Sections IV. Section V concludes this article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. THEORY AND HYPOTHESES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. RBV and DCV</head><p>The RBV conceptualizes firm to possess unique packet of tangible and intangible assets and capabilities that are valuable, rare, inimitable, and nonsubstitutable (i.e., VRIN) to attain competitive advantage and superior performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. As such, the intangible resources and capabilities (i.e., VRIN) help firms to develop inimitable, organization-specific core competencies to allow them to beat competitors by doing things differently <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. Therefore, we posit that if these strategic resources and capabilities of firms found to be valuable to customers, rare, and difficult to imitate, then these resources contribute to competitive advantage and increases firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Extant literature supports this conception, and continues to recognize and categorize such strategic resources that meet the criteria as suggested in the RBV <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>.</p><p>RBV originated initially in the discipline of strategic management <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>; it continues to evolve within the field of SMEs which necessitates a need to investigate whether different strategic resources are required by SMEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> to succeed in the todays' fierce competitive and dynamic markets. The key argument of the RBV is that competitive advantages are increased to the level that a firm holds its strategic assets <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and the assertion of RBV with some limitations finds supports until date <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. Therefore, drawing on the RBV, we posit that a higher level of firm innovation capability drives firm performance. As such, firms that are intelligent to use their strategic resources namely TMT-shared leadership, market-oriented culture, and innovation capability will eventually obtain the benefits of a higher firm performance.</p><p>However, the RBV perspective has not gone unchallenged as they failed to satisfactorily explain why and how specific enterprise to achieve competitive advantage in conditions of fast and volatile change <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>. As a result, RBV has been extended to dynamic markets where the competitive scene is shifting the dynamic capabilities (DC) wherein organization "integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competencies" to address fast shifting business landscape <ref type="bibr">[107, p. 516]</ref>. RBV emphasizes sustainable competitive advantage, whereas the DC focus on competitive survival in reply to the rapidly changing industry environment. The DCV of the firms refers to the capability of organization to persistently build, extend, or amend its asset <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> for the express purpose of delivering competitive advantage necessary for producing and supporting superior firm performance in the dynamic market <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>.</p><p>Extant literature suggest that firms learn continuously to deal with sustainability-related issues and that pushes firms to develop sustainable DC <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> and integrate them into their core business for a long-term strategy for explicit purposes namely, access to key resources, social and environmental responsibility, and legitimacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. Drawing upon the DVC, we argue that SMEs should deliberately make strategy embedded in the needs and demands of dynamic markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> that support firm's DC to effectively sense, seize and transform all available opportunities in a fast changing business environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>. In the context of SMEs, we posit that SMEs should practice mixing strategy for innovations with DC to be ready to address (new) customer needs, target right markets (new and old ones), and manage their stakeholders accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>. Therefore, drawing upon both RBV and DCV, we posit that SMEs' strategic resources namely TMT-shared leadership and marketoriented culture act on DC-i.e., innovation capabilities-and that in turn enhances firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. TMT-Shared Leadership and Market-Oriented Culture</head><p>TMT-shared leadership is a cooperative communal process involving interactions of multiple actors <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref> wherein leadership is carried out by the team in setting organizational goals, priorities, task behaviors, and group maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. Market-oriented culture, on the other hand, aims at creating higher customer value <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> through organizational practices that emphasizes market-oriented values, norms, market-associated norms, and actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. TMT-shared leadership favors collective decision making for generating strategic alternatives and reconciling paradoxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. TMT-shared leadership being a team process and most suited for SMEs as there is natural linkage between leadership and entrepreneurship <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. Therefore, TMT-shared leadership is responsible for installing and leveraging firm market-oriented culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> through exploratory and exploitative innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> for superior firm performance. Furthermore, we posit that TMT-shared leadership creates conditions to practice market-oriented culture with twin objectives of satisfying customer needs and close eyes over the competitors' offerings, through shifting between roles of leader and follower <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref> so as to create interdependence among team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. Thus, we predict:</p><p>Hypothesis 1 (H1): TMT-shared leadership influences marketoriented culture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. TMT-Shared Leadership and Firm Innovation Capability</head><p>TMT-shared leadership is multifaceted, adaptive progression that comprises uninterrupted leading and following interfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> that has distinctive impact on the performance of team <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref> and a useful predictor of team effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>. In other words, shared leadership is a kind of participative leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref> and is inextricably linked with the innovation and the creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. On the other hand, innovation capability is an intangible asset that firms exploit it to produce innovations continually <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref> wherein firms transform ideas and knowledge into processes, services, and products for the benefits of the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>.</p><p>We argue that TMT-shared leadership provides psychological climate for the team members to lead themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> and share responsibilities with each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref> and such a kind of leadership push coworkers to engage in innovative job behaviors, experimentations, and out-of-box thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Such a kind of leadership develops competencies in the coworkers, who are future focused as well as internally programmed to develop as well as use new technologies for process and product innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. Therefore, the TMT allocates larger amount of valuable strategic assets for innovation-related activities and adoption of innovation-oriented strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref> to enhance the organization's capability to compete with the competitors. We posit that innovation capability acts as a catalyst for firms to cultivate innovations uninterruptedly, in their processes and/or products, to respond to the dynamic markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref> and beat competitions from their rivals in the marketplace. Therefore, we predict:</p><p>Hypothesis 2 (H2): TMT-shared leadership influences firm innovation capability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Market-Oriented Culture and Firm Innovation Capability</head><p>Market-oriented culture keeps organizations close to the marketplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> through its strong client focus together with evaluation of strengths and weaknesses of enterprise <ref type="bibr">[59, p. 29</ref>]. Moreover, market-oriented culture emphasizes upon incorporation of the voice of the customers into organization's strategies, cultures, and behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> to achieve competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>. Therefore, market-oriented culture has been found to positively impact new product performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> and, to reap its benefits, managers need to complement it with appropriate marketing performance measurement metrics but its level and focus vary across small-to-large organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. Furthermore, we argue that market-oriented culture and firm innovation capabilities are inextricably intertwined <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref> as the former positively influence firms innovation capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> and also necessary for innovation-related efforts in the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. Therefore, we posit that market-oriented culture increases firm's ability to collect and use knowledge about competitors, competitions, and customers, and that in turn results in market-based innovation in products and/or processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. In other words, market-oriented culture enhances firms' exploratory capabilities to exploit knowledge through innovations, resulting in higher business performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Therefore, we propose: Hypothesis 3 (H3): Market-oriented culture influences firm innovation capability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Firm Innovation Capability and Firm Performance</head><p>Firm innovation capability helps companies to cope effectively in dynamic business environments through the development of products and/or processes for enhanced firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref>. The TMT of entrepreneurial enterprise continuously engage in using all the available resources at its disposal to develop firm innovation capability to enhance firm performance through new product lines/production methods, entering new markets, and discover new sources of supply of raw materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Therefore, we argue that innovation capability is firm's DC that are leveraged to develop cutting-edge knowledge intensive products to satisfy customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref> and enhance firm performance. Furthermore, firm performance depends on leveraging firm innovation capability to create new processes, services, and products to increase barriers against imitations by rivals in the dynamic markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. Moreover, firms with commitment to continuous innovation is likely to reduce costs of production and/or services, retaining old customers along with attracting new customers and that in turn results in increased market and financial performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. However, Simpson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref> suggest that firm innovation orientation in the early phase has a negative side namely decrement in short-term profit, market risk, stressed and dissatisfied human capital and substantial investment expenses, but it benefits firms as innovation orientation improves the long-term performance of firms. Therefore, we hypothesize: Hypothesis 4 (H4): Firm innovation capability influences firm performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Shared Leadership and Firm Performance</head><p>Shared leadership in a TMT setting is carried out by team as a whole wherein there is distribution of leadership tasks among TMT members <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Shared leadership encourages functional conflict and inclusive decision making within the TMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Extant literature suggest that TMT-shared leadership is critical for firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. The linkages between TMT-shared leadership and objective performance results make SMEs a perfect context <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, as TMT-shared leadership behavior relate to interdependence among team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. We argue that the shared leadership facilitates the process of developing shared strategic cognition and this shared cognition in the TMT influences firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Therefore, we predict: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Mediating Role of Market-Oriented Culture</head><p>Several studies suggest that TMT-shared leadership impacts firm innovation capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. TMT-shared leadership aims at developing future-focused competencies among their employees toward the use of new technologies for innovation in processes, products, and/or services for the benefits of the enterprises <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. Furthermore, TMT-shared leadership creates conditions for innovations to flourish through allocation of invaluable strategic assets to innovation-related activities aimed at new process/service/product development and adoption of innovation-oriented approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref> necessary to increase firm's ability to compete in the dynamic markets. As a result, firm innovation capability acts as a catalyst to promote process/product/service innovations repeatedly for firm to respond to the dynamic markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>.</p><p>Extant literature suggests that TMT-shared leadership positively influences market-oriented culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. TMT-shared leadership, through shifting between roles of leader and follower, builds environments to practice market-oriented culture with twin aims of customer satisfaction and also to keep close eyes over the competitors' offerings <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> so as to create interdependence among team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. Similarly, market-oriented culture results in incorporating customers' voice into strategies, cultures, and behaviors of organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> for the purpose of making positive influence on new product development and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. As such, market-oriented culture prevails upon team members to constantly innovate products and services for customer satisfaction and ensuring tough competition for rivals <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Therefore, we predict: Hypothesis 6 (H6): Market-oriented culture mediates between TMTshared leadership and firm innovation capability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H. Mediation Role of Firm Innovation Capability</head><p>The relationships of market-oriented culture-firm innovation capability performance are not always linear but can be nonlinear too, as market-oriented culture indirectly through firm innovation capability influences SME performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. The market-oriented culture facilitates culture of innovation and continuous improvement in organizational processes and systems for developing a distinctive firm's innovation capabilities relative to the market competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. We posit that market culture influences innovation capabilities to let the firms to survive and succeed better than their competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> and that, in turn, results in enhanced firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref> (De Luca &amp; Atuahene-Gima, 2007). Furthermore, several other research works suggested that firm innovation capability is positively associated with the performance of organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> (Carmen &amp; Jose, 2008) and can be effectively leveraged by firms. Therefore, we propose:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 7(H7): Firm innovation capability mediates between market-oriented culture and firm performance.</head><p>We contemplate that leveraging firm innovation capability to achieve stated goals is a function of intentions and abilities of leaders and members of organizations. Such an organizational atmosphere is best achieved through shared leadership, as it is a significant and positive predictor of performance and effectiveness of the workgroup <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>. Shared leadership arises from willingness of leader to pass on the leadership authority and power to the team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> and readiness of TMT team to agree to take the responsibilities and opportunities to concurrently lead and follow their colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. We posit that TMT-shared leadership predicts performance of team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref> and variance in performance across academic and organizational contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>, especially when team as a unit possess superior task-related competencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Hence, we hypothesize that: Hypothesis 8 (H8): Firm innovation capability mediates between TMT-shared leadership and firm performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Proposed Research Framework</head><p>Based on the extant research literature and hypotheses framed, we propose a research framework in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> to be examined empirically in this article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Data and Sample</head><p>We conducted this study on 336 SMEs belonging to the service and the manufacturing sectors in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates. Initially, we approached 538 SMEs to participate but only 489 of them agreed to take part in our study but 336 valid filled-in survey questionnaires returned from the dyad-the CEOs/TMT and the production/operations manager-were used to examine hypotheses of our study. The CEOs/TMT responded to the shared leadership and the firm performance questionnaires. The production/operations manager responded to survey questionnaire items for the market-oriented culture and firm innovation capability. All the items in the survey questionnaires were rated on seven-point Likert scale (wherein 1 = low and 7 = high) by the CEOs/TMT and the production/operations managers. Before actual data collection, we pilot tested the measuring instruments on CEOs/TMT-Production/Operations Managers dyad in 23 service and manufacturing sectors SMEs in Abu Dhabi, the UAE, to test for ambiguity, if any, in the framing of the items using 10-point rating scale (wherein 1 = highly ambiguous and 10 = highly unambiguous). All 28 items of measuring instruments for shared leadership, market-oriented culture, firm innovation capability, and firm performance were found to be unambiguous with some rewording of the items. Since the original measuring instruments were in English and majority of the respondents were fluent in Arabic reading and writing, we followed Brislin <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for translation-back translation procedure-from English to Arabic and back to English.</p><p>In this article, we followed Latan <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> to test for the nonresponse bias and the common method bias to understand about the characteristics of the sample. We used the independent t-test to between the early respondents and the late respondents to confirm that the respondents represent the characteristics of the population from where they were picked in this study and Table <ref type="table">I</ref> indicates no significant difference as the significance values were &gt;0.05. Thus, our dataset does not have nonresponse biases and the results obtained from this dataset can be generalized to larger population due to the same sampling weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Afterward, we used average full collinearity VIF <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> to examine the dataset for the common method biases, if any, wherein the AFVIF was obtained 1.968 &lt; 3.3. This result illustrates that common-method bias is absent from the dataset. Finally, we used Cochran's sample size formula as per recommendations of Bartlett et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to test for the minimum sample size necessary to carry out this study. It was found that minimum 209 sample (wherein margin of error = 0.03; alpha value = 0.01) as per Bartlett et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> is good enough to examine the hypotheses and the sample size in this study was 336.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLE III TEST FOR CONVERGENT VALIDITY</head><p>Table <ref type="table">II</ref> shows that SMEs in this study were from service and manufacturing sectors namely, chemical products, cargo and shipping, constructions, electrical appliances, tourism and hospitality, logistics, information technology, perfume manufacturing, food packaging, and fashion and beauty in Abu Dhabi, the UAE. The respondents in the CEOs/TMT bracket had 73.81% male and 26.19% female, and the production/operations mangers comprised 62.80% male and 37.20% female. About 65% of the CEOs/TMTs and 63% of the production/operations managers were in the age bracket 36-56 years. Furthermore, about 81% of the CEOs/TMT and 94% of the production/operations managers had minimum bachelor level of education in arts, science and technology, engineering, and management disciplines. Finally, about 97% of SMEs had 200-500 employee counts during the time of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Variables</head><p>1) Shared Leadership: It had eight items adopted from Mihalache et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. The sample items include the top management in my organization collectively "sets strategic objectives," "make critical decision," and "evaluate business performance." The Cronbach alpha was 0.914 (see Table <ref type="table">III</ref>). Confirmatory factor analysis reveals satisfactory data fit (χ2/df = 1.543, p &lt; 0.001; CFI = 0.991; TLI = 934; SRMR = 0.030; RMSEA = 0.059) and they all were in the range.</p><p>2) Market-Oriented Culture: We adopted six items subscale of market culture of Cameron and Quin <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> in this article. The sample items includes "competitive market leadership key to winning in the markets and beating the competition." The Cronbach alpha was 0.870 (see Table <ref type="table">III</ref>). The goodness-of-fit indices of market-oriented culture scale (χ2/df = 1.738, p &lt; 0.001; TLI = 0.968; SRMR = 0.033, RMSEA = 0.069) were in the satisfactory range.</p><p>3) Firm Innovation Capability: It had five items adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The sample items included were our company frequently tries out "new ideas," "new way of doing things," etc. The goodness-of-fit indices were (χ2/df = 1.149, p &lt; 0.001; TLI = 0.986; SRMR = 0.021; RMSEA = 0.031) in acceptable range and Cronbach alpha coefficient was 0.868 (see Table <ref type="table">III</ref>).</p><p>4) Firm Performance: It had two subscales with five and four items each for financial and market performance was adopted </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TABLE V TESTING FOR DIRECT EFFECT</head><p>Wherein SL = shared leadership, MOC = market-oriented culture, FIC = firm innovation capability, FPERF = firm performance.</p><p>from <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>. The sample items include my firm has performed better than competitors in last three years in terms of "customer retention," "return of investment," "entering new markets," etc. The Cronbach alpha was 0.864 as in Table <ref type="table">III</ref>. The goodness-of-fit indices of the scale were (χ2/df = 1.409, p &lt; 0.001; TLI = 0.958; SRMR = RMSEA = 0.051) in the acceptable range.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Measurement Validation</head><p>We used Cronbach alpha to assess reliability of all four measuring instruments <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and they ranged from 0.864 to 0.914 (see Table <ref type="table">III</ref>). Furthermore, we measured convergent and divergent validity of the measuring instruments. Here, the individual item should load on their intended constructs with standardized loadings in the range of &gt;0.5 to ≥0.7, scale composite reliability (SCR) should be &gt;0.7, and average variance extracted (AVE) should be &gt;0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. Table <ref type="table">III</ref> suggests that all four measuring instruments had high convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>, as the standardized loading of individual item on their intended construct was obtained in the range of ≥0.666 to 0.966 with SCR ≥ 0.870 to 0.934, AVE ≥ 0.527 to 0.621. Therefore, it explains that items of the scale elucidate higher variance than the error terms and suggest that the measurement instruments were unidimensional <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. Furthermore, we examined discriminant validity of the constructs wherein we found that the standardized loading of the items of scale ranged from ≥0.666 to 0.966 and the square root of the AVE was greater than the correlations amongst the constructs. Hence, Tables III and IV together suggest that constructs in this study have discriminant validity as per the recommendations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Structural Model</head><p>We used the structural equation model (SEM) to test the hypotheses. The results for the "testing for direct effect" and the "testing for indirect effect" are presented in Tables V and VI, respectively. In other words, TMT-shared leadership positively influences market-oriented culture (H1), firm innovation capability (H2), and firm performance (H5). On the other hand, market-oriented culture affects firm innovation capability (H3) and firm innovation capability to influence firm performance (H4).</p><p>2) Testing for Mediating Effects: We used bootstrapping statistics while performing the SEM, as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref>, to test for the hypotheses related to the mediating effects among the constructs in the proposed framework of this article.  (β = 0.095, p &lt; 0.036), (β = 0.047, p &lt; .037), and (β = 0.178, p &lt; .002) respectively. Therefore, this article suggests that market-oriented culture mediates the relationships of TMTshared leadership and firm innovation capability (H6). Similarly, results in Table VI suggest that firm innovation capability mediates the influence of market-oriented culture and firm performance (H7), and the influence of TMT-shared leadership and firm performance (H8).</p><p>V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Important literature in the field suggest for how TMT-shared leadership affects market-oriented culture to satisfy customer needs and keep close eyes over the competitors' offerings, through shifting between roles of leader and follower <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>. Furthermore, past studies indicate about the critical role of market-oriented culture vis-à-vis firm innovation capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> as the market-oriented culture increases organizational ability to collect and use knowledge about competitors, competitions, and customers to increase firm innovation capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> for enhanced firm performance. In this article, we empirically examined five direct and three indirect hypotheses and they were accepted. Therefore, the findings of this article support previous studies that TMT-shared leadership influences market-oriented culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>, firm innovation capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>, and firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Similarly, this article supported past studies that market-oriented culture influences firm innovation capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref> and firm innovation capability to influence firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. In addition, we found that firm innovation capability mediates on to the influence of TMT-shared leadership and market-oriented culture on firm performance. Last, but not the least, we also found market-oriented culture to mediate on to the linkage between TMT-shared leadership and firm performance. Overall, the findings of this article make significant theoretical and practical contributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Theoretical Contributions</head><p>This article offers three theoretical contributions. First, our study advances the usage of both RBV and DCV lenses to understand how firm innovation capability helps enhance SMEs' performance in the UAE context. The finding of the article suggests that SMEs should enhance their DC (i.e., innovation capabilities) in a manner that they become able to effectively sense, seize, and transform all available opportunities in their dynamic markets for enhanced firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>. This article also suggests that TMT-shared leadership and market-oriented culture act as strategic resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> that SMEs should leverage to increase their innovation capabilities-the DC-for enhanced firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>. Moreover, we suggest that SMEs should leverage their strategic resources-TMT-shared leadership and market-oriented culture-in a manner to enhance their dynamic innovation capabilities to address (new) customer needs, target the right markets (new and old ones), and manage their stakeholders accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>.</p><p>Second, previous studies suggested that TMT-shared leadership influences market-oriented culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> and firm innovation capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> and market-oriented culture predicts firm innovation capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. Based on the findings of this article, we suggest that TMT-shared leadership also indirectly influences firm innovation capability through market-oriented culture. In other words, TMT-shared leadership symbolizes shifting the roles of leader and follower among themselves for creating interdependence among team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> so as to incorporate customers' voice into strategies, cultures, and behaviors of organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> for the purpose of making positive influence on new product development and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. Therefore, this article fill in the gaps in the available literature on how to enhance firm innovation capability for sustainable competitive advantage.</p><p>Thirdly, this article extends the literature on firm innovation capability vis-à-vis firm performance. Extant literature suggest that firm innovation capability helps enterprises to cope effectively in dynamic markets through innovation in processes, products, and/or services to keep customers happy and satisfied and enhance the firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>. Several research works also note that innovation capability of firm increases barriers against imitations by rivals in the business environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. This article extends the findings of the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> wherein we suggest that TMT-shared leadership and market-oriented culture boost firm innovation capability and that drives superior SMEs' performance. We suggest that firm innovation capability cannot exist in isolation but it requires strategic resources namely, TMT-shared leadership and market-oriented culture as springboard to drive enhanced firm performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Practical Implications</head><p>This article offers several practical implications as well. First, SMEs play a critical role in the growth of the country through their quick and flexible decision making, entrepreneurial dynamism, flexibility, motivation, etc. SMEs in the UAE contribute 30% of the GDP and entrepreneurial ventures are highly valued by the UAE society as one of the best career choices <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref>. Therefore, while extending the findings of this article, we suggest that governmental agencies responsible for supporting SMEs should provide training to the entrepreneurs on developing shared leadership skills to boost the innovation capabilities of the entrepreneurial ventures to stay competitive in the markets. Second, the UAE is ranked 26th among 139 countries and 1st among the countries in the Middle Eastern and North Africa on Networked Readiness Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. That speaks volume about UAE government intentions to leverage all opportunities that information and communications technology (ICT) offers to the SMEs. However, the optimum exploit of opportunities offered by ICT depends upon organizational culture namely, beliefs, values and norms in practice at workplace in the SMEs. This article suggests that SMEs should install market-oriented culture to exploit available opportunities that ICT offers especially to develop and sustain firm innovation capability. Third, this article suggests that SMEs innovation capability drives firm performance-the market and the financial performance. Therefore, we suggest that SMEs should be future focused in how to develop and use new technologies for process and product innovation aimed at achieving competitive advantage necessary for creating and sustaining superior performance of SMEs in the dynamic market.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Limitations and Direction for Future Research</head><p>Like any other study in the management science disciplines, this article is not without limitations. Thus, we present the limitations of this article with suggestions and direction for future research. First, we relied on the perceptual measures of the constructs. As a result, we suggest that future research should use both objective and subjective measures, especially for the constructs of firm performance and firm innovation capability, for better generalization of the results. Second, we studied team and firm level constructs in this research. We suggest that future research should include individual level construct(s) along with group/team and firm level construct(s) to provide a much broader picture. Third, we examined the conceptual research model on SMEs in the UAE context. Therefore, future research should extend our research framework outside the UAE to contribute to theory development.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Hypothesis 5 (</head><label>5</label><figDesc>H5): TMT-shared leadership influences firm performance.</figDesc></figure>
