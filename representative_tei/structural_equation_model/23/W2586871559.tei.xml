<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The health benefits of physical activity are well established as physical activity is associated with protection from lifestyle diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> . Additionally, physically active children are protected of developing cardiovascular risk factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . Furthermore, reviews noted evidence for associations between several psychological and social-emotional health benefits of physical activity including mental wellbeing, higher self-esteem and social skills, self-efficacy, perceived competence, goal orientation, motivation and sports participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</p><p>There also is strong cross-sectional evidence noting the positive association between physical activity and motor competence in children and adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . However, only a few longitudinal studies with these variables have been conducted <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> . Barnett, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> followed 276 Australian children during five years and observed that object control proficiency in childhood was positively associated with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) time during adolescence. In addition, children with good object control proficiency were more likely to participate in at least some vigorous physical activity during adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . Lopes, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> observed a decrease in physical activity level in Portuguese children followed between six and 10 years of age. Importantly, children with high motor competence at six years of age exhibited lower decrease in physical activity levels at the age of 10, compared to children with low and average motor competence levels at six years of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</p><p>Understanding how physical activity and motor competence influence each other across childhood and adolescence is not well established, as researchers generally attempt to establish a unidirectional pathway with one variable causally determining the outcome of the other. However, Stodden, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> published a theoretical framework where the direction of causation is hypothesized to change from early to middle childhood. In early childhood, physical activity is suggested to promote motor competence via a variety of exploratory as well as context-specific (i.e., structured activities, games and sports) movement experiences. As a child ages, the relationship is hypothesized to become more reciprocal and is driven by the development of a child's ability to perceive and understand that they are competent in various movement contexts, which promotes success and enjoyment in a variety of activities. Thus, higher levels of motor competence foster more physical activity and, reciprocally, more physical activity fosters greater motor competence, which creates a positive spiral of engagement in physical activity across childhood and into adolescence.</p><p>Few studies evaluated the theorized reciprocal relationship of physical activity and motor competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . Independent investigations have shown the reciprocal relationship between object control <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and locomotor control <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> with physical activity. Barnett, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , in a cross-sectional study, observed a positive feedback association between object control and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in 215 Australian adolescents. Additionally, perceived sports competence mediated the association in both directions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> . Larsen, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> monitored 768 children during three years and observed a reciprocal relationship between shuttle run test which is a measure of agility, speed and cardiorespiratory capacity, and physical activity.</p><p>Fitness is hypothesized to mediate the reciprocal association between physical activity and motor competence as demonstrating higher fitness allows an individual to sustain physical activity for longer periods of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . Concomitantly, increased physical activity and increased motor competence likely function to assist in the development of cardiorespiratory fitness as physical activity and motor competence demonstrate consistent positive associations with fitness across childhood. Finally, the strength of associations between these three health-related variables is hypothesized to increase across childhood and into adolescence as their synergistic and reciprocal interactions will be mutually beneficial, or mutually detrimental (i.e., negative trajectory of physical activity, motor competence and fitness) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . Unfortunately, few studies have evaluated this possible mediation component of physical fitness in the physical activity-motor competence relationship. Khodaverdi, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> observed that cardiorespiratory fitness mediated the relationship between motor competence and physical activity as hypothesized by the Stodden, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> theoretical framework. However, the authors only evaluated the association of motor competence with physical activity, not vice and versa. In summary, there is evidence of the reciprocal relationship between physical activity and motor competence and the mediation role of physical fitness in this relationship; however, this evidence has not been summarized in a long-term longitudinal study.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, no longitudinal study has tested the possible reciprocal association of objectively measured physical activity and motor competence, and whether cardiorespiratory fitness mediates the relationship in both directions. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate, in both directions, the longitudinal relationship (seven-year follow-up) between motor competence and physical activity. The secondary aim of this study was to analyze the possible mediating effect of cardiorespiratory fitness in this relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>This study was based on longitudinal analysis of data from the Copenhagen School Child Intervention Study, a quasi-experimental study which began in 2001. Because the complete methodology has been previously published <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> , the methodology here presents only those variables of interest. Children were recruited from preschools in two communities in the area of Copenhagen (46 preschool classes in 18 schools). Informed consent was obtained from the parents/guardians of 706 children (69% of the population), and 696 actually participated in the study at baseline (409 children attending intervention schools and 287 enrolled in the control schools). Following the intervention, which lasted three years, 613 children were retested at nine years of age and 441 children followed up again in 2008 at 13 years, seven years after the beginning of the study. The study was approved by the ethical committee, University of Copenhagen.</p><p>Pubertal status was assessed by self-report of sexual maturation using a scale of pictures of breast development for girls and genital development for boys. Numbers were rated 1-5, according to Tanner's criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using a continuous running protocol on a treadmill until exhaustion. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured directly on an AMIS 2001 Cardiopulmonary Function Test System (Innovision, Odense, Denmark) at ages six and nine years, and using a COSMED K4b 2 portable metabolic system (COSMED, Rome, Italy) at 13 years. Both systems provide valid measures of cardiorespiratory fitness when validated against the Douglas bag method <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . Cardiorespiratory fitness was standardized for all statistical analyses. Biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac skinfolds were measured on the self-reported non-dominant side of the body by the same two skilled researchers with a Harpenden skinfold caliper (Harpender, West Sussex, UK), and the body fatness was computed as the sum of the four skinfolds in millimeters (mm).</p><p>Motor competence was assessed using the "Körperkoordinationstest für Kinder" (KTK), which is a standardized normative German test battery <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . The KTK has high test-retest reliability (0.90 to 0.97) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . The KTK consists of four independent tests: (1) walking backwards on balance beams of decreasing width: 6.0, 4.5, and 3.0 cm, (2) moving sideways on wooden boards for 20s, (3) one-legged hopping over a foam obstacle with increasing height in consecutive steps of 5cm and (4) two-legged jumping from side to side for 15s. The KTK battery has been used in numerous studies to evaluate motor competence levels in normally developing children and adolescents up to 15 years-of-age <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> .</p><p>The raw performance score on each item was summed and standardized in z-scores.</p><p>Physical activity was measured using Actigraph 7164 accelerometers (ActiGraph LLC, Pensacola, FL) in epochs of 10 seconds. All devices were calibrated in a motor driven vertical acceleration machine before use. Due to reactivity, the first day the participants wore the device was excluded from the analysis. The participants wore an elastic belt with the accelerometer on the right side of the waist close to the center of gravity. The device was only supposed to be removed while sleeping and during activities involving water. Periods with 30 or more minutes with consecutives zeros counts were considered as non-wear periods. A valid day had to have at least 10 valid hours of monitoring. Children with four or more valid days were included in the analysis. At baseline, 322 children presented four or more valid days whereas, 298 children were monitored four or more days at nine years of age and 300 children exhibited four or more valid days at 13 years of age. Therefore, 398 children were excluded from the analyses due to lack of valid physical activity data. To calculate the minutes spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and vigorous physical activity (VPA) we used Evenson's cut-points <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> because of its valid estimation for the age range of the participants in the present study <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . For analysis purposes, MVPA and VPA were standardized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>In all analyses, we used STATA version 14.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). We based our analysis on the theoretical framework first proposed by Stodden, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , which hypothesized reciprocal associations between physical activity and motor competence that is mediated by current cardiorespiratory fitness levels. Therefore, structured equation modeling was performed to test the reciprocal longitudinal relationship between physical activity (MVPA and VPA) and motor competence, and; additionally, if the longitudinal association between physical activity and motor competence was mediated by cardiorespiratory fitness (VO 2peak ). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Almost all of the children were born in Denmark (98.1%). At baseline, the annual family income (parents combined) was lower than 200,000 Danish Kroner (DKK) (approximately 30,000 U.S. Dollars) in 5.6% of the families in our study (14.5% between 200,000-400,000 DKK; 44.5% between 400,000-600,000 DKK; 35.5% more than 600,000 DKK). Less than 1% of the children's mothers had less than 7 years of education (0.5%: 7-8 years of education; 98.7%: 9+ years of education). There were no statistical differences in age or other demographic characteristics between those children with complete or incomplete data <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> . Boys spent more time in MVPA and VPA, and exhibited higher VO 2peak than girls at any age. On the other hand, girls presented higher body fatness than boys at six, nine and 13 years of age (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physical activity longitudinally associated with motor competence</head><p>During the seven-year follow-up, VPA presented direct association with the development of motor competence (β VPA =0.095; 95% CI: 0.021:0.169 -Black coefficients). Nevertheless, MVPA only presented association with motor competence via fitness mediation. No direct association between MVPA and motor competence was observed. Moreover, MVPA and VPA exhibited indirect association with motor competence via fitness mediation (β MVPA =0.071; 95% CI: 0.040:0.101; β VPA =0.087; 95% CI: 0.055:0.117 -Green coefficients). Finally, MVPA and VPA presented similar total association with motor competence (β MVPA =0.139; 95% CI: 0.062:0.217; β VPA =0.181; 95% CI: 0.104:0.257 -Red coefficients) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motor competence longitudinally associated with physical activity</head><p>Motor competence was longitudinally associated with both MVPA and VPA during childhood until early adolescence. In particular, motor competence was directly associated with VPA (β VPA =0.084; 95% CI: 0.018:0.149 -Black coefficients). The direct association between motor competence and MVPA was not significant (β MVPA =0.061; 95% CI: -0.005:0.126 -Black coefficients).</p><p>Additionally, fitness mediated the association between motor competence and physical activity (β MVPA =0.049; 95% CI: 0.023:0.075; β VPA =0.061; 95% CI: 0.034:0.087 -Green coefficients). Finally, the total association between motor competence and MVPA and VPA were analogous (β MVPA =0.111; 95% CI: 0.049:0.171; β VPA =0.144; 95% CI: 0.083:0.206 -Red coefficients) (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Results of this study indicated a reciprocal longitudinal relationship occurred between physical activity and motor competence across seven years. In summary, for each additional standard deviation (SD) in MVPA or VPA, motor competence increased by 0.139 SD and 0.181 SD during the seven-year follow-up, respectively. On the other hand, a standard deviation increment in motor competence would increase MVPA and VPA time by 0.111 SD and 0.144 SD, respectively. Additionally, cardiorespiratory fitness mediated the relationship in both directions. Both results have been predicted</p><p>by the heuristic model proposed by Stodden, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . Monitoring 768 children during three years, Larsen, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> observed a reciprocal relationship between physical activity and the shuttle run test which measures cardiorespiratory fitness, agility and speed. In particular, children who improved their time in the shuttle run test by one standard deviation increased their time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in 42 minutes a week. The authors also analyzed the influence of time in moderate-tovigorous physical activity on the shuttle run test. According to their results, children with more time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity had better performance in the shuttle run test <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</p><p>Similarly, Barnett, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> also observed a reciprocal relationship between physical activity and motor competence in a cross-sectional investigation. However, Barnett, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> observed a reciprocal positive relationship between object control and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and only a one-way relationship from moderate-to-vigorous physical activity to locomotor control which contradicts the findings observed in the present study and the investigation conducted by Larsen, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</p><p>The KTK battery used in the current study and the shuttle run test used at Larsen, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> investigation are primarily locomotor measures of motor performance. The different results observed in both investigations and Barnett, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> can be due to the self-reported measure of physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , different batteries to assess motor competence and the study design, cross-sectional <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> . In addition, Barnett, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> monitored adolescents (mean age of 16 years) whereas the current study and Larsen, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> evaluated children until early adolescence. Nevertheless, there are some contradictory results, the reciprocal influence between physical activity and motor competence seems real from the results presented in both longitudinal investigations.</p><p>It seems clear that physical activity and motor competence interact synergistically during childhood. Possibly, children who are more physically active have more opportunities to better develop their motor competence skills. Concomitantly, motor competent children experience greater success and enjoyment during many developmentally appropriate activities (e.g., sports and games) and are more likely to continue to participate and further develop their motor competence and be more physically active <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . According to our results, cardiorespiratory fitness was impacted by both physical activity and motor competence and consequently mediated the relationship between physical activity and motor competence in both directions. Khodaverdi, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> also observed cardiorespiratory fitness mediating the associations between locomotor skill competence and physical activity; however, the authors only analyzed locomotor skill competence influencing physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . Moreover, the reciprocal association between MVPA and motor competence was only via physical fitness mediation, highlighting the importance of higher physical activity intensity and the role of physical fitness during childhood development. Physical fitness is a key element in the theoretical framework proposed by Stodden, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . The authors believed that the acquisition of motor competence in the preschool age would serve to promote physical fitness by also promoting physical activity and neuromotor development. In addition, children with good levels of motor competence during middle childhood would present higher physical activity level and physical fitness. From the middle to late childhood, fit children would be more likely to continue physically active for longer periods, increasing their physical activity and motor competence levels. Children with low physical fitness level would be less physically active because of their lower ability to persist in activities which require higher levels of physical fitness and consequently have compromised physical activity and motor competence development <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</p><p>It should also be noted that this is the first longitudinal study to test the theoretical framework first proposed by Stodden, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> which intended to describe how physical activity and motor competence are associated across childhood and adolescence. Importantly, we were able to follow children for seven years during their childhood until early adolscence, which represents a period where the foundation of physical activity behaviors are formed and tend to track until adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</p><p>Additionally, the analyses were controlled for pubertal status which is a pivotal element on children's development. In summary, physical activity and motor competence exhibited reciprocal longitudinal relationship throughout childhood and early adolescence, and; additionally, physical fitness mediated their relationship in both directions. Both results were correctly predicted by the Stodden, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> model. However, future investigations can investigate additional components of the Stodden, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> model: 1) whether the strength of the association between physical activity and motor competence changes during childhood and adolescence; 2) whether other aspects of health-related fitness (strength, flexibility, speed, agility), or perceived motor competence can mediate the relationship between physical activity and motor competence, and; 3) whether the synergic relationship among physical activity, motor competence and health-related fitness are longitudinally associated with the risk of obesity in children and adolescents.</p><p>Our study has limitations to be considered in the interpretation of the results. While accelerometry is considered the gold standard measure for physical activity in epidemiological studies, physical activity presents a relatively high measurement error which could have influenced the strength of association between physical activity and motor competence. In addition, the current study only tested the participants' locomotor competence, thus other aspects related to motor competence, i.e. control movement skills could have been monitored and included in the analyses. The two first measurements of VO 2peak were performed in a camper where we had stationary analyzers. These are more stable and give less error variation in the measurements. In the last test round we used a portable system, because we did not have access to the original analyzers. In all tests we used direct measurement of VO 2peak during a progressive treadmill test, which is the highest quality of cardiorespiratory fitness assessment seen in any school based study. Importantly, both systems exhibited valid measures of cardiorespiratory fitness when validated against the Douglas bag method <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . No other epidemiological study reached this quality of assessment and we therefore believe the change in analyzers did not impact the results. This is a longitudinal study that was part of an intervention project which aimed to increased the ammount of physical activity in the intervention schools; however, compared to participants in the control arm of the original intervention study, the intervention demonstrated no significant impact on physical activity, motor competence or cardiorespiratory fitness <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> and the longitudinal results presented in this study were adjusted for the intervention factor. Unfortunately, we only have three time points of monitoring, which makes it less clear how the longitudinal associations developed than if we had more time points.</p><p>Practitioners should stimulate activities related to whole body movements that influence the success of engagement in sports which is one of the major ways of being physically active.</p><p>Complementarily, more physically active children will probably engage more in whole body movement activities and consequently improve their locomotor skills by practice.</p><p>In conclusion, physical activity and motor competence were positivily reciprocally related across childhood until early adolescence and cardiorespiratory fitness mediated the association in both directions. Interventions with the goal of increasing physical activity in children and adolescents should also address the development of motor competence skills in order to optimize the results because of the clear positive feedback loop between physical activity and motor competence.     </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 presents the pathways examined in the analysis.
