<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Taking a Bourdieusian perspective, we analyze the relevance of social background and capital for choosing English as a medium of instruction (EMI). Our work focuses on students with a non-native English-language background in a business school setting. Although proponents argue that EMI generally increases graduates' employability, they do not sufficiently consider that study strategies differ substantially across social milieus and between the sexes. Failing to account for cultural distance of students to the educational system in choosing EMI can foster social inequality and contribute to the reproduction of elites. Using a survey, we conduct a quasi-experiment in two identical bachelor's degree programs that differ only in their instruction language. Using structural equation modeling, we find that students from higher social strata are much more likely to choose EMI. As suggested by the Bourdieusian perspective, this relationship is not directly observable but operates through hidden mechanisms, such as cultural capital (relative English proficiency) and a better sense of gaming and positioning (career orientation). Business students from the lowest stratum self-select against EMI due to a pronounced fear of failure despite their awareness that EMI leads to higher employability. Our findings support the successful introduction of EMI while ensuring social equality.</head></div>

Also, superiors attribute more weight to degrees than to professional achievements when evaluating an employee with an elite education <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Festing &amp; Barzantny, 2008)</ref>. Even within the highest echelon of management, elite education is associated with stratification: <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Useem and Karabel (1986)</ref> demonstrate that the odds of being a CEO in the United States were much higher for senior managers with bachelor's degrees from elite universities and upper-class backgrounds (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Ott, 2011)</ref>. As another example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">McDonald and Westphal (2011)</ref> show that CEOs who perceive themselves among the CEO elite are much more supportive of their elite peers (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Westphal &amp; Khanna, 2003)</ref>. According to upper echelon theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Finkelstein &amp; Hambrick, 1996)</ref>, these individual's choices can exert substantial effects on organizational outcomes or even economic structures. As an example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Burkert and Lueg (2013)</ref> show that top managers' preferences for shareholderoriented governance relate to their educational backgrounds. The authors argue that such preferences are not just an outcome of business school educations but reflect the managers' selfselection into certain educational programs.</p><p>We are specifically interested in the EMI-related implications for elite management education. Recent research on the transformation of cultural capital and the reproduction of class patterns shows that an international orientation contrasts with the "provincial" orientation <ref type="bibr">(Prieur &amp; Savage, 2011: 576</ref>). Yet, the link from social background to language choice has not been discussed in this respect. Higher education (HE) institutions are crucial settings for social positioning, where the students' strategies influence success and failure. Because selection processes in HE often occur to the disadvantage of the culturally underprivileged, we specifically investigate the social backgrounds of students who decide for or against EMI. Failure to account for different social backgrounds and diver-sity among students can foster social inequality and the reproduction of elites <ref type="bibr">(Finkelstein &amp; Hambrick, 1996: 104;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Vaara &amp; Faÿ, 2012)</ref>. To address this gap-while accounting for alternative explanations of language choice-we pose the rather broad research question: "Why do non-native English language speaking students choose EMI in a non-English-speaking setting?" Thereby, we respond to calls for research on the internationalization of management education and its effects on the reproduction of elites <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Doh, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Vaara &amp; Faÿ, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>We approach this question using a quasiexperiment at Aarhus University (AU), Denmark, for which we employ a questionnaire that we evaluate with partial least squares (PLS). Aarhus University's bachelor of science in economics and business administration program offers students two identical options that differ only in their medium of instruction (English or Danish). Our findings suggest that students see EMI as a means of distinction. Hence, high social background indirectly fosters the choice of EMI through habitus and cultural capital. The fear of academic failure of lower-strata students decreases their probability of choosing EMI. Moreover, the reasons for choosing EMI differ across social strata. Students from higher strata make a less peer-dependent and a more cultural-capital related choice for EMI. In addition, the EMI choice of students from the lowest stratum is not driven by personal motives of employability, but by peer pressure (females) and peer and family pressure (males).</p><p>These findings have several implications. Although EMI is important for the future of higher education, its "unmindful" implementation may induce an unbalanced allocation of additional cultural capital among students. Policy makers can counteract these dysfunctional effects by accounting for gendered study strategies, and by demonstrating to the individual student that EMI does not pose insurmountable barriers to successful learning but offers opportunities. Simply stressing the general career relevance of the English language or raising absolute English proficiency among students, however, are not sufficient to convince lower-strata students to choose EMI.</p><p>In the following section, we introduce theoretical concepts by Pierre Bourdieu as the basis for our hypotheses development. We then explain our research design, and present its results, followed by a discussion of implications, limitations, future research, and a conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Boon and Bane of English in International Management Education</head><p>Both the rapid diffusion of EMI and internationalized education are controversial <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Harder, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Jeong, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Kang, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Park, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Seth, 2002)</ref>. For instance, politicians have proposed to protect local languages and culture against English as a European lingua franca (e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Denmark: Kulturministeriet, 2003)</ref>. Related research-specifically from CME-has investigated various aspects of internationalized management education <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Doh, 2010)</ref>, such as the diffusion of Anglo-American concepts and values <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Engwall, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Krishnan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Sturdy &amp; Gabriel, 2000)</ref>; the global institutionalization of management education <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Goodrick, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Spender, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Zald, 2002)</ref>; or the reproduction of elites through specialized programs and institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">(Useem &amp; Karabel, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Vaara &amp; Faÿ, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Harder (2009: 8)</ref> identifies two central themes in the EMI debate: the possibility of "domain loss" of the domestic language and danger of segregation between an English-oriented elite and a locally oriented majority. This latter "man in the street" is often represented by right-wing political parties, which attempt to ban the English language from national universities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Folkeparti, 2009)</ref>. But this resistance against Anglo-American influences has not stopped the general political tendency to support further internationalization, as evidenced, for example, by the steadily advancing Bologna Process in Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Powell &amp; Solga, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bourdieusian Theory and Language</head><p>In this article, we aim to understand the choice of EMI in management education from a Bourdieusian perspective. Bourdieu proposes that the academic success or failure of children from different social strata is not just a result of effort or natural aptitude, but is mainly dependent on their cultural distance from the educational institutions <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1997: 47;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bourdieu, Passeron, &amp; Saint Martin, 1994a: 35-36)</ref>.</p><p>The three key concepts within Bourdieu's theory of social reproduction are social class, capital, and habitus. Class constitutes the primary determinant of an agent's social and professional development <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1977: 89)</ref>. Agents from different classes have varying relationships to practices in HE, and the offspring of the dominant, higher classes are favorably positioned to meet the re-quirements of the educational system <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1977: 200)</ref>.</p><p>This interplay of the educational system and the abilities of agents to perform within that system is predicated on <ref type="bibr">Bourdieu's (1997: 46)</ref> general definition of capital. An agent's capital [I]s a force inscribed in the objectivity of things so that everything is not equally possible or impossible. And the structure of the distribution of the different types and subtypes of capital at a given moment in time represents the immanent structure of the social world [. . .], determining the chances of success for practices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Bourdieu (1997)</ref> distinguishes among four types of capital: Economic capital comprises physical assets that can be converted into cash; social capital includes the possession of a durable network or a social group membership; and-most important with regard to higher education and language-cultural capital. Cultural capital is classified into three types: The embodied form is unconsciously bequeathed within the family and covers competences and knowledge. It is "the best hidden and socially most determinant educational investment" <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1997: 48)</ref> because it is "recognized as legitimate competence" <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1977b: 49)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Bourdieu and Passeron (1977: 74)</ref> specifically use the term "linguistic capital" as a complement of embodied cultural capital. Because an academic language is "unequally distant from the language actually spoken by the different social classes" <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1994: 8)</ref>, academic success is determined by linguistic inheritance <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1977: 73;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bourdieu, Passeron, &amp; Saint Martin, 1994b: 37)</ref>. Cultural capital furthermore exists in the objectified form, that is, in books or instruments and in the institutionalized form, that is, as credentials from authorized institutions <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1997: 47)</ref>. A fourth type of capital is symbolic capital. Symbolic capital consists of other types of capital that are recognized as legitimate. It grants its agent credibility and distinction <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 2005: 195)</ref>.</p><p>The product of social class and the provision of capital types is the habitus, a complex system of "perceptions, appreciations, and actions" based on experiences <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1971: 83)</ref>. Habitus is a "sense of limits" as well as a "sense of one's place" <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1984: 471</ref>) that determines whether an agent feels comfortable with the rules and sym-bolic values of a field. An unsuitable habitus may lead to socially disadvantageous decisions such as self-exclusion from an educational field; therefore, there is a strong relationship among the unequal possession of cultural capital, habitus, and education and career choices.</p><p>We conjecture that family background has an indirect effect on the choice of EMI. At the same time, we postulate that EMI functions as distinguishing symbolic capital <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1991: 55)</ref> in contemporary Denmark. We do so because the government and the examined university accredit EMI as a legitimate form of cultural capital in the global labor market.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> Thereby, cultural and symbolic capital "become the condition for legitimate access to a growing number of positions" <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1977b: 55)</ref>. Therefore, the certified capability to master the "legitimate language" <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1991: 45)</ref> of the field facilitates accumulation of capital and social positioning.</p><p>There are several examples of the value of the English language in management <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Maclean, Harvey, &amp; Chia, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Ott, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Engwall (2004)</ref> documents how, since the 1950s, the Anglo-Americanization of Scandinavian business schools has not just led to a change in language but also to a general shift from a German tradition toward an American focus on finance and microeconomics <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Engwall, 2004)</ref>. This transformation has created an Anglo-American "management grammar" that elite graduates use <ref type="bibr">(Vaara &amp; Faÿ, 2011: 7;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Weißenberger &amp; Angelkort, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>As <ref type="bibr">Prieur and Savage (2011: 575)</ref> note, one difference between the culturally privileged and nonprivileged in Denmark is a difference in "international vs local or national orientation." Thus, we find it reasonable to assume that an EMI education functions as an important signifier for such a stratifying international orientation. Language-especially in its institutionalized and symbolic capital forms-becomes a vehicle for the creation of social and economic capital. Therefore, a social strata division between those who opt for and those who refrain from EMI may be considered a step toward the reproduction of uneven sociocultural privileges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Connection to Alternative Theories</head><p>Alternatives to Bourdieusian theory to explain decision making include the concept of self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Schwarzer &amp; Jerusalem, 1995)</ref>, and the theory of planned behavior (TPB; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ajzen, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ajzen &amp; Madden, 1986)</ref>. Because both approaches focus on agency, they exhibit some axiomatic conflicts with the Bourdieusian approach <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 2003b</ref><ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, , 2005: 215-216, 220): 215-216, 220)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Efficacy and the Theory of Planned Behavior</head><p>Perceived self-efficacy is a concept within <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bandura's (1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bandura's ( , 2001) )</ref> social cognitive theory, meaning the belief in one's ability to produce a desired effect <ref type="bibr">(Scholz, Doña, Sud, &amp; Schwarzer, 2002: 242)</ref>. Agents tend to seek environments where success is likely <ref type="bibr">(Bandura, 1993: 135)</ref>. This results in committing to more challenging tasks <ref type="bibr">(Scholz et al., 2002: 242)</ref> and-given the relevant skills-higher achievements. This will determine positioning in a certain environment and henceforward agents' behavior will be-consistent with the Bourdieusian interpretation-"partly the product of their environment" <ref type="bibr">(Bandura, 1993: 135)</ref>. Going beyond specific situations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Schwarzer and Jerusalem (1995)</ref> introduced a scale for measuring general selfefficacy (GSE), a "global confidence in one's coping ability" <ref type="bibr">(Luszczynska, Gutiérez-Doña, &amp; Schwarzer, 2005: 81)</ref>.</p><p>The theory of planned behavior (TPB) claims that agents use their experience to estimate their perceived behavioral control (PBC), that is, how challenging a certain behavior is to them <ref type="bibr">(Ajzen, 1991: 196)</ref>. Additional elements of TPB are behavioral beliefs that estimate how effective the behavior will be and influence attitudes toward the behavior. Normative beliefs are assumptions about how important others consider the behavior and form subjective norms on the basis of perceived social pressure <ref type="bibr">(Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 2005: 194)</ref>. Given the similarity of PBC and self-efficacy, <ref type="bibr">Kraft, Rise, Sutton, and Røysamb (2005: 493)</ref> suggest reconceptualizing PBC as "two separate but interrelated constructs, namely self-efficacy and controllability."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differentiating the Bourdieusian Approach From TPB and Self-Efficacy</head><p>Three characteristics distinguish the Bourdieusian approach from TPB and self-efficacy: (1) the role of social structures, (2) the role of power structures and cultural meanings, and (3) the process of decision making.</p><p>For social structures <ref type="bibr">Bourdieu's (1989: 14</ref>) agency-integrating "constructivist structuralism" centers on the class-specific habitus. The concept of habitus was initially constructed to integrate subjectivism and objectivism <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1990a: 10)</ref>. There are some parallel elements of normative beliefs and subjective norms (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Schultz, Nolan, Cialdini, Goldstein, &amp; Griskevicius, 2007)</ref> and social capital, but these differ in their reflection of agency and structure. From a Bourdieusian perspective, beliefs and norms correspond, are "doxical" <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1998: 81)</ref> with the environment. Agents assemble in "elective affinities" <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1984: 238)</ref>. Thus, the Bourdieusian perspective assumes concordance between social capital and habitus.</p><p>The Bourdieusian perspective elaborates the concepts of power and the cultural meaning of behavior more fully than TPB or self-efficacy. Selfefficacy does not explain how it emerges and differs in social contexts <ref type="bibr">(Burke et al., 2009b)</ref>. On the contrary, the Bourdieusian perspective sees "cultural accessibility and capital" (a power dimension) as an antecedent of self-efficacy <ref type="bibr">(Bandura, 1993: 142)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, the consciousness and controllability aspects of decision making are conceptualized differently. In the Bourdieusian conception, a rather unconscious "feel for the game" <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1990a: 9)</ref> will lead to success, while the culturally distanced might be led by misbelief <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1984: 321)</ref>. Agents can still make decisions in Bourdieusian theory. But, eventually, any self-efficacy will be predirected to habitus-corresponding fields (doxa). Recent research tries to align selfefficacy and social context <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Boardman &amp; Robert, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Burke et al., 2009b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Kiilo &amp; Kutsar, 2012)</ref>, expressing the hope that if it can be demonstrated that self-efficacy is dependent, to some degree, on the location of an individual in the broader macrosocial order, then self-efficacy may provide a conceptual bridge between structure and agency <ref type="bibr">(Boardman &amp; Robert, 2000, 119)</ref>.</p><p>In summary, <ref type="bibr">Bourdieu (1977b</ref><ref type="bibr">Bourdieu ( , 1990a) )</ref> addresses this integration problem effectively on a theoretical level with the concept of habitus. Yet, a main challenge for its empirical applicability is the lack of constructs at the agent level. Thus, integrating self-efficacy into the application of Bourdieusian theory (e.g., feel for the game, doxa, etc.) will be productive when agents are confronted with an either-or choice <ref type="bibr">(Boardman &amp; Robert, 2000: 119)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT: SOCIAL STRATA AND EMI</head><p>We derive hypotheses relating to social background, cultural capital, and habitus. We specifically investigate the expected need for and the expected advantage of English proficiency on the labor market, absolute English proficiency, and the barriers to choosing EMI (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). <ref type="bibr">Bourdieu (1984: 471)</ref> suggests that the offspring of the established strata have a "sense of one's place," which allows them to identify distinct positions in society and to equip themselves with the required qualifications. Competing agents from lower strata have less valuable predispositions that limit the scope of their actions to achieve such positions. Their exclusion is mainly accomplished through the higher-strata agents' shared habitus and common agreement on the underlying structures, principles, and boundaries of the field (doxa).</p><p>The codes and meanings of the fields of interest-in this case both the field of education and the economic field-are primarily cognizable for agents with matching predispositions, that is, cultural capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bourdieu, 1998)</ref>. Therefore, we expect mediating effects between background and EMI through habitus, cultural capital, and habitus-field correspondence. Still, a possible direct relationship between social origin and EMI has to be tested. Therefore, we propose: Hypothesis 1a: The higher the social background, the more likely the choice of EMI. In addition to its symbolic value, there is strong evidence that English proficiency has become a necessity for conducting transnational business in Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Vaara, Tienari, Piekkari, &amp; Säntti, 2005)</ref>. Business transactions in the EU are carried out primarily in English <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Ginsburgh &amp; Weber, 2011)</ref>, and managers are expected to be proficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Louhiala-Salminen, Charles, &amp; Kankaanranta, 2005)</ref>. In Denmark, due to its relatively small domestic market, even small companies are highly internationalized <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Firth, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Knight, Madsen, &amp; Servais, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Moen &amp; Servais, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Pedersen, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Servais &amp; Jensen, 2001)</ref>. We assert that the strata-dependent abilities of students to recognize these structural requirements and trends in the economic field lead to diverging response strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Bourdieu, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1977: 184)</ref>. To expect that students from higher strata are more likely to, first, detect the importance of English proficiency in the job market, and second, to realize that choosing EMI and acquiring the institutionalized cultural capital of English proficiency is an advantageous strategy for their individual employment is plausible. Thus, we propose Hypotheses 1b, 1c: Hypothesis 1b: The higher the social background, the higher the expectation of English as the working language. Hypothesis 1c: The higher the social background, the greater the expected employment advantage from EMI. A large number of studies have investigated the determinants of successful foreign language learning) from elementary school through higher education. Consistent predictors of success in a foreign language are high social background and the sophisticated use of one's mother tongue (for an extended literature review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Pishghadam, Noghani, &amp; Zabihi, 2011)</ref>. Conversely, the feeling of impotence negatively affects lower-strata students' success in a second language <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Schumann, 1978)</ref>.

We therefore propose Hypothesis H1d: Hypothesis 1d: The higher the social background, the higher the perceived English proficiency. One of the main institutional arguments for adopting EMI refers to increased job opportunities for graduates. Still, the empirical evidence on the link between the students' expectations of an internationalized labor market and their study behavior-the choice of EMI-is scarce <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Tung, Lam, &amp; Tsang, 1997)</ref>.

On the other hand, the TPB model suggests that having an attitude toward a general issue and acting upon it are two different things <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ajzen, 1991)</ref>. TPB emphasizes that self-efficacy (parallel to attitudes and norms) directly impacts behavior. Self-efficacy can be seen as an indicator of habitual mechanisms. Bourdieusian theory objects to the assumption that there is a continuity from the realization of the general importance of EMI to its specific importance for one's employability, and then for the choice for EMI. Even if all agents are aware of the demand for and the advantages of EMI, not all will act upon it. This is due to sociocultural barriers, such as the hysteresis effect, that is, "the foundation of the structural lag between opportunities and the dispositions to grasp them" <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1977b: 83)</ref>. These two links cannot be assumed but must be tested. We propose two hypotheses: Hypothesis 2a: The expectation of English as working language positively impacts the choice of EMI. Hypothesis 2b: The expectation of English as working language positively impacts the expected employment advantages. Evidence from Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Adshead &amp; Jamieson, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Felix, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Lauer, 2002)</ref> and the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Wilson, Wolfe, &amp; Haveman, 2005)</ref> suggests that career-related considerations outweigh personal motives, for example, the student's genuine interest in a subject. With respect to EMI, several non-European studies document that job advantages are a main reason for choosing EMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Byun et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Diab, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Tung et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Yang &amp; Lau, 2003)</ref>. However, evidence from Europe is scant (for the exception, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Gardner, 1985)</ref>.

It is probable that they attempt to acquire more valuable institutionalized cultural capital, which can take the form of a degree from an EMI program. Hence, we propose: Hypothesis 3: The greater the expected employment advantages of English, the more likely the choice of EMI.</p><p>English proficiency is a source of self-esteem for students and young graduates <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Andrade, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ball &amp; Chik, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Tsai,Ying &amp; Lee, 2001</ref>). An agent's self-esteem is rooted in possessing the characteristics that a society considers desirable, meaning cultural capital in its legitimized form <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Bourdieu, 2005)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr">Prieur and Savage (2011: 567)</ref> demonstrate, an "international orientation" is associated with cultural privileges, with a higher level of education and with common recognition.</p><p>English proficiency can function as symbolic capital and as a sign of distinction within the frame of international orientation. Students who already rate their English proficiency highly will employ a relatively risk-free but high-yielding strategy of "succession" <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1975: 30)</ref>. They try to convert their embodied form of cultural capital (English proficiency) into a legitimized form (a degree with EMI). So, they transfer their relatively high cultural and symbolic capital in the field of education into the economic field. We therefore propose: Hypothesis 4a: The higher the level of English proficiency, the more likely the choice of EMI. Despite all the potential benefits, there are some barriers to choosing EMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Hu, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Hu &amp; Alsagoff, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Kang, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Park, 2009)</ref>.

This implies that students' comprehension, participation, and exam performance could be negatively affected by EMI. Students are intrinsically motivated to strive for embodied cultural capital (H4a, English proficiency). Yet, students are also extrinsically motivated to strive for rewarding institutionalized cultural capital, manifested in high grades and their final diplomas <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1979b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Elliot &amp; Knight, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sullivan, 2009a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sullivan, 2009b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Vallerand, Pelletier, Blais, Briere, Senecal, &amp; Vallieres, 1992)</ref>.

Therefore, students will try to overcome barriers to EMI. The gap in understanding between content taught in English and Danish should narrow (relative English proficiency increases) as the absolute English proficiency increases. Hence, we propose:</p><p>Hypothesis 4b: The higher the level of English proficiency, the lower the barriers to choosing EMI. Absolute English proficiency is just a part of relative English proficiency because students' initial assessments of their personal gaps matter. A number of studies show that insecurity and perceived obstacles lead to higher drop-out rates or ex-ante avoidance of programs that are associated with obstacles <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Araque, Roldán, &amp; Salguero, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Belloc, Maruotti, &amp; Petrella, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bennett, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Lassibille &amp; Navarro Gómez, 2008)</ref>. From a Bourdieusian perspective, this behavior reveals a strategy. <ref type="bibr">Swartz (1997: 100)</ref> argues that each agent intends to use her time in a profit-oriented manner, with actions deriving "from sets of dispositions that internalize in practical form what seems appropriate or possible in situations of challenge."

Students who do not choose EMI protect themselves from being eliminated by the academic selection process (exams) after they have already invested their time <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1977: 153)</ref>. By choosing the Danish medium of instruction (DMI), they also protect themselves against a negative impact on their institutionalized cultural capital, that is, against lower grades <ref type="bibr">(Christensen, 2009: 58)</ref>. We propose: Hypothesis 5: The higher the expectation of barriers (inferior use of time, lower grades), the less likely the choice of EMI.</p></div>

The total number of enrolled Danish and international students increased by 272% from 345 in 1997 (45 chose EMI, i.e., 13%) to 937 in 2011 (174 choose EMI, i.e., 19%).

Educational Testing Service <ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref> shows that Danish test takers rank second among 165 countries in the Test of English as a Foreign Language with an average of 99 out of 120 points.

Of the remaining 676 students, we eliminated 60 non-Danish students because they could not choose DMI in the first place. Our final sample consisted of 616 Danish students who had chosen either DMI or EMI (an 87.3% response rate). The mean student age was 21.0 years (SD ϭ 2.034) and 15.4% had chosen EMI (SD ϭ 0.361).

The second group was composed of thirdsemester BSc students, and the third group consisted of lecturers from the BSc program. In the first meeting, the pretesters commented on the overall questionnaire. These comments helped us to refine the preliminary constructs and to eliminate indicators.

H1b and H1d predict that a student's social background has a positive relationship with the expectation of English as the working language and with English proficiency, respectively. The coefficients are positive and statistically significant (␤ ϭ 0.142/0.143; p Ͻ .001/.001). Thus, we find support for H1b and H1d.</p><p>We propose that students who expect that English will be (partly) their working language (JOBNEED) will choose EMI (H2a) and see an advantage for their future career from choosing EMI (H2b). The results from our model do not support a direct link between JOBNEED and EMI (␤ ϭ 0.016; p Ͼ .1), indicating that even students who realize the overall importance of English for the labor mar-ket do not act upon their insight by choosing EMI. Hence, we reject H2a. Nevertheless, the model shows that there is a moderately strong but highly significant link between JOBNEED and JOBAD-VANTAGE (␤ ϭ 0.380; p Ͻ .001). So students who realize the importance of English for employment on a global scale tend to draw consistent conclusions about their own employability.

This result demonstrates that even students who assess their English skills as excellent are not motivated by this fact to choose EMI. Their confidence in their English proficiency only lowers the barriers that prevent them from choosing EMI. 6  We assert that students who expect the BARRIERS to EMI to be high self-select against EMI.

The first four analyses evaluate the full model according to the four social background categories of the students. 8</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Backgrounds</head><p>Stratifying the full dataset into the social background categories 1-4 (1 ϭ lower middle, 2 ϭ middle, 3 ϭ upper middle, and 4 ϭ high) reveals further insights. We report the results of all four models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>.</p><p>We observe that the R 2 of EMI remains stable for subsample 4 (high) and increases for all other subsamples, reaching a high R 2 of 65.1% for subsample 1 (lower middle).</p><p>Because BACKGROUND is homogeneous within each subsample, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref> does not contain information on the pertinent path coefficients used to test H1a-d. With respect to H2a-b, H4a-b, and H5, we observe almost no differences from the previously presented full model, which speaks to the robustness of our previous hypothesis tests. Closer examination of H3 does, however, reveal an interesting finding: Students from the lower middle background (stratum 1) do not choose EMI even if they understand its benefits (␤ ϭ 0.004; p Ͼ .1).</p><p>Analyses of the control variables offer further fruitful insights into the motivation of students' EMI choice. The subsamples reveal that PRESSpeers is a decisive factor for students irrespective of social background. Nevertheless, PRESSpeers steadily increases in both strength and significance from students with a high social background (␤ ϭ 0.170; p Ͻ .05) to the lower middle social background (␤ ϭ 0.450; p Ͻ .01). These results indicate that the attitude of peers toward EMI is a substantially stronger determinant of EMI choice for students from the lower middle background than for students from the high background.</p><p>Another remarkable background-specific difference relates to the sex of the students. In stratum 2 (middle), 9.9% of the females chose EMI, but only 2.5% of the males did so. In stratum 1 (lower middle), just 8.0% of the males chose EMI compared to 31% of the females; this was the highest observed value in the dataset across all strata. We analyze the full model for sex-specific differences in the next section.</p><p>7 A simple t test confirms the medium size effect of BACKGROUND on EMI choice. Based on Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">8</ref>, we combine students from strata 1 and 2 that have chosen <ref type="bibr">EMI (11.5%,</ref><ref type="bibr">i.e.,</ref><ref type="bibr">19 of 165)</ref> and compare them to the students from strata 3 and 4 (16.9%, i.e., 76 of 451). Overall, the students from the higher strata choose EMI almost 50% more often than the lower strata. This difference is significant at p Ͻ 0.1. 8 Inevitably, this means that the first 4 models cannot employ the variable BACKGROUND because the variable is constant in each subsample. Likewise, the two analyses stratified by SEX employ all variables from the full model except for SEX. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sex</head><p>We analyze the model based on subsamples of male and female respondents. The R 2 of EMI remains stable for the female subsample (R 2 ϭ 28.4%) and increases for the male subsample (R 2 ϭ 33.3%).</p><p>There are only small sex-specific differences relating to H1a, H4a-b, and H5, which do not contradict our previous hypotheses tests. We report the results of all four models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">9</ref>.</p><p>Concerning the effect of BACKGROUND (H1a), we find that there are very small and weakly significant effects on the choice of EMI for males and females (␤ ϭ 0.079/Ϫ0.076; p Ͻ .1/0.05). Males from higher strata tend to choose EMI, while females from lower strata tend to choose EMI.</p><p>Another very small (␤ ϭ 0.082) and practically nonsignificant effect (p Ͻ .1) that differs from the full model is that the construct English has a slight direct influence on the choice of EMI (H4a). This might relate to the higher-most likely genderedassessments that females make of their English skills. Moving from strata 1-4, females rate their skills on the 7-point Likert scale as 4.6; 4.9; 5.0; and 5.1. The corresponding males assess their skills as only <ref type="bibr">4.0; 3.9; 4.3; and 4.4 (data not shown)</ref>. The females from the lowest social background assess their English skills at a higher level than the males from the highest social background. The same level of skills in English gives males more confidence than females (H4b). As a result, the former believe that the barriers to choosing EMI are lower. The coefficient for males is approximately 50% higher and has a much higher t value compared to the coefficient for females (␤ ϭ Ϫ0.490/Ϫ0.324; p Ͻ .001/0.001). Yet, when faced with the same barriers (H5), males are less likely than females to choose EMI, as indicated by the negative coefficients (␤ ϭ Ϫ0.395/Ϫ0.214; p Ͻ .001/0.001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>We investigate why non-native English language speakers choose EMI. Our study contributes to both theory and practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contributions to Theory and Methodology</head><p>In relation to Bourdieu's theory, we empirically demonstrate that social background substantially affects the choice of EMI through the mediating "hidden mechanisms" <ref type="bibr">(Swartz, 1997: 261)</ref> of cultural capital (language) and habitus (sense of place in the academic field). Students opt against EMI because they believe that the English language poses a barrier to their goals, for example, they fear receiving lower grades (less institutionalized cultural capital) or missing content in lectures (less cultural capital). Lower-strata students perceive the barriers to EMI as much higher than they actually are. We demonstrate that all students in the EMI/DMI programs have outstanding English proficiency, but that a higher social background is systematically related to higher levels of perceived English proficiency ("linguistic capital," <ref type="bibr">Bourdieu, 1991: 57)</ref>. The higher-(lower-) strata students' tendency to opt for (against) EMI thus   reflects their doxical field correspondence and not necessarily their capabilities. We contribute a set of constructs that make these "hidden mechanisms" visible through quantitative analysis.</p><p>The constructs capture the dialectic relationship between agency and social context in one model, representing Bourdieu's reciprocal "structured structures" and "structuring structures" <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1990c: 53)</ref>. We thereby offer a conceptual alternative to self-efficacy measures of scholarly success. Still, to investigate the relevance of choice at the level of the agent we suggest integrating selfefficacy into the future application of Bourdieusian theory. With our empirical focus on language choice within management education, we contribute to exploring the role of language as a social mediator between behavior and social structure. Since language represents institutionalized cultural and symbolic capital, we emphasize that the unmindful implementation of EMI can foster the uneven allocation of additional capital, the dogmatic "recognition of the legitimate language" <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1991: 49)</ref>, and the reproduction of a culturally privileged milieu. To transfer theory into higher education practice, we interpret our findings within the frame of <ref type="bibr">Bourdieu's (1979a: 76)</ref> "truly rational pedagogy" (see, "Contributions to Practice").</p><p>Moreover, we respond to the call for more research on the globalization of management education by addressing the underexplored role of EMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Doh, 2010)</ref>. Given our finding, that EMI will-even at the undergraduate level-function as a distinction for higher-strata students with an interest in social and symbolic capital, we also contribute to critical management studies.</p><p>Finally, we point to the underexplored role of gender in Bourdieu's work. The (statistically weak) finding that females from the lower strata are so surprisingly confident in their English skills and their EMI choice invites debate over whether future research should treat gender as a secondary constituent of social class as in our study or as a fundamental division in society <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1984: 468)</ref>. The latter division would conflict with Bourdieu's elaborations on the connections among capital, gender, symbolic violence, and the hysteresis effect of position and disposition <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1990b</ref><ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, , 2003a))</ref>. Women adapt their dispositions to their objective-and limited-opportunities, thereby following the logic of "amor fati" <ref type="bibr">(Bourdieu, 1990b: 13</ref>). Yet, the "negative capital of femaleness" (Djerf-Pierre, 2005: 265) can, under certain circumstances, be counterbalanced by gendered language-learning motivation and skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Akram &amp; Ghani, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Daif-Allah, 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contributions to Practice</head><p>As to public policy, we conjecture that globalizing management education is the sole feasible alternative for the leading universities <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Doh, 2010)</ref>, and that EMI is an effective tool for this internationalization. But, first, we caution that how EMI is implemented is crucial for its success as a language of choice and for the achievement of equal chances. Our findings on the strata-specific perception of barriers should alert policy makers that higher levels of English proficiency per se will not lead to greater acceptance of EMI among students in the lower strata. Universities can embrace the opportunity that undergraduate students arecompared to many MBA students-mainly interested in the content of the program (the cultural capital). With regards to the perceived language barriers of lower-strata students, policy makers should allay these students' concerns about the difficulty of EMI programs and take action to help students overcome the perceived barriers ("reflexive practice," see <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Maclean et al., 2012)</ref>. This could   also lower right-wing political resistance to such programs among those who feel that their domestic capital has been devalued. Examples of lowering barriers could include practice days, mandatory internships, or active relationships with alumni. In line with Bourdieu's "rational pedagogy"-which requires that assignments reflect the students' content-related work rather than their rhetorical and linguistic abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Baudelot, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1977)</ref>-lecturers and course administrators must stress in their course descriptions that the comprehensibility of the students' English is more important than their adeptness on English-language exams. Second, the integration of more students into EMI programs provides economies of scale for these programs and might help to find the resources to embed local traditions within a globalized education <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Mazza, Sahlin-Andersson, &amp; Pedersen, 2005)</ref>. For instance, it might become feasible to translate Continental European business traditions into English instead of simply importing Anglo-American content for a small number of students.</p><p>Third, our findings are equally valuable for Anglo-American universities that attempt to attract non-native English speakers from abroad (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Zheng, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research</head><p>The limitations of our work provide avenues for future research. First, we caution against generalizing our findings beyond the context of higher education in management. Future research may find that the effects presented here are more pronounced in more socially stratified contexts. Although Denmark's educational system is not fully socially inclusive <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Orr et al., 2011)</ref>, Denmark has one of the lowest growing income inequality (GINI) coefficients worldwide (OECD, 2011). The higher levels of inequality in (most) other European countries imply that students with inappropriate institutionalized cultural capital have higher chances of dropping out. Furthermore, the English language may be an even stronger social separator in countries where the perceived English proficiency is lower than in Denmark and student selection is biased toward the socially advantaged (e.g., Germany, France, Italy, Turkey; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Clayton, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">European Commission, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Orr et al., 2011)</ref>. The subsequent devaluation of the domestic language program contributes to further division. Class is-sues have especially been problematic in some Asian regions where expensive tuition and supplementary education in the English language (e.g., a stay abroad) are needed to keep up with the recent shift to EMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Jeong, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Kang, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Second, we have neither used constructs on general self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Schwarzer &amp; Jerusalem, 1995)</ref> nor implemented a scale for measuring perceived selfefficacy for EMI. Follow-up studies could use these constructs as mediating variables to understand the process of doxa in depth. These TPB (theory of planned behavior) elements would be a step toward explaining the importance of peer pressure and sex that might have their roots in a class-and gender-specific sensitivity toward normative beliefs, subjective norms, and self-efficacy. Our study could also be extended using social network analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Scott, 2003)</ref> to identify the agents in the field that actually have the power to declare that the English language is symbolic capital.</p><p>Third, the development of EMI choice could be assessed using longitudinal data to examine the potential effects of government or university interventions. Gathering such data would be facilitated if researchers created constructs for Bourdieu's types of capital and habitus based on publicly available data. In addition, the longitudinal perspective would help to close the gap between the antecedents of educational attainment (Bourdieusian theory) and its organizational outcomes (upper-echelon theory; <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Finkelstein &amp; Hambrick, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Ott, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Fourth, the proficiency of English among Danish students is so high that our findings might not be generalizable to settings with lower proficiency, such as Asia <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Evans &amp; Green, 2007)</ref>. To understand if a choice in itself is a perpetuator of unequal chances, it would be helpful to examine whether the reported problems with mandatory EMI in Asia <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Kang, 2012)</ref> can be prevented by measures such as free additional language classes, a shift toward student-centered learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Gao, 2012)</ref>, or a clear subordination of language to content requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Our study provides insights from an exceptional, multilingual Danish setting and develops constructs for future research. It uncovers the mediating effects of cultural capital and habitus in the relationship between social background and the choice of EMI in management education.</p><p>Our work must not be interpreted as opposing EMI in higher education. Abandoning EMI would be to the detriment of students, higher education, and possibly the broader economy because students generally see EMI as a personal enrichment and as a boon for their future careers. Instead, we contribute to the debate on class sensitivity in management education, which suggests that the diffusion of EMI be accompanied by policies that dismantle the barriers that lower-strata students perceive as prohibitive. This differs substantially from the politically exploitable dispute on domestic language protection or cultural imperialism.</p><p>We hope to contribute to a better understanding of the ways in which higher education in management plays a role in the (re-)production of privilege and disadvantage and to add to the current debates on EMI and social equality in management education.</p><p>Copyright of Academy of Management Learning &amp; Education is the property of Academy of Management and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.
