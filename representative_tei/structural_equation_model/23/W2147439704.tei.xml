<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Credit card is a mode of payment that is widely used by consumers to purchase goods and services on credit. The growth in credit card usage is parallel with the growth in other types of consumer credits such as bank overdrafts, personal loans, hire purchase and others. Although credit card stimulates consumer spending <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Warwick &amp; Mansfield, 2000)</ref> and offers flexibility to consumers, it also has its setbacks. The current developments of financial services globally have increased the availability and usage of credit, and directly increase the indebtedness of consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Griffiths, 2000)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Soman (2001)</ref>, those who use credit cards usually will make extra purchases and also tend to spend over their means. Consequently, they carry large balances in their credit cards which tend to accumulate because they usually pay only the minimum amount required by the banks.</p><p>This trend seems to be felt in Malaysia where the spread of credit card usage has been overwhelming among the consumers. As reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Passport (2011)</ref> What is then the negative side of this development? <ref type="bibr">Ahmed, Ishak Ismail, Sadiq Sohail, Ibrahim Tabsh and Hasbalaila Alias (2010)</ref> noted that many Malaysian consumers display compulsive buying behaviour, and with the easy accessibility to credit, this behaviour has led to exorbitant debt. The problem worsens because cardholders in Malaysia also use credit cards to withdraw cash advance. In this sense, credit cards are taken as the most consumer-friendly loan because it is easier to apply for credit cards than personal loans.</p><p>When credit cards were first introduced in Malaysia in the mid-1970s, only the well-off individuals (professionals and successful businesspersons)are eligible to own a credit card, which then represented the symbol of prestige <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Loke, 2007)</ref>. The requirement to own a credit card has been continuously relaxed as time passes. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahmed et al. (2010)</ref>, the rapid growing of Malaysian credit cardholders has created a thoughtless and unselective spending by users that cause many side effects. Furthermore, many Malaysian consumers are prone to exhibit compulsive buying behaviour. In an environment such as this, easy accessibility to credit cards has led to harmful circumstances such as excessive debts among Malaysians. The government of Malaysia is concerned about the increase in credit card usage and is keen to reduce personal debts. In 2010, the government introduces RM50 service tax for credit cards to promote a prudential approach to control credit cards. This action has effectively motivated many cardholders to cancel some of their credit cards especially in the wake of the economic downturn. Earlier in 2009, the Association of Banks in Malaysia restructured the credit card interest rates in order to encourage consumers to pay their credit cards, promptly.</p><p>Recently, the Central Bank of Malaysia (more commonly known as Bank Negara Malaysia) reported that as at end of 2010, the numbers of credit cardholders were 3.2 million with an outstanding credit card debt amounted to RM30.8 billion. This figure was 5 percent of the total household debt while non-performing loans (NPL) remained low at 1.7 percent of total credit card loans and 2 percent of the total banking system NPLs. With the current economic situation, the BNM has announced a new and more stringent set of guidelines on credit card eligibility criteria in March 2011 to promote prudent financial management among credit card users and to encourage responsible business practices among the credit card issuers.</p><p>Like the policy makers, the consumers are also concerned about the escalation of the credit card debt <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Geisst, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gross &amp; Souleles, 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bernthal, Crockett and Rose (2005)</ref> noted that consumers use credit cards to support their lifestyles. The increasing number of consumers especially among the young adults who incur debts in their credit cards is worrisome, particularly because they appear to be ignorant about the future consequences of their indebtedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Roberts &amp; Jones, 2001)</ref>. Although previous research has investigated the factors that influence the compulsive buying <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dittmar, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Park &amp; Burns, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Gao, Wheeler &amp; Shiv, 2009)</ref> and credit card usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Pirog &amp; Roberts, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fitzmaurice, 2008)</ref>, few have systematically articulated how these factors influence credit card misuse with theoretical support. Additionally, the findings of these studies are mainly derived from Western context. Therefore, it is unclear whether similar findings will be found in a non-Western context. In their study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sidoti and Devasagayam (2010)</ref> focused on the effect of materialism and risk attitude on credit card misuse in Western countries. Little research has been done in the Malaysian context. <ref type="bibr">Palan, Morrow, Trapp and Blackburn (2011)</ref> examine the mediating effects of credit card usage on the relationship between self-esteem and compulsive buying behaviour.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hayhoe, Leach, Turner, Bruin and Lawrence (2000)</ref>, income can also influence credit card usage among college students. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lyons (2004)</ref> suggested that only students with need-based financial aids are exposed to credit card debt.</p><p>Therefore, in an attempt to bridge these gaps, this study examines how self-esteem, materialism, budget constraint and impulsive buying influence compulsive buying and credit card misuse among working adults in Selangor, Malaysia. Moreover, this study also investigates the relationship between compulsive buying and credit card misuse. The variables of this study have been identified based on an extensive review of literatures. The findings of this study implicate need for training in financial planning to promote responsible spending among Malaysian.</p><p>The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the literature review, followed by the hypotheses. Section 3 describes the research methodology, sampling technique, as well as validity and reliability tests of the instruments used in this study. Sections 4 and 5 analyse and discuss the results. The last section summarizes findings of this study and provides implications arising from the findings.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Self-Esteem</head><p>Self-esteem is defined as an individual's feelings about the value or worth of himself or herself, and it is the degree of positivity of the self-concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Rosenberg, 1979)</ref>. Self-esteem signals individual's interpretations of the way others think about him or her <ref type="bibr">(Cooley, 1902;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rosenberg, 1979)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Pettit and Sivanathan (2011)</ref> find that individuals with low self-esteem tend to purchase expensive luxury goods on credit to repair their self-worth. This finding supports <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bell's (1998)</ref> argument that in a modern society, material wealth is used to demonstrate their social power.</p><p>Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Eastman, Fredenberger, Campbell and Calvert (1997)</ref> posited that status is shown by ownership of status products rather than occupational or personal reputation. These arguments are also consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Prince (1993)</ref> who suggested that young adults related money closely with power and esteem. In an earlier study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Braun and Wicklund (1989)</ref> noted that people demonstrate their identity to others by possessions of luxury items. However, this behaviour is conditional because it prevails when their identity is threatened. In a recent study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Gao et al. (2009)</ref> found that other psychological states such as low self-view confidence also can induce compensatory status consumption.</p><p>If low self-esteem lead to compulsive buying <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Faber &amp; O'Guinn, 1992)</ref> or high spur to purchase <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(d'Astous, 1990)</ref>, how does this personality lead to credit card misuse? The answer lies in <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wang, Lv and Jiang's (2011)</ref> explanation. When consumers' income is insufficient to meet their demand in pursuit of prestige, they will buy the luxury products using credit cards. The same problem less likely to occur among individuals of high self-esteem because they are more confident and less affected emotionally. In contrast, low self-esteem people continuously experience higher anxiety, distress and negative emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Yelsma, P. &amp; Yelsma, J., 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Credit card misuse is more likely to implicate this group of individual because most of the time compulsive buying happens in consumers who are very concerned about their appearance to others and attempt to be pleasing others <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Krueger, 1988)</ref>.Empirically, there is no significant relationship between self-esteem and credit card debt <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pinto, Mansfield &amp; Parente, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>However, the picture becomes clearer when the definition of debt is widened to include all kinds of borrowings. Norvilitis, Merwin, Osberg, Roehling, <ref type="bibr">Young and Kamas (2006)</ref> found a negative relationship between self-esteem and acquisition of debt, although it cannot be verified whether low self-esteem triggers individual's tendency to incur more debts whether debt reduces self-esteem, or whether another third factor exists. Inspired by these ideas and findings, we proposed the following hypotheses:</p><p>• H1a. Self-esteem will have a negative effect on compulsive buying behaviour.</p><p>• H2a. Self-esteem will have a negative effect on credit card misuse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Materialism</head><p>Materialism is the individual's devotion to material desires, drive on getting more material things, and attachment to worldly possessions to achieve desired states. Materialists treat acquisition of goods as their personal goals that affect their lifestyles <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Richins &amp; Dawson, 1992)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Schiffman and Kanuk (2007)</ref> noted that materialism stresses possessions as the central of an individual's identity attribution to success. At the most extreme degree of materialism, individuals treat possession as the greatest satisfaction and pleasures in life <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Belk, 1984)</ref>.</p><p>Accessibility to credit card can be detrimental to materialists because they tend to experience more dissatisfaction for setting unrealistic goals in their lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Sirgy (1998)</ref>. Credit card provides a means for them to reach these goals, but this means is artificial because it is not supported with actual resources. Consistent with Sirgy (1998), <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dittmar, Long and Bond (2007)</ref> found that individuals who are materialistic are less satisfied and more likely to be compulsive buyers. Therefore, the desire to attain social status through material possessions can easily trigger temptation, causing splurge spending which probably lead to credit card misuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fitzmaurice, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pirog &amp; Roberts, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Richins, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Rischins and Rudimin (1994)</ref> suggested that materialistic tendencies are related to the individual's identity, social behaviour, motivation for work and use of money. In turn, individuals' attitudes toward money and credit are related to their spending behaviour, economic well-being, and tolerant to debt levels <ref type="bibr">(Lea, 1995)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kasser and Sheldon (2000)</ref>, when individuals' needs for security and safety are not fully satisfied, they will turn their focus on materialistic needs including purchasing expensive things to achieve the desired states. The tendency could impose a serious problem to the economic well-being of the society because the increasing drive towards materialism, which contributes to compulsive buying behaviour, has been found to also occur among the younger consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dittmar, 2005)</ref>. This notion is supported by a finding by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Heaney, Goldsmith and Jusoh (2005)</ref> which shows that there is a significant relationship between status consumption and materialism among college students. Consistent with the evidence presented by previous researchers, we therefore postulate that:</p><p>• H1b. Materialism will have a positive effect on compulsive buying behaviour.</p><p>• H2b. Materialism will have a positive effect on credit card misuse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Budget Constraint</head><p>Consumer demand theory suggests that consumers maximise utility, which is subject to budget constraints, where price and income influence the budget constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Pindyck &amp; Rubinfeld, 2008)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hayhoe et al. (2000)</ref>, the income of college students, whether the sources are part-time jobs, sponsorships, or parents, also influence their credit card usage. They found that students with higher income tend to purchase entertainment, clothes and fuel with credit cards. Students with need-based financial aids are exposed to credit card debt <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lyons, 2004)</ref> but parental income is not associated with college students with credit card debt <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">( Wang &amp; Xiao, 2009)</ref>. These findings suggest that students claim personal ownership on the financial aids that they are free to spend the funds according to their own needs, interests, or desires. In contrast, they have fewer tendencies treat parental income in a similar manner because they have to answer to their parents out of respects, gratitude or responsibility.</p><p>A recent finding by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fogel and Schneider (2011)</ref> suggests that even the high disposable income consumers are exhibiting compulsive buying because they use it as a coping or therapeutic approach. In a case such as this, compulsive buying may not lead to credit card misuse if the disposable income is high enough to support the compulsive buying behaviour. Based on this, we state the following hypothesis:</p><p>• H1c. Budget constraint is related to compulsive buying behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Impulsive Buying</head><p>Impulse buying happens when an individual experiences a persistent, and sudden and powerful urge to instantly purchase something <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Rook, 1987)</ref> and it could result from temporary failure of self-control <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baumeister, 2002)</ref>. It happens when there is no pre-shopping intention to purchase the specific product or to fulfil specific buying task <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Beatty &amp; Ferrell, 1998)</ref>. The possibility of unplanned and unwanted outcomes is high when individuals act on impulse <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Rook &amp; Fisher, 1995)</ref>. However, impulse consumers tend to give in to their buying temptation although they are aware of the negative consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Rook, 1987)</ref>. When the impulse is out of control, the impulsive consumers have a great tendency to misuse their credit cards because credit cards provide a readily accessible means to fulfil their self-generated desires for things <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Pirog &amp; Roberts, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rook &amp; Fisher, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Roberts &amp; Jones, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fogel &amp; Schneider, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Park &amp; Burns, 2005</ref> have discovered significant positive relationships between fashion orientations in both impulsive and compulsive spenders.</p><p>Impulsive spending happens spontaneously in response to in-store stimulus, whereas compulsive spending is an addictive form of compensatory consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bayley &amp; Nancarrow, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Shoham &amp; Brencic, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Woodruffe, 1997)</ref>. Based on the reported research, we proposed the following hypotheses:</p><p>• H1d. Impulse buying tendencies will have a positive effect on compulsive buying behaviour.</p><p>• H2c. Impulse buying tendencies will have a positive effect on credit card misuse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Compulsive Buying</head><p>Compulsive buying can be defined as a chronic, repetitive purchasing that is induced by negative events or feelings <ref type="bibr">(Faber &amp; O'Guinn, 1989)</ref>. This behaviour is a critical tendency of an individual to spend beyond his/her means and needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mittal, Huppertz &amp; Khare, 2008)</ref> and it is becoming a serious problem among consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mittal et al., 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chaplin and John (2007)</ref> asserted that the modern culture that embraces materialism has intensified compulsive buying behaviour and <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Roberts and Jones (2001)</ref> claimed that compulsive buying has been identifies as one of the greatest cause associated with credit debts. People purchase expensive material goods to demonstrate status, social power and economic power to fulfil pleasure-seeking needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bell, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Belk, 1984)</ref> and to camouflage the low self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Faber &amp; O'Guinn, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hanley &amp; Wilhelm 1992)</ref>. The desire to attain social status through material possessions has encouraged the splurge spending and credit card misuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fitzmaurice, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pirog &amp; Roberts, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dittmar et al., 2007)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Sampling Design and Procedures</head><p>A self-administered questionnaire survey was distributed using convenient sampling to collect the empirical data. The target population comprises of credit card users and those who live or work within Klang Valley, Malaysia. Klang Valley is where the capital city of Malaysia, Kuala</p><p>Lumpur, is situated. The Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur has the highest population density in the Malaysia i.e., about 6,500 people per square kilometre. This metropolitan city is situated in the state of Selangor, which is one of the 14 states in Malaysia that is experiencing the fastest rise in population density as it benefits from the rapid development of Kuala Lumpur and the spill over of residents across the state boundary which surrounds the Federal Territory <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Passport, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>A total of 230 responses were collected. After data cleaning and editing, the final count of questionnaires with no missing values for all variables under analysis was 186, representing a response rate of 81percent. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> reported the demographic profiles of the respondents.</p><p>There were about the same number of male and female respondents. About 47.3 percent of the respondents were from the 20-30 age group followed by 35.3percent from the 31-40 age groups, giving a total of 82 percent of total respondents. Majority of the respondents (60%)</p><p>were ethnic Malay, 30 percent were ethnic Chinese, while 10 percent were ethnic Indians and the "other" ethnic groups. Most of the respondents held executive posts or higher. The occupations explained their income levels. Nearly half of the respondents earned RM2,001-RM4,000 per month, about a quarter earned RM4,001-RM6,000 while 23.3 percent earned more than RM6,000. There were 70.7 percent of the respondents who attained a Bachelor degree, 20 percent were with a Master degree and only 1 person had a PhD qualification.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> reported the patterns of the credit card usage. There were a total of 265 credit cards used, because more than half of the respondents' owned 2 or more credit cards. From the 265 credit cards, 44.2 percent were Master cards, 45.3 percent were Visa cards while the remaining 10.5 percent were AMEX or Diners cards. There were 36.7 percent of the respondents who used their credit cards once a week, followed by 26.7 percent who used fortnightly, and almost 10 percent used them on a daily basis. Only 27.3 percent of the respondents used the cards once a month. The most popular use of credit card was shopping (52.7%), followed by groceries, business, purely personal reason, and entertainment. The other purposes of credit card usage were convenience, payment for insurance, medical and online ticket. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Operational Definitions of Variables</head><p>The Appendix exhibited measures for the six variables in this study which were either adopted or adapted from the related studies. A survey instrument was composed based on the measurement items plus items designed to collect respondent demographics. All questions were measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1(strongly disagree) to 5(strongly agree), where respondents indicated their degree of agreement or disagreement with a series of statements. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> reported a reliability analysis of Cronbach alphas of 0.89, 0.76, 0.85, 0.88, 0.71, and 0.81 for self-esteem, materialism, impulsive buying, budget constraint, compulsive buying, and credit card misuse, respectively. The results indicated a high degree of internal consistency which concurs with Nunnally's (1978) 0.7 cut-off point.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Structural Model</head><p>A two-step approach was employed to analyse the data, in which an examination of the measurement model was followed by an examination of the structural model to test the hypothesized relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988)</ref>. The structural equation modelling (SEM) procedure enabled us to evaluate how well a proposed conceptual model that contained observed variables and unobservable constructs fit the collected data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bollen, 1989)</ref>. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test the robustness and reliability of the scales (via AMOS and the maximum likelihood estimation technique) to confirm the factor loading of the six constructs and to assess the model fit. The SEM was conducted to assess the overall fit of the proposed model and to test the hypotheses.</p><p>The model adequacy was assessed by the fit indices suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson &amp; Tatham (2006)</ref>. The analysis showed the model had an acceptable overall fit (χ2 =339.53, df-= 138, χ2/df = 2.460, p = .000, GFI = .90, CFI = .91, RMSEA = .008). Both the GFI and CFI values were larger than the suggested cut-off point of 0.90 <ref type="bibr">(Hu &amp; Bentker, 1999)</ref> while the ratio of chi-square to degrees of freedom (χ2/df) of 2.46 indicated a good model fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chin &amp; Todd, 1995)</ref>. A root mean square of error of approximation (RMSEA) of 0.008 also indicated an acceptable fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hair et al., 2006)</ref>. Overall, the measurement model fit well to suggest adequate validity and to warrant a closer look.</p><p>We assessed the convergent and discriminant validity with several tests suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</ref>. Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> listed the Cronbach's alpha, composite reliabilities and variance extracted estimates (AVE). Cronbach's alpha of all dimensions ranged from 0.71 to 0.89, clearly indicating that the scales used in this study were highly reliable <ref type="bibr">(Nunnally, 1978)</ref>. The AVE values consistently exceeded the recommended lower standard of 0.50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>. All tests supported convergent validity of the scales. We also assessed discriminant validity with tests recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</ref>. The correlation index among factors was low to moderate and did not exceed the 0.85 cut-off point <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kline, 2005)</ref>. Given the satisfactory fit of the model, the estimated structural coefficients were then examined to test the 7 hypothesed relationships using AMOS (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).  <ref type="bibr">Pettit and Sivanathan (2011)</ref>, they tended to purchase expensive luxury goods on credit to increase their sense of self-worth. While hypothesis 2a was supported, the direct paths from materialism and impulsive buying to credit card misuse were not significant (γ = 0.25; t =1.78; p&gt; 0.05; γ = -0.07; t =-0.37; p&gt; 0.05, respectively), which meant that H2b and H2c</p><p>were not supported.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>The findings of this study could make significant contributions to the understanding of credit card misuse among working adults in Malaysia. First, the findings showed the credit card misuse by the working adults was directly related to materialism, budget constraint, impulsive buying and compulsive buying. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Soman (2001)</ref>, this finding suggested that Malaysian consumers had the tendency to spend beyond their means and usually make an extra purchase when they used credit cards. Many literatures highlighted the relationship between credit and indebtedness which explains the rise in consumer spending and debt <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Griffiths, 2000)</ref>. The findings were in line with the past studies which indicated that the desire to attain social status through material possession increases the lavish spending and credit card misuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fitzmaurice, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pirog &amp; Roberts, 2007)</ref>. Moreover, this study showed that individuals with budget constrain were more exposed to credit card debt <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lyons, 2004)</ref>. Furthermore, the compulsive buying behaviour itself was one of driving factors of greatest concerns because it is associated with credit debts <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Roberts &amp; Jones, 2001)</ref> and credit card misuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(d'Astous, 1990)</ref>.</p><p>The findings also showed the compulsive buying behaviour was prevalent among working adults who had budget constraint and impulsive buying as well as embraced materialism. Since the respondents were mostly less than 40 years old, the results were also consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dittmar (2005)</ref> who found that materialism contributes to the increase in compulsive buying behaviour especially among younger consumers. There was also a significant positive relationship between impulsive buying and compulsive spenders <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Park &amp; Burns, 2005)</ref>. This relationship could be attributed to the composition of medium to high income group respondents in this study. As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fogel and Schneider (2011)</ref>, level of disposable income positively influences compulsive buying behaviour among consumers.</p><p>Interestingly and consistent with the intuitive prediction, self-esteem was negatively related to credit card misuse, which suggested that credit card users with low self-esteem were more likely to misuse their credit cards. This finding was in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wang et al. (2011)</ref> who suggested that when consumers' income is insufficient to meet their demand in pursuit of prestige, they will resort to credit cards to purchase the luxury products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Implications</head><p>The increasing number of consumers especially young adults, who incur credit card debt is worrisome particularly if they not informed about the future consequences of their indebtedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Roberts &amp; Jones, 2001)</ref>. Not only consumers often use credit cards to support their modern lifestyles <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bernthal, Crockett &amp; Rose, 2005)</ref>, there are also growing tendencies for consumers to buy compulsively <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Neuner, Raab &amp; Reisch, 2005)</ref>. The results of this study suggested significant practical implications for understanding and addressing the problem of credit card misuse not only among working adults but also the general population. The significant positive relationship between compulsive buying and credit card misuse indicated the need to educate the public about prudent financial planning and responsible credit card usage. Financial management education and courses should be introduced at the earliest age possible such as when the children begin their primary school. Moreover, parents need to take the responsibility to inculcate financial discipline to their children in order to instil the values of living within one's means.</p><p>The findings of this study also indicated that budget constraint, impulsive buying, and materialism contributed most toward compulsive buying among credit card users. In turn, low self-esteem and high compulsive buying behaviour increased the tendency of the working adults to misuse their credit cards. These findings demonstrated the importance of associating individual differences to effectively manage personal debts. These results implied that consumers need to be aware of their perception of money and how that attitude transcends into their credit card usage. They must be made understand that the purpose of credit card is for safe, economic and convenient mode of payment, rather than as a convenient, cost-free line of credits.</p><p>In Malaysia although, any individual above the age of 18 can possess a credit card (The Start Online, 2010), issuers of credit cards should use the findings from this study to develop advertisement campaigns and marketing strategies that promote responsible credit card usage. Socially responsible companies would benefit by designing advertisements and marketing efforts based on rational and responsible use of credit cards. Hence credit card companies should explain to potential credit cardholders on the interest rate, fees and the consequence of deferred payment of holding credit cards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Future Research</head><p>Based on the findings as well as the variety of issues associated with compulsive buying behaviour and credit card misuse, further research may want to incorporate knowledge on financial literacy and credit card debt management, particularly among those materialistic, low self-esteem, impulsive and compulsive buyers as these groups of people prone to spend beyond their financial limits and face the financial risk. With this finding, researchers can contribute towards improving consumer financial well-being and reduce bankruptcy due to credit defaults. Another promising future research needs to be conducted with different samples of credit card users such as, college students, senior citizens and female consumers.</p><p>As various segments will have different personal traits and values, for example, college students incline to have high proneness on possession of expensive and luxury products <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Eren, Eroglu &amp; Hacioglue, 2012)</ref> this will help credit card companies and regulators to reduce the credit card debt problem.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, personal credit cards in Malaysia are dominating 92 percent of transaction volume and 89 percent of transaction value in 2010. The transaction value of credit cards increases from RM41,228.1 million in 2005 to RM74,783.7 million in 2010 and the number of credit cards issued increase from 7.86 million in 2005 to 10.69 million in 2010.</figDesc></figure>
