<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study investigates the relationship between brand awareness, brand association, perceived quality, brand loyalty and brand purchasing intention. A total of 99 students from Budi Luhur University was used as respondents in this study based on the convenience sampling method. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and SmartPLS 3.0 software. The analysis specifies that there is a significant positive relationship among brand awareness, brand association and perceived quality towards brand loyalty and brand purchasing intention. However, there is not a significant relationship between brand loyalty and brand purchasing intention. It indicates that consumers who are satisfied with Richeese Factory products and services do not always end up making purchases. The ability of managers to understand the factors which shape consumer brand behavior is required to develop and to maintain their brand position in high competitive fast food brand competition.</p></div>

Moreover, high population of young people, a large number of women who work on tight schedules and increased income of middle-income class groups have become key antecedents of demand for fast food brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(SINGH;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">PATTANAYAK, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The high demand has been responded by the emergence of a many local fast food brands in Indonesia. The local fast food brands often offer a variety of products. However, the products and services provided are relatively similar in the form of the way products are processed, served, packed and the price ranges offered to the consumers. In addition, the brands usually provide delivery services, free wifi, and put special attention to restaurant layouts and interiors. This has brought a tight competition to the industry. Consumers can easily switch to other brands if there is no special uniqueness and differentiation that distinguishes a brand from its competitors. The uniqueness of products and restaurants has been used as a brand positioning strategy over the past few years in the food service industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(ROBINSON;</ref><ref type="bibr">CLIFFORS, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The uniqueness can be developed in terms of the variety of product, the restaurant's layout, the convenience provided for consumers in the restaurant, and consumer interaction with staffs (TSAI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">LU, 2012)</ref>. This concept of uniqueness is often challenging for fast food brands that basically have their own concept of serving food quickly and expect consumers to enjoy their food quickly in restaurants as well. High uniqueness of a product will bring high identity, consumer brand awareness and the brand association <ref type="bibr">(LU;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">GURSOY;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">LU, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Elements such as variety and inseparableness will form strong brand equity that highly influences consumer loyalty to products and brands, Increase Company profits, and builds effective marketing strategies (SUN; GHISELLI, 2010). In addition, the existence of global fast food brands that have dominated the fast food market for years in Indonesia, has been creating a high challenge for local fast food restaurants to gain market share. Usually, local food brands are not successful in forming their brand equity as expected (TAN; DEVINAGA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">HISHAMUDDIN, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Although there are growing literatures that discuss the relationship between brand equity and brand purchasing intention in the food service industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(JALILVAND et al., 2016</ref>;</p></div>

Since perceived quality is a more specific concept that determines the perceived value of consumers, therefore in this study, we adopted indicators of perceived value in measuring brand association. Brand personality is a human characteristic related to a brand (KELLER; PARAMESWARAN; JACOB, 2011).</p><p>Organizational associations are favorable relationships between consumers and companies. This is according to the assumption that a positive relationship will give the expected impact on consumer attitudes and behavior towards the brand. This is considered more effective than depend on the prominence of single product (AAKER, 2012). <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Romaniuk and Nenycz-Thiel (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Severi and Ling (2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Maderer, Holtbruegge, and Woodland (2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Foroudi, Jin, Gupta, Foroudi, and Kitchen (2018)</ref> proved a positive relationship between brand association and brand loyalty.</p><p>The higher the brand association will lead to the higher consumer's fondness and attachment to the brand.

Data indicated that this restaurant already has 59 outlets across Indonesia that outspread to 22 cities in 2018.</p><p>Despite it was first launched in 2011, the restaurant has a rapid growth due to its franchise concept and high consumer demand for the typical restaurant products (RACHMAWATI, 2018).</p><p>The difference with other fast food brands is all the menus served accompanied by a cheese sauce while other fast food restaurants usually use tomato or chili sauce. In this study, specifically, we selected the Richeese Factory, which is located in South Jakarta. The main reason is because the location is near to Budi Luhur University, where we collected our respondents.</p><p>The Richeese Factory has assigned high school and university students as their main target market. A total of 99 students from Budi Luhur University was collected as samples in this study. Electronic questionnaires were distributed based on convenience sampling method and Likert Scale.

The finding indicates that Richeese Factory is well known in the mind of respondents. The higher consumer satisfaction with products and services, the higher their desire to make purchases, repurchases, and affect other people to make the similar purchase.</p><p>Furthermore, brand association also has a positive relationship to brand loyalty and brand purchasing intention. This result is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Foroudi, Jin, Gupta, Foroudi, and Kitchen (2018)</ref>. Consumers are not only able to identify Richeese factory as one of the local fast food brands, but consumers also have been able to identify the product offered, its uniqueness compared to other brands, its innovation, and other form of services (MOHD YASIN; NASSER NOOR; MOHAMAD, 2007).  <ref type="bibr">ijmp.jor.br v. 11, n. 1, January-February 2020</ref><ref type="bibr">ISSN: 2236-269X DOI: 10.14807/ijmp.v11i1.981</ref> Likewise, the perceived quality of brand loyalty and brand purchasing intention is positive and significant. This result is consistent with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bao, Bao, and Sheng (2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">), Calvo-Porral and Lévy-Mangin (2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">), and Foroudi, Jin, Gupta, Foroudi, and Kitchen (2018)</ref>. Richeese factory's high quality of service that exceeds customer expectations will increase brand loyalty and brand purchasing intention. Service quality covers the product characteristics, services, and wifi availability.</p><p>However, brand loyalty does not significantly affect brand purchasing intention. The finding is inconsistent with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Tu, Wang, and Chang (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Han et. al. (2018)</ref>. This is interesting since according to prior studies, brand loyalty should be able to influence consumer attitude and behavior. Attitude means the level of customer satisfaction with Richeese factory. High satisfaction should lead to product purchases. However, in this study we assume that consumers who are satisfied with Richeese factory products and services do not always end up making purchases. This may be affected by other variables such as prices that have not been included in the research model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION</head><p>This study contributes in analyzing the factors that affect brand equity and brand purchasing intention of a local fast food brand in Jakarta, Indonesia. The finding indicates that there is a positive relationship between brand equity (brand awareness, brand association, perceived quality, and brand loyalty) and brand purchasing intention.</p><p>However, the relationship between brand loyalty and brand purchasing intention is not significant. Since the fast food industry has grown very rapidly in Indonesia, high competition must be addressed well by managers by building strong brand equity. The study suggests several managerial implications for local fast food brands.</p><p>First, creating strong brand equity will lead to brand loyalty. However, the fact that brand loyalty is not significant in creating brand purchasing intention suggests that managers must pay attention to other factors that may influence consumers to make purchases.</p><p>Second, positive effects of brand awareness, brand association, and perceived quality towards brand purchasing intention give a signal for managers to implement specific strategies that can increase the three elements of brand equity, especially on consumers' brand awareness, such as communicating the Richeese Factory name and logo, product variations, improving the packaging to be more attractive and creating a unique way on how the products served to its consumers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode] Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 United States License 44 INDEPENDENT JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT &amp; PRODUCTION (IJM&amp;P) http://www.ijmp.jor.br  v. 11, n. 1, January-February 2020  ISSN: 2236-269X    </figDesc></figure>

Similarly, AVE values are above 0.50, composite reliability and Cronbach's Alpha are above 0.70 except for the brand purchasing intention which has a value of 0.687. However, this value is considered moderately acceptable. Fornell larcker criterion results indicate that the AVE root values of all constructs are higher than construct correlations with other constructs.
