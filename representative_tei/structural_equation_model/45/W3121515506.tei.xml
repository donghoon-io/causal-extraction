<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Drawing on prospect theory (the subgroup of behavioural economics) and information integration theory, this study proposes and empirically tests a research model exploring the influence of tourist trust on tourists' revisit intention through the mediating effect of attitudes in the Hong Kong (HK) protest context. A series of protests commenced on 3 April 2019 against the Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement have severely impacted the HK tourism industry as the destination may deem to be unsafe by tourists to revisit. This study is important because HK protests happened at least 10 protests per month from April to December 2019, which have brought an adverse impact on the tourism industry. Using a survey method, we collected 176 data from those who had prior experience visiting HK, and data were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling. Overall, the findings demonstrate that attitudes mediate the effect of tourists' trust on revisit intention, but no direct effect of trust on revisit intention ascribe to hazard protests. Recognizing greater uncertainty arises following reports from media that prominently inform tourists' decision-making, and how selfperceived trust influences attitudes on hazards offers intriguing managerial and practical implications for managers and policymakers. Besides, theoretical implications and directions for future research are presented.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In Hong Kong (HK), the share of tourism industry in Gross Domestic Product was 4.5% in 2018 <ref type="bibr">(Tourism Commission, 2020)</ref>. Tourism stimulates HK's economic diversification, provides impulsion to the growth of related industries, and creates employment opportunities. HK enjoys its sovereignty under the 'one country, two systems' principle. Known as the pits crisis event in HK by the central government of China, a series of HK protests commenced on 3 April 2019 against the Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement, which intends to oppose the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill proposed by the Chinese sovereignty (BBC News, 2019, June 9). More recently, the acts of anti-government protests continue and tensions mount in busy districts in Central, Hong Kong Island and Kowloon to oppose both the national anthem bill debate and the proposed national security legislation in May 2020. Descending from peaceful rallies into violent chaos, the 2019 HK protest has intensified to a life-threatening level (The <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Guardian, 2019)</ref>, with an escalating number of injury cases of protesters, police, and the public. This study is important because HK protests happened at least 10 protests per month from April-December 2019 (<ref type="url" target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_protests_in_Hong_Kong">https://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_protests_in_Hong_ Kong</ref>). The ongoing protests with no signs of abatement have affected the HK tourism industry detrimentally. As political unrest persists and turns violent, visitor arrival growth has plummeted 80.9% year-on-year in 2020Q1 <ref type="bibr">(Hong Kong Trade Development Council, 2020)</ref>. As the world transport hub, Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) becomes the key protest target. Hitting a nadir in mid-August with the cessation of HKIA and mass gathering at HKIA resulted in the cancellation of departing flights for days <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Regan et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Tourism and trust come together at various intersections. Prior research shows trust drives several fundamental constructs in travel choices, including tourist visitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Su et al., 2014)</ref>, revisiting intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abubakar et al., 2017)</ref>, and attitudes towards a destination <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chen and Phou, 2013)</ref>. Recently, studies have investigated the correlation between tourists' perceived trust and revisit intention in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hassan and Soliman, 2021)</ref>. While the relations between tourists' trust and revisit intention have been assessed in the extant literature, no known study has explored these relations during the context of protests.</p><p>Trust depletes with uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lewis and Weigert, 1985)</ref>. Uncertainty is enunciated in safety and security, episodic political, economic events, and natural hazards <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Williams and Baláž, 2020)</ref>. Uncertainty of trust poses superfluous challenges in tourism where tourists have imperfect personal tacit knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Williams and Baláž, 2015)</ref>. Contrary to <ref type="bibr">So ¨nmez and</ref><ref type="bibr">Graefe (1998a, 1998b)</ref> that tourists avoid risk allied with potential political instability, and choose to visit safe destinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Silva et al., 2010)</ref>, some tourists revisit unsafe destinations regardless of risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fuchs and Reichel, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Li et al., 2010)</ref>. This has underlined the prominence of trust in realizing revisit intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Sannassee and Seetanah, 2015)</ref>, particularly on festival visit motivation.</p><p>Borrow the similar analogy of COVID-19 causes fear and anxiety worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Reznik et al., 2020)</ref>, it may be apparent that geopolitical uncertainty and social unrest in HK can cause a feeling of fear among the tourists, which may change their attitudes and behaviour in deciding whether to revisit HK. To the best of our knowledge, limited studies assessing the mediation impact of attitudes on the relation between tourists' trust and revisit intention in the protests research framework. To fill the gaps, this study examines the key determinants influencing tourists' revisit intention in the hitherto protests context. Specifically, this study aims to: 1) assess the role of trust in influencing tourists' revisit intention to HK in the aftermath of a series of protest incidents; 2) test the influence of trust on attitudes and revisit intention; and 3) investigate the mediating role of attitudes in the relationship between trust and revisit intention decision.</p><p>This study contributes a novel perspective of the body of knowledge and practices in three ways: 1) It contributes to the scarce study arena of trust in the tourism destination aversion literature; it provides insights on tourism trust for a destination, which answers whether tourism behaviour is liable to the domain trust components; 2) It adds to the literature that outlines tourist behaviour during the time of political unrest (i.e., protest) period and provides managerial guidelines for tourism authority and agents; 3) We assess the mediating role of attitudes towards a destination in the relations between tourist trust and revisit intention, which has not been recced in the HK protest chaos context; and 4) This area lacks clarity in the literature whether attitudes can be explained by tourist trust to predict revisit behavioural intention in the protest scenario.</p><p>The structure of the paper is as follows: We first present a literature review on tourist trust, attitudes, and revisit destination intention. Section 3 outlines the methodology, samples, and measures. Section 4 elucidates the data analysis and discussion. Section 5 concludes with academic theoretical and managerial implications, limitations, and directions for future research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prospect theory</head><p>Prospect theory is a theory of behavioural economics. The application of the theory of behavioural economics in conceptualizing the application of trust to tourists' revisit behavioural intention was originated from Tversky and <ref type="bibr">Kahneman (1974)</ref>. Behavioural economists differentiate between uncertainty (unknown risks) and known risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Knight, 1921)</ref>. When people favour known risks to unknown uncertainty, this is called the Ellsberg paradox <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ellsberg, 1961)</ref>, Prospect theory analyses decision-making under risk, notably how people value gains and losses differently, disfigurements in estimating the odds of unusual events <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979)</ref>. In the context of tourism, prospect theory is particularly applicable in explaining tourists who are loss averse and prefer tourism experience with known risk instead of huge uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Avineri and Chorus, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">van Wee, 2010)</ref>. Risk aversion has been associated with revisit motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bongkosh et al., 2008)</ref>. Tourists deciding whether or not to revisit HK depends on the propensity to bear uncertainties and the acceptance of the associated tacit knowledge of deviations of the 'normal' situation in HK. Some travellers may acquire extensive information processing to reduce risk and uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Osti et al., 2009)</ref>. All these lies at the heart of trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Williams and Baláž, 2020)</ref> and trust operates as rational individual behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Murphy, 2006)</ref>. Rational tourists elect to visit a tourist spot based on its attributes, subject to experience. People change their attitudes when they perceive contradiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Heider, 1946)</ref>, and maintain their attitudes following their perceptions.</p><p>On the other hand, some tourist attractions are festival motivated <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lee et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Mohr et al., 1993)</ref> or food motivated <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Sims, 2009)</ref> -the gastronomy tourism <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kivela and Crotts, 2006)</ref>. Culture has an impact on perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Poon and Yong, 2005)</ref>. The cultural dimension remains a crucial factor in shaping decision-making on tourists' destination selections. In tourism, two types of culture are classified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Qian et al. (2018)</ref>, namely the tourists' self-culture (where a tourist's cultural background shapes a destination selection and the evaluation of the subsequent travel experience) and culture of the host (the pull factor that attracts tourists to visit a destination). HK is famous for its art festivals, classic or modern performances, and food festivals, and these festivals have made HK a unique glimpse into traditional Chinese and living culture. Among those festivals that have attracted tourists worldwide are parading Dragon and Lion Dance Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Chinese New Year, Mooncake Festival, Arts Festival, and Chinese Opera. Trust related to repeating visits to HK may pertain to those who are desired for excitement and adventure curiosity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Formica and Uysal, 1998)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information integration theory</head><p>Risk perception refers to the subjective evaluation of the risk, which can shape an individual's behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Weinstein, 1988)</ref>. In tourism, risk perception is connected with the valuation of endangering condition to make travel decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Maser and Weiermair, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Reisinger and Mavondo, 2005)</ref>. Past studies examine tourists' risk perception in the reverberation of health crises <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cahyanto et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Floyd and Pennington-Gray, 2004)</ref>, including how COVID-19 influences risk perception and travel behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bae and Chang, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Neuburger and Egger, 2020)</ref>. HK protest is categorized as travel health risks because HK protest has threatened the safety of tourists exposure to blood, injury, and violence (WHO, 2012), and endangered travellers and local communities. Because of these known risks, which most tourists learned from media, tourists might form negative well-being travel attitudes and avoidance to HK temporarily <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Chua et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Yang et al., 2018)</ref>. This has in turn induced a low trust level on revisit intention. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Anderson (1981)</ref>, this circumstance of risk perception can be theoretically explicated by information integration theory, which describes how a person integrates information from different sources to make an overall judgement. In our context, information integration theory suggests that a tourist's travel decision process whether to revisit HK is decided based on the risk-(or safety) related information received and the perception of risk probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Roehl and Fesenmaier, 1992)</ref>. Risk perception in our protests context means the tourists' perception of the probability that action may endanger them that ultimately prompt travel decisions if the perceived hazard is beyond an acceptable tolerance level. Tourists, who feel at risk of contracting a crowd within any protest groups, may avoid travelling. Furthermore, tourists who value an avoidance of health risks will not revisit HK, particularly in the unfamiliar current situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trust in tourism</head><p>Trust is defined as a person's affection for security and willingness to have faith in other people or things <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chung and Kwon, 2009)</ref>. There are three strands of literature on tourist trust: 1) organizational trust (e.g., trust in government and travel agencies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Nunkoo et al., 2012)</ref>; 2) interpersonal trust (e.g., trust in residents and tour guides, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ouyang et al., 2017)</ref>; and 3) organizational and personal trusts <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Liu et al., 2019)</ref>. The majority of trust concepts central themes of attitudes, beliefs, intentions, and behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(McKnight and Chervany, 2001)</ref>, with broad convergence consider trust to be a reaction to uncertainty engrossing the willingness of a trustor's beliefs to bear vulnerability about the positive expectations on the perceived benevolence, competence, and integrity of the trustee <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Rousseau et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Williams and Baláž, 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rousseau et al. (1998)</ref> differentiate trust among psychology (as internal cognition), economics (as economics cost of risk), and sociology (as embeds socially). Having this typology of trust, this study deliberates how situational factors (protests, chaos, or hazards) manifest trust in the tourism ground.</p><p>Tourist behaviour is diverse due to its intangibility, inseparability, and heterogeneity. Therefore, it makes more sense to use a multidimensional tourist trust scale, considering diverse stakeholders in the tourism destination <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Wang et al., 2014)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">McCole (2002)</ref>, trust dimensions include availability, competence, consistency, promise, discreteness, fulfilment, fairness, loyalty, integrity, and openness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Liu et al. (2019)</ref> develop a more comprehensive sixdimensional tourism destination trust scale with 22-measurement items, encompassing trust in a scenic spot, destination agency, destination residents, destination employees, administration, and other tourists at the destination. In this study, we adopt a comprehensive and multidimensional scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Liu et al. (2019)</ref> to measure tourist trust in a tourism destination because this sixdimensional scale of tourist trust embracing all stakeholders, such as residential, organizational, institutional, staff, and consumer levels. Moreover, this scale has been validated by both qualitative analysis and quantitative testing. The six dimensions of trust in relation to protests are justified as follows.</p><p>Scenic spot covers from travel destinations offer, the quality of landscaping, environment, and attractions to sound traffic management, convenient, adequate facilities, safety issues, and a transparent and customized pricing policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Liu et al., 2019)</ref>. Trust in a scenic spot underlines tourists' perception of the target scenic location. This measurement is a relevant premise for predicting tourists' attitudes and behavioural intentions.</p><p>Trust in the administration measures the competency of the local government or authority in providing operative policies that help the public <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Wong et al., 2011)</ref>. Trust dimension in administration exposes the benefits tourists perceive from sound effectual government policies, such as traffic congestion, the cleanliness of the public areas, the public trust in the government, competency of the government, effective security management, and sound organization for its employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Liu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Nunkoo et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Trust in agency dimension features the ability of destination's travel agency or service providers meeting the needs of tourists, which include the accuracy of the advertisements, reasonable pricing, or trustworthy quality of goods and services, clear and precise tourist transactional items, value for money customized travel package, and reliable service offerings by the destination's agency <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Oh, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Trust in employees dimension embodies tourists' pronouncement of what wage-earners say and do during their interaction with the workers. Solo tourists always seek help from the people in the destination, and they are mostly employees. From the social psychology perspectives, tourists gain trust in the destination employees who reveal good virtues and good characteristics, including reliability, honesty, integrity, friendliness, helpfulness, knowledgeability, proficient language skills, courtesy, appearance, and professionalism to tourists <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Moorman et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Poon and Low, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Trust in other tourists dimension at the destination shows tourists' views of the attitudes and behaviours of other tourists they encounter in the travel path. Tourists may have interactions with other tourists during a trip/tour, in which they build trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Rosen et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The aspect of trust in residents portrays tourists' insight into the host's communication quality. The observation towards the residents envisages a general destination image <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Artigas et al., 2017)</ref>. Honesty, reliability, hospitality, and rapport are the significant components for tourist trust in destination residents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trust and revisit intention</head><p>Trust levels can affect repurchase intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chiu et al., 2012)</ref>. Trust can be associated with a significant relationship with revisit intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abubakar et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Arici and Gucer, 2018)</ref>, repurchase intention in the airline industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Saleem et al., 2017)</ref> or revisit in the context of medical tourism if tourists trust the healthcare formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Han and Hyun, 2015)</ref>. Previous studies have probed reasons for the antecedents of revisit intention. Among the antecedents of repeat visitation, are, but not limited to (1) importance of earlier visit purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Rittichainuwat et al., 2008)</ref>, (2) satisfaction effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Alegre and Cladera, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Petrick et al., 2001)</ref>, (3) value for money <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Um et al., 2006)</ref>, (4) cultural difference, (5) perceived quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chen and Gursoy, 2001)</ref>, and (6) destination image <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bigne et al., 2001)</ref>. Tourists are prone to visit places that they deem trustworthy and dependable <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ekinci and Hosany, 2006)</ref>. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed.</p><p>H1: Trust in a) scenic spot, b) administration, c) destination agency, d) destination employees, e) other destination tourists, and f) destination residents has a significant positive and direct effect on revisit intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attitudes and revisit intention</head><p>Behavioural intention is associated with attitudes. This study emphasises revisit intention in the context of HK protest hazard. One of the major risks for visitors is political issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Giusti and Raya, 2019)</ref> such as protests or demonstrations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Addo et al. (2020)</ref> attest that human behaviour regularly changes based on perceived risk. Perception of risk significantly impacts tourists' revisiting intention (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fuchs and Reichel, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Li et al., 2018)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Steimer (2002)</ref>, tourists may express adaptive behaviours and avoid the source of risk. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Souiden et al. (2017)</ref> measure attitudes using three items, namely whether the visitors like the destination, whether he/she has a favourable opinion of the destination despite the hazard incident, and whether visiting a specific destination is a wise decision. Some studies find no significant association between attitudes-behavioural intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lam and Hsu, 2006)</ref>, while others find connections between attitudes-intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Yoon and Uysal, 2005)</ref>. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed: H2: Attitudes towards a destination has a positive and significant direct effect on revisit intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The mediating role of attitudes</head><p>Trust affects attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Wu and Chen, 2005</ref>) and tourists' attitudes steer a significant influence on visitation intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Huang et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Mansfeld, 1992)</ref>. Studies observe that attitudes have mediating effects on the association between trust and behavioural intention in different contexts. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Zainal et al. (2017)</ref> show that attitudes towards electronic word-of-mouth (e-WOM) mediate the relationship between trust and intention in e-WOM. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Agag and El-Masry (2016)</ref> observe that tourist intention to acquire travel online is first influenced by attitudes and that attitudes are influenced by trust. Attitudes mediate between trust and intention to adopt social networking platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Naqvi et al., 2020)</ref>. Environmental concern is an influential predictor of tourists' attitudes and behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Wurzinger and Johansson, 2006)</ref>. Attitudes influence revisit intention and concomitantly impacts by trust. Attitudes affect revisit intention, and it plays a mediating role between trust (as an exogenous variable) and revisits intention (as an endogenous variable). We argue that trust may have both direct and indirect effects (via attitudes) towards revisit intention. Trust might not directly lead to revisiting intention to HK, it may first influence people's attitudes towards HK, which subsequently affect their tendency to revisit HK in the future. Hence, we propose the following hypothesis in our context as follows:</p><p>H3: Trust in a) scenic spot, b) administration, c) destination agency, d) destination employees, e) other destination tourists, and f) destination residents has a significant direct positive influence on attitudes. H4: Attitudes mediates the relationship between trust in a) scenic spot, b) administration, c) destination agency, d) destination employees, e) other destination tourists, and f) destination residents and revisit intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptual framework</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> depicts the research model that shows direct and indirect links between the latent constructs as discussed in the literature review. Hypotheses 1 (H1a-H1f) suggest that the trust dimensions have a positive influence on revisit intention. Hypotheses 2 (H2a-H2f) suggest that attitudes influence revisit intention, while Hypotheses 3 (H3a-H3f) suggest that attitudes have a positive influence on revisit intention. Hypotheses 4 (H4a-H4f) test whether attitudes are a mediator to connect tourists' trust and revisit intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples and a brief profile of respondents</head><p>This study used a survey approach to understand the influence of tourist trust on tourists' intention to revisit HK after the protest incident. Two screening questions were included in the questionnaires to identify the right target. First, they must have visited HK at least once in the past years before a series of protests to have the necessary knowledge to evaluate statements asked regarding HK in the questionnaire. Second, they must have heard of the protest incident that happened in HK. Data collection took place in a private university in Malaysia from 7 October 2019 to 21 November 2019. We stopped the data collection up to that point because the Coronavirus outbreak can indirectly hinder tourists' intention to revisit HK, a situation that we want to avoid. A total of 176 usable data were collected. The samples comprised of 17 (9.7%) Malays, 128 (72.7%) Chinese, 11 (6.3%) Indians, and 18 (10.2%) others. 89.2% of the respondents were aged between 18 and 25.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>We measured tourist trust using the scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Liu et al. (2019)</ref>. It is a multidimensional construct with six dimensions, namely trust in i) scenic spot (four items), ii) administration (three items), iii) destination agency (four items), iv) destination employees (three items), v) destination residents (four items), and vi) other destination tourists (four items). The scale was modified to suit the context of HK. The latent construct measurement model was conceptualized as a reflective-formative construct so that we can test the overall impact of tourist trust on revisit intention through attitudes. A three-item scale by Souiden et al. ( <ref type="formula">2017</ref>) was employed to measure attitudes towards revisiting HK. An example item includes 'Visiting Hong Kong is a good decision'. To measure intention, we used a seven-item scale proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Souiden et al. (2017)</ref>. An example item includes 'I will avoid visiting Hong Kong in the very near future'. All scaled items were developed using a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from totally disagree (unfavourable) to totally agree (extremely favourable).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>This study employed partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) to validate the research model. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hair et al. (2017)</ref>, PLS-SEM has several advantages over co-variance-based structural equation modelling. First, it is suitable for studies focusing on theory development rather than theory confirmation. This study is not a theory confirmation research but we attempt to explore how tourist trust influences intention to visit HK after the protest incident. Second. PLS-SEM is relatively flexible on data assumptions. Third, PLS-SEM performs well on small sample data. Lastly, PLS-SEM provides latent variable scores which can be very useful for subsequent analysis. We used the twostage approach to model tourist trust as a reflective-formative construct using the latent variable scores of the lower-order construct dimensions as formative indicators for the higher-order construct. This study followed the two-stage analytical approach to verify the model. First, the measurement model was evaluated, followed by the structural model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Common method variance</head><p>Given that our data were collected from the same respondents using a survey method, we conducted Harman's one-factor test and a full-collinearity test to overcome the issue of common method bias (CMB). We conducted Harman's one-factor test by inserting all measurement items into the exploratory factor analysis and the results showed a variance of 34.916% from the first factor, which is less than 50% <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>. Furthermore, a full-collinearity test was performed by creating a model where all latent variables pointing at the dummy variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kock, 2015)</ref>. None of the VIF values was greater than 3.3. Based on the evidence above, we can conclude that the data is free from CMB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement model</head><p>In this study, internal consistency was ascertained as the values of Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability for all the constructs were above 0.7 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Furthermore, convergent validity was examined by checking the factor loadings and average variance extracted (AVE). To achieve convergent validity, factor loadings should be above 0.7. However, items with factor loadings between 0.4 and 0.7 can be retained subject to their respective construct's AVE was greater than 0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hair et al., 2017)</ref>. One item (BI3) was deleted due to having a negative factor loading. Overall, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows that convergent validity was not an issue of concern. Discriminant validity was another measurement model assessment criterion to ensure distinctiveness between constructs in a given model. Following <ref type="bibr">Hair et al.'s (2017)</ref> recommendations, we assessed discriminant validity using the Fornell and Larcker criterion and HTMT criterion. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows that the square root of AVE of each construct (diagonal) was larger than the correlation estimate of other constructs (offdiagonal), suggesting discriminant validity was not a problem. With regard to the HTMT criterion, the HTMT ratio should be lower than 0.9 between two reflectively measured constructs. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, all the HTMT values were lower than 0.9. Furthermore, the standardized root means square residual (SRMR) value of the model was 0.064, indicating the data fit the model well <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Henseler et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural model</head><p>A bootstrapping analysis procedure with a resample rate of 5000 was performed to obtain p-values, t-values, and bootstrapped confidence intervals. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, trust in administration, destination agency, destination residents, and destination employees, surprisingly, were found to have no significant impact on revisit intention. Although trust in other destination tourists was significant to revisit intention, the effect was negative, contradicting with our proposed positive relationship. Hence, H1a to H1f were not supported. Furthermore, attitudes were found to have a significant effect on intention, supporting H2. Support was found for H3b, H3d and H3e as trust in administration, destination employees, and other destination tourists were found to have a significant positive influence on attitudes. However, H3a and H3f were not supported indicating trust in scenic spot and destination residents were not important to attitudes. Lastly, trust in destination agency was found to have a negative impact on attitudes as opposed to the proposed positive direction, thus H3C was not supported. The mediating effects of attitudes on the relationship between various dimensions of trust and revisit intention were tested by checking the confidence interval values <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Nitzl et al., 2016)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> shows that only H4d was supported because confidence intervals did not contain a value of zero. However, H4a, H4b, H4c, H4e, and H4f were all not supported. The results indicated that attitudes only mediate the relationship between trust in destination employees and revisit intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-hoc assessment</head><p>We also conducted a post-hoc analysis to better understand whether trust as a whole plays a role in influencing revisit intention via attitudes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). We first saved the latent variables scores of the six lower-order construct dimensions of tourist trust. Next, those latent variables scores formed the formative indicators of the higher-order construct of tourist trust. Hence, it is required to   evaluate the construct based on the formative measurement model assessment. First, we checked whether tourist trust violated the multicollinearity issue by checking the variance inflated factor (VIF) values. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>, all the VIF values were lower than 5, suggesting no issue of collinearity. Next, we assessed the significance and relevance of the formative indicators. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> shows that only trust in destination employees is a significant formative indicator of tourist trust. Although other formative indicators were not significant, their outer loadings were above 0.5, meaning their relative contribution to the construct might be less significant but their absolute contribution is still substantial. As for attitudes and intention, they have no issues with reliability and convergent validity. The model has no discriminant validity issue too based on the Fornell and Larcker criterion and HTMT criterion.</p><p>Similarly, a bootstrapping procedure (5000 resamples) was conducted to test the significance of path coefficients. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">7</ref>, trust did not have a significant direct effect on intention (b ¼ 0.056, p &gt; 0.05), but the relationship was mediated by attitudes (indirect effect ¼ 0.479, p &lt; 0.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictive power</head><p>PLS-SEM is superior when it comes to prediction. A model's predictive capability should be tested based on its in-sample prediction and out-ofsample prediction. The in-sample prediction uses the model estimate to predict observations from adjusted values were 0.412 and 0.608 for attitudes and intention respectively for the full model, and 0.416 and 0.600 for attitudes and intention respectively for the post-hoc model. Furthermore, for out-of-sample prediction, we conducted a blindfolding procedure to obtain the Q 2 values for both models. The results showed that Q 2 values for both models were greater than 0, indicating predictive relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Geisser, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Stone, 1974)</ref>.</p><p>Besides, this study also reported Q 2 predict, a measure developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Shmueli et al. (2016)</ref> to compare the prediction errors of the PLS-path model against simple mean predictions. The Q 2 predict values were 0.304 and 0.088 for attitudes and intention respectively for the full model, and 0.315 and 0.104 for attitudes and intention respectively for the post-hoc model, indicating both PLS-path models provided better predictive performance with lower prediction errors against simple mean predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and discussion</head><p>This study aims to assess the role of trust in influencing tourists' revisit intention to HK in the aftermath of a series of protest incidents, and examine the mediating roles of attitudes between tourist trust and revisits intention decision. Overall, the empirical results support that tourist trust has a direct effect on attitudes towards a destination and indirect effects to revisit intention. The effect of tourist trust on revisit intention is mediated by tourists' attitudes. We underline the worth of integrating future development of operative positioning stratagems for building trust and image restoration in hazard destinations. This study emphasizes the importance of managing tourism fear by postulating promotion via segmentation of the travel market. Without knowing the type of specific trust to a tourist destination, conventional strategies for boosting of revisiting intention may be less convincing in persuading tourists to revisit hazardous destinations. From this research, theoretical and managerial implications can be derived. Out of the six dimensions of trust to attitudes, only three trust dimensions (i.e., administration, destination employees, and other destination tourists) are significant and have a direct effect in influencing the attitudes. Therefore, in the context of protests, our results do not show that trust crises within a destination travel agency spoil trust (e.g., mismatch of service quality as advertised, <ref type="bibr">Lien et al., 2015, unfair</ref> pricing for services, and fraud transactions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Oh, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Attitudes have a positive impact on revisit intention in the context of protests. Results reveal the fact that the ongoing state of geopolitical uncertainty or social unrest in HK forms a sense of fear within tourists, which could subside their eagerness to revisit HK.</p><p>It is noteworthy that trust has no significant direct effect on revisit intention in the context of protests. This result contradicts with <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abubakar and Ilkan (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Abubakar et al. (2017)</ref> who exhibit that trust has a positive impact on revisit intention. However, our results show a mediating role of attitudes between trust in destination employees and revisit intention. From the six dimensions of trust to revisit intention, attitudes only mediate the relationship between trust in destination employees on revisit intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial implications</head><p>This study has several important practical contributions to comprehend how tourists make visiting decision associated with a protest. First, the HK economy has direct negative social externalities of the touristic phenomenon following protests. When tourists judge there is an odds of uncovering the unsafe situation due to protest incidents, their risk perception is alerted, which in turn worsens perceived uncertainty. Therefore, tourism authorities should focus on ensuring that the dimensions of trust (i.e. administration and employees) are well-deployed, commit to safeguarding tourists' safety to easing their perceived uncertainty is of utmost priority to encourage tourist flows. Even if crises or incidents happen, well-managed action plan potency builds a favourable impression and reinforces trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Yang et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Translating this into practices, communication strategies should specify the measures taken transparently by HK authorities to reinforce HK is safe to enhance tourists' trust in the context of a demonstration. It is also important to consistently communicate updated messages of the safety measures to the world and make known to the tourists, through the media. This effort could eventually improve HK's safety image, minimize the negative perception of safety issues, and enhance individuals' perceived trust towards revisiting HK.</p><p>Coordination effort among tourism administration (i.e., the authority) and employees is needed to develop a more sensible campaign in promoting HK for enhancing destination positioning, particularly in the aftermath of protest periods. For example, positioning Kowloon and Hong Kong Island, and/or avoid Central areas during the weekend. A segmentation approach in formulating the right communication strategies could be employed to managing travel fear by providing safety specific knowledge in the HK travel market for each city based on their scenic site (Golden Bauhinia Square), kid tions (HK Disneyland, Ocean Park), culture and heritage attraction (Lantau Island -The Big Buddha architecture), arts and performance (7 Mallory Street, HK Film Archive), business and investment (International Finance Centre, Exchange Square, The Center), nightlife (Lan Kwai Fong), events or festivals (horse racing, food expo), luxury shopping, and counterfeit products shopping (The Ladies Market, Temple Street Market, Stanley Market).</p><p>The findings prove the mediation role of attitudes that positively affected the connection between trust in destination employees and revisit intention. Consequently, the positive dimension of trust in the destination employees on attitudes underscores the destination employees operating the business in HK should heed to promotion strategies, accommodate the needs and wants of the tourists, and sincerely deliver high-quality service to enhance tourist trust, while simultaneously ensure efficient deployment of safety requirements to regain numbers on international tourist arrival.</p><p>The results suggest that trust in other destination tourists has an influential impact on attitudes. Mainland China is Hong Kong's most prominent source market, which accounted for 77% of arrivals in 2019. 1 As the HK tourism industry applauded the record growth, the growing presence of Chinese tourists has engendered more complaints among Hongkongers on mainland Chinese tourist behaviour because their lives have been intensely disrupted by them since the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge opened in October 2019. Such social externalities include some common uncivilized behaviours, such as spitting, public urination, queue-jumping, and talking loud in public places when travelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Johnson et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Sheng, 2016)</ref>, which are related to sustainable de-growth as a path to societal well-being <ref type="bibr">(Martinez-Alier et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Sharpley, 2020)</ref>. These are the signs of the appearance of domestic anti-tourism sentiment. We could not change human behaviours, but we can alter the environment around us. The Chinese economy has a lower Gross Domestic Product growth this year. Chinese luxury shoppers may return their lavish spending sprees of the past or may stay away from HK after the resumption of the city's anti-government protests. Tourism as a fundamentally economic sector in HK is justified within the economic growth paradigm. The authorities should focus on the development of sustainable tourism. Retail-related businesses might need to change their approach to survive, such as showcase home-grown designers and Hong Kong Tourism Board may establish a recovery task force and launch campaign creates unique events available only in HK to entice tourists back to HK.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical implications</head><p>This study attempts to contribute to the existing tourism literature by illustrating to the existing knowledge to understand tourists' revisit intention in a country with protest (or social unrest) that has caused cataclysm in society. This study is the first attempt to investigate the extent to which attitudes mediate between trust and revisit intention of visitors in the hitherto protests context.</p><p>We propose and test a comprehensive determinant model of revisit intention supported by two theories, namely prospect theory and information integration theory. This study harnesses the concept of information integration theory to illuminate a novel behavioural pattern among tourists to revisit a country with prolonged series of protests. This theory posits that whether or not a tourist decides to revisit HK is ascertained by the content and amount of information received. In particular, this study indicates a 'new trend of tourism behaviour, which satisfies tourists' remain desire to travel even in the aftermath of protests while keeping the risks to the minimal. Second, this study uses prospect theory not only to confirm the mediating role of attitudes between trust and revisit intention in the hypothesized structural relationships, but also to provide insights on tourist behaviours during protests, chaos, or hazards in the future. We test the conditions of attitudes on the determinant model of revisit intention using the mediator analysis. Once more, we found that the effects of the determinants of revisit intention varied with different trust factors on attitudes. These findings provide fresh insight into the influence of attitudes on tourists' decisions to revisit a destination with high geopolitical risk such as protests. The insights obtain form this study postulates tourist avoidance mechanism in a time of HK protest and develops resurgence strategies to cope with the impact of chaos and hazards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitation and future research directions</head><p>This study has some limitations. While this study shed some light on an integrative approach to grasp tourist trust and revisit intension, the usable sample size of 176 repeat tourists may not demonstrate the views of the total number of tourists revisit HK. The fact that the data were collected over a short period due to the occurrence of COVID-19 is a limitation, since revisit intention may be influenced by unexpected events like this. The generalization of findings should be made with caution. Moreover, this study focuses on tourists who have already visited HK before a series of protests. Future research can explore the behavioural intention of first-time visitors, and /or perform a comparative analysis of both first-time and repeat tourists. Future research can build on a longitudinal basis with a larger sample size to improve the generalization results. Further research can investigate the mediating role of perceived risk in other countries with different cultures.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
