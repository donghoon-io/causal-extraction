<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Environmental pollution, increasing damages in the nature and deformation of ecosytem have started to worry consumers and the environemental concern has formed in time. Consumers who have environmental concern and wish to lend a healthy and clean environment to next generations, then started to consider the damages of their products to the nature in a higher degree. Thus, consumers with environmental concern have placed more importance to green products, which do not pollute the nature, use natural resources less, enable recycling, but are environmental friendly. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of environmental concern on green product purchase intention, and to also investigate the mediating role of environmental attitude on the mentioned impact. Research data were gathered from 410 individuals residing in İzmir city using the face-to-face questionnaire method. Then, the data were tested with Crobach Alpha Method, Test of Normality, Exploratory Factor Analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Structural Equation Modeling and Sobel test. Based on research findings, it is observed that environmental attitude has a mediating role on the impact of environmental concern on green product purchasing intention. It is also determined that, environmental concern has a meaningful impact on environmental attitude and green product purchasing intention, and environmental attitude has a meaningful impact on green product purchasing intention.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>One of the most important issues causing environmental problems is that; wishes, needs and consuption habits of humankind do differ every day with globalization. In time, the environmental problems have climbed and natural resources have decreased, which led these issues to have more coverage in the media. As a result, activities on this subject have raised awareness among consumers and enabled them to be more careful about the products they use. In other words, the sensitivity of consumers towards the environmental problems have increased and consumers are observed to use environmetal friendly products, which are sensitive to the nature through all product phases. As the environmental focus and concentration have increased step by step on consumption, the firms giving importance to this issue are now taking care of consumers by satisfying their demands and needs. So, the number of firms choosing the green path for the products they manufacture has increased by time.</p><p>Since the consumers now have environmental concern, the concepts such as green product, green consumer, green marketing and environmental attitude have become significant subjects that should be focused <ref type="bibr">(Kalafatis et al. 1999:441;</ref><ref type="bibr">Laroche et al. 2001: 515)</ref>. Green or environmental friendly products are the ones which do not pollute the nature, don't consume natural resources, that are re-cyclable and protectable <ref type="bibr">(Turhan et al. 2015)</ref>. Green consumers do reflect environmental concerns more to their purchases and consuptions, compared to other consumers. Additionally, green consumers are also interested in the production, shortage of consumed resources and post-usage processes of products <ref type="bibr">(Zinkhan ve Carlson, 1995:2)</ref>. Green marketing is a marketing approach, which can be applied to consuption products, industrial products and services. Green marketing also includes various activities such as making changes in production process, modifying the product, changing the packaging strategy and improving advertsing plans <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Alnıaçık, 2009)</ref>. Attitude is described as a positive or negative reaction tendency of an individual, when faced with a stimulant <ref type="bibr">(Oppenheim, 1992)</ref>. If an individual has a postive attitude towards an object, he will behave and act positively to that object. Also, this individual will have a tendency to get closer, support and assist the mentioned object. On the other hand, an individual which has a negative attitude towards a particular object, will have a tendency to be uninterested about that object. Also, this individual will have a tendency to get away, criticize or even damage the mentioned object <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Aydın, 2000)</ref>. By the way, environmental aittude is described as positive or negative feelings towards specific elements of the environment as well as aims concerned with the environment <ref type="bibr">(Hines et al. 1987: 4)</ref>. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of environmental concern on green product purchase intention, and to also investigate the mediating role of environmental attitude on the mentioned impact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Conceptual Framework of the Research and Hypotheses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Green Product</head><p>Green product is generally described as the environmetal friendly product. Also, green product is expressed as the product, which assists the recycling and termination of waste, protecting and enlarging the environment by limited use of energy resources <ref type="bibr">(Ottman et al. 2006)</ref>. Parallel to another description, the green product protects the environment and aims to recycle the resources of nature as well as eliminating cease of resources <ref type="bibr">(Shamdasani et al. 1993: 488)</ref>. Moreover, the green product is stated as products, which don't have any negative effect on the environment, eliminate air pollution and similar negativenesses by preserving energy and resources even in the business life <ref type="bibr">(Çabuk et al. 2008: 87)</ref>. The basic criteria in the green product are satisfaction of consumers' demands and needs, sustainability of energy resources, harmlessness of product towards the environment and human health as well as the renewability of product <ref type="bibr">(Uysal, 2006: 89-90)</ref>.</p><p>If the green product concept should be explained with the 4S formula in literature, we should state that these are environmental friendly products, which are able to (satisfy) the demands and needs of consumers, reflect (sustainability) for the continuity of resources, have (social acceptibility) in global context for not harming the environment and livings, and focus on (safety) in terms of consumer health <ref type="bibr">(Erbaslar, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>A product should have particular features, so that it can qualify as a green product. These features are indicated below: <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Moisander, 2007:</ref> Consumers in fact experience difficulties in differenting green products from the others. As a solution to this complexity in the mind of consumers, eco labels and stickers are now used which is equivalent to some kind of confirmation. Eco labels and stickers have easy to understand signs, which emphasize that a product's environmental impact is lower than that of other products in similar categories <ref type="bibr">(Morris, 1997: 11)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Page |6| Emerging Markets Journal</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Green Consumer</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Elkington (1994)</ref>, the green consumer avoids using products, which risk the health of consumers and others, have potential to significantly harm environment through production, usage and postusage, consume energy extensively, cause uncessary waste, endanger species and the environment, require unncessary usage, cause treating animals mercilessly and affect other countries negatively. Based on another definition, green consumer is the individual, who is interested in new products, runs research on information and shares his opinions with others concerning the products. Thus, green consumers are considered as opinion leaders and word-of-mouth advertisers (information providers). Also, green consumers are careful shoppers and they are not inclined to purchase without consideration. The green consumers give priority to the needs of environment and they run research about the products without any brand loyalty <ref type="bibr">(Shrum et al. 1995:80)</ref>.</p><p>Green consumers can affect the environment with their purchasing decisions. The consuming decisions of green consumers reflecting the social responsibility include specific components. These cover specific research, which can be listed as checking the manufacturers of purchased products, production operations and implementations, and the impact of raw materials on the environment through usage and post usage <ref type="bibr">(Karaca, 2013)</ref>. Green consumers present various consuming behaviors aimed at protecting the natural environment by using different methods such as purchasing green products, considering recycling and making savings on energy <ref type="bibr">(Paço et al. 2013)</ref>. Green consumers believe that, personal consumption is an effective method to protect the environment They also believe that, the environmental protection is a personal (individual) issue and it should not be solely left to the hands of government, environmentalists and scientists. Furthermore, green consumers are open minded and they are tolerant to new products as well as new ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Boztepe, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the research of IISD (International Institute for Sustainable Development), general characteristics of green consumers are as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Boztepe, 2012)</ref>: Exaggregating green behaviors, making environmental protection easy and being inclined to not trust the environmental arguements of corporations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Green Marketing</head><p>Today, green marketing is a set of activities, which include all environmetal and natural friendship efforts in order to match the demands and needs of consumers. It is aimed to harm the environment in a minimum degree while these demands and needs are matched. Green marketing is also called and known as a reaction towards the goods and services used for design, production, packaging and labelling <ref type="bibr">(Onurlubaş ve Dinçer, 2016: 26)</ref>.</p><p>The green marketing approach can be investigated under four different phases <ref type="bibr">(Erbaşlar, 2012: 96)</ref>;</p><p>In the first phase, green products are designed for environmentalist consumers. Ecocredential products and automobiles working with alternative fuel technology can be shown as examples at this point. We can name this first phase as the green targeting.</p><p>In the second phase, green strategies are developed. As an example, environmentalist measures such as increasing the energy efficiency and producing less waste within the business can be mentioned here.</p><p>In the third phase, the manufacturing of nongreen products, in other words non-environmental friendly products are halted and only green products are manufactured.</p><p>However, it is not enough to be green or environmentalist in the fourth phase. The firm has reached to the social responsibility awareness by all means here. When the organizations reach green marketing awareness, this is generally based on the organizational culture and environmental elements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental Concern</head><p>The most important purpose of the humankind through history has been searching for ways to find resources (food, clothes, shelter, energy and other materialistic needs) from various ecosystems, in other words from the environment, which will let him to sustain his life. Also, the humankind has benefited from the resources of the nature for thousands of years without any concern. These resources have been used extensively to satisfy basic needs and in some cases, generating profits. Despite that, the nature has always renewed itself in a great extent and presented its resources over and over for the humankind's welfare. The fact that this cycle continued for a very long time without any problem has caused an incorrect perception as if the natural resources were limitless <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Biner, 2014)</ref>. However the population increase, higher usage of natural resources, limited environmental richness and the emergence of environmental problems in time have created a concern among people in terms of a healthy life and landing a good environment to next generations.</p><p>The environmental concern is an indicator that, individuals are showing an effort for raising awareness in terms of environmental sensitivity <ref type="bibr">(Akehurst, 2012: 977)</ref>. The term environmental concern is used to state the concern of individuals about environmenral changes today or in the future <ref type="bibr">(Ay and Ecevit, 2005: 246)</ref>. The term environmental concern is used to state the concern of individuals about environmenral changes today or in the future. It is pointed out that, environmental concern is reflected to the behaviors of various consumers. Also, it is understood that environmental concern has an impact on product selection, informative research and behaviors concerned with receycling and diversity <ref type="bibr">(Minton ve Rose, 1997: 44)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ebru Onurlubaş</head><p>Emerging Markets Journal | P a g e |7</p><p>In the literature, there are many studies which have determined that environmental concern has a meaningful impact on green product purchasing intention. Some of these studies are <ref type="bibr">Kim and Choi (2005)</ref> H1: Environmental concern has a meaningful (significant) impact on environmental attitude. H2: Environmental concern has a meaningful (significanr) impact on purchase intention towards green products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental Attitude</head><p>Generally speaking, attitude is a preliminary tendency of reaction that a particular individual has towards any subject around his environment. Also, attitude is a regular act and behavior pattern of individuals towards specific objects as a result of former experiences. Individual patterns are formed as a result of an individual's upbringing and life-long experiences, which differentiates that particular person from others <ref type="bibr">(Akdemir, 2008: 83)</ref>. Attitude is an organized mental, emotional and behavioral preliminary tendency of reaction, which is developed based on experience, knowledge, emotion and motivation, and that is against the individual himself or against any object, social subject or incident around the individual <ref type="bibr">(İncelioğlu, 2010: 13)</ref>. In general terms, attitude is a positive or negative emotion that is developed towards an individual, object or situation. This is related with the belief that, it is formed by the knowledge of an individual about another individual, object or condition <ref type="bibr">(Newhouse, 1990)</ref>.</p><p>Environmental attitude is the sum of beliefs, emotions and environmental intentions of an individual about the environmental activities and issues <ref type="bibr">(Schultz et al. 2004: 31)</ref>, as well as the attitude and behavior patterns of an individual related with environmental feelings and thoughts. At this point, it will be wise to put forward that, if the individual will have a positive attitude towards the environmental, he will try to protect and recover it. However, if the individual will have a negative attitude towards the environment, he will be insensitive towards it, and in some cases may even have a tendency to harm it <ref type="bibr">(Sabuncu, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Kim (2011)</ref> pointed out that, consumers with high environmental attitude have an intention to buy products that are considered environmental friendly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Alwitt &amp; Pitts (1996)</ref> presented that, environmental attitude indirectly affects the purchase intention of environmental friendly products. <ref type="bibr">Kim &amp; Chung (2011: 43-44</ref>) did run a research on attitude of consumers towards organic personal care products. As a result of this research, it was found that, attitudes were a meaningful (significanr) variable affecting purchase intention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cowan &amp; Kinley (2014)</ref> stated that, there existed a strong relationship between postive attitudes towards environmental friendly textile products and the purchase intention. Yadav and Pathak (2016) reported that, the environmental attitude had direct effects on their intention to purchase green products. Based on mentioned findings, the hypothesis below is developed and presented; H3: Environmental attitude has a meaningful (significant) impact on purchase intention towards green products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Green Product Purchasing Intention</head><p>Attitude is in a key position concerning the relationship between intention and behavior. If we should interpret the intention concept from the perspective of consumer and client, it will not be wrong to state that the intention occurs somewhere between evaluating purchasing alternatives and the realization of purchase. Purchase intention is described as the perceptional opinion (belief) level of a client towards buying a specific product or service <ref type="bibr">(Bergeron, 2004: 117)</ref>. Also, purchase intention represents the planning and purchasing willingness of consumers to buy a specific product in the future <ref type="bibr">(Wu et.al.., 2011: 32)</ref>. Concerning the purchase intention, evaluations and attitudes of consumers related to products or services ae important. When the consumers believe that a particular product or service is worth to buy, they do purchase that specific product or service <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Madahi ve Sukati, 2012)</ref>. Evaluations on purchase intention do reflect the purchasing behaviors in the future <ref type="bibr">(Grewal et.al., 1998)</ref>. Purchase intention of consumers is considered to a subjective tendency for a specific product and it can also be an important index to estimate and foresee consumer behaviors <ref type="bibr">(Fishbein ve Ajzen, 1975)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Engel et. al. (1995)</ref> argue that, purchase intention can be categorized such as unplanned purchase, partially planned purchase and entirely planned purchase. Unplanned purchases are generally known as the purchases, which occur with a sudden emergence of stiumulation, not based on any plan. Partially planned purchases mean that, the consumer has made a decision only on a single product category or a specific object before buying a product, but he will make a decision on brands and types later in the store. Entirely planned purchases stand for a situation when the consumer has made a decision on a specific product and brand before visiting the store.</p><p>The fact that environmetal problems are taking a part in the media continuously and with an increasing pace have led to environental concern in individuals. Thus, consumers are observed to purchase green products while leaving non-green products on the shelf <ref type="bibr">(Davis, 1993)</ref>. In the recent years, the consciousness level of consumers is much higher and they are more inclined to purchase green products, which do not harm the environment or that harm the environment lower than other products. Green product purchasing intention of consumers determine their planning or purchasing will when buying a green product in the future. Green product purchasing intention is described as a consumer's plan to</p></div>

Thus, it is considered that this research may contribute to the literature and accordingly, the H4 hypothesis is presented below in this context.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">METHODOLOGY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Aim of the Study</head><p>The ever increasing population leads to the drain of natural resources and the drain of natural resources unconsciously causes natural devastation. Consumers who are aware of this fact and have environmental concern, have started to prefer recyclable products, which are environmentally sensitive that do not harm the nature in order to ensure the healthy life of themselves and future generations. The green product and green marketing have become more important as the environmental concern of consumers has increased in the recent years. Thus, some firms have developed marketing strategies accordingly and have concentrated on environmental activities for enabling their sustainability. Green product purchasing by cosumers who have environmental concern can let green products remain in the market and cause non-green products to decrease in numbers. This issue can help businesses to manufacture green products by focusing on environmental activities. Because of this fact, it is significant to investigate the environmental concern of consumers as well as factors directing consumers to improve their environmental attitude and green product purchasing intention. Thus, this study aims to investigate the mediating role of environmental attitude on the impact of environmental concern on green product purchasing intention. Moreover, this study aims to investigate the effect of environmental concern on environmental attitude and green product purchasing intention, as well as the impact of environmental attitude on green product purchasing intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Scope, Limitations and Sample of the Research</head><p>Research was limited with individuals who are living in the city of İzmir and are informed of green products. One of the non-random sampling methods, convenience sampling method was used for the face-toface questionnaires distributed to 410 individuals who were subject to this study. The most important limitation of the research is that, the study was only run in İzmir city center because of time and monetary scarcities. Based on the data of TÜİK (Turkish Statistical Institute), population of İzmir city was 4.279.677 in 2017 <ref type="bibr">(Tüik, 2018)</ref>. After the universe was determined, the following formula was used to detect the sample volme <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Arıkan, 2007)</ref>: z= statistical value (1.96, 95% confidence interval) Using the formula above, the sufficient sample size was determined as 410 with 0,0484% error rate and 95% confidence interval. One of the non-random sampling methods, convenience sampling method was used for the face-to-face questionnaires. By the help of convenience sampling method, data can be collected from the universe with the easist, fastest and most economic way possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aaker et. al., 2007)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">q p t N d q p t N n . . ) 1 .( . . .</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Data Collection</head><p>Research data were collected with face-to-face questionnaires. Questionnaires were distributed to consumers who are living in İzmir city and are informed of the green product. The questionnaire form was composed of two sections. The first section included 6 demographical items (questions). The second section included 6 items (questions) on environmental concern, 5 items (questions) on environmental attitude and 5 items (questions) on green product purchasing intention. Concerning the items (questions) on second section of research, studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Maichum et al. (2016)</ref>  <ref type="formula">2013</ref>); <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mark and Law, (2015)</ref> were taken as a reference for preparing the green product purchasing intention scale. The research also benefited from the 5 Likert scale for questionnaire. The coding for 5 Likert scale was as follows; (1) Definitely disagree, (2) Disagree, (3) Indecisive, (4) Agree, (5) Definitely agree. The researcher received feedback from two experts on the internal validity of scales and the scale items were translated to Turkish. Then, a pilot study was run on 40 respondents in order to eliminate future potential errors and determining the clarity of questions. It was detected that all items were completely understood and perceived by respondents, so the final version of questionnaire was prepared. Reliability of scales was tested by the Cronbach Alpha coefficient. According to Özdamar (1999), a Cronbach Alpha value of 0,80-0,90 is equivalent to high reliability and a Cronbach Alpha value of 0,90-1,00 is equivalent to very high reliability. As a result of the relaibility analysis, Cronbach Alpha value of environmental concern scale was determined as 0,820, so the reliability of environmental concern was high. Cronbach Alpha value of environmental attitude scale was 0,817, so the reliability of environmental attitude was high. Cronbach Alpha value of green product purchasing intention scale was 0,726, so the reliability of green product purchasing intention was normal. According to <ref type="bibr">Sipahi et. al. (2008:89)</ref>, Cronbach Alpha coefficient is accepted to be reliable when the value is 0,70 and above. In this context, all the scales of research are reliable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Data Analysis</head><p>Data analysis of the research were run by SPSS 22 and AMOS 20 software. The relaibility of scales was calculated via Cronbach Alpha. Also, normality test was run after the reliability test, to see if data had a normal distribution. In regards to normality test, kurtosis and skewness values of data groups were analzyed. It is accepted that data groups with kurtosis and skewness values between +2 and -2 have normal distribution <ref type="bibr">(George &amp; Mallery, 2003)</ref>. Environmental concern had a skewness of -0,063 and kurtosis of -0,359. Environmental attitude had a skewness of 0,205 and kurtosis of -0,373. Green product purchasing intention had a skewness of -0,36 and kurtosis of -0,264.</p><p>In this context, it can be accepted that all dimensions of the research have normal distribution. Exploratory factor analysis was run to test the construct validity of all scales used in the study. Also, confirmatory factor analysis was run to validiate the dimensions after running exploratory factor analysis. Researcher can define models defending an important feature, arrange factors and test the sutiability of data for models with confirmatory factor analysis <ref type="bibr">(Hoyle, 1995)</ref>. The research investigated the relationship among variables to analyze the mediating role (effect) of environmental attitude, and to study the impact of environmental concern on green product purchasing intention. Then, the interaction between variables was tested with structural equation modelling in order to analyze the interaction among variables. In this context, environmental concern was determined as indepedent variable, green product purchasing intention was determined as dependent variable and environmental attitude was determined as mediating variable. Environmental concern, environmental attitude and green product purchasing intention which are included in the theoretical model to be tested are known as theoretical structures, latent variables or factors, since their structures can not be tested directly and because they are considered to be existent theoretically in social sciences <ref type="bibr">(Byrne, 2010:4)</ref>. Although structural equation modelling is known as asimultaneous equation modelling with latent variables, its foundations are based on both factor analysis and path analysis. Also, structural equation modelling helps to retrieve findings which can not be presented with other popular techniques, since it can be used for direct, indirect and total impact estimations via mediating and moderator variables <ref type="bibr">(Kelly, 2011: 12)</ref>. Structural equation modelling was used in this study in order to determine the mediating role (effect) of environental attitude on the impact of environmental concern on green product purchasing intention. First, relationship among variables were investigated and second, interaction among variables were analyzed using structural equation modelling. Structural equation modelling was also used to test other hypotheses. Structural equation modelling is a detailed statistical approach used to test the causal interrelation among latent variables -factors. Structural equation modelling can also be described as a series of statistical methods, which present hypothesis test approach to the multivariable analysis of structural theory <ref type="bibr">(Timm, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tomer, 2003)</ref>.</p></div>

Environmental attitude had a skewness of 0,205 and kurtosis of -0,373.Green product purchasing intention had a skewness of -0,36 and kurtosis of -0,264. It is accepted that data groups with kurtosis and skewness values between +2 and -2 have normal distribution <ref type="bibr">(George &amp; Mallery, 2003)</ref>. In this context, it can be accepted that all dimensions of the research have normal distribution. Also, Kaiser Meyer Olkin and Bartlett test results were considered to decide whether factor analysis results are interpretable. For the construct validity study, following results were retrieved: Kaiser Meyer Olkin=0,820 and Bartlett (p&lt;0,01) for environmental concern scale, Kaiser Meyer Olkin=0,817 and Bartlett (p&lt;0,01) for environmental attitude scale, Kaiser Meyer Olkin=0,726 and Bartlett (p&lt;0,01) for green product purchasing intention. It was revealed that, exploratory factor analysis could be run with these test analysis results. Test method by rotation was not used for the research's factor analysis. The reason is that, when all scales are assessed and tested via factor analysis separately, they can be listed under one single dimension (scale).</p><p>When the demographics of questionnaire respondents are analyzed, it is observed that 49,0% are males, and 51,0% are females.

Exploratory Factor Analysis Results</head><p>When Table <ref type="table">2</ref> is considered, it is observed that environmental concern dimension is composed of 6 items (questions) and factor loads vary between 0,526 and 0,852. Environmental concern dimension explains 54,447% of the variance. Environmental attitude dimension is composed of 5 items (questions) and factor loads vary between 0,788 and 0,842. Environmental attitude dimension explains 67,285% of the variance. Green product purchasing intention dimension is composed of 5 items (questions) and factor loads vary between 0,477 and 0,822. Green product purchasing intention dimension explains 50,443% of the variance. In practice, generally a value of 0,45 and above is Ebru Onurlubaş Emerging Markets Journal | P a g e |11 considered to be a good rate for factor load coefficients, which explain the relationship between items (questions) and the related factors <ref type="bibr">(Büyüköztürk, 2002: 118)</ref>. In this context, since factor loads of all dimensios were above 0,45, none of them were removed from the scale. Confirmatory factor analysis is presented in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Confirmatory factor analysis is a more advanced and detailed technique, which is used to test the latent variables and related theories <ref type="bibr">(Tabachnick and Fidell, 2014)</ref>.

The retrieved adaptive values for environmental concern scale are calculated as follows as a result of the confirmatory factor analysis; CMINDF: 6,860, GFI: 0,952, CFI: 0,942, RMSEA: 0,120, NFI: 0,933, RMR: 0,61. The values are CMINDF:20,306, GFI: 0,909, CFI: 0,910, RMSEA: 0,217, NFI: 0,906, RMR: 0,60 for the environmental attitude scale and they are CMINDF: 9,439, GFI: 0,957 , CFI: 0,909, RMSEA: 0,144 , NFI: 0,900, RMR: 0,55 for the purchasing intention scale. These values do not stand for good or acceptable adaptive volumes. Thus, items (questions) with low beta values were removed from the model and covariance relationship was established to ensure adaptive values of the model. Covariance relationship was established between e1-e5 error terms for the environmental concern scale and Q8.3 item (question) was removed. After the final version of the model, confirmatory factor analysis was run and the good adaptive values of scale was analyzed. The moderated adaptive values of environmental concern scale was calculated as CMINDF: 1,358, GFI: 0,997, CFI: 0,999, RMSEA: 0,030, NFI: 0,997 and RMR: 0,015. As observed in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, all adaptive values indicate a "good adaptation". Model is acceptable at its current condition. Covariance relationship was estabished between "e1-e5", "e5-e3" and "e5-e4" error terms and no items (questions) were removed for the environmental attitude scale. Moderated adaptive values of the environmental attitude scale was calculated as CMINDF: 2,882, GFI: 0,995, CFI: 0,996, RMSEA: 0,068, NFI: 0,995 and RMR: 0,017. As seen in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, RMSEA indicates an acceptable adaptation, while all other adaptive values indicate a "good adaptation". Model is acceptable at its current condition. Covariance relationship was estabished between "e3-e5" and "e5-e4" error terms and no items (questions) were removed for green product purchasing intention scale. Moderated adaptive values of the green product purchasing intention was calculated as CMINDF: 2,997, GFI: 0,991, CFI: 0,987, RMSEA: 0,070, NFI: 0,981 and RMR: 0,022. Based on Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, RMSEA indicates an acceptable adaptation, while all other adaptive values indicate a "good adaptation". When Table <ref type="table">3</ref> above is taken into consideration, results of the moderated confirmatory factor analysis adaptive scale values (CMINDF, RMSEA, GFI, CFI, RMR, NFI) show that, model is in line with data and there exists a valid and reliable scale.</p></div>

The mediating role of environmental attitude on the impact of environmental concern on green product purchasing intention is evaluated with the Sobel test. The mentioned test is calculated via using the moderated regression coefficients and standard deviation values of related variables. Based on the Sobel test results (Z=2,277, p&lt;0,05), the mediating role of environmental concern's impact on green product puchasing intention is meaningful (significant).
