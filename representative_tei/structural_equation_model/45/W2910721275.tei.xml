<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Samosir is one of the largest lake in the world, and the largest and most popular in Indonesia. Samosir is located in North Sumatra area which is one of the valuable assets in the State/Local Government and is one of the important tourist destination after Bali and Lombok, so it is a pride for the region. The establishment of Samosir as one of the tourist destination, because the assumption of beautiful natural panorama <ref type="bibr">(Sianturi, 2004)</ref>. However, Samosir tourism activities are currently not experiencing developments, as seen from a decrease in the number of visitors so that tourism facilities are starting to be neglected <ref type="bibr">(Buaton and Purwadio, 2015)</ref>. In Samosir tourism area, there are not only Samosir tourism object but also 4 other tourism objects, namely Batu Gantung, Kera Huta Sibatu Loting Tourism Park, Bangun Dolok and camping ground and Dolok Simarbalatuk. These objects are in fact if developed properly can provide more value in Parapat tourism area, but the current conditions of these objects are almost unknown to the public <ref type="bibr">(Buaton and Purwadio, 2015)</ref>. To manage the tourism industry properly and professionally, an in-depth study is needed including tourists as the source of income that must be served well to keep them happy and comfortable so that the residence time within the tours area will be longer. The tourism industry is a type of product which is mostly engaged in the service, for all aspects related to the economic orientation are services <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hidayat, 2010)</ref>. The dynamics that occur in the tourism services sector can be seen from the development of various industries such as banking, insurance, telecommunications and others.</p><p>Marketing services intended to build expectations of tourists and make a promise to the tourist <ref type="bibr">(Daryanto, 2013)</ref>. The company strives to meet the expectations and promises to tourists so that tourists are satisfied. Consumer satisfaction is the level of one's feelings after comparing performance (results) that perceived with the expectation <ref type="bibr">(Daryanto, 2013)</ref>. Tourists experiencing various levels of satisfaction or dissatisfaction after experiencing each services in accordance with the extent to consumer expectations are met or exceeded. This is because satisfaction is the emotional state, the post-purchase reaction of tourists can be anger, dissatisfaction, irritation, neutrality, joy, or pleasure. Tourists who are angry or dissatisfied would cause problems because they can be moved to another company and spread the negative word of mouth <ref type="bibr">(Lovelock and Wright, 2007)</ref>. Many factors can affect tourist loyalty, including the marketing mix and service quality. It is supported by some research results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Azhar &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Jufrizen (2017), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gultom (2017)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Setiawan and Sayuti (2017)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Tefera &amp; Govender (2017)</ref> stating that the service quality and marketing mix has a positive and significant effect on tourist loyalty. This study was made aiming to replicate the study, because of the marketing mix and service quality effect on tourist loyalty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature review</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Loyalty</head><p>Loyalty is the willingness of tourists to continue the purchase on a company in a long period of time and use the product or service repeatedly, as well as recommend it to friends and other companies in voluntary <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Oliver, 2002)</ref>. While according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Griffin (2005)</ref> consumer loyalty is a concept of loyalty that leads more to behavior than attitude and a loyal consumer will show a purchase behavior which is defined as a regular purchaser and shown over times by some decision-making units. Loyalty is important concept in marketing because loyalty is one of the factors to be able to determine the market share of a company. Consumer loyalty is a behavioral drive to make purchases repeatedly and to build consumer loyalty to a product/service that is produced by a company that takes a long time through a repetitive purchasing process <ref type="bibr">(Olson, 1993)</ref>. Loyalty does not only mean the existence of consumer wishes to buy back the same brand in later time, but also the consumer has a psychological commitment or attitude towards the brand. And the loyal tourists are not only buying the brand but also refused to switch to other brands even though other brands offer something more than the brands they use <ref type="bibr">(Wells et al. 2003)</ref>. Loyal Consumers are not sensitive to price, deliver a positive recommendation regarding the brand and willing to spend more money on these brandproducing company <ref type="bibr">(Uncles, et.al, 2003)</ref>. Loyalty can also refer to the preference of tourists to purchase a particular brand of a product category. This occurs because tourists feel that a brand is able to offer the product features, product image or product quality level which matches to the price. Basically, the first-time tourists will experiment in the purchase of a product, after they try the product and feel satisfied, they will make it a habit and will continue to purchase the same product because they feel the product is more secure and known <ref type="bibr">(Giddens, 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Johnson and Fornell (1991)</ref> stated that consumer satisfaction is the result of a thorough evaluation of the top performing consumer products which they consume. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yi (1991)</ref> identified two different concepts of customer satisfaction, namely transaction-specific satisfaction and overall satisfaction. Transaction-specific satisfaction is a concept that refers to the assessment of customer satisfaction after purchasing products or brands. While overall satisfaction is a concept that measures the satisfaction (dissatisfaction) of tourists towards products or brands as a whole based on the entire experience in consuming these products or brands. Thus, overall satisfaction could be viewed as a function of all transaction-specific satisfaction that occurred before. In this study, the concept of customer satisfaction that used is overall customer satisfaction. By knowing the measurement results in consumer satisfaction, the company can prepare strategies that will be implemented in order to create consumer loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hadiyati, 2012)</ref>. Consumer satisfaction according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kotler and Armstrong (2009)</ref> is the level of consumer feelings after comparing performance (or results) that the consumer perceive than their expectations. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hasan (2009)</ref> consumer satisfaction is a feeling of consumer in good response of products or services that has been consumed. In general satisfaction can be defined as a comparison between results received or services in consumer expectations, results received or services at least must be equal with consumer expectations, or even beyond it. <ref type="bibr">Kotler (2009)</ref> revealed that satisfaction is as feelings of like or dislike someone for a product after he/she compared a product performance with his/her expectations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Simamora (2008)</ref> argues that customer satisfaction is the result of experience in the product. This is a consumer feeling after compare between expectations (prepurchase expectation) and actual performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consumer Satisfaction</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Marketing Mix</head><p>Marketing mix is the set of controlled tactical marketing tools (products, prices, places and promotions) that combined company to produce the desired response in the target markets <ref type="bibr">(Kotler and Armstrong, 2008)</ref>. Daryanto ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>), the marketing mix is the tactical marketing tools that can controlled and combined by the company to produce the desired response in the target markets. Marketing mix is the variables to be monitored by the company to satisfy the groups targeted <ref type="bibr">(Cannon, et al, 2008)</ref>. Marketing mix consists of a product, is offered at a certain price, with some kind of promotion to tell prospective tourists about these products, and a way to reach consumer's place <ref type="bibr">(Cannon, et al, 2001)</ref>. Marketing mix consists of all the things that a company can do to influence the demand for its products <ref type="bibr">(Kotler and Armstrong, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Effective marketing program combines all the elements of the marketing mix into an integrated marketing program designed to achieve the company's marketing goals by delivering value for tourists. Marketing mix is the company's tactical advice to determine a strong positioning in the target markets <ref type="bibr">(Kotler and Armstrong, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Service Quality</head><p>Service quality is the evaluation of tourists' long-term observations in the service delivery of a company <ref type="bibr">(Lovelock and Wright, 2007)</ref>. The definition of service quality is the magnitude of the difference between expectations or desires of tourists with their level perception <ref type="bibr">(Like,2008)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Kotler and Keller (2009)</ref> how far the difference between reality and consumer expectations for services received/retrieved. While the Yamit (2010) stated that in general, service quality can be seen from the comparison between consumer expectations and service performances. The best service to customers and the level of quality can be achieved consistently by improving services and paying special attention to good service standard performance both in internal service standard or external service standard. Before the consumer buys a service, tourists have expectations about the service quality that is based on personal needs, experiences, word of mouth recommendations, and ad service providers. After buying and using these services, tourists compare the expected quality with what is truly received <ref type="bibr">(Lovelock and Wright, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research methods</head><p>The location of the study was carried out in the tourism destinations of Samosir Region, North Sumatra, located in seven districts namely Simalungun Regency, Toba Samosir Regency, Samosir Regency, North Tapanuli Regency, Humbang Hasundutan Regency, Karo Regency, Dairi Regency. The population in this study were all tourists who visiting the Samosir Region.</p><p>The sample used non probability sampling, allowing the opportunity for someone to be a respondent was not known. Sampling of tourists in this study was determined by quota sampling as many as 200 respondents either male or female. In this study, the sampling technique was accidental sampling, which was how to obtain samples based on tourists who was found when conducting the study, which was taken from the research site without distinguishing the origin of the tourists.
