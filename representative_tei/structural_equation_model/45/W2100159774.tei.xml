<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Sediment denitrification in lakes alleviates the effects of eutrophication through the removal of nitrogen to the atmosphere as N 2 O and N 2 . However, N 2 O contributes notably to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Human land uses (e.g. agricultural and urban areas) strongly affect lake water quality and sediment characteristics, which, in turn, may regulate lake sediment denitrification and N 2 O production. In this study, we investigated sediment denitrification and N 2 O production and their relationships to withinlake variables and watershed land uses in 20 lakes from the Yangtze River basin in China. The results indicated that both lake water quality and sediment characteristics were significantly influenced by watershed land uses. N 2 O production rates increased with increasing background denitrification rates. Background denitrification and N 2 O production rates were positively related to water nitrogen concentrations but were not significantly correlated with sediment characteristics and plant community structure. A significant positive relationship was observed between background denitrification rate and percentage of human-dominated land uses (HDL) in watersheds. Structural equation modelling revealed that the indirect effects of HDL on sediment denitrification and N 2 O production in Yangtze lakes were mediated primarily through lake water quality. Our findings also suggest that although sediments in Yangtze lakes can remove large quantities of nitrogen through denitrification, they may also be an important source of N 2 O, especially in lakes with high nitrogen content.</p></div>

Conversion of natural land use (e.g., forests and wetlands) to human land use (e.g., cropland and urban areas) releases large quantities of pollutants, including nitrogen, and has widespread effects on biodiversity and ecological function of lakes, rivers and other water bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Müller et al., 1998)</ref>. Lake water quality has deteriorated worldwide due to increasing point-and nonpointsource pollution in watersheds <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Nielsen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baron et al., 2013)</ref>. For instance, the percentage of Chinese lakes classified as eutrophic has rapidly increased from 41 % in 1980 to 85 % in 2005 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Liu et al., 2010)</ref>. The effects of watershed land uses on lake water quality are well-documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Liu et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Nielsen et al., 2012)</ref>. However, relatively few studies have reported the relationship between watershed land uses and lake sediment characteristics, and their results are inconsistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Müller et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruesewitz et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Denitrification plays an important role in lake ecosystems by removing excess nitrogen input from watersheds <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Seitzinger et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">McCrackin and Elser, 2010)</ref>. The denitrification process predominantly occurs under anaerobic or anoxic conditions and involves the successive reduction of nitrate (NO - 3 ) to nitrite (NO - 2 ), nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and, finally, dinitrogen gas (N 2 ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sirivedhin and Gray, 2006)</ref>. In lakes, denitrification capacity is greatest in sediments due to the favourable environment for denitrifying bacteria and fungi <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(McCrackin and Elser, 2010</ref>  <ref type="bibr">al., 2013)</ref>. Sediment denitrification can account for approximately 82 % of the total nitrate loss in lakes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kreiling et al., 2011)</ref>. Despite the significant increases in nitrogen loading in lake ecosystems and the growing attention to water quality degradation and toxic algal blooms, our understanding of large-scale sediment denitrification in lakes remains limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(McCrackin and Elser, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruesewitz et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Liu et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>N 2 O is an intermediate product of sediment denitrification and may be released into the atmosphere in substantial amounts under certain conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Seitzinger and Kroeze, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hefting et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Freymond et al., 2013)</ref>. In Lake Taihu of China, both the littoral and pelagic zones can release large quantities of N 2 O, especially during the summer algal bloom period <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wang et al., 2007)</ref>. However, N 2 O fluxes in the pelagic regions of shallow boreal lakes are reported to be negligible <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Huttunen et al., 2003)</ref>, which indicates that lakes are only moderate sources of N 2 O <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mengis et al., 1997)</ref>. N 2 O is a powerful greenhouse gas that is approximately 300 times stronger than CO 2 and is responsible for approximately 6 % of global warming <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(IPCC, 2007)</ref>. Thus, it is important to examine the N 2 O production during sediment denitrification. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Seitzinger and Kroeze (1998)</ref> have indicated that the relative N 2 O production (i.e., the N 2 O / (N 2 O+N 2 ) ratio) for heavily polluted river and estuary sediments is approximately 0.03. By contrast, the relative N 2 O production for lakes is still poorly understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(McCrackin and Elser, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>At the within-lake scale, overlying water quality and sediment characteristics are recognised as the primary determinants of sediment denitrification and N 2 O production <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Saunders and Kalff, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hasegawa and Okino, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhong et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rissanen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Liu et al., 2015)</ref>. Recently, several studies have found that aquatic plant communities can also greatly influence sediment denitrification in fresh waters (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Forshay and Dodson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Jacobs and Harrison, 2014)</ref>. Plants may affect denitrification primarily through the modification of carbon inputs and soil redox conditions via oxygen excretion from roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Sutton-Grier et al., 2013)</ref>. At the watershed scale, few studies have addressed the indirect effects of watershed land uses on lake sediment denitrification and N 2 O production (but see <ref type="bibr">Mc-Crackin and Elser, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruesewitz et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Liu et al., 2015)</ref>, and no studies have examined whether the indirect effects are mainly mediated through lake water quality or sediment characteristics. A better understanding of multi-scale determinants of sediment denitrification in lakes is necessary to achieve high nitrogen removal efficiency and low N 2 O production rates.</p><p>In this work, we investigated sediment denitrification and N 2 O production and their relationships to within-lake variables and watershed land uses in 20 lakes from the Yangtze River basin in China. We hypothesised that the human land uses in watersheds would influence sediment denitrification and N 2 O production in lakes, primarily via effects on lake water quality. The objectives of this study were (1) to ex-amine if watershed land uses could influence lake sediment characteristics, as well as water quality, (2) to determine the effects of water quality, sediment characteristics and plant community structure on lake sediment denitrification and N 2 O production, and (3) to reveal the mechanisms of lake sediment denitrification and N 2 O production in response to human land uses in watersheds for the first time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Study sites</head><p>The Yangtze River, originating from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and flowing into the Pacific Ocean in the city of Shanghai, is the largest river in China and has a drainage area of approximately 1.8 million km 2 and a total length of 6300 km (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). There are 648 lakes with areas greater than 1 km 2 in the Yangtze River basin <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wang and Dou, 1998)</ref>. Most of these lakes are concentrated in the middle and lower Yangtze River basin (i.e., the Yangtze floodplain; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), where alluvium predominates. Lakes in the Yangtze floodplain are generally shallow with short hydraulic retention times <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Liu et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Over the past decades, the watershed land uses of many Yangtze lakes have undergone substantial changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Liu et al., 2012)</ref>. Large areas of forests, wetlands and other natural landscapes have been transformed into agricultural, industrial, and urban lands. For instance, the percentage classified as built-up lands in the Chaohu Lake watershed has increased from 6.59 to 9.58 % during the period of <ref type="bibr">1979</ref><ref type="bibr">-2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Wu, 2011))</ref>. As a result of watershed land use changes, water quality in many lakes has deteriorated considerably in recent years, and up to 86 % of the Yangtze lakes are classified as eutrophic or even hypereutrophic <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Yang et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Field sampling</head><p>During the summer (from 30 July to 7 August) of 2012, 20 lakes in the middle and lower Yangtze River basin of China were selected non-randomly on the basis of ease of access (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). These selected lakes covered a wide range of physical and chemical conditions and vegetation characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wang and Dou, 1998)</ref>. Almost all these lakes are shallow (mean depth &lt; 4 m), except for the Lake Bohu with a mean depth of 4.41 m. The largest lake is Lake Longganhu with an area of 316.20 km 2 , while the smallest one is Lake Yiaihu with an area of 3.21 km 2 . The name, geographic location and morphology characteristics of these studied lakes are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> in the Supplement. To obtain representative samples, one transect from the littoral zone to the lake centre was randomly established in each lake and 3-4 sampling sites were chosen along this transect at regular intervals based on lake area <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Yang et al., 2008)</ref>. Littoral sampling sites were generally located at a water depth less than 1.5 m, approximately 50-100 m away from the lake shore. At each sampling site, three replicate surface sediments were randomly collected within an approximately 50 m 2 area from a boat using a Peterson dredge and then mixed and homogenised to form a composite sample. For each site, approximately 1 kg of sediment was placed in a sealed plastic bag and stored at approximately 5 • C in a refrigerator until return to the laboratory. At each sampling site, a 200 mL unfiltered water sample was collected at a depth of approximately 1 m for use in the denitrification and N 2 O production assays. At the same time, we collected an additional 200 mL water sample at the same depth for water quality analyses in the laboratory. Water sampling was performed before sediment collection to prevent sediments from being resuspended and thereby contaminating the water. At each sampling site, submerged macrophytes were sampled using a pronged grab (25 cm × 35 cm) with three replicates, and the species richness (i.e., mean species number recorded in a sampling site) and fresh plant biomass were calculated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Denitrification and N 2 O production assays</head><p>The most common method for measuring sediment denitrification is based on the ability of acetylene to inhibit the reduction of N 2 O to N 2 during denitrification <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Groffman et al., 1999)</ref>. Although the acetylene blockage technique has a number of limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Yu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Felber et al., 2012)</ref>, it is still amenable to large-scale comparisons of denitrification, especially for systems with moderate or high NO - 3 concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Groffman et al., 2006)</ref>. In this study, we measured potential and background denitrification rates of lake sediments using the acetylene blockage technique. The potential denitrification rate was measured under optimal conditions (by supplying an excess of NO - 3 and organic carbon and ensuring anoxia) and thus provided an upper-bound estimate of in situ denitrification. Background denitrification (i.e., unamended denitrification) rate was a conservative estimate of in situ denitrification without carbon and NO - 3 amendments because acetylene also inhibited nitrification (NO - 3 production). The increase in N 2 O concentrations was always linear throughout the short assay duration therefore, short-term incubation (2-4 h) was recommended for measuring sediment denitrification of lakes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bruesewitz et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>For potential denitrification rate assays, 50 g of homogenised sediments from each sampling site was slurried with 30 mL of incubation solution (final concentrations: 0.1 g L -1 KNO 3 , 0.18 g L -1 glucose and 1 g L -1 chloramphenicol) in a 250 mL serum bottle. Each bottle was then sealed and purged with N 2 gas for 2 min to induce anoxic conditions. Approximately 10 % of the bottle headspace was replaced with acetylene to block the conversion of N 2 O to N 2 during denitrification. We measured background denitrification and N 2 O production rates using a similar procedure, but with the addition of 30 mL of unfiltered lake water instead of the incubation solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(McCrackin and Elser, 2012)</ref>. Parallel incubations with and without acetylene (10 % vol/vol in the bottle headspace) were used to differentiate between background denitrification and N 2 O production <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(McCrackin and Elser, 2010)</ref>. All bottles were then incubated in the dark for 4 h at 25 • C (the approximate in situ water temperature). At the beginning and end of incubation, 5 mL of headspace gas samples was collected from each bottle (after shaking vigorously) using a syringe. The N 2 O concentrations were measured using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with an electron capture detector.</p><p>Potential denitrification, background denitrification and N 2 O production rates were calculated as the difference between the initial and final headspace N 2 O concentrations (corrected for N 2 O dissolved in water, Bunsen coefficient = 0.544) divided by the incubation time <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hayakawa et al., 2012)</ref>, and was expressed on the basis of dry matter of sediment (ng N g -1 h -1 ). The relative N 2 O production was calculated by dividing the N 2 O production rate by the background denitrification rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Garcìa-Ruiz et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mc-Crackin and Elser, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Sediment characteristics and water quality measurements</head><p>Sediment pH was measured in a soil to water ratio of 1 : 5(v/v) using a pH meter and bulk density was determined by weighing soil cores of known volume after drying for 24 h at 105 • C. Sediment moisture was measured gravimetrically (24 h at 105 • C) from 30 g sediment samples. Sediment total nitrogen (STN) was measured using the Kjeldahl method after digesting samples in a digestor using a sulfuric acid/mercuric oxide catalyst. Sediment total carbon (STC) content of air-dried samples was analysed by a TOC analyser (Vario TOC cube, Elementar, Germany). Conductivity (Cond), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate (NO - 3 ) and ammonium (NH + 4 ) were measured on site at the sampling depth using a YSI 6920 multiparameter water quality probe (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA). Total nitrogen (TN) concentration was analysed using the micro-Kjeldahl method. The concentrations of total carbon (TC) and total organic carbon (TOC) in waters were measured with a TOC analyser (Vario TOC cube, Elementar, Germany).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Watershed land use calculation</head><p>After delineating the watershed boundaries of the 20 studied lakes using a 1 km resolution digital elevation model, overlay functions were used to extract a land use map of each lake's watershed from 100 m resolution national land cover data in ArcGIS 10 software (ESRI, Redlands, California, USA). The national land cover data, interpreted from recent Landsat TM images, were obtained from the Data Sharing Infrastructure of Earth System Science in China (<ref type="url" target="http://www.geodata.cn/">http://www.geodata.cn/</ref>).</p><p>The original land use classes were further grouped into four main categories: (1) vegetation, including forest and grassland; (2) cropland, including dry land and paddy fields;</p><p>(3) built-up land, including urban areas, rural settlements and others such as industrial areas, roads, and airports; and</p><p>(4) water bodies, including lakes, rivers, streams, reservoirs, ponds, and wetlands (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Bare land was not included in our analysis because its area in watersheds was very small. The percentages of land use types in each lake's watershed were calculated in ArcGIS 10 software. Cropland and builtup land can be considered as human-dominated land uses (HDL; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abdullah and Nakagoshi, 2006)</ref>. We used the HDL here, because the correlations between in-lake characteristics (i.e., water quality and sediment characteristics) and the percentage of cropland or percentage of built-up land were weak.</p><p>To quantify the vegetation cover, we calculated the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) of each watershed from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) red and near-infrared bands. The 250 m resolution MODIS data for the years 2010 and 2011 were obtained from the USGS EROS Data Center. The NDVI is a reflection of the biophysical condition of a watershed's vegetation cover, which, in turn, may affect the water runoff and water quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Griffith et al., 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Statistical analyses</head><p>For each studied lake, we calculated the mean values for sediment denitrification, N 2 O production, water quality, sediment characteristics and plant community structure (Tables S2 and S3). Before statistical analyses, we tested data for normal distribution using a Shapiro-Wilk test. When possible, non-normally distributed data were natural log or square root transformed to reach a normal distribution. To examine the relationships among watershed land uses, water chemistry, sediment characteristics, plant community structure, sediment denitrification and N 2 O production at the lake level, we performed Pearson correlation and regression analyses using PASW Statistics 18 software (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).</p><p>Structural equation modelling (SEM) with Bayesian estimation was used to study the indirect effects of watershed human land use on lake sediment denitrification and N 2 O production. We used results from our correlation analysis to select the promising explanatory variables to include in the SEM models. Given the positive correlations between TN and NO - 3 (r = 0.86, P &lt; 0.01) and between TN and NH + 4 (r = 0.45, P &lt; 0.05), the TN was not included in the SEM analyses to simplify the final models. We expected that NO - 3 and NH + 4 were likely correlated with DO, because when aerobic condition was present, NH + 4 might easily be converted into NO - 3 by nitrifying organisms in waters <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Peterson et al., 2001)</ref>. The software Amos 20 (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) was used to design the SEM models and calculate path coefficients, squared multiple correlations, direct and indirect effects. Indirect effects, i.e., effects mediated by other variables, were calculated by multiplying the standardised path coefficients (i.e., estimates) of the direct effects of the variables involved in the total pathway. We used the chi-square (χ 2 ) test and the comparative fit index (CFI) to evaluate the overall fit of the SEM models. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kline (1998)</ref>, a good fit was indicated by an insignificant χ 2 statistic (P &gt; 0.05) and a CFI value &gt; 0.90. The χ 2 provides an estimate of how closely the proposed SEM model matches the structure of the actual data. Thus, an insignificant χ2 statistic (P &gt; 0.05) indicates that the structure of the proposed model is no different than the structure of the data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Effects of watershed human land use on in-lake characteristics</head><p>Numerous studies have revealed that human modification of the land uses plays a key role in determining the water quality of adjacent aquatic ecosystems (e.g., generation of point and non-point source pollutants and expansion of impervious surface area; Crosbie and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chow-Fraser, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arbuckle and Downing, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Taranu and Gregory-Eaves, 2008)</ref>. In this study, human land use in watersheds was strongly and positively related to water N concentrations in lakes (Table 2). Built-up land, including urban, industrial areas and rural settlements, is the leading source of point source pollution in the Yangtze River basin <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Liu et al., 2012)</ref>. Chaohu Lake, one of the lakes included in the present study, received 2.17 × 10 8 t of industrial wastewater and domestic sewage discharged from adjacent Hefei City every year <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Shang and Shang, 2005)</ref>. Cropland is recognised as the most important source of non-point source pollution affecting lakes in many countries. Approximately half of the area of the middle and lower Yangtze River basin is covered by agriculture land, especially paddy fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Liu et al., 2011)</ref>. In the Yangtze River basin, the annual consumption of nitrogen fertiliser on agricultural lands increased from 94 kg ha -1 in 1980 to 509 kg ha -1 in 2000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Liu et al., 2008)</ref>. Moreover, the nitrogen use efficiency decreased considerably from 0.31 to 0.23 between 1980 and 2000. Most of the excess nitrogen in paddy fields was discharged into aquatic environments through surface runoff.</p><p>Relatively few studies have reported on the relationship between watershed landscapes and lake sediment characteristics and their results are inconsistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Müller et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruesewitz et al., 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruesewitz et al. (2011)</ref> found that the percentage of catchment agriculture was positively related to sediment carbon but not nitrogen. These researchers found that agricultural landscapes can increase carbon inputs   to aquatic ecosystems as a result of increased soil erosion and organic carbon transport or through increased lake productivity resulting in higher rates of organic matter deposition in sediments. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Müller et al. (1998)</ref> indicated that TN concentration in lake sediments strongly increased with increasing agricultural land use in watersheds. Our study also found a significant relationship between watershed human landscapes and STN. It is noteworthy that the correlation between human landscapes and water TN was greater than that between human land uses and STN (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). One possible explanation is that water TN level in lakes primarily reflects recent land use patterns in watersheds. Sediment TN content, however, reflects sedimentation and deposition of nutrients that have occurred over several decades. Any modelling of water and sediment nutrient contents using recent land use data is likely to show stronger correlations with water than sediment nutrient levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Houlahan and Findlay, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">The role of sediment denitrification in nitrogen removal in Yangtze lakes</head><p>Sediment denitrification is recognised as the most important pathway of nitrogen removal in lakes, followed by nitrogen sedimentation and uptake by aquatic macrophytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Saunders and Kalff, 2001)</ref>. Scaled on an areal basis using the bulk density of the top 7 cm of sediment, background denitrification rate ranged from 353.6 to 1.097 × 10 4 kg N km -2 yr -1 , with a mean of 1065 kg N km -2 yr -1 . This mean rate is smaller than the global average of lakes (3421 kg N km -2 yr -1 ) estimated by a NiRReLa model <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Harrison et al., 2009)</ref>. Background denitrification rate can be considered as a conservative estimate of actual in situ denitrification. Therefore, according to the areal background denitrification rate and the surface area of the 20 studied Yangtze lakes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>), we find that Lake Chaohu and Lake Caizihu can at least remove 6.019 × 10 5 and 5.538 × 10 5 kg of N every year, respectively. It has been reported that denitrification rate of lake sediments shows a marked seasonal variation with higher values in summer and lower values in winter <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Christensen and Sørensen, 1986)</ref>. Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate the temporal variations of sediment denitrification in the Yangtze River basin to estimate the N removal capacity of lake sediments more accurately.</p><p>Net N 2 O production during sediment N cycles is gaining increased attention because N 2 O is a powerful greenhouse gas <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hefting et al., 2006)</ref>. The mean net N 2 O production rate (i.e., N 2 O production in the absence of acetylene) of the studied Yangtze lakes was 0.27 ng N g -1 h -1 or 142.9 kg N km -2 yr -1 . This value is approximately 2.1 times greater than the average rate in Norwegian lakes (68.60 kg N km -2 yr -1 ) calculated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">McCrackin and Elser (2010)</ref>. By using the static chamber method, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wang et al. (2007)</ref> reported that the N 2 O flux in the pelagic zones of a eutrophic Yangtze lake (i.e., Lake Taihu) was approximately 182.2 kg N km -2 yr -1 . It should be noted that N 2 O production in the absence of acetylene may be derived from both denitrification and nitrification processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Garcìa-Ruiz et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Xu et al., 2008)</ref>. Nitrification, the oxidation of NH + 4 to NO - 3 , can produce N 2 O as an intermediate product. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beaulieu et al. (2014)</ref> found that denitrification and nitrification were likely occurring simultaneously when dissolved oxygen in water column was &gt; 5 mg L -1 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Beaulieu et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In the present study, N 2 O production rates significantly increased with increasing background denitrification rates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Although our study did not quantify the respective contributions of denitrification and nitrification to N 2 O production, the positive relationship between N 2 O production and background denitrification rates might imply that sediment denitrification produces more N 2 O than nitrification in the Yangtze lakes. Our result also indicates that lake sediments may be significant sinks for terrestrial NO - 3 but may also become a significant source of N 2 O if NO - 3 input is to  increase. However, the available information on the N 2 O production and consumption of the Yangtze lakes is still rather limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wang et al., 2007)</ref>. Further direct measurements of N 2 O emission are needed to better understand the contribution of Yangtze lakes to regional N 2 O fluxes. The present study found that the average of relative N 2 O production was 0.17, similar to the value (0.18) reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Garcìa-Ruiz et al. (1998)</ref>. However, our results contrast with those found in other investigations, the majority of which give values less than 0.05 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Seitzinger, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Beaulieu et al., 2011)</ref>. This result might be explained by the fact that oxygen in overlying water of shallow lakes could suppress the N 2 O reductase enzyme, which reduces N 2 O to N 2 during denitrification <ref type="bibr">(Garcia-Ruiz et al., 1998)</ref>. It is known that this enzyme is the most oxygen sensitive of all enzymes involved in denitrification process, and slurries in the present study were made with unfiltered lake water. It should be noted that some studies have found that the relative N 2 O production can be larger than 1 and explained that in such cases nitrification, but not denitrification, is the major source of N 2 O <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Xu et al., 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Local and regional determinants of sediment denitrification in lakes</head><p>Environmental variables that affect sediment denitrification can be categorised as proximal or distal regulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Saggar et al., 2013)</ref>. Proximal regulators, including NO - 3 concentration, oxygen supply or water content, carbon availability and temperature in sediment and overlying water, affect the instantaneous rate of sediment denitrification. Consistent with previous studies conducted in streams and rivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Garcìa-Ruiz et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Inwood et al., 2005)</ref>, we found that only overlying water quality had significant relationships with sediment denitrification and N 2 O production in Yangtze lakes. Our study suggests that nitrogen availability in water is the primary factor limiting sediment denitrification in Yangtze lakes. Water NO - 3 concentration explained approximately 70 % of the variability in denitrification rates in a meta-analysis (Piña-Ochoa and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Álvarez-Cobelas, 2006)</ref>. Some studies also reported a significant relationship between denitrification and sediment carbon concentration (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruesewitz et al., 2011)</ref>. However, this relationship is not significant in the Yangtze lakes, most likely because sediment TC concentration was high (25 mg g -1 ) and was not limiting to sediment denitrification.</p><p>Distal regulators affect sediment denitrification indirectly by acting on the proximal controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Saggar et al., 2013)</ref>. These regulators include factors such as catchment land use and regional climate. Few studies have examined the relationships between watershed human land uses and sediment denitrification in lakes (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruesewitz et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Liu et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruesewitz et al. (2011)</ref> found that potential denitrification but not background denitrification was positively related to the proportion of catchment agriculture. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Liu et al. (2015)</ref> reported that the proportion of agricultural and urban land uses in watersheds was positively related to potential denitrification rate, but not to background denitrification rate and N 2 O production rate. However, consistent with previous observations regarding stream sediment denitrification (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arango and Tank, 2008)</ref>, we only found a significant positive relationship between sediment background denitrification and human land uses.</p><p>Although many studies have investigated the sediment denitrification in lakes worldwide (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hasegawa and Okino, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bruesewitz et al., 2011)</ref>, to our knowledge, no study to date has examined the indirect effects of catchment land uses on sediment denitrification in lakes. Using a conceptual model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Inwood et al. (2007)</ref> predicted that land use could indirectly affect sediment denitrification and N 2 O emission in headwater streams in Michigan, USA, by influencing the stream water quality or sediment characteristics. SEM, a comprehensive statistical approach which allows for testing and estimating indirect effects among a set of associated variables, is widely used in ecological studies in recent years (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sutton-Grier et al., 2010)</ref>. As we hypothesised, although both lake water quality and sediment characteristics were significantly affected by human land use, the indirect effects of human land use in watersheds on sediment denitrification and N 2 O production in Yangtze lakes were more likely driven through changes in lake water quality than through changes in sediment characteristics (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). SEM analysis further demonstrated that positive relationships between human land uses and sediment background denitrification were primarily driven by water nitrogen loading (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Areas of urban in the Yangtze River basin have expanded dramatically in the last 3 decades, and this change is considered a severe threat to lake ecosystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Liu et al., 2012)</ref>. Although our results suggest that human-dominated land uses can enhance the sediment denitrification in lakes, the quantity of nitrogen exported from watersheds should be controlled to improve the water quality and reduce the N 2 O production of eutrophic lakes in the Yangtze River basin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>Increased human land uses in watersheds have led to elevated nitrogen concentration in both water and sediments in Yangtze lakes. Among the water quality parameters, ORP, DO, NO - 3 and TN were significantly related to sediment background denitrification and N 2 O production rates. Only the background denitrification rate was found to be positively correlated with the percentage of human land uses in the watersheds. The results of SEM analysis supported the hypothesis that sediment denitrification and N 2 O production in the Yangtze lakes were indirectly associated with watershed human landscapes, primarily through the effect of land use on lake water quality, but not sediment characteristics.</p><p>The Supplement related to this article is available online at doi:10.5194/bg-12-6059-2015-supplement.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>; Baron et Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.
