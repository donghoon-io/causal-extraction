<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose -Different studies underline that Perceived Job Insecurity (PJI) has negative consequences at both individual and organisational level. Some authors investigated PJI in Temporary Agency Workers (TAWs) but these studies did not focus on specific countries and did not discuss the relationship with job exhaustion. Other researchers explored gender differences in PJI and found different results; some investigated differences in PJI perception and others its relationship with the outcome of stress or well-being. The aim of this study is to inquire about the effects of PJI (as a demanding condition) on job exhaustion, considering the mediation role of workload and exploring differences between male and female TAWs. Design/Methodology/Approach -This research involved 474 Portuguese TAWs (209 men, 265 women). Data was collected through a self-report questionnaire; data analyses were performed using IBM Spss Statistics 22 for descriptive statistics, correlations and t-test; Mplus7 was used to estimate a multi-group structural equation model and to test the mediation. Findings -The results confirmed that workload is a mediator and indicated gender differences in how PJI relates to workload and job exhaustion in TAWs. In fact, the mediation of workload in the relationship between PJI and job exhaustion was partial in men and total in women: in the women group the direct effect of PJI on job exhaustion is not significant, and the indirect effect mediated by workload is significant; in the men group both direct and indirect effects are significant. Originality/Value -This paper contributes to extend the research on job insecurity of TAWs in a specific national context and highlights gender differences in the relationship between PJI and job exhaustion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The growth in fixed-term contracts and increased outsourcing to temporary agencies have implied benefits for employers and costs for employees: temporary employment provides flexibility to organizations but poses demands on employees, thus raising their job insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(De Witte, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">De Cuyper et al., 2009)</ref>. Some studies have already investigated the association between job insecurity and its psychological outcomes in temporary workers, indicating that it has various harmful consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(De Cuyper and De Witte, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Parker et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sverke et al., 2002)</ref>. However, they have considered Temporary Agency Workers (TAWs) only to a minor extent <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(De Cuyper et al., 2009)</ref>, so further studies are needed regarding employees with specific temporary contracts.</p><p>Another unresolved issue within the context of job insecurity is gender differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Okurame, 2014)</ref>. Some studies have focused on the differences in job insecurity perception, other studies with regard to the relationship with outcomes of stress or well-being. For example, some research found that men experience greater job insecurity than women (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gaunt and Benjamin, 2007)</ref>, others showed that the experience of job insecurity is more distressing for women than for men (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kinnunen et al., 2000)</ref>. Moreover, other authors still have not identified gender differences in job insecurity experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cheng and Chan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Keim et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Our study considers these open issues and investigates the perception of job insecurity among TAWs as well as its relationship with workload and job exhaustion. In our research, we explore gender differences within the perspective of the gender role theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barnett et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Simon, 1992)</ref>, considering that Portugal is a traditional country in terms of gender ideology, where men attribute great value to their job role <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aboim, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pereira, 2010)</ref>. In fact, some scholars pointed out that women are more likely to find a temporary job that satisfies them than men <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Booth et al., 2002)</ref> and less bothered by the lower job security typically afforded by temporary jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aletraris, 2010)</ref>. Instead, men seem to be more sensitive to social pressures that lead them to work and to maintain a secure job <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bertolini, 2013)</ref>, according to the idea of the main breadwinner <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barnett et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Simon, 1992)</ref>. This may be particularly true in Portugal, a country where traditional values are still deep-rooted <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aboim, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pereira, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Job insecurity and TAWs</head><p>Over the past two decades, changes in working life have caused feelings of insecurity in many employees. The psychological concept of job insecurity refers to concerns about the continuation of one's job <ref type="bibr">(Sverke and Hellgren, 2002)</ref> i.e. workers fear losing their job and becoming unemployed <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(De Witte, 1999)</ref>. Job insecurity can be conceptualized as a work stressor, in the background of the transactional stress theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Lazarus and Folkman, 1984)</ref>. According to the transactional stress theory, faced with a possible stressor, individuals undertake two appraisals: a primary appraisal, to evaluate if the occurrence is a threat to personal well-being and if it leads to harm or loss; a secondary appraisal, to evaluate resources and coping strategies to face it. It emerges that, when the job is perceived as being at risk, it is most likely interpreted as a threat since employment is important for the individual's personal, social and economic life. In addition, uncertainty about the future of the job, contrary to the certainty of dismissal, makes it hard to identify and utilize efficient coping strategies during the secondary appraisal <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(De Witte, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>So far, two meta-analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cheng and Chan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sverke et al., 2002)</ref> resumed the most studied consequences of job insecurity on employees' well-being. PJI resulted as being negatively related to job satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Rosenblatt and</ref><ref type="bibr">Ruvio, 1996), organisational commitment (McFarlane et al., 1991)</ref>, psychological health <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Wilson et al., 1993)</ref>, physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Isaksson et al., 2000)</ref>, work performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Rosenblatt et al., 1999)</ref>, trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Pearce et al., 1994)</ref> and job involvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kuhnert and Palmer, 1991)</ref>; and positively related to turnover intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ameen et al., 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Perceived job insecurity (PJI) is also classified as a job demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Schaufeli and Taris, 2014)</ref>, for example in Job Demands-Resources Model (JD-R model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bakker and Demerouti, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Demerouti et al., 2001)</ref>, and is likely to be positively associated with negative outcomes, like job exhaustion, which is one of the core dimensions of the burnout syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Maslach et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Schaufeli and Taris, 2005)</ref>. Previous studies confirmed this positive relationship between PJI and job exhaustion <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bosman et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">De Cuyper et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kausto et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Piccoli and De Witte, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Vander Elst et al., 2012)</ref> and our study seeks to contribute to the literature in this direction.</p><p>Our study focuses on TAWs that are temporary workers involved in a triangular employment relationship with two organizations: the employment agency that hires them and the client organisation where they actually perform their work <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Coyle-Shapiro et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gallagher and McLean Parks, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Giunchi et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Considering the continuing global increase in temporary agency employment penetration rates in the world -2.0 percent in USA, 1.6 percent in Europe and 1.4 percent in Japan (CIETT, 2014)concerns about well-being of this working population have attracted the attention of the scientific community for years. Due to the temporary nature of their employment arrangement, TAWs are considered as being involved in an objective insecure situation, which can lead them to subsequently perceive a subjective insecurity (i.e. a feeling of insecurity). Furthermore, the management strategies adopted by agencies, such as providing TAWs short-term assignments to generate a surplus of workers "on the books" to meet client demands, have exacerbated a feeling of insecurity and uncertainty in these workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Forde, 2001)</ref>. Different scholars have pointed out that it is important to consider the dimension of the employment contract as either a given <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bernhard-Oettel et al., 2005)</ref> or an objective situation that implies feelings of security/insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(De Witte and Näswall, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sverke and Hellgren, 2002)</ref>. However, among the studies investigating job insecurity that considered the type of contract, the majority compares workers with different permanent and temporary contracts, and fails to account for a specific temporary contract population <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(De Cuyper et al., 2009)</ref>. Indeed, the studies reporting perception and outcomes of job insecurity in TAWs are comparative and found contrasting results.</p><p>Some studies found that TAWs experience job insecurity and show harmful consequences related to it: less job satisfaction and affective organizational commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(De Cuyper et al., 2009)</ref> and more health complaints <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Klein Hesselink and Van Vuuren, 1999)</ref> than permanent and other temporary workers. Other comparative studies went in the opposite direction: when comparing fixed-term, temporary and agency contracts, and permanent employees in four organisations in the UK, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Guest, Mackenzie Davey and Patch (2003)</ref> found that those with agency contracts reported a better state of the psychological contract and job security than permanent workers did. Moreover, Vander Steene and colleagues <ref type="bibr">(2001)</ref> reported that TAWs compared with temporary workers reported less perceptions of job insecurity, probably because they rely on the agency to provide them with the next assignment, thus feelings of insecurity are mitigated by expectations of security from the agency. However, a more recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chambel and Fontinha (2009)</ref> did not confirm this thesis and found, on the contrary, that employees' perceptions of job insecurity can be a threat to the psychological contract with the agency, precisely for their expectations of job security from the agency, in terms of assignments supply, that may or may not be respected.</p><p>Thus, it seems very important to examine more closely perceived job insecurity in the specific domain of TAWs and its relationship with outcomes of stress and well-being at work, especially in Portugal which, as well as the other Mediterranean European countries (i.e. Spain, Italy and Greece), has a strict dismissal regulation for permanent workers that acts as a buffer and may further increase the risk of negative outcomes due to job insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(OECD, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>With regard to the dimensions of burnout, we decided to exclusively take into account job exhaustion since it was found to be more strongly associated, compared to the other components <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lee &amp; Ashforth, 1996)</ref>, with important outcome variables regarding the well-being of both individuals and organisations, such as organisational commitment, job performance, organisational citizenship behaviour and turnover intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cropanzano et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, we assumed that:</p><p>H1: PJI is positively related to job exhaustion in TAWs</p><p>Another important and less explored issue about PJI is its relationship with workload. Some scholars suggested that job insecurity perceptions might influence some individuals to counteract a perceived threat to their job by increasing their work effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Richter, 2011)</ref> in an attempt to convince management they are valuable to the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bergman and Wigblad, 1999)</ref>. Furthermore, results on performance by <ref type="bibr">van Vuuren and colleagues (1991)</ref> showed that working very hard could be seen as a way to secure one's job for the future. In addition, some authors reported that job insecure employees worked longer hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Fischer et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lewis and Cooper, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Richter and colleagues (2010) tested the possible mediation role of workload between job insecurity and work-family conflict and found it to be an intensifier factor of negative outcomes. In fact, workload is intended as a perceived pressure in completing work tasks and is considered one of the major demands of work <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lee and Ashforth, 1996)</ref>. Perceived workload was also associated with both job insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Richter et al., 2010)</ref> and job exhaustion <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Xanthopoulou et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>This may be far more likely in the case of TAWs, since several research studies reported that they develop positive attitudes towards organisations, employment agencies and client organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Coyle-Shapiro et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Giunchi et al., 2015)</ref>, probably because they want to increase the likelihood of being a permanent position <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chambel et al., 2015)</ref>. It is likely that to contrast their job insecurity TAWs try to work harder, perceiving a higher workload and showing that they are valuable for the organisation. But, at the same time, they seem to have less autonomy and cover working roles with a higher workload and more repetitive tasks than other groups of workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kompier et al., 2009)</ref> that, in turn, may have a negative impact on their well-being.</p><p>Based on these assumptions, we postulated that workload mediates the relationship between PJI and job exhaustion: H2: The positive relationship between PJI and job exhaustion is mediated by workload in TAWs PJI and gender differences Considering that the intensity of job insecurity effects on health and well-being varies considerably <ref type="bibr">(Sverke et al., 2002)</ref>, many authors investigated several potential factors among which gender was particularly considered, which might mitigate or worsen its detrimental effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cheng and Chan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kinnunen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mäkikangas and Kinnunen, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Näswall et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Richter, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sverke et al., 2002)</ref>. Some studies focused on gender differences in job insecurity perception, other studies on gender differences in the relationship between PJI and outcomes of stress or well-being.</p><p>In studies that focused on gender differences in job insecurity levels and consequences, a few scholars considered gender as a moderator <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kausto et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Okurame, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sverke and Hellgren, 2002)</ref>. Nevertheless, even these latter researchers found conflicting results: while men and women were comparable in some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cheng and Chan, 2008)</ref>, some differences were noted in others <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Campos-Serna et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gaunt and Benjamin, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kinnunen et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Okurame, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Richter et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Rosenblatt et al., 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Considering the interaction between gender and gender ideology, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gaunt and Benjamin (2007)</ref> found that traditional men experienced greater job insecurity than traditional women. On the contrary, in a previous study <ref type="bibr">Kinnunen and colleagues (2000)</ref> examined perceived job insecurity and its antecedents and outcomes over a one-year period among Finnish employees in three organisations and found female employees to feel more job insecure compared to men, probably due to the occupational segregation by gender. Furthermore, Campos-Serna and colleagues ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) recently wrote a review on working and employment conditions as determinants of gender inequalities in occupational health, analysing publications between 1999 and 2010. They found employed women had more job insecurity, lower control, worse contractual working conditions and poorer self-perceived physical and mental health compared to men.</p><p>Regarding studies that focused on gender differences in the relationship between PJI and outcomes of stress or well-being, <ref type="bibr">Rosenblatt and colleagues (1999)</ref>, in a study on Israeli schoolteachers, found that job insecurity adversely affected women job attitudes even more, such as organisational commitment, tendency to quit, resistance to change, perceived performance and perceived organisational support, compared to men. Instead, <ref type="bibr">Richter and colleagues (2010)</ref> in a longitudinal study on the relationship between job insecurity and work-family conflict mediated by workload found that men reacted more strongly to job insecurity, by reporting a higher workload, and by reporting more work-family conflict in connection with job insecurity than women. Moreover, in a recent study investigating the relationship between job insecurity and career engagement in the Nigerian-banking sector, Okurame (2014) reported that when men experienced higher levels of job insecurity, the negative effects on proactive career behaviour was significantly stronger.</p><p>Our study was conducted in Portugal, a country where traditional values are still deep-rooted, emphasising a separation in gender roles between male and female, and where the importance of the family roles and natural aptitude of women for child-rearing and domestic labour is foregrounded <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aboim, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pereira, 2010)</ref>. It is thus possible to consider Portugal as a country where the explanation of gender differences in the level of job insecurity and its consequences on well-being can be inscribed in the framework of gender role theory. According to gender role theory, family roles such as mother and spouse are more central to the identity of women, whereas work roles such as workers and main breadwinner are more central to the identity of men <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barnett et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Simon, 1992)</ref>. In addition, because previous studies were conducted with permanent workers it is important to verify if the assumptions of gender role theory apply to TAWs.</p><p>Thus, we expected to find that:</p><p>H3a: PJI is higher for men than for women TAWs H3b: The positive relationship between PJI and job exhaustion, mediated by workload, is greater for men than for women TAWs</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure and participants</head><p>Data was collected on TAWs from various companies, including employment agencies and clients located throughout Portugal, including the Island of Madeira. A questionnaire was placed on an online platform and disseminated to the companies through a link to be sent to workers via e-mail.</p><p>Respondents answered the questionnaire online and were assured of response anonymity and feedback opportunities. There was no incentive (money or otherwise) for participating in the project. The questionnaire allowed us to collect responses from 1,840 TAWs, of which we selected 474 by using a non-probabilistic sampling method based on reasoned choice, where we considered age, education level, industrial sector and agency contracts. The total sample was divided into two groups according to gender: 209 male and 265 female TAWs. Their demographic characteristics are presented in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSERT TABLE I</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>The study provided a self-report questionnaire consisting of a socio-demographic form and different scales from existing international literature. This instrument comprised the following scales: Perceived Job Insecurity (PJI). We assessed PJI through an eight-item scale composed of four items from De Witte's (2000) job insecurity measure, which had already been used in a previous study in Portugal <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chambel and Fontinha, 2009)</ref>, and four reverse items tailored from the job security measure scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kraimer, Wayne, Liden and Sparrowe (2005)</ref>. An example of PJI for each scale was, "I feel insecure about the future of my job" and "I am not secure about my job" respectively. The eight items were measured with a seven-point scale ranging from "Strongly Disagree" (1) to "Strongly Agree" (7). Cronbach's α in this study was .85 (.85 for male TAWs and .86 for female TAWs).</p><p>Workload. We used the Job Content Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Karasek et al., 1998)</ref>, already used in a previous study in Portugal <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Castanheira and Chambel, 2010)</ref>. The scale comprised seven items on a five-point scale ranging from "Strongly Disagree" (1) to "Strongly Agree" (5). A workload item present on this scale was, for instance, "I have too much work to do". Cronbach's α in this study was .83 (.82 for male TAWs and .84 for female TAWs).</p><p>Job Exhaustion. We assessed job exhaustion using the Portuguese translation of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Maslach et al., 1996)</ref> following an earlier Portuguese study <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Castanheira and Chambel 2010)</ref>. The scale of job exhaustion was composed of five items on a seven-point frequency scale ranging from "Never" (1) to "Always" (7). "I feel emotionally drained by my work" was a job exhaustion item present on the scale. Cronbach's α in this study was .90 (.88 for male TAWs and .91 for female TAWs).</p><p>Demographic characteristics such as gender (1= male TAWs, 2 = female TAWs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analyses</head><p>Data analyses were performed using IBM Spss Statistics 22 for a) descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) and Alpha reliabilities (α -Cronbach's Alpha) for each scale; b) correlations between variables (Pearson's r); and c) a t-test for an independent sample to understand differences in variables perception. Moreover, to estimate a multi-group structural equation model and to test the mediating role of workload between PJI and job exhaustion, data analyses were performed using MPLUS7 <ref type="bibr">(Muthen and</ref><ref type="bibr">Muthen, 1998-2012)</ref>; hypotheses were specified a priori leading to the choice of a partial mediation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(James et al., 2006)</ref>. Goodness of fit for the model was evaluated using the chi-square value (χ 2 ), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and the Standardized Root Mean square Residual (SRMR). In general, models with fit indices of &gt;.95 and an RMSEA of &lt;.06 indicate a close fit between the model and the data, whereas fit indices of &gt;.90 represent a reasonable fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hoyle, 1995)</ref>. To construct latent variables a parceling method was used: the indicators of these latent variables are parceled (aggregate-level indicators comprising an average of two or more items) for each latent variable. Using parcels as indicators of a construct is better than using more items for two reasons: firstly, it reduces type I errors in the item correlations; secondly, it lessens the likelihood of a priori model misspecification <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Yang et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Little et al., 2002)</ref>. All parcels present significant loadings (p &lt;.00) in structural equation models.</p><p>To address the common method variance issue, we performed the Harman's single-factor test <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref> using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The aim of this study was to inquire about the effects of PJI (as a demanding condition) on job exhaustion, considering the mediation role of workload and exploring potential differences between male and female TAWs.</p><p>Our first hypothesis was that PJI was positively related to job exhaustion among TAWs (H1). Correlations and the estimated model for job exhaustion showed that PJI has a direct positive impact on job exhaustion, thus increasing it. The first hypothesis (H1) was therefore supported: PJI resulted as being positively associated with job exhaustion, in accordance with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bosman et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">De Cuyper et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kausto et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Piccoli and De Witte, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Vander Elst et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>According to literature, job insecurity perceptions may lead to greater work efforts and higher workload perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Richter, 2011)</ref>. In this study, we further supposed that for TAWs the positive relationship between PJI and job exhaustion was mediated by workload (H2). Results supported this second hypothesis as well: a structural equation model showed workload to mediate the relationship between PJI and job exhaustion, indicating that TAWs react to job insecurity, by reporting not only a higher workload but also job exhaustion in connection with it. This may occur because they hope to be contracted permanently by the organisations they work for <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chambel et al., 2015)</ref> and this effort brings, in turn, negative consequences on their well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kompier et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Based on gender role theory, the third hypothesis explored gender differences. Hypothesis 3a was that PJI was higher for men than for women TAWs: t-test did not show differences between male and female TAWs in PJI. Even though job exhaustion and workload were higher in the men group, hypothesis 3a was not confirmed. Hypothesis 3b was that the positive relationship between PJI and job exhaustion, mediated by workload, was greater for men than for women TAWs. A multi-group structural equation model partially confirmed this hypothesis: in the male group we found that the mediation of workload was partial; in the female group, the mediation was total, thus the direct effect of PJI on job exhaustion did not occur.</p><p>This study investigated job insecurity perceptions and their relationship with job exhaustion in TAWs, and it thus contributed to the literature in various ways.</p><p>Firstly, even if an employment contract is a given and brings with it an objective situation that implies feelings of security/insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(De Witte and Näswall, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sverke and Hellgren, 2002)</ref>, due to the subjective nature of this emotional perception, such an objective precarious employment arrangement may be interpreted in various ways. In fact, some workers may not experience feelings of job insecurity, even though they might be dismissed in the near future <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aletraris, 2010)</ref>. Indeed, our results are in line with this conception: TAWs job insecurity perception is related to job exhaustion; however, this direct relationship did not occur in women, whose work ill-being and job insecurity perceptions both depend on their workload perception. Probably, this is because women react more strongly to a specific stressor, namely workload, rather than to another, such as PJI, depending on how important their work role is to their identity. According to traditional gender role separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barnett et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Simon, 1992)</ref>, women primarily identify themselves as mothers and spouses, and to cover these roles they are probably more likely to choose a job in which they can manage multiple roles rather than a job in which they feel secure <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Richter et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>On the contrary, men and PJI seem to be more strongly associated, as they report a higher workload and job exhaustion in connection with it. This might happen because in traditionalist countries, such as Portugal, men's deep-rooted tendency to attach greater importance to their work causes them to be more vulnerable than women to job insecurity-related outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gaunt and Benjamin, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Secondly, as most of the studies focusing on the association between job insecurity and health have been conducted in wealthy countries, and there is a lack of research in countries with different types of welfare states <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(László et al., 2010)</ref>, the results of the present study add another aspect to existing job insecurity research.</p><p>Effectively, Portugal, as well as the other Mediterranean European countries (i.e. Spain, Italy and Greece), has a stringent dismissal regulation for permanent employees that acts as a buffer and may further increase the risk of negative well-being outcomes due to job insecurity in TAWs, especially as they are used to mitigating business fluctuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(OECD, 2014)</ref>. For this reason, future studies should investigate further these relationships, gathering data from different samples to compare various countries with diverse gender values and welfare states.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future studies</head><p>We need to acknowledge some limitations relative to our study. Firstly, the present study used a cross-sectional research design that did not permit the establishment of definitive causality relations between variables. Further studies should examine the longitudinal effects of PJI on negative outcomes, such as burnout and ill-being, thus substantiating our assumption even more.</p><p>Secondly, the exclusive use of self-reported questionnaires can potentially contaminate results because observed relationships may be artificially inflated as a result of the respondents' tendency to answer in a consistent manner. Nevertheless, self-reported data seemed to be the most appropriate approach in our study as it evaluated workers' subjective perceptions of job insecurity, workload and exhaustion.</p><p>Finally, our sample of two TAW groups was extracted from a larger sample of TAWs through a judgment sampling method that took into account different variables. Our sample cannot therefore be considered representative of the general TAW population. Future studies should seek to enhance the external variability of this research by replicating our study with random sampling of TAWs who are working under various contract conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The results of the current study contribute to the existing literature on job insecurity of TAWs by relating job insecurity to job exhaustion, both directly and indirectly, and by exploring gender differences in these relationships. Characteristically, if TAWs are men then theyreportedlysubjectively feel job insecure and perceive higher workload and job exhaustion in relation to PJI and this happens beyond their objective insecurity situation ensuing from the temporary nature of their contract.</p><p>These results can be used for employers and governments to consider PJI as a demanding condition and potential stressor also for TAWs. Results may be useful for career practitioners and researchers to plan life-designing intervention that could help individuals to articulate and enact a career story that supports adaptive and flexible responses to developmental tasks and occupational transitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Savickas et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Savickas, 2012)</ref>. For example, counselling and coaching interventions, with specific attention to gender differences in specific countries, would allow people not only to enhance their ability to define a project of personal development, but also to redefine it without suffering or loss of identity in order to always maintain their employability.</p><p>These results also suggest considering the cultural aspect related PJI and gender differences: in some cultures, characterised by traditional value such as Portugal, men's deep-rooted tendency to attribute greater importance to their work causes them to be more vulnerable than women to job insecurity-related outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gaunt and Benjamin, 2007)</ref>. Furthermore, it is important for practitioners to design and manage interventions in an attempt to decrease TAWs work stress according to gender differences. Moreover, they reveal how fundamental it is to enhance feelings of mastery in order to decrease perceived workload while improving employee well-being, especially in more-uncertain times.</p><p>In conclusion, our results show that gender is not to be underestimated as a factor in PJI and its effects on the working world. Consequently, examining more closely the study of gender differences in job insecurity perceptions in countries characterised by different gender models is of the utmost importance.      </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Structural equation model, workload mediation between PJI and job exhaustion</figDesc></figure>
