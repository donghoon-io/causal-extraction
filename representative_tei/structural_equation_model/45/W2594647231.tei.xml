<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature review</head><p>Business Performance <ref type="bibr">Lin and Peng (2008)</ref> explains that business performance is the result of organization operational activity, including the achievement of organizations goal either internal or external achieve. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr">Lin and Peng (2008)</ref> define business performance as the achievement of organization's goal related to sales growth, profit and market share. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kaplan and Norton (1992)</ref> suggest a structure to measure business performance based on four perspectives: financial, customer size, business internal size, and innovative learning. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Olson and Slater (2002)</ref>, performances is defined as a company evaluation from effectively perspective.

The business performance term is used as an effort to develop performance in order to describe market aspect and financial performance aspect. Business performance refers to financial performance and financial steps, such as profit margin and return of investment, while market performance is the steps such as market share and sales volume that have been achieved. Another study which was conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kara et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relational capabilities</head><p>Relational capabilities have been discussed in many different contexts. In many studies, relational capabilities is defined an importance asset and organizational internal capabilities perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Zohdi et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Ngugi et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hormiga et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fazli et al. 2013</ref>). Relational capabilities is strongly related with the focus on knowledge access acceleration, supporting innovation and creating competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Smirnova et al. 2011)</ref>. Moreover, relational capabilities involve business exchange and effort to gain information's and business specific relation through the integration of other knowledge.</p><p>Referring to previous study, relational capabilities is defined as a organization ability to communicate, coordinate and manage business interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Day and Van den Bulte 2002)</ref>. Furthermore, the study explains that relational aspect is an internal capability which is still interesting to study. Study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dyer and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Singh (1998), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Jacob (2006)</ref> develop the concept of relational capabilities in three dimensions, i.e. the ability in configuration process, the ability to communicate with customers, and the ability to control the business process.</p><p>The study about relational capabilities also provides an interesting issue in the context of business interaction. Previous study done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ayios (2004)</ref> has focused on relational capabilities in the understanding of organization behavior and the role of business culture in business relation model practices. It is strengthened that inter organizational relations is very important process. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Butler and Purchase (2008)</ref> emphasizes that an effort to create trust is not merely between the organization but also on higher level of trust in interpersonal organizational.</p><p>In Resource Based View (RBV), internal capability determines the roots of sustainable competitive advantage of an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Barney 1991)</ref>. The example of internal capability include patent right protected under law, knowledge of technology, production skill which is difficult to imitate by the competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lee et al. 2001</ref>). Those capabilities have been implemented in many technology support <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Moen et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Lin and Chen 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ismail and Mamat 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Mohannak 2007</ref>). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dakhli and De Clercq (2004)</ref> explain the effect of two kinds of capital in relational capabilities, namely human capital and social capital in organizational value creation in the model of innovation. The study uses previous conceptualization of social capital which consists of trust, member of association, and behavior norms to investigate the correlation between social capital indicators and innovation. The relational capability in this study is an effort conducted by SMEs furniture's export oriented to develop relationship with the buyers/customers in international market.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Market Knowledge Competence</head><p>Knowledge-based view considers that knowledge is one of the most important assets to create business competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Tayauova 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hou and Chien 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hughes et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Li 2013)</ref>. Market knowledge competence is mostly used by organization to develop and expand resource capability of the organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Barney 1991)</ref>. Knowledge is defined as a belief which is based on information and considered as the form of high information value in which prepared for decision making process and implementation process (C.K. <ref type="bibr">Prahalad and Hamel 1994)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Jorgensen and Nilsen (2015)</ref> explain how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) develop their patterns of internationalization after taking their first steps in a foreign country. Moreover, SMEs need to identify and describe types of development patterns in international SMEs. The dynamics environment of an organization demands the organization to consider knowledge as wealth so that it is affected the effort to gain competitive advantage. That condition demands the manager to build organization culture that encourage the creation, dissemination, sharing and utilization of knowledge to achieve superior business performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Boumarafi and Jabnoun 2008)</ref>. Various types of research have tested the issues related to creation, development, codification, storage, distribution, sharing, and utilization of knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Zaim et al. 2013)</ref>. In order to achieve competitive advantage in the market, and to achieve superior business performance, the organization has to identify, search, develop, maintain, and contribute its competencies.</p><p>Market knowledge competence has been admitted as the source of competitive advantage and described as a core competence (C.K. <ref type="bibr">Prahalad and Hamel 1994)</ref>, unique knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Day 1994)</ref>, superior resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Morgan and Hunt 1994)</ref>, and strategic assets <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Barney 1991)</ref>. However, other study investigates the role of market knowledge can be conducted through strategy framework and implementation, and suggested that organizations have to gain information about competitors in order to use the strategy, understanding, creation, selection, implementation and strategy modification that will be implementated by the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kohli and J. Jaworski 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Slater and Narver 1994)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Day (1994)</ref> states that competency is considered as skill and business organizational collective learning of which are used in the business activities process. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Pitt and Clarke (1999)</ref> considers competence as coordinated organization ability, collective skills and capacity from the organizations. In a competitive external environment, an organization needs to learn continuously about new market trend and advanced ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hoe 2008)</ref>. Knowledge is something expensive which becomes advantage comparison among competitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hunt and Morgan 1995)</ref>. However, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hou and Chien (2010b)</ref>, market knowledge has become the biggest asset of an organization and the key to maintain organizational competitiveness. To enable an organization to have an ability to compete effectively, the company has to give the knowledge its own and creating their new market knowledge in choosing and maintaining the market. This research measures market knowledge competence indicators which consist of market information search, fulfillment of market demand, approach to achieve market. Those indicators are the reflection of market knowledge competence.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Framework</head><p>The objects of this study were the entrepreneurs of SMEs furniture industry export oriented in Central Java who develop inter-organizational relationship pattern with the buyers in international market. The analysis unit in this study are the owners or managers, either production or marketing manager. The SMEs furniture industry export oriented managers can represent the views, attitudes, behaviors in conducting relational capabilities and market knowledge competence in the development of value creation to gain higher business performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variable Definitions and Measurement</head><p>To test the hypotheses model, a survey questionnaire was designed on the basis of comprehensive literature reviews to specify a set of items that ensured content validity. The self-administered questionnaire was part of a wider examination of relational capability, market knowledge competence, value creation and business performance. As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Wright et al. (2006)</ref>, the existing scales were adapted, modified, and extended. Because the study was conducted in Indonesia SMEs, the survey instrument was in Central Java. The face to face validity analysis of the questionnaire was tested in a try out with managers or owners of SMEs furniture industry oriented. Furthermore, face to face interviews with these managers or owner were conducted to check the information accuracy, validating the outcome of analysis and developing an understanding of questionnaire. The level of business performance implementation was measured as well. This research used self-reported questionnaires to measure relational capabilities, market knowledge competence, value creation and business performance.</p><p>Relational capabilities. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Day and Van den Bulte (2002)</ref>, relational capabilities is an organizational ability to communicate, coordinate and manage business interaction. All constructs of relational capabilities were measured with multiple and open-ended items scales. Most of the measurements were assessed via ten-point (1 -10) item rating scales ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree of four indicator : personal ties with buyers, information about the product quality with international standard, long-term relationship oriented, relationship on mutual benefits with customers.</p><p>Market knowledge competence. Market knowledge competence is a competence to satisfy the needs of customers through the effectiveness and response to achieve the sustainability for the success of the organization performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jayachandran et al. 2004</ref>). The subjects were asked to indicate, on a ten-point (1 -10) rating scales ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree of our indicator: market information, speed response to market condition, new entry market expansion and customer approach to market achievement.</p><p>Value creation. Value creation is a firms interpretation and response to customer requirements with the delivery of superior product in the value offering and the extent of perceived value customers receive <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(O'Cass and Sok 2013)</ref>. As in previous studies on a ten-point (1 -10) type rating scale used. The researcher developed based on four indicators namely value added of product quality, cost efficiency, product service assurance, and customer response.</p><p>Business performance. Business performance was the result of operational activities organization include the achieve of the internal and external outcomes <ref type="bibr">(Lin and Peng 2008)</ref>. The subjects were asked to indicate on a ten-point (1 -10) rating scale, four indicators: sales volume, sales growth, profitability and market share.</p><p>The research data will be collected consist of primary data and secondary data. Primary data were collected using a survey method with most face to face interviews and questionnaires distribution. Questionnaire that was tested content validity and reliability then performed field trials in order to obtain improved consistency and validity of each instrument.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Sample</head><p>Data gathering was conducted through questionnaires face to face interviews and distribution. The number of total respondents were 305; they were the SMEs managers or owners to fill out the distributed questionnaires. Based on the survey, there were 209 questionnaires which are completely filled out with the level of percentage was 68.5 percent from the total respondents. This research uses four constructs, namely relational capabilities, market access competence, value creation and business performance. In addition, relational capabilities were the only one invalid construct validity. The number of questionnaires that did not meet the qualifications was 24 respondents. There were 209 questionnaires used in the study. However, during data processing, the extreme value was 37 questionnaires, so they were eliminated from the research sample. The total samples of the study were 172 respondents.</p><p>The data were gathered from SMEs furniture industry export oriented in seven regencies in Central Java. Those seven regions represented the regions that are the largest SMEs export oriented groups in Central Java based on the data assessed by Indonesia Furniture <ref type="bibr">Association , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">(ASMINDO, 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis and Measurement models</head><p>The hypotheses test in the study used SEM approach. SEM was used to test the causality relation between relational capabilities, market knowledge competence, value creation and business performance constructs. The test using SEM consists of two kinds of variables, i.e. observable/manifest variable; and latent/non-observable variables. Observable variabel is the indicator which is reflected from construct and latent variable is developed from a construct theory. In evaluating the fit of the model, several goodness-of-fit indices were used; those are normal fit index (NFI); comparative fit index (CFI); Tucker-Lewis index (TLI); root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) in addition to the X 2 statistic. Relational capabilities (Cronbach's α =0.775, VE = 0.592, CR = 0.777, DV =0.770) During this time our company always tries to establish personal ties with buyers My customers (buyers) give information about the product quality with international standardization. My organization always tries to create family-relationship which oriented on long-term relationship My organization always tries to establish relations which are based on mutual benefits with customers. Market Knowledge Competence (Cronbach's α =0.865,VE = 0.559, CR = 0.877, DV =0.748) My tries to search for information related to certain market in order to increase my product. My organization always tries to improve the ability to fulfill market demands. My organization tries the best effort to market my furniture products in a new market. My organization tries to do specific approach to achieve market segmentation. Value Creation (Cronbach's α =0.826,VE = 0.559, CR = 0.877, DV =0.748) My organization and customers (buyer) is able to create value-added about product standard as desired by the customers. My organization always tries to do adjustment in serving the model request to suit the customers. The speed in response customers wish becomes my business main priority. My organization always tries to maintain product quality in fulfilling the changes of customer's product demands. Business Performance (Cronbach's α =0.871,VE = 0.552, CR = 0.883, DV = 0.743) Sales growth has significant enhancement for the last three years. The number of my sales product increased for the last three years. Sales value of my furniture product is increased for the last three The regions of my product market share is increased for the last three years Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> explains the information about the difference of each construct and the question item used, the Cronbach value α on each construct, the loading value of each construct should be more than 0.6 cut off point (J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">F Hair et al. 1998)</ref>. The value of variance extracted (VE) is more than the determined critical value, which is 0.5. The test result of construct validity value, variance extract, and discriminant validity in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows that the result that the construct of relational capabilities, market knowledge competence, value creation and business performance discriminant validity (DV) are based on the determined statistics cut off value that is construct reliability (CR) was more than 0.7, the variance extract (VE) was more than 0.5, and discriminant validity (DV) was more than 0.7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>In order to test empirical research and the difference hypotheses against the structure model, covariance-based path estimation was used, namely structural equation modeling (SEM) based on the Maximum Likelihood Estimation. The overall fit measures showed a good fit of the model; CMIN/Degree of Freedom (X 2 ) = 1.290 (p=0.038), GFI=0.928, AGFI=0.897, CFI=0.981, TLI=0.976, RMSEA=0.041.</p><p>In our study the value of CMIN/DF same as the value of chi-square statistics, X 2 divided by DF. Therefore, CMIN/DF as well as X 2 relatively is less than 2.0. It is an acceptable value, that indicates model and data fit. Based on the estimation of structural equation modeling (SEM), the value of CMIN/DF is 1.290. Therefore, the model is acceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arbuckle, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Mean, standard deviation and correlation among the observed variables are illustrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. With point rating scale from 1 for the lowest performance to 10 for greatest performance, the observed firms have moderate business performance at level 7.2006 of average, relational capabilities, at level 7.5698, market knowledge competence at level 7.6439, value creation at level 7.3205. All constructs also showed moderate level with average rate range at 7 rating scale.</p><p>Reliability test adopts quality criteria, in which the CR measurement showed that all variables have coefficient greater than 0.7. This result implies that all variables are accepted reliability. The measure of average variance extracted <ref type="bibr">(VE)</ref> shows that all variables have greater number than 0.5. This result indicates that all variables are adequate discriminant validity (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows that the path analysis, which indicates that there is no significant relationship between relational capabilities and business performance, since the path-coefficient and probability. The result show t-table with sample greater than 100 shows that t-statistics for two tailed should be 1.96 for alpha 5%. The empirical model illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> has five hypothesized relationship among the variables, namely relational capabilities, customer response capability, value creation and business performance. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the path diagram resulting from the structural equation modeling analysis using AMOS software. The results show that all the measurements have significance loadings to their corresponding second-order construct.</p><p>This study provides empirical model that two is direct effect of relational capabilities and market knowledge competence on business performance. The previous studies support the result and argue that the significant relationships between market knowledge competence on business performance, but relational capabilities are insignificant. Another reason for insignificant relationship may come from statistical approaches, such as outweighed effect from other variables. Moreover, the role of mediating variable may explain the complex relationship between relational capabilities and business performance.</p><p>The results did not support hypotheses 1, which stated that impact of relational capabilities on business performance. The statistical result is insignificant of hypotheses 1(coefficient = 0.342, p&gt;0.05).</p><p>Hypothesis 2 is supported, which indicates that positive impact of market knowledge competence on business performance.The statistical result is significant of hypotheses 2 (coefficient = 0.000, p&lt;0.05).</p><p>Hypothesis 3 is supported, which indicates the impact of relational capabilities on value creation.The statistical result is significant of hypotheses 3 (coefficient=0.012, p&lt;0.05).</p><p>The results indicate the positive impact of market knowledge competence, on value creation, thus confirming Hypotheses 4. The statistical result is significant of hypotheses 4 (coefficient = 0.000, p&lt;0.05).</p><p>Finally, hypotheses 5 are supported, which indicates that impact value creation on business performance.The statistical result is significant of hypotheses 5 (coefficient = 0.000, p&gt;0.05). However, note that the relationship between relational capabilities and business performance is insignificant regardless of the business performance context. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> Showed that relational capabilities have insignificant effect directly to the business performance with the value (β=0.100, CR= 0.949, p&gt;0.05). However, the test result showed that probability &gt; 0.05 which means that relational capabilitiesinsignificant effect on business performance. Furthermore, hypotheses 1 are not supported. Marketknowledge competence has direct effect on business performance with the value (β=0.332, CR=3.404, p&lt;0.05). However, the market knowledge competence is significant to influence on business performance. Hence, hypothesis 2 is supported.</p><p>Relational capabilities directly effect on value creation (β=0.213, CR= 2.502, p&lt;0.05), it means that hypotheses 3 is supported. Market knowledge competence effect on value creation directly (β=0.356, CR= 4.886, p&lt;0.05), which means that hypotheses 4 is supported. Furthermore, we can deduce that value creation has a partial mediating effect on the relation between relational capabilities and business performance, (β=0.533, CR= 3.995, p&lt;0.05) and that support H5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and Implication</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical and practical implications</head><p>The research findings indicate that export oriented SMEs in Indonesia have relation establishment between relational capabilities and value creation, also the relation of market knowledge competence effect on business performance and value creation on business performance. In regard to the determinant of business performance in this study, we use three constructs namely relational capital (RC), Market knowledge competence (MNC) and value creation (VC). The characteristics of SMEs Furniture export oriented need to develop business networking, need to improve the competence to market access mainly related to international market and need to create value-added of products.</p><p>This research also indicates a positive correlation between value creation and business performance as well as inter-organizational relationships. These findings are consistent with earlier research and theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Walter et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">O'Cass and Sok 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Walter et al. (2001)</ref> argue the theoretical considerations and conceptualize value creation is as a set of direct and indirect functions of customer relationships. The functions are characterized with respect to perform activities and employ resources of customers firm.</p><p>The relational capabilities did not support impact to business performance for the SMEs. Furthermore, this study indicate that of the relational capabilities have higher business performance, it was not supported the exported firms typology proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Zohdi et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Ngugi et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Welbourne and Val 2008)</ref>. This study asserts the relational capabilities did not significant effect on SMEs business performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Zohdi et al. 2013)</ref>. Aside from that result, the analysis of internal perspective would be incomplete and it is necessary to add the relational perspective.</p><p>This research indicates a positive relationship between relational capabilities and value creation. This means that the strength of SMEs' relational capabilities can enhance value creation. Based on literature review, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ayios (2004)</ref> argues that a relational capabilities is an organization interaction with others, it is developed by trust and commitment. Moreover, the studies have focused on understanding the behavior of capability relation of the organization and the role of corporate culture in the business relationship. This study analyzes a strength perspective that the role of inter-relationship to be important <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Butler and Purchase 2008)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Morgan and Hunt (1994)</ref>, the organization needs the effort to create trust among its members, and up to higher levels of interpersonal organization. The degree of value creation makes the need to build efficient external relations to be more important. The results regarding the effect of relational capabilities indicate that the development of value creation may result in the relationship between internal capabilities and external capabilities to be positive.</p><p>Market knowledge competence has positive impact on value creation. This study consists of the relationship theories. The inter organization relationship is a competitor relationship and process of adaptability, as a result an organization intention to response its customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Mohd Taisir Masadeh et al. 2014)</ref>. Organization needs a trust as the value of special knowledge, it includes in the process and procedures of organization to anticipate the challenge of globalization. Based on literature review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Banyte and Dovaliene (2014b)</ref>, they both explain that in order to reveal the relations between customer engagement to the value creation and their loyalty to the organization, it could be noticed for researchers' interpretation.</p><p>The results confirm that the development of market knowledge competence is to enhance business performance. These results are in line with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Wu and Choi (2004)</ref> that asserts of mutually relationship and managerial role to enhance performance based on trust and relationship bonding interaction. The result showed that the relationships of the managerial capabilities have a positive impact on trust. Based on relationship marketing theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kanagal (2002)</ref>, the author defines as identification, maintenance, formation and association with customers to customer value creation and the organization of relations with others. The result shows, there is relationship exchange theories that is supported by transaction cost analysis and social exchange theory as indicated in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research</head><p>The result of this study gives contribution on literature review, especially related to value creation in the context of a product as the result of organization business relationship network model and knowledge process on business market. The contribution of this paper that is the mediating effect of value creation in the relationship between relational capabilities on business performance is an important topic in the organization strategy framework that may be used as a conceptual model that could improve decision making. The contribution of this research verifies the effect of relational capabilities on value creation of SMEs export-oriented furniture sector. SMEs furniture export oriented also requires networking through strategic partnership to create mutual value.</p><p>This study seems unfitted to generalize of the results, since they can only be interpreted with regard to the subject population of the study and in the SMEs furniture export orientation. Furthermore, the future of the research should be applied the empirical model of business resources to other processes of the SMEs. Moreover, the measurement of the variables relational capabilities, market knowledge competence and value creation is taken from an analysis of the respondents perceptions indicated in the rating scale type questions on the questionnaire.</p><p>In this regard, it is necessary to use other methodologies, such as the application of qualitative techniques that enable the analysis of the resources based view theory and level of organizational category for more holistic perspective. It is also necessary to develop other constructs and variables that is complement the relational capabilities, value creation, market knowledge competence and business performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>VE = Variance Extracted; CR = Construct Reliability; DV = Discriminant Validity; -= item deleted during the model estimation stage)</figDesc></figure>
