<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Objective/Purpose: The aim of the study is to examine the impact of the big data analytics capabilities (BDAC) on the organizational performance. The study also examines the mediating role of ambidexterity and the moderating role of business value of big data (BVBD) analytics in the relationship between the big data analytics capabilities and the organizational performance. Methodology/Design: This study collected primary data based on a questionnaire survey among the large manufacturing firms operating in UAE. A total of 650 questionnaires were distributed among the manufacturing firms and 295 samples were used for final data analysis. The survey was conducted from September to November in 2019 and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The BDA scalability is supported by the findings on the performance of firm and its determinants such as system, value of business, and quality of information. The role of business value as a moderator and ambidexterity as mediator are found significant. The results reveal that there is a need for managers to consider the business value and quality dynamics as crucial strategic objectives to achieve high performance of the firm. Implications: The study has significant policy implication for practitioners and researchers for understanding the issues related to big data analytics. Originality/Value: This is an original study based on primary data from UAE manufacturing firms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The knowledge management of organizations and old business models are revolutionizing with the emergence of big data <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Khan &amp; Vorley, 2017)</ref>. Different quantities and types of information are included in the form of heterogeneous datasets, which is referred as Big data <ref type="bibr">(Pauleen &amp; Wang, 2017)</ref>. Nowadays, managers have knowledge about their competitors, organization, and customers because of big data emergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Zhang, et al., 2017)</ref>. Managers can monitor each organizational process, assets, units of production and supply chain through the use of big data <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Khan &amp; Vorley, 2017)</ref>. Latest and new data can be accessed from the internet to recognize the potential competitors of the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cappellesso &amp; Thomé, 2019)</ref>. Moreover, big data analysis (BDA) facilitates for the producers in acquiring the information about the behavioral patterns of their customers, complaints, and requests. The behavior of the customers can be accessed at individual and aggregate level, which may change with time. There is need for organizations to develop big data analytics capabilities (BDAC) to source relevant information and use it in the decision-making process.</p><p>A combination of capabilities is included in BDAC of an organization. These may include personnel capabilities, management capabilities, and flexibility of infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jeble et al., 2020)</ref>. Various outcomes are achieved by the organizations, that incorporate BDAC into their operations and models. Consequently, most of the existing studies agreed that the economic performance of an organization is influenced by BDAC. For instance, it was highlighted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mikalef et al. (2018)</ref> that the marketing strategy of an organization and its ability to respond with time for formulation of new strategies is influenced by BDAC. The researchers reflected the way in which new information regarding the customers can improve the performance of an organization. Alternatively, it was demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mikalef et al. (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amado et al. (2018)</ref> that the supply chain management can be revolutionized by BDAC. In a similar way, it was emphasized by <ref type="bibr">Wang et al.(2018a,b,c</ref>) that internal processes and operations of organizations are improved through BDA. It also enhances the efficiency of an organization. The way in which dynamic capabilities are influenced by BDAC was also observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Santoro et al. (2019)</ref>. This indicates the importance of big data information and how it influences the performance of an organization which include the impact it has on the adaptability and capability of an organization. Therefore, most of big data benefits are received by large organization because of their efficient deployment of BDA.</p><p>Despite the information regarding the influence of DBA, there are gaps in the literature. The researchers have started understanding the association between the performance of an organization and BDA development. Here most of the studies are in qualitative or theoretical <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(De Mauro et al., 2018)</ref> or at generally qualitative <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cillo et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Santoro et al., 2019)</ref>. On the other hand, quantitative study on BDA abilities and performance is still in its infancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dubey et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wamba et al., 2017)</ref>. Therefore, the existing literatures on the relation of performance and BDAC are based on using quantitative methods. Therefore, it is important to identify the traits of an organization that can be influenced through BDAC and their influence on organizational performance. Moreover, the factors hindering the implementation of BDA within an organization must be identified. This is the study gap we intend to fill in this paper. Therefore, this study aims at finding out the influences of big data on the performance of large business organizations, particularly from the manufacturing industry of United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p><p>The present study explains the behaviour of big data analytics, Ambidexterity of big data, value of big data and their relationship with performance of manufacturing firms, particularly on the manufacturing firms in UAE. Big data analytics are relatively new in the operations of manufacturing sectors. Hence, more information is needed to understand their relationship with the small and medium enterprises (SME) performance, particularly in the manufacturing sector of UAE, which is one commercial hub in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The study is carried out on the manufacturing industry of UAE, because UAE is one of the biggest business hubs and major consumers and beneficiaries of big data <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(De Mauro et al, 2018)</ref>. This study also selects manufacturing sector, because it is one of the biggest economic sectors in UAE. The study also focused on large business organizations because of their ability to use big data <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Sivarajah et al., 2017)</ref>. Moreover, there is a need for big investments for developing BDAC, which can be done by large organizations only.</p><p>Given the scope of the present study that covers manufacturing firms in UAE, it is expected that the findings contribute to the body of knowledge on big data analytics and performance of manufacturing firms in emerging markets. The adaption of big data analytics in the manufacturing sector of developing markets like UAE is still in the early stage which suggests that big data analytics play a significant role in the performance of manufacturing firms of UAE. Owing to this condition, the phenomena need more explanation as most empirical studies done in developed countries cannot be generalised to the context of emerging market. Hence, the study on big data analytics and performance of manufacturing firms in emerging market is a timely attempt.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Dynamic Capability View</head><p>This study aims to adopt the Dynamic Capability View (DCV) as one of the most significant views in management <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Schilke, 2014)</ref> previously explored in previous studies like <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barney, 1991)</ref>, which is an evolution of the resource-based viewpoint (RBV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Wernerfelt 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barney 1991)</ref>. The RBV emphasizes that companies need to develop abilities to solve obstacles and to achieve competitive advantage. In any event, if dynamic changes arise in ambiguous situations, the typical RBV requires an adequate outline of skills. By preparing suitable tools and abilities to respond to situation-specific changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Teece et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eisenhardt &amp; Martin 2000)</ref>, the DCV solves this void in the traditional RBV, thus resolving the peculiarities of uncertainties. In most competitive settings, the dynamic capability view (DCV) explains the distinct and sustainable advantage of an organization over the other competitors. DCV can be best understood as the capacity of an organization to adapt to ever changing situations by improving internal and external skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Teece et al., 1997)</ref>. Thus, this study is grounded in the theory of DCV and argues that companies should cultivate skills that cannot be imitable and have not only competitive advantages, but also make the company flexible enough to take advantage of technological prospects. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Henderson and Venkatraman (1993)</ref> reasoned that that DCV is an on-going course of revolution rather than a temporary episode. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akter et al. (2016)</ref> concluded that, if the practices are straightforward and adaptive, BDPA can be a competitive capability from which organizations can reach a higher degree of organizational sustainability and edge others out. Some organizations struggle or are unable to achieve their desired result, despite possessing considerable strategic resources. Therefore, the perspective offered by DCV helps organizations to clearly understand how capacity can enhance organizational resilience in conditions of turmoil. According to the DCV, in order to cope with rapidly evolving conditions, companies must have the flexibility to adapt, incorporate, and reconfigure their resources and capabilities. Organizations need to be vigilant in scanning climate conditions to gain the necessary versatility and adaptability to needed to drive those changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Teece et al. 1997)</ref> which, in our study, is appropriate with the incorporation of ambidexterity and business value of big data analytical to achieve organizational performance and prevent potential vulnerabilities in the market. The DCV <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Teece et al. 1997)</ref> emphasizes that market winning firms can rapidly modify their capital and abilities in order to regain skills during difficult times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Big Data</head><p>There is a difference between big data and traditional database. This difference is in the form of variability, variety, velocity, volume, value, veracity, and visualization. The datasets, which are complex and large, are defined by the term big data. The traditional models of statistics cannot analyze big data <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ferraris et al.,2019)</ref>. Big data represents a promising scene for likely gains as far as financial and social worth, as well as a potential source of competitive advantage for associations in the medium and long run <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Grover et al., 2018)</ref>. The first characteristic of big data alludes to the enormous size of information, while the second alludes to its auxiliary heterogeneity. The third characteristic implies its high speed of production. The fourth trait alludes to the inalienable untrustworthiness from certain wellsprings of big information, while the fifth quality alludes to the variety in flow rates, as well as the horde of information sources in such settings. Lastly, the sixth trait alludes to the conceivable worth derived from a refined examination including big data <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gandomi and Haider, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Martens, Provost, &amp;Clark, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, the term enormous information analytics compares to the use of measurable, preparing, and analytical procedures to large information, with the objective of developing business <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ferraris et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Grover et al., 2018)</ref>. Indeed, big data analytics can be characterized as a "… holistic process that involves the collection, analysis, use, and interpretation of data for various functional divisions with a view to gaining actionable insights, creating business value, and establishing competitive advantage … " <ref type="bibr">(Akter et al., 2019, p. 86</ref>). These days, there are a few instances of utilizations of large information analytics in different settings, for example, value creation in supply chain management <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dubey et al., 2019)</ref>, firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Müller et al., 2018)</ref>, business measure management <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dezi et al., 2018)</ref>, and administration advancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lehrer et al., 2018)</ref>, just to make reference to a few. Generally, the ongoing literature in line with the subject gives proof supporting the positive effect of big data on firms' performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Sena, Bhaumik, Sengupta, and Demirbag, 2019)</ref>. As indicated by certain authors, information collected from big data analytics can turn administration frameworks more astute by encouraging learning, dynamic transformation, and decision-making under vulnerability <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akter et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ismagilova, Hughes, Dwivedi, and Raman, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Papa, Mital, Pisano, and Del Giudice, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cegarra-Navarro and Soto-Acosta, 2016)</ref>. Notwithstanding, BDA significance as of today, just not many associations have consolidated big information analytics in their everyday schedules <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Martens et al., 2016)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr">Akter et al. (2019, p. 86)</ref> recommend: "… BDA-based decision making and problem-solving to the most part remain unexplored, requiring thereby further investigation" The primary test identified with big data analytics for professionals and specialists is the manner by which to make an interpretation of large information into important data and business experiencesthrough big data analyticsso as to legitimize the required investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Grover et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the differences between traditional and big data, several challenges are experienced by the organization in the management of big data. To use this information, organizations need to develop architectures of big data <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Sivarajah et al., 2017)</ref>. These are the networks based on different databases, machines, and processors, which can collect, store, process, and analyze the big data <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Khan &amp; Vorley, 2017)</ref>. The data must be based on lakes of data, which are data repository stored in real format. Usually, it is a single store comprising of all data such as transformed data, raw data <ref type="bibr">(Provost &amp; Fawcett,2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Analytical Capabilities, Ambidextrity, Business Value and Organizational Performance</head><p>The information systems are ensembled in BDA infrastructures, which can collect, process, store, and analyze the information from big data. It is ensured by this capability that all the technologies can process the flow of different data and its formats in different situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Provost &amp; Fawcett, 2013)</ref>. For the selection of right infrastructure of big and correct information to be sourced from big data, the managerial capabilities are of key importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ferraris et al., 2019)</ref>. It is important for the managers to make decision about the best technical solution for their organization. In the similar way, there is need for managers to processes analytical skills of data for making right decisions using the available data <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(McAfee et al.,2012)</ref>. For different reasons, the personnel must have skills in BDA. The skilled people can reduce the risk of rejecting BDA by an organization or hindering the use of new information management systems. Moreover, the BDA infrastructure working improves with the presence of skilled people. Moreover, skills are required by employees analyzing the big data. In this way, suitable conclusions can be made from the analysis. Organizations can achieve competitive advantage by such capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jeble et al., 2020)</ref>. It was noted that the BDA benefits are leveraged by organizations, which make huge investments. This investment capability is not possessed by small and medium businesses. These businesses cannot invest in data lakes or parallel computing, and training of personnel <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amado et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>It is already mentioned that the BDAC are linked with the structural aspect, infrastructure of BDA, dynamics of an organization, and HR management. The organizational routines are linked with the managerial and personnel BDAC. The existing researches on BDA are adopted for the main theoretical approach of dynamic capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Wamba et al., 2017)</ref>. The term dynamic capabilities was used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Teece, 2012)</ref> which is regarded as the ability of an organization to adapt with the environmental changes and time through changes in the resources, internal or external processes as well as strategies. According to some definitions, dynamic capabilities are linked with the improvisation of an organization. These are based on specific and identifiable routines <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Teece, 2018)</ref>. Some processes and routines of an organization can diffuse into the best organizational practices. Routines of an organization can be split into small processes, which can act as bricks in the process. Specifically, the personnel and managerial BDA practices reflect the bricks, which can be used in various circumstances. Therefore, an organization may achieve competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Rialti et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The infrastructures of BDA are inter-operable, flexible, scalable, and adaptable to various types of data. Moreover, these ensure effective information flow with time in any circumstances. The way in which the performance of a firm is influenced by BDAC is clear <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Wamba et al., 2017)</ref>. This finding is consistent with the studies analyzing the creation of value through BDA. As distinguished previously, ambidexterity "is vital to pursue both […] exploration and exploitation for its innovative redesign of operational processes and continuous productivity improvement simultaneously" <ref type="bibr">(Lee et al., 2015, p. 402)</ref>. Studies have also revealed that dynamic capabilities can have a positive effect on a firm's performance because they are suggestive of a superior level of organizational ambidextrousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(O'Reilly and Tushman, 2008)</ref>. Organizations that can re-arrange current routines and resources to tackle new difficulties are also capable of identifying changes in the environment and exploit opportunities. Dynamic capabilities related to BDA capabilities could progress their aptitude to recognize new threats and opportunities <ref type="bibr">(Mikalef et al., 2019)</ref>. Data removed as a result of BDA permits businesses to detect new opportunities and benefit from them <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Rialti et al., 2018)</ref>. According to the same reasoning, information management systems that can adjust to diverse situations and information may also benefit organizations recognize and exploit new opportunities (Lu and Ramamurthy, 2011). Similarly, firms can recognize and use opportunities through the use of information management systems, which can adapt with various situations. Resultantly, the performance could be influenced by ambidexterity. It may act an intervening variable between the performance and BDAC of an organization. Therefore, the following hypotheses can be formulated: H1: BDAC has significant impact on the organization performance H2: AMB (ambidexterity) has significant impact on the organization performance H3: BDAC has significant impact on the AMB H4: AMB mediates the relationship between BDAC and organizational performance According to Resource-Based View (RBV), when the resources of an organization are rare, valuable, and imitable, it can achieve competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Howson, 2013</ref>). An increased attention was given by the analysis of firm performance and business value created from technological resources in BDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kiron et al., 2014)</ref>. The value of business and performance of a firm was identified by RBV as the key variables after capabilities and resources. Previous study suggested that complementarity of resource such as the advantages of the quality of a system can be achieved through quality of information. This can contribute in improved business performance and business value <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen et al., 2014)</ref>. The potential influence on firm performance and business value by big data has increased attention towards this concept. When the performance of a firm is superior to its competitors, the firm is said to have a competitive advantage. Consistent with the RBV perspective, it can be proposed that competitive advantage can be indicated by high firm performance and business value in big data environment. Therefore, it is considerable to differentiated between performance of a firm and business value. These must be distinguished from resources such as quality of information and quality of system to understand the net of nomology.</p><p>Literatures proposed different concepts of business values emerging from resources of technology. Three types of business value were identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Parasuraman et al. (2018)</ref> including automation, transformation, and information. The IT value of business was conceptualized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Teece (2012)</ref> in the form of strategic, informational, and transactional advantages. Researchers argued that the resources of technology are crucial determinants of business value in the form of effectiveness and efficiency of business processes. This influences the overall performance of a firm. It was found by previous studies that business value is created through technology resources, which improves the overall business performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(García-Morales et al.,2012)</ref>. Collectively, the business value of BDA was defined as the advantages achieved in the form of information, strategy, and information. The focus of transactional value is on improving the efficiency and reduction of cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Garmaki et al., 2016)</ref>. The focus of informational value is on decision making with respect to time. However, the strategic value is based on achieving competitive advantage.</p><p>For instance, it was argued by <ref type="bibr">Wang et al. (2018a, b, c</ref>) that healthcare industry was transformed by predictive analytics of BDA to reduce cost. The healthcare sector developed the capability to offer better quality care services and reduce fraud and wastage of resources. Similarly, it was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Howson (2013)</ref> that both the tangible and intangible benefits can be improved through business value from BDA. The intangible benefits occur in the form of improved repute of business <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Basheer et al.,2018)</ref>. A recent study showed that operating margins could be increased by BDA up to 60% when there is a match between value, performance, and quality. For instance, the creation of new products and services could be increased (70%) by organization with BDA, the new market expansion can be done by 72%, and the needs of customers could be satisfied by 79%, sales and revenue could be improved by 76% through the use of a reliable information and quality system <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akter et al.,2016)</ref>. Therefore, the following hypothesis are also considered: H5: BVBD has significant impact on the organizational performance H6: BVBD moderates the relationship between BDAC and organizational performance</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data</head><p>To test our hypotheses, this study utilized data from manufacturing firms in UAE. A total of 650 questionnaires were distributed among the manufacturing firms. The response rate is 45.4 percent, which is considerably higher than the minimum response rate of 30 percent. The final analysis was based on 295 samples. The data was collected during the period from September-November in 2019.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Measurement of Variables</head><p>A 17-item scale was used for measuring BDAC of an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Wamba et al., 2017)</ref>. The BDAC of an organization were regarded as a variable of second order in line with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Mikalef &amp; Pateli, 2017)</ref>. The flexibility of BDA infrastructure comprised of 6 items, personnel expertise of BDA comprised of 5 items, and management BDAC based on 6 items. All these variables were of first order. An 8-item scale was used to determine the ambidexterity of an organization. Ambidexterity was considered as the only variable of first order based on the suggestion. Two unobserved variables i.e. exploitative innovation and explorative innovation were used to create the ambidexterity variable of first order. A 7-point Likert scale was used by respondents. The number 7 reflected strongly agree and number 1 strongly disagree. To dodge non-respond predisposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Rogelberg and Stanton, 2007)</ref>, we have shown the questionnaire to academic researchers and industry experts with a solid foundation in either big data or information management systems. We made this move to guarantee that the questionnaire was carefully organized, simple to finish, of a sufficient length, and had clear and unambiguous inquiries <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Laudano et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Model Assessment</head><p>This study analyzed data based on partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). PLS-SEM is a distinct technique that makes it possible to estimate complex models with many constructs, indicator variables and structural paths without imposing distributional assumptions on the data <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2019, p. 3</ref>). The PLS-SEM comprises of two basic assessment namely the measurement model and structural model. The reliability and validity of the model is explained in the measurement model whereas the nature and strength of the relationship is explained through the structural model. This study also checks data reliability and validity test with model efficiency tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results and Analysis</head><p>PLS-SEM analysis starts with the assessment of measurement model or outer model as it is commonly referred to. The assessment of outer model confirms the individual item reliability, internal consistency, content and convergent validity, and discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hair et al., 2011)</ref>. In other words, evaluation of the outer model verifies whether the survey items measure the constructs they were intended to measure, hence ensuring the validity and reliability of the measure. Obviously, outer model analysis is concerned with appraisal of the goodness of measures. In this study, the outer model was used to evaluate the reliability and validity of the construct measures using PLS-SEM Algorithm. Accordingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hair et al. (2013)</ref> suggest that reliability and validity are the two prime criteria used in PLS-SEM analysis to assess the goodness of the outer model.</p><p>The convergent validity is usually explained through the outer loadings. To confirm the convergent validity, the items namely BDAC-15, BVBD -2, AMB-2, P8, and P-12 with loading below 0.7 were deleted from the analysis. The outer loading values are shown in the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and the measurement model of the current study is shown in the Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.  The discriminant validity of the measures was examined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref>. The results in the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> indicates that the cross-diagonal values are greater than other values, which confirms the validity of the model. Subsequent to the general assessment of the measurement model (outer model), specifically when the latent variables satisfied the suggested reliability and validity index, then the following stage was assessment of the structural model (inner model). The evaluation of the structural model involved measuring the model's predictive capabilities and abilities to measure relationships between the constructs. Accordingly, inner model assessment involved the determination of the latent variables' path coefficients, coefficients of determination, effect size and the model'spredictive relevance After the acescent of the measurement model, the next step is the assessment of structural model. The structural Model of the current study is shown in the Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The study used 5000 bootstraps to examine the direct, mediating and moderating relationships between and among the variables.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussions</head><p>This study shows that BDAC has significant impact on the organization performance. The traditional models of statistics cannot analyze big data <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ferraris et al.,2019)</ref>. Based on the differences between traditional and big data, several challenges are experienced by the organization in the management of big data. Furthermore, this research shows the way in which the large organizations can re-shape their structure through BDAC. Particularly, the skills, processes, and infrastructure for sourcing important information from big data enables large organizations to recognize the market opportunities <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2018a, b, c)</ref>. Different insights are given by the research for the relation of big data and performance of a firm.</p><p>The findings show a positive influence created by BDA derived ambidexterity of an organization on the performance, because organizations can respond to the environmental changes in a rapid manner by performing better than competitors. This is in line with the studies based on the potential of information to create value for the organization and influence of big data, incorporated dynamic capabilities as the theoretical base <ref type="bibr">(O'Really and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Tushman, 2008 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wamba et al., 2017)</ref>. This discovering agrees with past studies on organizational ambidexterity. Without a doubt, the more data an association can get about the condition of the market, the more it may be able to identify new opportunities and develop new strategies to exploit them <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Rialti et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mikalef et al., 2019)</ref>. As an association turns out to be more equipped for achieving these objectives, it might likewise turn out to be more powerful and receptive to changes. Ambidextrous associations can grow new contributions in a shorter timeframe and rearrange lean supply chains as a result of changes in client demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Weber and Tarba, 2014)</ref>. Especially, this is evident when ambidextrous extracted from ad-hoc data frameworks permits an organization to gather, measure and convey data from outside of the association to its internal individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lee et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The findings also show that the BDAC has significant impact on the AMB and the BDAC of an organization can be developed and improved with the help of ambidexterity which is in line with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Raguseo and Vitari, 2018)</ref>. The results are consistent with previous studies Found in the current literature. With the help of information about the market circumstances, the organization can explore market opportunities and identify threats for the formulation of new opportunities <ref type="bibr">( Lu and Ramamurthy, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Rialti et al., 2018 and</ref><ref type="bibr">Mikalef et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>When the organization achieves these objectives, it can respond quickly to the external changes. Thus, our study enhances the literature about organizational BDA capabilities and a firm's performance by discovering how ambidexterity can benefit organizations remove information from big data that they can utilize to improve their performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Gupta and George, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Rialti et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wamba et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>This study highlighted the role of AMB as a mediates the relationship between BDAC and organizational performance. New offerings can be developed by the ambidextrous organization within a short time. Such organizations can re-organize the activities and supply chains with respect to the changes in the demands of customers. When the ambidexterity is derived from unplanned information systems, the company can gather, process, and disperse external information to the internal organizational members. Therefore, the study extended the regarding the BDAC of an organization and performance of a firm through identifying the way in which BVBD and ambidexterity support the information in using big data to improve performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lamberti &amp; Pero, 2019)</ref>. The literature is extended by the findings on dynamic capabilities and big data through incorporating mediating variables to understand the complicated dynamics in the hypothesized relations. The ultimate outcome of the firm's performance, which is also a challenge, is to be recognized and able to follow the best BDA practices over the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akter et al., 2016)</ref>. Henceforth, organizational big data capabilities are linked to wider dynamic aptitudes and the capability of the organization to flourish in the competitive market <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gunasekaran et al., 2018)</ref>. This research also contributes to the current literature about the organizational features that avert or endorse the successful implementation of big data <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hashem et al., 2015)</ref> by presenting the diverse impacts of organizational resistance to the application of information management systems and the fit among the organization and such schemes. Information about these two features should support practitioners and researchers measure whether an association will prosper or flop in utilizing big data.</p><p>The researchers who have studied and claimed about the importance of information in terms of value-generating potential and the researchers who have examined the influence of big data through the dynamic capabilities as their important theoretical frameworks have presented the same results. This theoretical research highlighted certain points such as matter and firm's ambidexterity. Thus, the progress in organizational BDA capabilities would support large businesses during their hunt for ambidexterity. Therefore, when the business has gained more information about the condition of marketplace, it would support organizations to recognize and achieve more new opportunities after generating new strategies according to the market state, such as the organization are enables to achieve more targets, and the organization are developed to be more responsive and dynamic towards the market fluctuations. In a very short duration of time the ambidextrous organizations would generate new opportunities and as per the change in demand of consumer their supply chain would manage to reform. Specially, it is a fact that if the ambidexterity estimated from some ad-hoc system of information, it would support the organization to distribute information, process and collection from the external resources to its in-house agents.</p><p>There are flexibilities in investments that are made by large companies in BDA infrastructures. Value is created by BDA infrastructures when it is ensured that information flow is smooth with time <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Garmaki et al., 2016)</ref>. The BDA infrastructures should be capable of gathering information, storing and analyzing with respect to different circumstances. Moreover, these must be operable with each other to ensure the communication quality in the form of sharing data between the firm and its partners. It is also recommended that all the parts of the organizations should be able to access the data lakes. The best solution for making the availability of big data for everyone is through data lakes. Another solution is architectures based on cloud computing, which are outsourced. These architectures hinder the organization from depending on the internal systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Basheer et al., 2018)</ref>. The patterns from the datasets, which are not structured, can be extracted automatically by machine learning and artificial intelligence without the support of human.</p><p>Based on the findings, it is recommended that the large companies should go for an investment in BDA, especially in the growth of flexible BDA infrastructure. Certainly, BDA infrastructures could be developed when they can guarantee the move of information timely without any sort of disruptions. These infrastructures should be enabled to gathered, analyze and store data of any type at any condition. Additionally, they should be inter-operable because they could guarantee the quality of communication in the data such as sharing type among its partners and the company. However, the research recommended that information technology (IT) solutions such as data lakes is available to every section of the companies. Data lakes are possibly the great way-out to develop availability of big data. Cloud computing-based architectures, mostly on outsourced cloud computing platforms are also a better opportunity, because they make companies to avoid the dependency on the in-house systems. Without the intervention by the human the artificial intelligence and the skills to operate machine might be possible to enable them to extract data patterns automatically from the unstructured datasets.</p><p>In fact, BDA infrastructures which are considered as a significant variable of BDA capabilities, motivate the agility and ambidexterity of large businesses. These results develop conflicts upon the general opinion about the information management systems (such as BDA infrastructures). Certainly, the common review of this research is that the information management systems are generally dependent on fixed infrastructures which may be obstruct the organizational dynamism. One clarification about the difference of opinion might be that because of their technical features the BDA infrastructures determine and improve functional performance as compare to the general information management systems. BDA infrastructures depends upon the data lakes or the internet stuff, cloud computing in fact they depend on the reformer architectures as compare to the general information management systems.</p><p>Furthermore, the BDA infrastructure playing important role in the organization which is enhance the skills that need to recognize the new offerings, catching the market opportunities and react dynamically towards the market fluctuations. According to the study it is the fact that large organizations are generally less flexible and more rigid as compare to medium-size and small organizations, Moreover, BDA infrastructures might be giving a good solution for this issue due to the reason that they are more convenient as compare to the traditional information management systems. Certainly, BDA infrastructures may possibly enhance communication among various large organizations units, support then to react timely upon the problems and achieve new offering in a right time.</p><p>Moreover, the focus of managers also should be on the people who are behind the infrastructures of BDA. The notion of BDA should be embraced by the entire organization. This goal can be achieved through improving the creative skills of the employees through competitions for solving the problems related to BDA. Some other ways to achieve the objective are flexibility of procedures and investment in collaborative projects through use of information management systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Teece, 2018)</ref>. It is recommended to the managers that they empower people with high problem-solving skills related to the processes of big data using their potentialities. Moreover, success can be achieved by right people with right skills and right data <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ferraris et al.,2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>The outcomes from this study pointed out how the framework of reform in large companies with the organizational BDA. Mostly, the study presented that the skills, infrastructures, and processes obtained the significant statistics from a survey of large data which support large businesses to recognize and achieve the opportunities well in the marketplace. This study deals with the different understandings in an association among a firm's performance and big data. The significant role of these findings from this research presented that how performance had a positive impact by the organizational ambidexterity and derive the BDA capabilities. The reason behind this concept is very clear, it showed that when a business has skills to react upon the market fluctuations timely then it performs better as compare to its competitors The study will be helpful for the policy makers and business managers in understanding the role of big analytics in increasing the organizational performance. The study signifies the role of ambidexterity in the relation of big data and economic performance. Furthermore, the study shows the significance of BDA in aching ambidexterity is underscored by this impact. Therefore, investments in infrastructures of BDA will help in improving the overall performance of the organization, and development of capabilities related to BDA at every level of the workforce is very important to improve the performance of the organization. Practitioners should realize the approach that either a firm will gain achievement or failure by using information derived from big data. Consequently, this study is very useful to understand the BDA performance mostly in the large businesses.</p><p>The research findings must consider few limitations. As the present study has used a survey questionnaire method including cross sectional data that was collected at a single point in time, future study might choose longitudinal data collection method in order to expand the research scope. Current study has chosen manufacturing firms but in future other services sectors might be chosen for further investigation of these relationships earn their influence on organizational performances. Moreover, the current study is done on UAE's manufacturing sector, thus these findings might not applicable to all the cultures around the globe due to cultural biasness between different nations. The current study has employed Ambidexterity of big data as mediator between relationship of big data analytics and performance of manufacturing firms in UAE. Future studies might use other mediators like big data value creation, big data management capability and big data investment. Consequently, business value of big data is used as moderator between big data analytics and performance of manufacturing firms in UAE. Moreover, further investigate should be extended by focusing on medium and small size companies to check if the findings of this study based on large size firm is valid for them.     </p></div>
