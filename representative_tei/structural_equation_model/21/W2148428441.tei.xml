<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Behavioural syndromes, correlations of behaviours conceptually analogous to personalities, have been a topic of recent attention due to their potential to explain trade-offs in behavioural responses, apparently maladaptive behaviour and limits to plasticity. Using Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami ), we assessed the explanatory power and generality of hypothesized syndrome structures derived from the literature and the natural history of the species. Several aspects of functionally distinct behavioural responses of D. merriami were quantified. Syndrome structures were compared using structural equation modelling and model selection procedures. A domain-general behavioural syndrome incorporating crossfunctional relationships between measures of boldness, agonistic behaviour, flexibility and food hoarding best explained the data. This pattern suggests that D. merriami behaviours should not be viewed as discrete elements but as components of a multivariate landscape. Our results support arguments that a lack of independence between behaviours may be a general aspect of behavioural phenotypes and suggest that the ability of D. merriami's behaviour to respond to selection may be constrained by underlying connections.</p></div>

Syndrome or personality differences between individuals are well recognized in humans and have been identified in a wide variety of other animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Mather &amp; Anderson 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gosling 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dingemanse et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bell 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Stapley &amp; Keogh 2005)</ref>.

Syndrome characteristics may be highly variable between species and environments and have important ecological and evolutionary implications due to the inherent trade-offs of a syndrome structure <ref type="bibr">(Sih et al. 2004a</ref>). These trade-offs result from correlations between behaviours, implying that selective pressures cannot operate on single behavioural responses independently <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lande &amp; Arnold 1983)</ref>. Depending on the nature of the correlation, one or more behavioural responses may be prevented from reaching local optima in order for the suite of behaviours to reach a multivariate maximum <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Roff &amp; Fairbairn 2007)</ref>. Further, behavioural syndromes that constrict plasticity and response options for individuals may represent frequency-or density-dependent effects or be alternative strategies maintained by multiple optima <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Price &amp; Langen 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sinervo &amp; Lively 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Since behavioural syndrome structures have been described in multiple species, we can now ask whether previously described structures are present across taxa. This will eventually allow the use of phylogenetic methods to more properly determine the ecological, developmental and phylogenetic determinants of behavioural syndromes.</p><p>To determine the generality of syndrome structures, we tested hypothesized syndrome structures in Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami ). Kangaroo rats are appropriate species for syndrome research because they exhibit extensive intraspecific behavioural variation (e.g. alternative food caching behaviours and mating strategies; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jenkins et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Randall et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Murray et al. 2006)</ref>, and the wide distribution of some species, including D. merriami, may necessitate diverse coping strategies within and between populations to deal with variation in local conditions.</p><p>We quantified behavioural responses from three functional contexts in D. merriami. First, we measured a proxy for status in agonistic interactions and intraspecific aggression. Agonistic behaviour towards conspecifics is often a defining characteristic of behavioural syndromes and may help in defining the trade-offs of complex syndromes <ref type="bibr">(Sih et al. 2004b)</ref>. Second, we quantified the seed caching behaviour of individuals. D. merriami stores seeds in scatter hoards (numerous dispersed caches) or larder hoards (one location, typically a burrow; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jenkins et al. 1995)</ref>. Caching behaviour affects survival because individual D. merriami store food for later use during periods of low availability, exhibiting a range of expression between complete larder hoarding and complete scatter hoarding <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">( Jenkins et al. 1995)</ref>. We also quantified the intra-individual flexibility exhibited in caching behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Asendorpf 1990</ref>). Finally, we quantified the foraging behaviour in the presence of a predator stimulus as a measure of boldness, a frequent component of syndromes <ref type="bibr">(Sih et al. 2004a,b)</ref>.</p><p>We tested hypothesized structures of behavioural syndromes containing responses from the above behaviours. These included syndromes analogous to the shy-bold continuum <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">( Wilson et al. 1994)</ref>, alternatives <ref type="bibr">(Sih et al. 2004b</ref>) and an unstructured null model of behavioural independence. Syndrome structures were compared using structural equation modelling (SEM) and AIC-based model comparison <ref type="bibr">(Burnham &amp; Anderson 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Johnson 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Shipley 1999)</ref>. This combination of SEM and model comparison allowed the first explicit testing of multiple proposed models of syndromes in behavioural ecology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MATERIAL AND METHODS</head><p>Nineteen adult male D. merriami were obtained from locations 70 km east of Reno, Nevada and housed and tested in the animal care facility of the Department of Biology, University of Nevada, Reno. Only adult male D. merriami were used to avoid the possibility of conflating individual differences with sex or age differences. Animals were individually housed with a 12 : 12 light : dark cycle and fed ad libitum quantities of bird seed except during limited fasting periods (see §2a(ii)). Trapping was conducted over a one-month period and behavioural trials commenced two months after all individuals were collected and brought into the laboratory. All behavioural testing occurred during dark time periods.</p><p>(a) Behavioural tests (i) Agonistic behaviour We quantified status in agonistic interactions as represented by response to mirror-image stimulation (MIS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Svendsen &amp; Armitage 1973</ref>). MIS response is strongly related to agonistic behaviour during staged pairwise encounters of D. merriami <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hargett 2006</ref>) and has been used to assess behavioural syndromes in other species <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Armitage &amp; Van Vuren 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Blumstein et al. 2006</ref>). In addition, MIS standardizes the stimulus to which a subject responds to an image of equal size; thus, measures of aggression are not confounded by size differences between the focal subject and a conspecific.</p><p>We conducted MIS testing in 1.2!1.2 m arenas with a small dish containing 10 g of millet seed along a wall of the arena that also had a covered mirrored surface extending 11.7 cm in height and 1.2 m in length. A rock and branch were located in the half of the arena farthest from the mirrored wall. These objects provided visual refuge from reflections. We released a subject into the back-right (relative to the mirror) quadrant of the arena and allowed it to explore the arena for 10 min. At the end of this acclimation period, the curtain was removed from over the mirror and we continuously recorded the subject's behaviour for 15 min <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Martin &amp; Bateson 1999)</ref>. For the purpose of comparing the models of syndrome structure, we used the time taken by an individual to resume activity after viewing its reflection as a response variable (latency). Latency is negatively correlated with aggression levels and dominance status <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hargett 2006</ref>) and we considered it a measure of aggressiveness and response towards conspecifics. Individuals with lower latency times were more likely to attack their mirror image and were more active in the half of the arena containing the mirror. Conversely, individuals with higher latency times froze or fled from their reflections. Elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hargett 2006)</ref>, D. merriami with lower latency times were also found to be more aggressive towards conspecifics and vice versa.</p><p>(ii) Variation in caching strategy Individual variation in caching behaviour was determined by quantifying patterns of seed caching in 1.45 m 2 arenas. Caching behaviour was observed in the presence of differing cues of conspecific presence. Arenas were filled to a depth of 2.5 cm with fine sand and had a mesh screen on top of a removable wooden floor <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">( Jenkins et al. 1995)</ref>. Artificial burrows built of opaque PVC pipe were provided to individuals during caching trials.</p><p>Subjects were placed in arenas and provided with 20 g of millet seed in a small dish after a 10-h fasting period. After one complete dark cycle, the individual was removed and the locations and masses of seed caches recorded. This procedure was repeated for four trials per subject with each trial differing by cue of conspecific presence (see below). Each trial was separated by one week.</p><p>Four different cues of conspecific presence were used during trials to determine the differences in caching behaviour under different levels of perceived pilferage risk. First, we assessed caching behaviour in the presence of conspecific olfactory cues. An area surrounding the seed dish of approximately 625 cm 2 contained sand in which conspecifics had scent marked. Second, we assessed caching behaviour in the presence of conspecific visual cues by recording caching behaviour when one wall of the arena had a mirror extending 1.2 m along its length and 11.7 cm vertically. This mirror simulated the presence of a conspecific <ref type="bibr">(Svendsen &amp; Armitage 1973 and above)</ref>. The seed dish was placed along the middle of the mirrored wall. Third, we assessed caching behaviour in the presence of both visual and olfactory cues by combining the above two treatments. Finally, we assessed caching behaviour in the absence of visual and olfactory cues. Testing order was determined by random assignment of individuals to a testing sequence generated by a 4!4 Williams square (Diaz-Uriarte 2002). We will describe differential responses to different conspecific cues in greater detail in subsequent publications.</p><p>We used a simulation model to compute a spatial index of the dispersion of caches in scatter hoards and the larder hoard as an estimate of vulnerability of caches to pilferage. The spatial index was the minimum time required for complete exploitation of food caches by a simulated naive forager searching, using area concentrated search, for the caches made by the focal subject <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Reid &amp; Staddon 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jenkins in preparation)</ref>. Simulated individuals searched randomly, with a preference for moving along the edge of an arena <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">( Jenkins &amp; Breck 1998)</ref>. Upon finding a cache, the simulated individual searched the immediate area first and resumed random search if no additional caches were found. This index integrated the size, number and spatial dispersion of caches as well as the amount of seeds larder versus scatter hoarded. Individuals who predominantly scatter hoarded seeds and did so in many small and dispersed caches had the highest index scores.</p><p>We used two response variables based on these spatial scores in subsequent testing of syndrome structure: the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) of an individual's spatial pattern of caching and intra-individual flexibility in spatial pattern of caching. We calculated BLUPs from mixed-model analysis in which the individual was included as a random effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kruuk 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Reale &amp; Martin in press)</ref>. BLUPs provided an estimate of an individual's 'behavioural profile' <ref type="bibr">(Reale &amp; Martin in press</ref>) after removing fixed effects (e.g. conspecific cue treatment). We measured intra-individual flexibility using the variance of an individual's rank transformed spatial scores across the four trials (I var ). High values of I var represented larger within individual variation (greater flexibility in response) while small I var values represented less variation (less flexibility). This value was a non-parametric extension to more than two measurements of 'individual consistency' as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Asendorpf (1990)</ref>, and is a measure of individual flexibility.</p><p>(iii) Response to a predator stimulus We determined behavioural responses to predation threat by observing foraging in the presence of a cue of predator presence. Individuals were introduced into a 0.7!0.7 m arena and allowed to remain in a nesting chamber and to emerge on their own. As in other tests, various 'natural' structures were located throughout the arena. Sand saturated with 2.5 ml of coyote urine diluted with water to a total volume of 10 ml was used as a simulated predator cue. This sand was located along the centre of the far wall (in relation to the nest chamber), and 10 g of hulled sunflower seeds were placed on top of the saturated sand. D. merriami have previously demonstrated alteration in foraging patterns to similar cues of predation risk, although individual differences in response were not explicitly examined <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Herman &amp; Valone 2000)</ref>. We allowed each individual access to the arena for a period of 10 min during which time behaviours were continuously recorded <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Martin &amp; Bateson 1999)</ref>. After 10 min, we removed the individual from the arena and recorded the mass of seed harvested as a measure of boldness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(b) Data analysis</head><p>We compared a priori hypotheses of syndrome structure using a combination of SEM incorporating latent variables and information-theoretic (I-T) model comparison using AMOS 5.0 (SPSS, Chicago; Shipley 1999; <ref type="bibr">Burnham &amp; Anderson 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Johnson 2002)</ref>. We used four observed variables (described above) to construct structural equation models (SEMs) representing behavioural syndromes (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Where appropriate we transformed variables prior to SEM analyses (e.g. MIS latency time). Relative explanatory power of the models was compared, penalizing for complexity, using differences in AIC scores (lower scores indicated greater statistical support; <ref type="bibr">Burnham &amp; Anderson 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Richards 2005)</ref>. The SEMs with the lowest AIC scores were considered representative of the syndrome/personality structure of D. merriami. Models with AIC scores differing from that of the lowest score by more than two (i.e. DAICO2) were considered to be unsupported statistically <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Richards 2005)</ref>.</p><p>AIC values were calculated using likelihood discrepancies based on 1000 bootstraps. Bootstrapping was used to calculate likelihood because we assumed multivariate non-normality. To conduct bootstrapping, three missing values (for the amount of seed collected in the presence of a stimulus of predator presence) were replaced with randomly generated values to allow inclusion of data from all individuals. Values were drawn from a normal distribution using the mean and variance from observed trials (model comparison results were concordant across multiple sets of randomly generated values).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(c) Behavioural syndrome structures</head><p>We constructed the following eight models (approx. 10% of all possible models) of hypothesized syndrome structures based on the syndrome literature (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS</head><p>All behavioural measures differed considerably between individuals (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Data differed from normal distributions according to Ryan-Joiner tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">( Filliben 1975)</ref> for individual flexibility in cache spatial structure (RZ0.933, pZ0.022; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>) and, despite transformation, an individual's conspecific response (log-transformed latency time, RZ0.896, p!0.01; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>). Distributions of boldness (seed gathering in the presence of a predator cue) and the spatial pattern of seed caching did not differ significantly from normal (RZ0.989, pO0.1 and RZ0.9641, pO0.1, respectively). The shape of behavioural response distributions also varied considerably (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). While an individual's conspecific response appeared generally unimodal (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>), other behaviours appeared to be more unevenly distributed, with boldness possibly bimodal (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref> ). Spearman correlations between behavioural responses ranged from small to medium strengths (table 1; Cohen 1992). Since we utilized an I-Tapproach to compare models of syndrome structure, correlation probability values are not explicitly considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson et al. 2001)</ref>. The strongest correlation (rhoZK0.282) was between the amount of seed gathered while in the presence of a predator cue (boldness) and conspecific response (mirror image latency; table 1). The direction of the relationship indicated that individuals who collected more seed while in the presence of a predator cue also had shorter latency after first viewing a mirror image. In other words, bolder individuals resumed activity more quickly after the perceived appearance of a conspecific. Correlation coefficients (rhoZ0.196 for both; table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) also suggested that boldness and conspecific response were connected with the spatial pattern of seed caches (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Bolder individuals had a more dispersed cache spatial pattern, as did individuals with longer latencies (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Finally, individuals with lower conspecific response scores (i.e. more aggressive individuals) exhibited less intra-individual variation in caching spatial pattern (rhoZK0.150; table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(a) Structural equation model comparison</head><p>We compared eight different models of behavioural syndromes (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). These models differed in complexity (table 2, 'K ' was the number of parameters estimated) and in whether they incorporated cross-contextual/ cross-functional relationships. Despite relatively small correlations, the domain-general syndrome (model 7; figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) had the lowest AIC score and best explained the observed data (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). This model also statistically differed from the null model of behavioural independence (model 1; figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) according to a drop-in-deviance test (deviance df4 Z10.26, pZ0.036).</p><p>Two additional syndrome structures required consideration due to DAIC values less than 2 (models 5 and 3; table 2 and figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Both structures incorporated domain-general relationships between aggression and either caching responses or boldness (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).While the three top models cannot be conclusively distinguished from one another, jointly they provide strong support for the presence of a domain-general syndrome in D. merriami.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head><p>Using the novel and generalizable approach of combining SEM and I-T model comparison, we demonstrated that D. merriami exhibits a domain-general syndrome incorporating behaviours related to food provisioning, conspecific interaction, predation and flexibility (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The pattern of correlations between behaviours within this syndrome was generally consistent with previous research. As in other rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Koolhaas et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Koolhaas et al. , 1999))</ref>, this syndrome connected boldness to response towards conspecifics. Bolder individuals exhibited lower latency to respond to their mirror image, suggesting that bolder individuals were more aggressive and potentially socially dominant. The negative relationship between aggression and flexibility is also consistent with other reports that aggressive and bold individuals exhibited less flexibility and ability to respond to changing environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Koolhaas et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Koolhaas et al. , 1999))</ref>. The model comparison results and associated correlation coefficients also suggested that connections between boldness and flexibility may have been mediated through conspecific aggression. Further, the model comparison results (table 2) support arguments that behaviours from different functional contexts covary and are constrained in their plasticity by their connections to other behaviours and that domain-general syndromes may be common among organisms <ref type="bibr">(Sih et al. 2004a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bell 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Our results also suggest that the combination of I-T and SEM is a more powerful approach to testing behavioural syndrome hypotheses than is the use of bivariate correlation coefficients. Our approach detected  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The SEM approach also avoided concerns regarding type I error inflation, an issue in syndrome research <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bell 2007)</ref>, by considering a restricted subset of a priori models <ref type="bibr">(Anderson &amp; Burnham 2002)</ref>. Given that D. merriami exhibited a domain-general behavioural syndrome, it is likely that the correlated nature of behaviours affects D. merriami survival and reproductive success, and results in fitness trade-offs between behavioural responses for the species <ref type="bibr">(Sih et al. 2004a,b)</ref>. For example, response towards predator cues probably directly impacts survival of D. merriami and indeed the species has been observed to avoid preferred areas where predators are perceived to have been present <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Herman &amp; Valone 2000)</ref>. Similarly, food hoarding has been considered an important adaptation for D. merriami (and other heteromyids) as it allows individuals to survive through periods of low food availability <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">( Jenkins et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Jenkins &amp; Breck 1998)</ref>. Levels of aggression towards conspecifics are likely to affect reproductive success by increasing or decreasing reproductive opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Randall et al. 2002)</ref>. How these different selective pressures interact remains unclear for D. merriami. Nonetheless, these results suggest that the ability of D. merriami populations to respond to selection may be limited by underlying connections between behaviours. Future research should attempt to incorporate multivariate measures of selection, with particular attention being paid to correlative selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lande &amp; Arnold 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brodie et al. 1995)</ref>.</p><p>The general prevalence of syndromes underlying behaviours affecting fitness has been questioned by some researchers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Neff &amp; Sherman 2004)</ref>. However, our results support arguments that behavioural responses may be linked in numerous diverse taxa <ref type="bibr">(Sih et al. 2004a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bell 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Since research on behavioural syndromes is still fairly new, theoretical justification for the maintenance of syndromes as well as the causal mechanisms responsible for syndrome structures remain to be resolved <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bell 2007</ref>). However, some researchers have proposed that temporal or spatial heterogeneity may lead to the maintenance of syndrome structures with different combined strategies being most effective under particular conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dingemanse et al. 2004</ref>). Alternatively, multiple fitness peaks in a multivariate landscape may lead to the maintenance of syndrome structures and equivalent fitnesses for different strategies. It is not clear at this point what factors have led to the maintenance of syndrome structure in D. merriami. However, owing to the species' expansive range as well as the spatial and temporal stochasticity inherent in the arid ecosystems it inhabits, D. merriami may prove to be an ideal species with which to test proposed mechanisms of syndrome maintenance.</p><p>This research was conducted according to the guidelines for the use of animals published by the Animal Behaviour Society and was carried out in accordance with the legal requirements of the United States of America and the University of Nevada, Reno (IACUC Protocol no.

Path 'a' is active in model 2; 'b' in model 3; both 'a' and 'b' are active in model 4. Paths 'c' and 'd' are active in model 5; 'c' and 'e' in model 6; paths 'c'-'e' are all active in model 7. Paths 'd' and 'e' are active in model 8.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,108.34,77.41,392.12,133.98" type="bitmap" /></figure>

K is the number of parameters estimated in a model. Model discrepancy is the bootstrapped (nZ1000) maximum-likelihood discrepancy between the model and the data. Smaller AIC values suggest a better fit of the model to data while also penalizing for complexity (k). Models whose AIC values differ from that of the top model (DAIC) by more than 2 are considered to lack explanatory power relative to the top model. Model likelihoods represent the relative likelihood of a model (e.g. model 7 is 1.33 more likely, given the data, than model 5 (1/0.75)).</figDesc><table><row><cell>model</cell></row></table></figure>
