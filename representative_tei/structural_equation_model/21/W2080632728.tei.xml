<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Mediterranean endemic freshwater fish are among the most threatened biota in the world. Distinguishing the role of different extinction drivers and their potential interactions is crucial for achieving conservation goals. While some authors argue that invasive species are a main driver of native species declines, others see their proliferation as a co-occurring process to biodiversity loss driven by habitat degradation. It is difficult to discern between the two potential causes given that few invaded ecosystems are free from habitat degradation, and that both factors may interact in different ways.</p><p>Here we analyze the relative importance of habitat degradation and invasive species in the decline of native fish assemblages in the Guadiana River basin (southwestern Iberian Peninsula) using an information theoretic approach to evaluate interaction pathways between invasive species and habitat degradation (structural equation modeling, SEM). We also tested the possible changes in the functional relationships between invasive and native species, measured as the per capita effect of invasive species, using ANCOVA.</p><p>We found that the abundance of invasive species was the best single predictor of natives' decline and had the highest Akaike weight among the set of predictor variables examined. Habitat degradation neither played an active role nor influenced the per capita effect of invasive species on natives. Our analyses indicated that downstream reaches and areas close to reservoirs had the most invaded fish assemblages, independently of their habitat degradation status. The proliferation of invasive species poses a strong threat to the persistence of native assemblages in highly fluctuating environments. Therefore, conservation efforts to reduce native freshwater fish diversity loss in Mediterranean rivers should focus on mitigating the effect of invasive species and preventing future invasions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The diversity of life on Earth is rapidly declining under the current biodiversity crisis <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Olson et al. 2002)</ref>. Extinction rates are 100-1000 times higher than prehuman levels in many different taxonomic groups and across a wide range of environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Pimm et al. 1995)</ref>. This situation is especially worrying in freshwater environments worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dudgeon et al. 2006)</ref>, and Mediterranean systems in particular. In a recent review of the conservation status of Mediterranean endemic freshwater fish, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Smith and Darwall (2006)</ref> found that almost 70% of the species assessed (excluding data deficient species) were threatened with extinction or already extinct. There is a general agreement on the urgent need for management actions focused on conserving biodiversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Olson et al. 2002</ref>), but such actions require an understanding of the mechanisms driving biodiversity loss. The study of the relationships between extinction drivers and biodiversity loss thus transcend mere theoretical discussions, and it has clear implications for achieving conservation goals.</p><p>Many factors have been cited as extinction drivers. However, habitat degradation and invasive species are the most commonly cited causes of biodiversity loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Ricciardi 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Clavero and Garcı´a-Berthou 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Didham et al. 2007)</ref>. Due to the frequent spatial (and temporal) co-occurrence of these factors (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>), the ultimate mechanisms driving biodiversity loss often remain unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gurevitch and</ref><ref type="bibr">Padilla 2004, Didham et al. 2007)</ref>. Different views on this issue range from the perception that invasive species are mere passengers (i.e., a co-occurring though basically independent phenomenon) of the biodiversity loss process driven by 7 E-mail: virgilio.hermoso@gmail.com habitat degradation (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>), to the designation of invasive species as main drivers of native species' decline (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Didham et al. 2005)</ref>. However, effective conservation action demands accurate identification of the relative roles of habitat degradation and invasive species to biodiversity loss. For example, eradication plans would be completely inefficient, and conservation budgets wasted, if invasive species just proliferate in degraded environments but have no effect on the decline of native species <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Myers et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">, Zavaleta et al. 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Recently, some efforts have been devoted to analyze the roles of habitat degradation and invasive species in the decline and extinction of native species for different taxonomic groups, with contradictory conclusions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Marchetti et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, MacDougall and Turkington, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Light and Marchetti 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Light and Marchetti (2006)</ref> tested the role of invasive freshwater fish species and habitat degradation in the decline of native fish assemblages in Californian streams, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">MacDougall and Turkington (2005)</ref> used experimental designs to check the same hypothesis on plant assemblages in an oak savannah in Canada. While in the first example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Light and Marchetti (2006)</ref> identified invasive species as the primary driver in the decline of native freshwater fish assemblages, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">MacDougall and Turkington (2005)</ref> argued that invasive plants were mainly passengers in the decline of native species, suggesting that native species' recruitment limitations in degraded systems would be a consistent explanation for invasive species dominance.</p><p>Research on the two major drivers of biodiversity lost (habitat degradation and invasive species) is often approached as independent, single-factor problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fazey et al. 2005)</ref>. However, these factors can also act synergistically through different interaction path-ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Didham et al. 2007)</ref>. Habitat degradation may promote increases in the local abundance or regional distribution of invaders, with total invasive impact scaling in direct proportion to invader abundance (i.e., without changes in the per capita impact; Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). Habitat degradation can also change the mode of action or functional response of invasive species, with total impact scaling disproportionately with invader abundance (i.e., with changes in the per capita interaction effects; Fig. <ref type="figure">1D</ref>). For example, habitat degradation causing loss of refugia could expose native species to higher predation rates by invasive species, resulting in an increased per capita effect. It is important to differentiate between these two pathways because they have different consequences for conservation management strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Didham et al. 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Mediterranean freshwater ecosystems harbor a highly endemic freshwater fish fauna <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Reyjol et al. 2007</ref>) featuring a large proportion of threatened species <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Smith and Darwall 2006)</ref>. These systems have suffered a long history of habitat degradation, including modifications of flow regimes, urban and agricultural spills, dam construction, river channelization, and destruction of riverine vegetation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allan and Flecker 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Cowx 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Collares-Pereira and Cowx 2004)</ref>. They are also among the most heavily invaded ecosystems in the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Leprieur et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>To address these issues, we evaluated the role of invasive species, different sources of habitat perturbation, natural environmental gradients, and their potential interactions in the decline of native freshwater fish assemblages in a Mediterranean basin. We tested the hypotheses represented in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> on a wide range of conditions: from pristine areas with no invasive species FIG. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Conceptual models explaining alternative pathways responsible for the decline of native assemblages, including the two most commonly cited causes of biodiversity loss: habitat degradation and invasive species. (A) A full model, where both factors are responsible for the decline of native assemblages. (B, C) Two alternative pathways, where invasive species act as drivers of native decline (only invasive species would have direct effects on natives) or passenger (habitat degradation would be the leading cause of the decline of native species). (D) An additional interactive pathway, where habitat degradation could be enhancing (i.e., numerically or functionally mediated processes according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Didham et al. [2007]</ref>) the per capita effect of invasive species. and low habitat degradation to highly perturbed areas or fish assemblages completely dominated by invasive species, as well as intermediate combinations of both factors (e.g., areas with good habitat condition but highly invaded). We first evaluated if invasive species were acting as ''drivers'' (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>) or ''passengers'' (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>) in the process of native fish biodiversity loss led by other factors, such as habitat degradation, at the reach scale. This work is a refinement of previous work carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Marchetti et al. (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Light and Marchetti (2006)</ref> on freshwater fish assemblages at coarser spatial scales. We then evaluated the effect of habitat degradation in the relationship between invasive fish species and native assemblages, testing whether native species simply responded to the abundance of invasive species (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A-C</ref>) or if habitat degradation modified the functional relationships between natives and invasives (Fig. <ref type="figure">1D</ref>). We also analyzed the effects of natural upstreamdownstream gradients, one of the most important natural factors structuring stream fish assemblages <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Angermeier and Schlosser 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, Matthews 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">, Magalha˜es et al. 2002)</ref>, on the relationship between invasive and native species. Moreover we check the role of reservoirs, which act as centers for fish introductions facilitating nonnative establishment and subsequent expansion within basins <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Clavero et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Havel et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Johnson et al. 2008)</ref> in the decline of native assemblages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study area</head><p>The Guadiana River basin is located in the southwestern Iberian Peninsula and drains a total area of 67 039 km 2 to the Atlantic Ocean. It features a typical Mediterranean climate, with high intra-and interannual variability in discharge, including severe and unpredictable floods between autumn and spring and persistent summer droughts <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gasith and Resh 1999)</ref>. Mean air temperature ranges from 13.08 to 18.18C, with strong intra-annual variation in extreme temperatures. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 350 to 1200 mm (with a mean of 450 mm). Although it is not an overpopulated area (28 inhabitants/km 2 ), this landscape has been strongly transformed during the last century by agricultural activities. Almost half of the basin (49.1%) is currently under agricultural use. As a consequence, about 11 000 GL of water is retained in 88 large reservoirs (.1 GL) and more than 200 small ones (,1 GL) for water supply. This has resulted in the modification of natural flow regimes and has seriously fragmented the basin. Water abstraction in wells is also a problem in some areas of the basin, where thousands of legal exploitations, and an uncertain number of illegal ones, have negative consequences for the main aquifers. Other common human perturbations include river channel modifications and complete destruction of the riparian forest <ref type="bibr">(Hermoso et al. 2009b)</ref>. In regards to biotic degradation, a total of 13 invasive species are also present in this basin <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hermoso et al. 2008)</ref>, some of which are widely distributed (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</p><p>Guadiana's freshwater fish fauna, with 14 native species found in this study (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>), is especially relevant within the circum-Mediterranean context, where mean species richness is usually below this value <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Smith and Darwall 2006)</ref>. Moreover, almost two-thirds (64.3%) of the native species in the basin are currently threatened based on IUCN criteria (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fish and habitat data</head><p>Fish assemblages were characterized in 170 localities (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) in the Guadiana River basin, using electrofishing during spring (April-June) in <ref type="bibr">2002, 2005, and 2006</ref>. Sampling was conducted through a single-pass at each location without block-nets along a minimum of 100 m stretches whenever possible, covering all habitats available at this scale following the recommendations of the FAME Consortium ( <ref type="formula">2004</ref>) for European rivers. This sampling method was selected to adequately characterize spatial trends in abundance and species richness <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bertrand et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">, Sa´ly et al. 2009)</ref>. All fish were identified to species and returned to the water. Abundances were standardized as captures per unit of effort by the total length surveyed and time devoted (catch per unit effort, CPUE ¼ number of fish/[length] 3 time; where length is measured in meters and time is measured in hours).</p><p>Habitat was characterized by 33 environmental variables, covering three different spatial scales: site, reach (defined as a buffer area of 500 m around the sampling site) and basin (Appendix). In situ variables (except water quality measures) were characterized using a stratified approach from transects perpendicular to the river channel located every 20 m within the surveyed site. At each transect three different point measures were recorded and mean values from all transects were used in analyses. Basin scale data included a set of variables generated from GIS layers that characterized climatic parameters, land uses and spatial measures (e.g., distances to main stem Guadiana River, distance to headwaters and mouth. See the Appendix for more information on these variables). Climatic variables were extracted from the digital climatic map of the Iberian Peninsula <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Ninyerola et al. 2005)</ref>, based on long temporal series (15-50 yr). We assumed that these data represented an average year in the area. For land cover data, we used a digital map provided by the Guadiana Basin's management authority (Confederacio´n Hidrogra´fica del Guadiana), representing land cover status in 2003. All environmental metrics fell within two categories: (1) variables that described the natural environmental variability in the basin (i.e., not subjected to direct human influences) and (2) descriptors of human perturbations (Appendix). These variables were selected as they have been highlighted as important factors explaining fish assemblage structure, such as stream size and position within the watershed, habitat quality and land use <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Oakes et al. 2005)</ref>. All variables were checked for normality and transformed when necessary prior to analysis (arcsine for land use variables, expressed as percentages and log[x þ 1] for the rest).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition of response and predictor variables</head><p>We used two variables to represent the status of native freshwater fish assemblages: (1) total native species richness and (2) a measure of biotic integrity. Biotic integrity was assessed through an index of community  Notes: Key to abbreviations: CR, critically endangered; EN, endangered; VU, vulnerable; NT, near threatened; LC, least concern. Scardinius erythropthalmus and Fundulus heteroclitus are cited in the basin but were not found in the present study. integrity (ICI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hermoso et al. 2010)</ref>, which measures the general deviation of the observed assemblage composition from an expected assemblage in absence of major perturbations (human or biotic) following the reference condition approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hughes et al. 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">, Reynoldson et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Bailey et al. 1998)</ref>. Only native species were included in the index. We determined the reference assemblage composition (probability of occurrence of each species) using assessment by nearest neighbor analysis (ANNA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Linke et al. 2005)</ref>. ANNA determines a set of the most environmentally similar reference sites for each target site, and predicts the assemblage composition based on the assemblage composition of the nearest neighbors <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Linke et al. 2005)</ref>. ANNA was used in this case since it simultaneously allows fitting multi-response models for most the species in the assemblage, allowing us to include species with prevalence .5% (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>) in the model.</p><p>We built and validated our ANNA model with two independent sets of reference localities (construction and validation, 70 and 20 of reference localities each) using those environmental variables not affected by human perturbations as predictors (Appendix). Performance tests showed our ANNA model was valid and accurate, minimizing type I and II statistical errors <ref type="bibr">(Hermoso et al. 2009a</ref>). We measured the deviation of the observed presences-absences from the expected probabilities (in absence of perturbations) for each species at each site obtaining 10 different residuals for a given site. Negative residual values indicated a loss of species (i.e., the species was predicted to be present with a certain probability but was actually absent), while positive residuals indicated observed presences with low predicted probabilities. Residuals were standardized (x À mean/ SD in the reference data set) and transformed into probabilities (ranging 0-1), based on the cumulative normal distribution function corresponding to a given x residual value <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Pont et al. 2007)</ref>. Final index scores were the sum of partial species probabilities. The index ranged between 10 (no biodiversity loss) and zero (complete biodiversity loss).</p><p>Two principal components analyses (PCAs) were carried out on a reduced set of environmental variables (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>) to obtain perturbation and natural gradients Notes: Variables were recorded in situ or using digital maps in a GIS. Mean and total range values are shown.</p><p>Data sources: 1, stream network provided by the Confederacio´n Hidrogra´fica del Guadiana; 2, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Ninyerola et al.

The first PCA was carried out on variables related to human perturbations (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>) and produced two PCs that accounted for 56.9% of the total variation in the perturbation variables. The first PC (denoted as PC1 deg ) represented the general perturbation status related to land-use, riparian forest alteration and water quality degradation (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). The second PC (PC2 deg ) discriminated sites affected by agriculture from those with urban derived impacts (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). A second PCA was performed on environmental variables representing natural gradients. The resulting first PC (PC1 nat ) explained half of the original variation (50.5%) and was mainly related to the natural longitudinal upstreamdownstream gradient (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). The three PCs were later used as surrogates of human perturbation or natural gradients in the analyses.</p><p>We also included the upstream or downstream distance from a site to the nearest reservoir (km) as a predictor in our analyses, considering the potential effect of the establishment and dispersion of invasive species <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Johnson et al. 2008)</ref>. The abundance of invasive species ([log [CPUE þ1]-transformed), was used to account for the effect of invasive species on native fish assemblages. A preliminary analysis on the tolerance of our predictor variables suggested they were not redundant (Pearson's R , 0.2 in all possible cross-correlations between predictor variables).</p><p>Invasive species: drivers or passenger in the process of natives' decline?</p><p>The driver or passenger role of invasive species in the decline of native freshwater fish assemblages was explored through two different approaches. First, we built all possible multiple regression models between our response variables (biotic integrity and native species richness) and the set of predictors. These models included a full model with all the predictors, single models for each predictor and all possible combinations of multi-variable models. Models were ranked according to their Akaike's information criterion (AIC), and each model's support was estimated through the difference in AIC with respect to the top-ranked model (DAIC). AIC estimates the distance between a certain model and the (unknown) theoretical underlying mechanism generating the data. Lower AIC values indicate better fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burnham and Anderson 2002)</ref>. We inspected all models having moderate support (i.e., DAIC , 7 in relation to the bestranking model, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Burnham and Anderson 2002)</ref>. For these models we first calculated their Akaike weights (w i ) as the ratio of each model's likelihood to the sum of all the model likelihoods <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burnham and Anderson 2002)</ref>. Then we used the cumulative Akaike weights (Rw i ) as a measure of predictor importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burnham and Anderson 2002)</ref>. The R w i for each predictor was assessed as the sum of w i for all the models where it was included. We would expect a high relative importance of invasive species if they had an active role in native species decline instead of being passengers.</p><p>Additionally, structural equation modeling (SEM; Bollen 1989) was used to simultaneously model combinations of our variables as predictors and responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gerbin and Anderson 1988)</ref>. This is an advance with respect to multiple regression analyses, which can only analyze a single layer of linkages between response and predictor variables at a time. Whereas the direct impacts of individual drivers can be readily recognized, indirect causal linkages among multiple drivers can be difficult to detect and quantify. SEM is a common technique used to deal with the analysis of many drivers of ecological change that could be acting at the same time, and that might be too complex to test experimentally <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Wootton 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Didham et al. 2005)</ref>. SEM also allows testing multiple relationships between the set of variables under consideration, placing more accurately the target variables (invasive species) within the complex matrix of relationships.</p><p>We used SEM to test the role of invasive species as drivers or passengers in the decline of native fish assemblages through the comparison of three alternative models (full, driver, and passenger). The full model (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>) included relationships between all variables and was used as the baseline for comparison with the other two nested models (driver and passenger). The driver model (Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>) only considered direct effects of PC1 nat and the abundance of invasive species on biotic integrity/native species richness, while habitat degra-dation (PC1 deg and PC2 deg ) and reservoirs had only indirect effects via invasive species. The passenger model (Fig. <ref type="figure">3C</ref>) assumed direct effects of habitat degradation and natural gradients on biotic integrity/ native species richness and excluded effects of invasive species.</p><p>FIG. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Scheme of different structural equation models testing alternative pathways of invasive species (IS) and habitat degradation on natives' decline (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). In the driver model we assumed that the abundance of invasive species is leading the process of biodiversity loss (measured using an index of biotic integrity and native species richness), whereas in the passenger model habitat degradation has the leading role. The full model includes all potential paths between the variables considered. Standardized coefficients based on the correlation matrix for each path are shown. Dotted lines represent nonsignificant effects, and line thickness is proportional to their relative weight. The chi-square statistic (testing significant differences between the observed and expected covariance matrices), degrees of freedom (df ), and P (based on likelihood-ratio test) are also shown. Significant differences (P , 0.05) indicate poor fit between the tested model and the observed data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Invasive-native species relationships along environmental gradients</head><p>We tested whether the functional relationship between native assemblages and invasive species (sensu <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Didham et al. 2007</ref>) changed along environmental gradients or, in other words, whether the effect of invasive species was constant along those gradients or if habitat perturbation enhanced or reduced the effect of invasive species (synergic effects). We used analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) with the abundance of invasive species as a covariate to test the homogeneity of slopes of the relationship between dependent variables (biotic integrity or native species richness) and each perturbation (PC1 deg and PC2 deg ) and natural (PC nat ) gradient, as well as along increasing distances to reservoirs. To allow the use of continuous variables as factors, PC gradients and distances to reservoirs were categorized into four equal-sized levels. The possible changes in the functional relationship between invasive species and native assemblages were tested using homogeneity slope tests (Garcı´a-Berthou and Moreno-Amich 1993). Significant results of the covariate 3 factor interaction terms would imply changes in the per capita impacts (i.e., slopes) of invasive fish, whereas nonsignificant results (i.e., constant slopes along environmental gradients) would denote simple numerically mediated responses of native assemblages to invasive species. Whenever the interaction term from the homogeneity of slopes test was not statistically significant (P . 0.10, sensu Garcı´a-Berthou and Moreno-Amich 1993), it was deleted from the models, and standard ANCOVA analyses were run. Different generalized linear model (GLZ) configurations were used for each response variable. A normal distribution with an identity link function was used for the index of biotic integrity (normally distributed) whereas a Poisson distribution with a log link function was used for species richness (count variable).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Invasive species: drivers or passenger of native species decline?</head><p>The top-ranked multiple regression model using biotic integrity as the response variable included invasive species abundance as the only predictor. The remaining models with moderate support (DAIC , 7) showed similar information, representing all possible combinations between the abundance of invasive species and the other predictor variables. This means that the inclusion of the abundance of invasive species was essential for a model to receive moderate support. All models showed a low adjusted R 2 though. Based on the likelihood ratio test, the abundance of invasive species was the only variable included as a significant predictor in all models (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). The top-ranked model for native species richness included all the predictors except distance to reservoirs (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). Abundance of invasive species appeared with a significant negative effect in all 10 of the models with moderate support (DAIC , 7), whereas the natural gradient (PC1 nat ) appeared as a significant term in eight of them (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). Both predictors had high cumulative R w i (1.00 and 0.95, for invasives abundance and PC1 nat , respectively), followed in importance by PC2 deg and PC1 deg <ref type="bibr">(0.80 and 0.67, respectively)</ref>.</p><p>The goodness of fit test indicated the full and driver models were consistent with the data for biotic integrity, since the difference in the observed and expected covariation matrices was not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.09 and P ¼ 0.15 for the full and driver model, respectively). The full model was also consistent explaining native richness, while the driver was not (P ¼ 0.09 and P ¼ 0.03 for the full and driver model, respectively). On the other hand, the passenger model, in which the effect of invasives abundance on native assemblages had not been included, was inconsistent in both cases (P , 0.001, Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>SEM analyses revealed a strong effect of the abundance of invasive species on biotic integrity and native species richness, and natural upstream-downstream gradient on both invasive species abundance and native species richness. The latter effect was not detected for biotic integrity since it was previously accounted in the assessment of the index of biotic integrity. The longitudinal gradient was considered using the reference condition approach when comparing the observed and expected native assemblages. The expected species composition in reference condition for each site was obtained including environmental variables describing this longitudinal gradient in the predictive model (variables listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> not affected by human perturbations) so the spatial location of each site was considered in the comparison. The distance to the nearest reservoir also showed significant effects on the abundance of invasive species (and thus indirectly on natives), as well as the natural gradient on both perturbation gradients (PC1 deg and PC2 deg ; Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). PC1 deg only had significant effects on native species richness while PC2 deg showed no significant effect on native assemblages or invasive species abundance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Invasive-native species relationships along environmental gradients</head><p>The slope of the relationship between the abundance of invasive species and both biotic integrity and native species richness was strikingly constant along the natural and perturbation gradients (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>). In all cases, the abundance of invasive species had a negative effect on biotic integrity and native species richness, denoting the clear impact of invasive species on both variables (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). PC1 nat and PC2 deg also had significant effects on native species richness (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>), which tended to increase toward downstream localities and was higher in agricultural areas than in urbanized ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Our results suggest that biotic interactions with invasive species are the leading driver of the decline of native freshwater fish assemblages in the Guadiana River. We detected few direct effects of habitat degradation on native assemblages, whereas the negative relationships between native and invasive species remained constant along habitat degradation gradients. The role of invasive species driving the decline of native species had already been reported in our study area, but was not clearly distinguished from habitat degradation <ref type="bibr">(Godinho and</ref><ref type="bibr">Ferreira 1998, Corbacho and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Sa´nchez 2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Corbacho and Sa´nchez (2001)</ref> found habitat degradation reduced the number of native species and increased the number of invasive species in the Guadiana River basin. They concluded that habitat degradation might be the leading cause of both the decline of natives and the proliferation of invasive species. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Godinho and Ferreira (1998)</ref> also highlighted the role of invasive species explaining native assemblage composition after accounting for the effect of natural environmental gradients. However, this study lacked the inclusion of habitat perturbation as predictors, and did not measure the effect of potential interaction pathways between invasive species and habitat degradation.</p><p>Our results show that the abundance of invasive species was a key variable explaining both native species Notes: The set of environmental and perturbation gradients described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> and the distance to the nearest reservoir were used as predictors (adjusted R 2 ¼ 0.13 and 0.17, respectively, for the biotic integrity and native richness models).

The driver model was the most parsimonious model explaining the biotic integrity of native fish assemblages, while the full model was the most suitable for explaining species richness. The driver model assumed only direct effects of the abundance of invasive species on natives, with habitat degradation and the distance to the nearest reservoir having only indirect effects via their relationships with the abundance of invasive species. When all the interaction pathways were considered in the full model neither the perturbation nor the longitudinal gradients were significant in the case of biotic integrity, while PC1 deg and PC nat showed significant effects explaining native species richness. In all cases (driver and full models for biotic integrity and species richness) invasive species had the stronger direct effect as the magnitude of its standardized regression parameters indicated (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). In the latter case the relationship between PC nat and PC1 deg could be behind the significant effect of PC1 deg on native species richness. Actually, when the effect of the longitudinal gradient was accounted for in the index of biotic integrity, PC1 deg was not significant. More importantly, the passenger model, which did not consider the effects of invasive species on native assemblages and only included the effect of habitat degradation or natural gradients, did not fit our data. While our models are robust, we cannot exclude the possibility that observed fish biodiversity patterns, may be related to sources of habitat degradation not considered in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Shipley 2000)</ref>. This may be the case when there are increased effects of summer drought due to water impoundment and diversion for agricultural uses. We were unable to include this effect at the scale of our analyses, yet it could have a strong effect on both native and invasive fish assemblages particularly when considering the high rate of water diversion in <ref type="bibr">FIG. 4</ref>.

Each plot represents a portion of the gradient, corresponding to the four equivalent categories in which the gradients described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> and the distance to the nearest reservoir were split for the ANCOVAs. Variables codes are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. some areas of the basin <ref type="bibr">(Formes et al. 2000, Cortina and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cruces 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The driver role of invasive species has been previously reported in California (with a similar Mediterranean climate), and was the main factor leading to freshwater fish imperilment at the watershed scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Light and Marchetti 2006)</ref>. That study highlighted the positive relationship between non-indigenous species richness and the level of imperilment of fish assemblages, measured as the number of species of conservation concern while accounting for total native richness. Moreover the authors also found that hydrologic modifications and development had only indirect effects on native communities through the relationship of these factors with invasive species. Some other studies in the same region, although using different approaches, back up the idea that modified habitats continue holding native species in the absence of invasions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baltz and</ref><ref type="bibr">Moyle 1993, Moyle 2002)</ref>. Our results complement those in California and suggest that Mediterranean freshwater fish assemblages may be relatively resistant to habitat perturbations, but are highly sensitive to the impacts of invasive species <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baltz and</ref><ref type="bibr">Moyle 1993, Moyle 2002)</ref>.</p><p>None of the habitat gradients used as factors in the ANCOVA analysis influenced the association between invasive species abundance and native species richness or biotic integrity. The mechanism of action of invasive species on native assemblages in our study area can be thus interpreted as a numerically mediated process, and any factor enhancing the proliferation of invasive species would negatively influence native freshwater fish assemblages. We found that the natural upstreamdownstream gradient and the distance to reservoirs were the only environmental features with significant effects on the abundance of invasive species, which increased downstream and near reservoirs (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). These patterns strongly suggest that habitat stability, which is higher close to reservoirs and at low reaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Godinho et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">, Magalha˜es et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Clavero et al. 2004)</ref>, is an important environmental factor regulating the colonization and expansion success of invasive species.</p><p>Habitat stability is a critical factor structuring fish assemblages <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Schlosser 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Jackson et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, McGarvey and Hughes 2008)</ref>, and is especially important where water availability is a limiting resource. This is the case of Mediterranean streams, which experience extremes in both intra-and interannual seasonality in water availability <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gasith and Resh 1999)</ref>. Permanent waters are essential refuges during summer droughts, when small streams or headwaters are often desiccated <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Magalha˜es et al. 2002)</ref>. Mediterranean freshwater fish evolved in highly unstable systems and tend to be habitat generalists that are well adapted to survive in constantly changing environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Clavero et al. 2004</ref>). However, there is a clear natural gradient of native species richness and abundance change from upstream to downstream. Both species richness and abundance tend to increase toward downstream reaches in response to the increase in living space and environmental stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Magalha˜es et al. 2002)</ref>. Most invasive fish species introduced to Iberian freshwaters occupy stable habitats, often lentic systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Corbacho and Sa´nchez 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Elvira and Almodo´var 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">, Ribeiro et al. 2008)</ref>, and few of them are able to cope with the extreme flow fluctuations in small Mediterranean streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Vila-Gispert et al. 2005)</ref>. The milder environmental fluctuations that occur in reservoirs, and their proximities, and in downstream reaches would favor the successful establishment of invasive species populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Moyle and Light 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Corbacho and Sa´nchez 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">, Ribeiro et al. 2008)</ref>. Therefore, habitat stability appears to play an essential role for both native and invasive species populations in Mediterranean streams, whereas the proliferation of invasives in these environments may endanger the natural resilience of native assemblages. In fact, the impacts of invasive species in our study area blurred the natural increase of native species downstream, which was evident only when the effects of invasive species had been taken into account. This means that the impacts of invasive species are especially strong in areas that should bear the richest native fish assemblages within the basins and that could act as population refuges during extreme climatic events (e.g., prolonged droughts). Over the past century, human activity has promoted invasions both by creating new transport vectors and by changing natural habitats. Creation of impoundments is a clear example of this trend, promoting invasions by increasing colonization opportunities for nonindigenous taxa and by enhancing their subsequent establishment success <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Shea and Chesson 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Clavero et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Havel et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Johnson et al. 2008)</ref>. Reservoirs cause a drastic reduction of habitat heterogeneity, not only converting extensive reaches of stream habitat into standing water, but also altering the downstream magnitude and timing of water flows, sediment load and creating barriers for fish migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Malmqvist and Rundle 2002)</ref>. Our results suggest that reservoirs do not play a direct significant role in the decline of native fish assemblages in the Iberian Peninsula. However, they have indirect effects through their relationship with invasive species. Propagule pressure is a major factor for predicting the success of invaders in colonizing new ecosystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kolar and Lodge 2000)</ref> and reservoirs play an important role as centers of introduction of invasive species <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Clavero et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">, Havel et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Johnson et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The driver and passenger models have different implications for conservation policies and practices. Our analyses showed that invasive species are the leading cause of native fish decline, while habitat degradation neither affected directly biotic integrity nor influenced the per capita effect of invasive species. Therefore, management plans should be focused on controlling invasive species. The most effective manner of addressing the invasion of nonnative species to fresh waters is to prevent active and accidental introductions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Myers et al. 2000)</ref>, but little effort has been devoted to reduce the risk of new introductions. While humanmediated species introductions have occurred for centuries, the rate of new introductions has increased dramatically during the last century <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lozon and MacIsaac 1997)</ref>. In the Iberian Peninsula, the number of introduced fish species is continually rising and established invasive species are spreading through both natural expansion and secondary introductions allowing interbasin jump dispersal <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Clavero and Garcı´a-Berthou 2006)</ref>. Reduction in the current rate of new introductions should be based on proper legislation, regulation and public education, although the efficiency of such measures has not been tested. We suggest that wherever invasive species have already become established, active management is needed to reduce harmful effects and prevent further spread <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Saunders et al. 2002)</ref>. This is particularly true in highly sensitive areas holding healthy native assemblages.</p><p>There are several management approaches that could be followed in highly sensitive habitat areas: (1) eradication or long-term control of invasives at key times of year <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Wittenberg and</ref><ref type="bibr">Cock 2001, Moreno-Valca´rcel 2006)</ref>; (2) extend flows in regulated rivers, given that previous studies suggest that the success of invasive species could be reversible if natural flow regimes are restored <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Marchetti and Moyle 2000</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">, Trexler et al. 2000)</ref> and (3) reduce dispersal rates from reservoirs <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rischbieter 2000)</ref>. Eradication is the most cost-effective way to tackle the problem, although it can only be recommended when it is ecologically feasible (high probabilities of extirpation with low effects on native assemblages) and has enough financial support. However, where eradication is not feasible (the species is highly widespread or the eradication methods can have negative effects on natives), the other alternatives should be considered. Invasive species control programs should focus on the areas of highest value for native biodiversity and those most at risk from non-native invaders <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Saunders et al. 2002)</ref>. In this sense, further efforts should be devoted to the identification of those areas. Given the special role that reservoirs seem to play in the dispersion of invasive species, these environments should be a focus of attention in future management programs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>FIG. 2.
