<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper examines relationship quality as a multidimensional metaconstruct comprising three dimensions; satisfaction, trust and commitment. The role of relationship quality in its nomological network with service orientation as an antecedent construct and consumers' positive behavioural intentions, perceived switching costs and activism as the consequences is explored. Survey data from 728 travellers are used employing structural equations modelling to test this conceptualisation. We find that service orientation affects relationship satisfaction and trust, and that the latter influences satisfaction and commitment. In turn, satisfaction, trust and commitment have a positive impact on positive behavioural intentions, trust a negative one on activism, and commitment a positive one on perceived switching costs. The implications of this conceptual and empirical understanding of relationship quality are discussed and directions for future research presented.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Relationship marketing is well recognised as being at the forefront of marketing practice and academic marketing research <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Berry, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hennig-Thurau, Langer and Hansen, 2001]</ref>. This is even more so in the area of services marketing as consumers may seek on-going relationships with service providers to reduce the perceived risk associated with the consumption of services such as intangibility and credence factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[Hennig-Thurau et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Wong and Sohal, 2002]</ref>. Successful relationship marketing is well established as a strategy for increasing customer retention, and implementing such a strategy provides firms with a sustainable competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Anderson and Narus, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Roberts, Varki and Brodie, 2003]</ref>. There has been less work examining the nature and impact of relationship marketing, its organisational antecedents and consequences for consumer behaviour in the context of consumer markets compared with business to business markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Beatty, Mayer, Coleman, Reynolds and Lee, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">De Wulf, Odekerken-Schroder and Iacobucci, 2001]</ref>.</p><p>Understanding the relationship from the customer's perspective, however, has been identified as an important area of marketing research and given the importance of relationships in a service context, this paper aims to investigate the quality of the relationship between the customer and the service organisation from the customer's perspective within the travel industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[De Wulf et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gwinner, Gremler and Bitner, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hennig-Thurau, Gwinner and Gremler, 2002]</ref>.</p><p>Cross sea passenger transport was chosen as the research context, as this segment of the travel industry market offers essentially undifferentiated core service benefits (transport between ports at similar prices) with no contractual or incentive obligation such as frequent flyer points, for customers to remain with the service provider. Consequently, variations in repeat purchase are expected to arise from relationship quality rather than price competition, or contractual obligation [see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Roberts et al., 2003]</ref>. To more fully understand the role of relationship quality in this context, we investigate a wider nomological network with service orientation as an antecedent to relationship quality and consumers' attitudes and behaviours towards the firm as consequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK</head><p>Retaining customers has become an important goal for organisations. This has increased academic interest in relationship marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Colgate and Danaher, 2000]</ref>. Not only can customer retention result in long run benefits for the firm, it also offers certain psychological, social and economic benefits for customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[Gwinner et al., 1998]</ref>. In a consumer market context, the interaction of consumers with front line staff becomes paramount in determining the quality of the relationship as consumers often do not differentiate between the person providing the service and the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[Bitner, 1990]</ref>. In order for service organisations to compete more effectively it behoves them to better understand the nature of service relationships from the consumers' perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[De Wulf et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gwinner et al., 1998]</ref>. Key questions to be answered are: how are consumers' perceptions of the quality of their relationships with service providers formed, and what are the consequences of high quality relationships for the firm? <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Roberts et al. [2003]</ref> define relationship quality as 'a measure of the extent to which consumers want to maintain relationships with their service providers <ref type="bibr">' [p. 191]</ref>. Relationship quality focuses on the overall nature of the relationship between the consumer and the firm and views fulfilling consumers' needs as central to relationship success <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Hennig-Thurau et al., 2002]</ref>.</p><p>Previous investigations have variously conceptualised relationship quality as either a higher order construct or as a metaconstruct [See for <ref type="bibr">example, De Wulf et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hennig-Thurau et al., 2002]</ref>. Although there is no clear consensus on the most appropriate conceptualisation, of relationship quality, there is general agreement that satisfaction, trust and commitment are key dimensions of relationship quality [See for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Crosby, Evans and Cowles, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">De Wulf et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dorsch, Swanson and Kelley, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hennig-Thurau and Klee, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hennig-Tharau et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Roberts et al., 2003]</ref>. In other words, high quality relationships are defined by high levels of satisfaction, trust and commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[De Wulf et al., 2001]</ref>. One major advantage of conceptualising relationship quality as a multidimensional metaconstruct (rather than a higher order construct) is the opportunity that this provides to gain a deeper understanding of the construct and relationships between its dimensions. Furthermore, such a multidimensional conceptualisation, provides an opportunity to explore the relative impact of each dimension on the outcomes of the relationship. Consequently, in this research we adopt the conceptual approach proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hennig-Thurau et al. [2002]</ref> who regard relationship quality as a metaconstruct composed of three interrelated core dimensions <ref type="bibr">(satisfaction, trust and commitment)</ref>.</p><p>In this study relationship-satisfaction is defined as consumers' overall affect based evaluation of the relationship with the provider. It is cumulative in that it develops over the course of the relationship (as opposed to specific to each transaction) and is based on an evaluation of interactions with a range of service staff and systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Anderson, Fornell and Rust, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">De Wulf et al., 2001]</ref>. Relationship-trust is defined as consumers' confidence in the service provider's reliability and integrity and has similarities with the concept of trustworthiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[De Wulf et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Morgan and Hunt, 1994]</ref>. Relationship-commitment is conceptualised as the consumer's enduring desire to continue a relationship with a service provider because of a liking or positive attitude, accompanied by this consumer's willingness to make efforts at maintaining the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[De Wulf et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Morgan and Hunt, 1994]</ref>. Relationshipcommitment, in this context, represents the attitudinal element of consumer loyalty. These three dimensions (satisfaction, trust and commitment) tap into the key facets of a successful relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Antecedents to Relationship Quality</head><p>It is well recognised in services marketing research that a link exists between employee behaviours and consumer behaviour [see for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bienstock, DeMoranville and Smith, 2003]</ref>. Employee behaviours such as organisational citizenship behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Bienstock et al., 2003]</ref>, prosocial service behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Bettencourt and Brown, 1997]</ref>, customer orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Bettencourt and Brown, 2003]</ref> and service orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[Kelley, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lytle, Hom and Mokwa, 1998</ref>] have all been related to positive consumer evaluations of the service encounter. It is likely (given this association between employee behaviours and consumers' evaluations of service encounters) that similar behaviours will also influence relationship quality. Despite some research examining antecedents to relationship quality, such as relationship investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[De Wulf et al., 2001]</ref>, relational selling behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Crosby et al., 1990]</ref>, and customer orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[Wray, Palmer and Bejou, 1994]</ref>, further research in this area is necessary <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[Roberts et al., 2003]</ref>. Understanding the antecedents to positive relationships will enable organisations to develop and implement strategies aimed at securing better relationships with customers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty.</p><p>As an extension of previous studies, this research examines the impact of service orientation on the dimensions of relationship quality. Service orientation captures customers' perception of the organisation's service related policies and practices, as enacted by employees. It has its conceptual grounding in the notion of organisational climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[Schneider and Bowen, 1985]</ref>.</p><p>Service orientation is thought of as the organisation's 'climate for service' <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[Kelley, 1992]</ref>, and exists when the organisation's policies and practices are directed towards the delivery of exceptional customer service <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[Lytle et al., 1998]</ref>. Service orientated policies and practices will affect the attitudes and behaviours that service employees display towards customers. It is the customers' perceptions of these employee attitudes and behaviours that represent the organisation's service orientation in this context. These perceptions of service orientation will, in turn, influence customers' evaluations of their service experience. Consequently, if an organisation has a high degree of service orientation, it will be committed to delivering excellent service. Customers will then perceive this service orientation and will recognise that the firm is trying to serve them well, this, in turn, will increase the likelihood that they will trust the firm, develop a positive affect to the firm, and will be satisfied with the firm, that is, that they will report higher levels of relationship quality. Therefore it is proposed that; H 1 : Customers' perceptions of service orientation are directly related to their perceptions of relationship quality, (H 1a satisfaction; H 1b trust; H 1c commitment).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes of Relationship Quality</head><p>Relationship quality captures the attitudinal element of consumer loyalty through relationship commitment. However, it is also important to capture the subsequent behavioural responses arising from relationship quality. Organisations are interested in not only the positive attitudes to the firm through relationships, but also the behavioural outcomes from these relationships.</p><p>What do they really result in for the firm? Is there an actual benefit to the firm that can be understood in terms of consumer behaviour? Customers typically engage in a range of behaviours towards the organisation, ranging from positive behaviours (from the firm's perspective) such as repeat purchase and firm advocacy, through inertia, and negative behaviours (from the firm's perspective) such as reducing purchase behaviour, negative word of mouth and complaining to third parties. It is particularly important for organisations to understand how these positive and negative behaviours arise and how to manage them.</p><p>Two positive behavioural outcomes of relationship quality are regularly identified in the marketing literature. These are repeat purchase behaviour and positive word of mouth communications <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Hennig-Thurau et al., 2002]</ref>. Consumers who perceive that they have a high quality relationship with their service provider are likely to repeat purchase from that firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[De Wulf et al., 2001]</ref> and are likely to communicate their experiences to others within their social network ,i.e. engage in positive word of mouth <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Hennig-Thurau et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Reichheld, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Roberts et al., 2003]</ref>. Measuring these behaviours involves observation of respondents to capture the behaviours directly. Such observations are not always practical and, in line with other research in this area, we conceptualise these positive outcomes for the firm as positive behavioural intentions, and assume that the relationship between consumers' intentions and behaviours is significant. Consequently, we hypothesise that the higher the consumer's perceptions of relationship quality, the higher their intentions to behave positively towards the firm.</p><p>H 2 : Higher perceptions of relationship quality, (H 2a satisfaction; H 2b trust; H 2c commitment) lead to a higher level of positive behavioural intentions.</p><p>In addition to these positive behaviours, customers who are committed to a relationship with an organisation are less likely to become activists against the company <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[Hoyer and MacInnis, 1997]</ref>. That is, they are unlikely to demonstrate negative behaviours towards the firm, such as complaining to other customers and complaining to external agencies <ref type="bibr">[Hoyer and MacInnis, 1997: 285]</ref>. When a consumer feels they are getting their requirements met through the service provider, why would they feel the need to act in a negative way towards that provider? Therefore it is hypothesised: H 3 : Higher perceptions of relationship quality, (H 3a satisfaction; H 3b trust; H 3c commitment) lead to a lower level of activism against the company.</p><p>Previous research has identified that satisfaction with services increases consumers' perceptions of the cost of switching suppliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[Gundlach, Achrol and Mentzer, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Patterson and Smith, 2003]</ref>. Such costs may take the form of continuity-, set-up-, or sunk costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[Patterson and Smith, 2003]</ref>, and are an important determinant of the likelihood that the consumer will terminate the relationship or seek an alternative supplier <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[Morgan and Hunt, 1994]</ref>. We predict (given the association between relationship quality and consumers' evaluations of service encounters), that consumers reporting higher levels of relationship quality are likely to perceive higher switching costs than those who report low levels of relationship quality. In essence, for customers experiencing a service relationship with a supplier that is characterised by trust, liking and satisfaction, leaving this relationship will represent a level of risk to them because another supplier may not fulfil their needs in the same manner. Therefore, we hypothesise that perceptions of relationship quality will positively influence perceptions of switching costs: H 4 : Higher perceptions of relationship quality, (H 4a satisfaction; H 4b trust; H 4c commitment) will lead to higher perceived switching costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between satisfaction, trust and commitment</head><p>In line with the suggestions of Hennig-Thurau et al., <ref type="bibr">[2002]</ref>, we also explore the structural relationships between the three dimensions of relationship quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Morgan and Hunt [1994]</ref> suggest that trust is a central tenet of relationships; it is seen as reducing consumer uncertainty and vulnerability; especially important in services contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Berry, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hennig-Thurau et al., 2002]</ref>. These benefits can create relationship efficiency through decreased transaction costs which then help foster commitment to the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Garbarino and Johnson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hennig-Thurau et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Morgan and Hunt, 1994]</ref>. If a customer trusts their service firm they are more likely to have a positive attachment to the firm. This gives rise to the following hypothesis:</p><p>H 5 : A higher level of relationship trust will lead to a higher level of relationship commitment.</p><p>Trust has also been found to have a positive impact on satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Anderson and Narus, 1990]</ref>. Higher levels of trust result in lower anxiety concerning the interaction and thus greater satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Hennig-Thurau et al., 2002]</ref>. When a consumer believes that the firm is honest in their dealings with them it is likely to result in the customer being more satisfaction with that firm. Consequently: H 6 : A higher level of relationship trust will lead to a higher level of relationship satisfaction.</p><p>A positive relationship has also been reported between satisfaction and commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[Oliver, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Singh and Sirdeshmukh, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Szymanski and Henard, 2001]</ref>. That is, those consumers who are satisfied with their interactions with the organisation are provided with repeated positive enforcement, thus creating positive emotional commitment bonds with the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[Hennig-Thurau and Klee, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hennig-Thurau et al., 2002]</ref>. If a customer is satisfied with the interactions they have with the firm they are more likely to have a positive attitude or attachment toward that firm. Therefore it is hypothesised that: H 7 : A higher level of relationship satisfaction will lead to a higher level of relationship commitment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</head><p>In order to collect data to examine the relationships between the constructs of interest in this study, a questionnaire was designed employing measures adapted from existing marketing and psychology scales. Specifically, relationship satisfaction was measured using a five point semantic differential scale as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Yi [1990]</ref>, using items drawn from Ganesan <ref type="bibr">[1994]</ref>. Examples of the items used include satisfied/dissatisfied, pleased/displeased, happy/unhappy. Relationship commitment was measured using five items adapted from scales published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Garbarino and Johnson [1999]</ref> and Allen and <ref type="bibr">Meyer [1990]</ref>. Example items include "I feel a sense of belonging to (firm name)", "I am committed to my relationship with (firm name) because I like being associated with them", and "I am loyal to (firm name)". Relationship trust, consumer activism, and positive behavioural intentions were all measured using items modified from <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Roberts et al. [2003]</ref>. Examples of the items of relationship trust are " (firm name) is concerned about the welfare of its customers", " (firm name) tries to understand customers' problems when they arise", " (firm name) is honest with its customers about any problems with its service". Examples of the consumer activism items include, "I am likely to complain to external agencies, such as trading standards or the media, if I experience problems with (firm name)", and "I am likely to complain to other customers if I experience problems with (firm name)". Positive behavioural intentions items included "I am to encourage friends and relatives to do business with (firm name)", "I am likely to say positive things about (firm name) to other people", "I am likely to keep purchasing from (firm name) for another year", and "I am willing to provide (firm name) with more information about myself to help them to serve me better".</p><p>Perceived switching cost items were modified from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gundlach et al., [1995]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Morgan and Hunt [1994]</ref>, examples include; "Moving to another carrier is not worth the effort", and "I would have to invest a lot of time and effort to find another carrier of equal standard".</p><p>Service orientation was measured using items adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lytle et al. [1998]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Saura et al. [2005]</ref> and referred to the firm's staff. Example items include: 'They provide prompt service', 'They are committed to serving customers' and 'They view interactions with me as opportunities to please me'. With the exception of relationship satisfaction, all scales utilised a seven point response options anchored at strongly agree and strongly disagree. As mentioned relationship satisfaction was measured using a semantic differential scale. A full list of items used in the study is provided in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> Data were collected using a self-completion questionnaire, administered to business and leisure travellers on a cross channel ferry, and collected from pre-specified pick up points.</p><p>Respondents were chosen using a customer intercept while they were on board the ferry, and were asked to complete the questionnaire during their voyage. In total 808 questionnaires were administered and 728 usable responses were received (effective response rate of approximately 90%). This research context was chosen as, typically, the service offering is undifferentiated, in terms of price, duration and comfort, between competitors operating the same route. In this situation, any observed consumer loyalty is likely to be driven by consumers' evaluations of the service orientation of the service provider and consequent quality of the service relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RESULTS</head><p>Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) within a structural equation modelling approach was used to confirm the dimensionality of the scales for all constructs in the study. At this stage, several items were removed from the scales to assure that items only captured the construct that they were intended to, and to improve model fit. The final set of items for each scale is illustrated in Table . 2. A random sample of 250 respondents was chosen from the data set.</p><p>The covariance matrix of the items capturing the constructs was analysed using LISREL 8.54 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[Jöreskog and Sörbom, 2003]</ref>. Following the suggestions of <ref type="bibr">Sharma [1996: 151]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Hair, Anderson, Tatham and Black [1998: 605]</ref>  Discriminant validity was tested following <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fornell and Larcker [1981]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson and Gerbing [1988]</ref>. Evidence of discriminant validity is provided by a low to moderate correlation among measures that are designed to measure conceptually different but related constructs, i.e., a phi coefficient significantly less than one offers support for discriminant validity between constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Anderson and Gerbing, 1988]</ref>. The correlations between the constructs in the study were all in the range 0.17-0.72, indicating that the scales discriminate between the constructs included in the study (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> below). Additional evidence of discriminant validity is provided if the average variance explained by a construct's items is greater than the construct's shared variance with every other construct [i.e., the square of the inter-factor correlations between any two constructs (φ 2 ), <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fornell and Larcker, 1981]</ref>. This test provided further evidence of discriminant validity. The inter-factor correlations (φ), squares of the inter-factor correlations (φ 2 ), and average variances extracted are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> below.</p><p>[Take in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1]</ref> Having established that each of the scales measuring various constructs do indeed discriminate between these constructs, the next stage in the analysis was to examine composite reliabilities of each of the scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[Gerbing and Anderson, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hair et al., 1998: 611]</ref>. These are reported in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> and all exceed the recommended standards of both <ref type="bibr">Bagozzi, Yi and Phillips [1981]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hair et al. [1998]</ref>, and provide evidence of the internal consistency of the construct indicators. This suggests that the scale items do indeed measure the latent constructs that they purport to. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fornell and Larcker [1981]</ref> suggest that variance extracted is a stringent test of internal stability and convergent validity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson and Gerbing [1988]</ref> offer an alternative heuristic, that significant t-values support the convergent validity of scale items. Both approaches were used to test the convergent validity of the scale items.</p><p>1. Examining the variances extracted for each of the scales adopted (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>), indicates that all scales explain more than 50 per cent of the variance in the data for each of the constructs, and so meet the test of convergent validity set by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fornell and Larcker [1981]</ref>.</p><p>2. Also, all item loadings have significant t-values &gt; 1.96, exceeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson and Gerbing's [1988]</ref> heuristic. This suggests that the scale items adequately represent the constructs that they purport to measure.</p><p>Overall these tests indicate that the scales used to measure the constructs of interest in this study possess sufficient internal stability and validity to provide confidence that they measure what they purport to.</p><p>[Take in <ref type="table">Table 2]</ref> The next stage in the analysis was to assess the structural model fit. The hypothesised relationships in the model were tested simultaneously using structural equations modelling, employing LISREL 8.54 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[Jöreskog and Sörbom, 2003</ref>]. The full data set was used to test this model. Model fit was assessed using several heuristics commonly published in the literature.</p><p>These goodness of fit indices suggest that the model fits the data well; χ 2 = 301.256 (p = 0.901), df = 334, GFI = 0.920, AGFI = 0.903, St RMR = 0.044. The standardised path coefficients as estimated by LISREL are given in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> below. Service orientation explains more than 50 per cent of the variation in relationship trust, 42 per cent of the variation in relationship commitment and 22 per cent of the variation in relationship satisfaction. The model explains more than 56 per cent of the variation in positive behavioural intentions and 27 per cent of the variation in consumer switching costs, however only 9 per cent of the variation in consumer activism is explained by the proposed model. One partial explanation for the relationships between the constructs in this study may be the existence of systematic measurement error arising from the use of a single instrument to simultaneously collect data on all constructs in the study. In order to test for such common method bias, a <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Harman's [1967]</ref> one-factor test was performed following the approach described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Podsakoff et al. [1984]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Schriesheim [1979]</ref>. All of the self-report items were entered into a principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation. According to this technique, if a single-factor emerges from the factor analysis or one-factor accounts for more than 50 per cent of the variance in the variables, common method variance is present <ref type="bibr">[Mattila and Enz, 2002]</ref>. Our analysis revealed a seven-factor structure with no general factor present (the first factor accounted for 15 per cent of the variance). Although this test does not rule out the presence of common method bias, combined with measures taken in the questionnaire design to minimise acquiescence bias, it does provide support for the absence of such a general bias in the findings <ref type="bibr">[Mattila and Enz, 2002]</ref>.</p><p>As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. below the impact of service orientation on relationship satisfaction and relationship trust is positive (H1a and H1b). Additionally relationship satisfaction is seen to have a direct effect on positive behavioural intentions (H2a) as does relationship trust (H2b) and relationship commitment (H2c). H3b is also supported (relationship trust having a negative effect on consumer activism). Relationship commitment is also seen to increase the perceived switching costs of consumers (H4c). Trust emerges as the focal dimension in relationship quality as it impacts both satisfaction and commitment (supporting H5 and H6).</p><p>[Take in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>] 5. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY This research addresses the call for additional investigation into the antecedents of relationship quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[Roberts et al., 2003]</ref>, and also examines some of the consequences of high quality relationships for the firm. Additionally, the paper also explores the relationship between the three dimensions of satisfaction, trust and commitment in the metaconstruct of relationship quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Hennig-Thurau et al., 2002]</ref>. We show that service orientation does, indeed, act to increase consumers' perceptions of relationship satisfaction and relationship trust. Interestingly, however, it did not appear to increase consumers' perceptions of relationship commitment. Perhaps given the strong link between service orientation and the other two dimensions of relationship quality particularly trust, these mask the relationship with commitment. It could be said though just because a consumer perceives that a service employee had their best interest at heart, it may not necessarily result in them being committed to the organisation. The results do indicate that consumers' perceptions of the level of service orientation that organisations demonstrate have a positive impact on their likelihood to trust and be satisfied with their relationship with the organisation. This implies that service organisations should manage their customer interface to ensure that such perceptions are facilitated. This will include adopting policies and practices that are directed at allowing front line staff to deliver exceptional service to customers. Such policies may include empowering employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[Thomas, 1998]</ref>, training them <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[Jones and Sasser, 1996]</ref> and implementing internal marketing to motivate them to deliver service excellence <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Grönroos, 1985]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore this research adds support to previous studies examining the benefits of high quality relationships with customers. Specifically we find that all three dimensions of relationship quality lead to positive behavioural outcomes. This suggests that satisfaction, trust and commitment all result in repeat purchase and positive word of mouth toward the service providing organisation. This strongly indicates the importance of achieving high levels of relationship quality with consumers as it is likely to result in them continuing to purchase in the future and also saying good things about the organisation and encouraging friends and relatives to purchase from that organisation in the future. Trust and commitment were also found to relate to consumer activism in that higher levels of trust and commitment are likely to result in lower levels of consumer activism (negative behaviours towards the firm, including complaining to other customers and complaining to external agencies which is an important goal for organisations) <ref type="bibr">[Hoyer and MacInnis, 1997: 285]</ref>. Interestingly, high levels of relationship commitment also resulted in lower levels of switching costs. This suggests that consumers which have an emotional attachment to the organisation are more likely to perceive a risk associated with switching to a competing provider. This risk could be economic or psychological.</p><p>Regarding the relationship among satisfaction, trust and commitment in the metaconstruct of relationship quality, trust emerges as the focal dimension in this construct as it has a direct relationship with both satisfaction and commitment. This result is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Morgan and Hunt [1994]</ref> who highlight the importance of trust in relationship marketing, and in particular its importance for creating satisfied and committed consumers. The importance of relationship trust is also ascertained as it also appears to affect all three behavioural outcomes directly and indirectly: positive behavioural intentions, consumer activism and perceived switching costs.</p><p>Further replications of this work are necessary to examine the stability of these results in other service contexts. Additionally, other cultural settings would also help increase further the generalisability of the results. The use of dyadic data should also be considered for replicating this work. Data about employee behaviour (service orientation) could be collected directly from front line staff and linked to data collected from service customers regarding their attitudes and behavioural intentions. This study serves to highlight the importance of service employees in the establishment of consumer relationships with organisations and the flow-on effect that these relationships have on consumer behaviour. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>maximum likelihood estimation was used.
