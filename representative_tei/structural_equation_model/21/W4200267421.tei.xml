<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Blockchain can solve the problems that the agriculture supply chain (ASC) is facing to achieve sustainable growth. In a nation like India, blockchain application in the supply chain is still new; therefore, supply chain players need a better understanding and awareness of blockchain through valuable insights. This article aims to study the mediating role of blockchain technology adoption (BLCT) for sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP). This study investigates the influence of numerous factors such as green and lean practices, supply chain integration, supply chain risk, performance expectancy, top management support, cost, internal and external environmental conditions, regulatory support, and innovation capability on BLCT adoption. A sample of 316 respondents from Indian ASC industries was collected, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used. This study's outcomes show that green and lean practices, supply chain integration, supply chain risks, internal and external conditions, regulatory support, innovation capability, and cost positively influence BLCT B Gajanan B.

The decentralization characteristic of BLCT that means data cannot be stored at one point in the chain is a big challenge to make SC sustainable. Eventually, BLCT use in SC makes it high-performanceoriented, more energy-efficient, cost-effective, transparent, efficient, and effective in utilizing resources. Thus, BLCT will help establish sustainable SC <ref type="bibr">(Yadav &amp; Singh, 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Kshetri, 2018)</ref>. In literature, researchers have discussed the role of various factors on BLCT adoption (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kouhizadeh et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Nandi et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wamba et al., 2020)</ref> and on SSCP (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Han &amp; Huo, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Asadi et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Orji &amp; Liu, 2020)</ref>, separately.

Thus, the objective of this research article is to examine the effect of identified factors on BLCT adoption and then further study the effect of BLCT adoption on SSCP.</p><p>As an emerging technology, BLCT is still in its developmental stage due to the challenges in its adoption, and practitioners and researchers are trying BLCT implementation in the supply chain area <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Queiroz &amp; Wamba, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kamble et al., 2019)</ref>. The authors in extant literature have explored the effect of BLCT on SC performance, BLCT critical success factors for sustainable SC, perceived usefulness of BCLT, performance measurement model for transparency of BCLT based system, BLCT enabled critical sustainability factors, conceptual model for BLCT adoption for green and sustainable SC, user perception of BLCT adoption, critical success factor for BLCT adoption, challenges and opportunities of BLCT adoption. However, the literature lacks exhaustive research on essential success factors on BLCT adoption and sustainable supply chain performance. Therefore, this study proposes the following research questions to address the gap: RQ1 What are the factors that affect BLCT adoption in ASC? RQ2 Does BLCT adoption affect sustainable supply chain performance? RQ3 Does BLCT play a mediating role in between the factors affecting its adoption and SSCP?</p><p>With sustainable performance (SP) consideration, the BLCT adoption model can help policymakers and practitioners understand BLCT better with empirical evidence. Therefore, this study aims to study BLCT's mediating effect on SSCP of the agri-food sector in India by considering the factors affecting blockchain adoption based on technological, organizational, and environmental (TOE) and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) theory with slight variations. The factors and subfactors of the proposed model were identified from the literature survey, and SEM was used for analyzing these factors. This study's outline is organised as follows: Section 2 presents the study's existing review study and background. Section 3 discussed the conceptual framework and hypothesis development for the study. Section 4 describes the research methodology. Section 5 and 6 represent the empirical findings and the discussion and implications of the study. The last section of the study discussed the conclusion and limitations, and future scope.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Literature review</head><p>In the available literature focused on BLCT adoption and its role in improving supply chain performance (SCP) and sustainability. The literature was searched from 'Scopus' and 'Web of Science' (WoS). 'Sustainability', 'performance', 'blockchain', 'supply chain', and 'SEM' were used as keywords for searching articles on an online database. No time limit was set, and searches were limited to reviews and articles. By combining all keyword combinations, removing repeated articles, conference, and non-peer-reviewed articles, and after thorough reading and detailed analysis of papers, 16 articles were finalized for this study, excluding multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques, case study, and conceptual papers. The relevant literature found is discussed in the next sections based on which research gap is written as follows:</p><p>2.1 BLCT and SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Li and Fang (2021)</ref> explored the factors influencing information resource sharing intention through the view of unanimity of BLCT's perception, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kamble et al.

The effect of green and lean practices on BLCT adoption for sustainable performance is neglected by researchers; although, green and lean practices play an essential role in improving sustainable performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Raut et al., 2019)</ref>. Blockchain improves collaboration by providing real-time information sharing, improving the system's transparency, trust, and security <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Stranieri et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Iansiti &amp; Lakhani, 2017)</ref>. BLCT assists in mitigating risks by effective management of supply and demand, SC resources, and inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ivanov et al., 2019)</ref>. The internal and external environmental conditions such as availability of resources including technical skills and expertise, presence of advanced information-sharing technology system, intention to adopt blockchain technology, competitive pressure, the influence of customs, culture, and people can influence BLCT adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kouhizadeh et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Shi &amp; Yan, 2016)</ref>. Regulatory support (RESU) provides legal certainty to the users of BLCT by implementing guidelines related to data protection and its use for transparent SC processes. This will also improve the trust of SC players for BLCT use <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Wong et al., 2020b)</ref>. The particular and robust policies and laws for BLCT adoption result in quick adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Shi &amp; Yan, 2016)</ref>. Performance expectancy (PERE) is also a suitable catalyst for technology adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Batara et al., 2017)</ref>. It influences behavioural intention to adopt BLCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Francisco &amp; Swanson, 2018)</ref>.

Integrative supply chain management may help firms achieve sustainable SC performance by promoting firms' internal motivation to implement green SC integration practices and better manage resources to achieve green goals. Suppliers can share going green costs and increase economic performance, whereas consumers can push demands related to social issues by providing authentic product feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Han &amp; Huo, 2020)</ref>. Higher the SUCI means higher the SCP in quality, cost delivery, and flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Banchuen et al., 2017)</ref>, enhancing SSCP.

The hypothesis of blockchain technology adoption related to sustainable supply chain performance is also supported (SSCP, 0.178).</p><p>The findings of mediation analysis from Table <ref type="table">5</ref> denote that only three mediation effect exists. If form in terms of hypotheses, each of the nine relationships, we can see three hypotheses are accepted in the fully mediating condition where the only indirect effect is working. In some cases, if the only direct effect is working, there cannot be any mediation effect. None of the cases in Table <ref type="table">5</ref> can find direct and indirect effects, leading to partial mediation. Full mediation is occurring for the factors SUCI, GLPR, and CO.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>The mediating role of blockchain technology for sustainable supply chain performance is explored in this study by using SEM statistical methodology. Table <ref type="table">5</ref> reveals the SEM analysis's finding, supporting eight hypotheses, including blockchain technology's relation with the proposed model's sustainable supply chain performance. Eight significant blockchain adoption variables in order of their standardized estimates are Cost (CO), sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP), Green and Lean Practices (GLPR), Environment conditions (IEEC), Supply chain integration (SUCI), Regulatory Support (RESU), Supply chain risk (SUCR), Internal and External and Innovation Capability (INNC).</p><p>This study concludes that "Cost" is the essential variable. This is consistent with the results of <ref type="bibr">Wong et al. (2020a)</ref>. At the same time, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Fan et al. (2020)</ref> concluded that cost is a conditional variable for blockchain adoption. Unexpectedly, Cost was not supported empirically as a barrier to blockchain technology adoption but a driver for adopting blockchain. The reason can be the advantages that blockchain provides; however, it is perceived as a costly and complicated technology by the users <ref type="bibr">(Wong et al., 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gallardo et al., 2018)</ref>. This result does not agree with the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Shi &amp; Yan, 2016)</ref> but agrees with <ref type="bibr">Wong et al. (2020a)</ref>.</p><p>The reason for SC cost positively influences BLCT adoption is the reduction of overall cost after implementation. BLCT can remove intermediaries or traders up to some extent in ASC, and distributors can get direct customer payments <ref type="bibr">(Wong et al., 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chen et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>The new method of accounting in BLCT shared ledger, less human intervention, real-time monitoring, information accessibility to all players, and smart contract helps in minimizing the paperwork, transaction and food frauds and ASC risks and uncertainties related to climate change, fluctuating supply and demand, etc. <ref type="bibr">(Yadav &amp; Singh, 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kamilaris et al., 2019)</ref>. Thus, reducing the cost of transactions, infrastructure, maintenance, operational, and food recall cost.</p><p>Green and lean practices construct the second highly significant variable in the model. Keeping in mind the sustainable performance of the supply chain Green and Lean Practices play an essential role in blockchain adoption. Earlier studies have not included green and lean practices as a factor in the blockchain model because they have not explored blockchain's mediating role for sustainability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Raut et al. (2019)</ref> included green and lean practices in the SEM-Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model of big-data (BD) analytics for Indian manufacturing firms' sustainability. Green and lean practices support the blockchain technology adoption in our study, which is against the finding of Raut et al. ( <ref type="formula">2019</ref>) for BD analytics. In our study, GLPR supports blockchain adoption because Green and lean strategies are supported by adopting at least one Industry 4.0 technology, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chiarini et al. (2020)</ref> discussed through a survey of Italian manufacturing plants. The literature lacks empirical evidence of a relationship between BLCT adoption and GLPR. The improved transparency and real-time monitoring of resource usage through BLCT can help in improved natural resources and suppliers' green performance management. BLCT can also help in the functioning of ASC from farm to fork by using lean and green tools such as value stream mapping (VSM) and life cycle assessment (LCA), thus exposing the spots of food waste and lower green performance.</p><p>Internal and external environmental conditions are the third most significant variable in blockchain adoption. Internal and external environmental conditions are facilitating conditions that drive blockchain adoption. Authors in the extant literature have not discussed precisely the effect of internal and external conditions on BLCT adoption. The cause of acceptance of this hypothesis can be explained by discussing items about BLCT adoption. Availability of the right resources, knowledge, technical expertise, and assistance under facilitating conditions positively influences blockchain adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Wong et al., 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Queiroz et al., 2021)</ref>. Competitive pressure also positively influences blockchain adoption because it is necessary for firms to remain competitive <ref type="bibr">(Wong et al., 2020a)</ref> and BLCT, a significant technology under industry 4.0. The internal pressure and desire to gain the competitive benefit, upstream and downstream players' external pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Shi &amp; Yan, 2016)</ref> in ASC lead to BLCT adoption. The diversity of geographical and economic distribution of SC stakeholders and most ASC players exists in rural areas, thus dominated by customs, culture, and people's hesitation to adopt new technology like BLCT. However, for advanced information technology (IT) that needs to be driven by the industry 4.0 era, BLCT needs to be adopted in ASC to minimize SC risks related to payment fraud, supply management, crop failure, food wastage, etc. The successful execution of BLCT adoption requires knowledge, expertise, and experience of BLCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kouhizadeh et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Supply chain integration (SUCI) is the fourth most significant variable concerning blockchain adoption. Supply chain integration hypotheses are in contrast with <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Karamchandani et al. (2020)</ref>. SUCI positively influences the relationship between perceived benefits and perceived usefulness of BLCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Karamchandani et al., 2020)</ref>. The positive relationship between SUCI and blockchain technology adoption can also be supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chiarini et al. (2020)</ref> findings for industry 4.0. BLCT provides more transparent, secure, and accurate information sharing than other technology-based traceability systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Iansiti &amp; Lakhani, 2017)</ref>. Thus, providing platform to improve collaboration, partnership and strategic alliance performance for efficient knowledge, innovation and information sharing. The BLCT adoption can also help in understanding ASC player's requirements through real-time and accurate information management. To meet the strict food quality and safety requirements, ASC needs to improve SUCI and improve SC visibility. Thus, BLCT can be the technological solution.</p><p>Regulatory support is the Fifth most significant variable with blockchain technology adoption. The regulatory support hypothesis agrees with <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Wong et al. (2020b)</ref> but contrasting with <ref type="bibr">Wong et al. (2020a)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Wong et al. (2020b)</ref> explored the role of regulatory support as a moderator on facilitating conditions' impact on behavioural intention of blockchain adoption. Clearing the regulatory uncertainties overcomes the trust challenge and facilitates the required infrastructure implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Wong et al., 2020b)</ref>. So, the reason behind the acceptance of regulatory hypothesis can be that the managers believe that providing legal certainty to blockchain users through guidance on data protection regulation while using BLCT would develop trust in users for BLCT and data economy by using it for developing transparent SC <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Wong et al., 2020b)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Shi and Yan (2016)</ref> reported that robust policies and laws for BLCT adoption result in its quick adoption. ASC always remains under stringent scrutiny from audit and regulatory bodies on multiple fronts for maintaining the quality and safety of food, and thus firms are pressurized to explore BLCT adoption to improve compliance with regulations. As blockchain can trace the product throughout ASC and provide authentic information on food items <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Ghadge &amp; Bourlakis, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Casino et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>INNC refers to adapting to the dynamic environment and solving unexpected problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Wang et al., 2020)</ref>. Innovation capability positively influences BLCT adoption. A positive relationship can be the need for ASC to mitigate SC risks related to consumer, firm, and environment by improving the supply chain's innovative capability in BLCT enabled supply chain. BLCT can improve innovative capacity to improve SC's ability to utilize knowledge, products, systems, and ideas for the firm's advantage based on real-time data availability.</p><p>SUCR positively influences BLCT adoption. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Choi (2020)</ref> found that BLCT enabled SC leads to lower SC risks. The reason for this relationship is BLCT's capability to mitigate SUCR by efficient inventory and resources management. BLCT mitigates risks related to crop diseases, pest infestations, the uncertainty of supply and demand, and delay of payments due to higher transaction settlement time by reducing human interference, increasing traceability and transparency, improving trust among ASC players, and eliminating intermediaries.</p><p>Supply chain risk and Innovation capability are two variables explored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Wang et al. (2020)</ref> regarding the relationship between these two in the industry 4.0 era. Innovation capability increase will result in a decrease in customer, company side, and environmental risks. Therefore, firms may adopt new technologies and innovative solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Wang et al., 2020)</ref>. This study's positive relationship between supply chain risks and blockchain adoption is more significant than the positive relationship between innovation capability and blockchain. This can be because those firms are more interested in blockchain adoption for mitigating risks and are more interested in improving innovative capability by other means rather than by only implementing blockchain.</p><p>BLCT and SSCP relation is the second most significant hypotheses overall and newly studied. This hypothesis's significant reason can be the capabilities and unique characteristics of BLCT such as traceability, reliability, immutability, smart contracts, automation, disintermediation, security and privacy, decentralized database etc. BLCT capabilities could improve supply chains' sustainable performance by reducing the product recall and rework, food poisoning, actual tracing of carbon footprint, and carbon tax, and efficient resource utilization of soil, water, and energy, thus improving the emission trading system's efficiency and facilitating recycling behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Prashar et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Saberi et al., 2018)</ref>. This helps in reducing food waste and other hazardous waste and emission means achieving environmental sustainability targets. BLCT can help small farmers by supporting insurance programs, protecting labor from exploitation through smart contracts, and ensuring fairness in payments and taxation in ASC <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kamilaris et al., 2019)</ref>, thus helping achieve social sustainability goals. BLCT is very useful for reducing SC cost in terms of production cost, transportation cost, maintenance cost, food recall cost etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Nandi et al., 2020)</ref>, thus helping in making business operations economically sustainable.</p><p>Performance expectancy and top management support are the two variables for which the hypotheses have been rejected in our study. The positive relationship between top management support and BLCT adoption was rejected in our study, which agrees with <ref type="bibr">Wong et al. (2020a)</ref>. The rejection reason can be that the top management does not have enough knowledge about the advantages of BLCT and thus have a negative intention for BLCT adoption. The relative benefits motivate the top management to support BLCT adoption <ref type="bibr">(Wong et al., 2020a)</ref>. With the immaturity of BLCT implementation and its regulation as BLCT is a disruptive technology, managers are not convinced about its benefits to ASC in developing countries like India <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Kouhizadeh et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wong et al., 2020a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Wong et al., , 2020b))</ref>. The positive relationship of performance expectancy with blockchain adoption was rejected in this study. This agrees with <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Wong et al. (2020b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Queiroz et al. (2021)</ref>. This can be the lack of awareness, knowledge, familiarity, experience, and expertise about blockchain-based systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Wong et al., 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Queiroz et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kamble et al., 2019)</ref>. However, BLCT has benefits in reducing transaction cost, production cost, risk management cost, and competitiveness and innovation capability by improving transparency, traceability, information sharing, trust, and collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Stranieri et al., 2021)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Stranieri et al. (2021)</ref> reported that BLCT does not impact flexibility and responsiveness and does not positively affect product flow management and intrinsic food product quality.</p><p>The mediation effect of BLCT for the relationship between SUCI, GLPR, and CO with SSCP proves that BLCT indirectly affects SUCI, GLPR, and CO relation with SSCP. It is evident from this study that GLPR supports BLCT adoption. This study also concludes that BLCT mediates the effect of GLPR on SSCP or indirectly affects the relationship between GLPR and SSCP. The reason for the mediation effect of BLCT in this relationship can be that BLCT promotes GLPR practices which further helps achieve sustainable performance in ASC. BLCT can support green and lean tools such as VSM and LCA by enabling realtime information sharing and monitoring each activity and process in ASC from farm to fork. Green and lean practices help achieve environmental targets and reduce SC's cost by improving resource efficiency, and the saved cost can be utilized for the benefit of society. BLCT helps reduce the cost of SC; thus, cost reduction can support sustainability targets by providing more financial support, which can be utilized to improve resource availability to improve SSCP. Therefore, we can say BLCT indirectly affects the relation of cost with SSCP. BLCT indirectly affects the relation of SUCI with SSCP. BLCT improves SUCI by providing more transparent, secure, and accurate information sharing, thus improving collaboration quality and building trust among players within ASC <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Stranieri et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Iansiti &amp; Lakhani, 2017)</ref>. Whereas SUCI helps improve decision-making by supporting the material movement and timely information sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Rai et al., 2006)</ref>. The improved SUCI means improvement in SCP in the forms of quality, delivery cost, and flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Banchuen et al., 2017)</ref>; thus, SUCI can further enhance SSCP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Theoretical implications</head><p>This study extends the literature on blockchain technology by empirically exploring the factors affecting blockchain adoption and blockchain technology's role in achieving sustainable performance. A few have explored the role of blockchain technology in sustainable performance. However, in the agri-food sector, there is a lack of good literature on the mediation effect of blockchain technology in between the relationship of blockchain with sustainable supply chain performance empirically. This study prepares the comprehensive base for the feasibility and potential of BLCT adoption for sustainable development in ASC based on UTAUT and TOE theory. This study contributes to the knowledge gap in three ways. First, by exploring the relationship between BLCT and SSCP and finds that BLCT adoption positively affects SSCP. This provides empirical evidence for how BLCT adoption can help in achieving sustainable goals in ASC. Second, this study has also addressed the gap in the relationship of GLPR with BLCT adoption and found that the need for green and lean practices can induce BLCT adoption. This finding highlights that BLCT adoption in ASC can facilitate the successful execution of lean and green tools such as VSM and LCA. Third, the mediating effect of BLCT on the relationship of SUCI, SUCR, IEEC, RESU, PERE, TMSU, INNC, GLPR, and cost with SSCP and found full mediation effect of BLCT for the relation of SUCI, GLPR, and cost with SSCP. This means blockchain indirectly affects SUCI, GLPR, and cost relation with SSCP. In addition to these three new findings, the findings of this study also showed that SUCI, SUCR, IEEC, RESU, INNC, and cost positively affect BLCT adoption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Managerial implications</head><p>The study provides understanding to the managers, technology service providers, and innovative project handlers about the role of BLCT for improving SP of ASC and the factors that affect BLCT adoption. Cost and green and lean practices are identified as the most significant factors affecting BLCT adoption. Cost is the most critical factor affecting BLCT adoption. Thus, managers need to focus on close coordination with the technology service providers to decrease and compensate for the cost as it requires high computing power and energy or resources, takes a long time for payback, and higher cost of hiring technical specialists because of higher demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kamilaris et al., 2019)</ref>. The implementation cost of BLCT is sustainable as BLCT reduces overall SC cost after successful implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Perboli et al., 2018)</ref>. The cost of BLCT adoption can be compensated by designing a suitable and resilient BLCT application model that can provide maximum benefits to ASC. This study also provides insights that green and lean practices positively influence BLCT and BLCT technology influencing SSCP. Managers can meet their sustainability targets through BLCT by applying green and lean practices and using tools like VSM and LCA. Managers and technology solution providers can utilize BLCT capabilities such as smart contract, immutability, transparency, traceability, trust, disintermediation, automation, verifiability, auditability, shared databased, provenance, and information security for achieving sustainability in SC operations by reducing food waste, food recall cost, food poisoning, and contamination, waste disposal costs, improving consumer health, quality of food delivered and promoting insurance program of small farmers, environmental practices for food production, fair payments thus reducing exploitation of labors. Managers need to improve collaboration, coordination, informationsharing strategy, and strategic alliance among ASC players to accelerate the BLCT adoption. For successful BLCT adoption in ASC, top managers need to focus on existing knowledge, experience, technical expertise, advanced information technology (IT), customs, culture, and people. As ASC mainly exists in rural areas and there is a lack of advanced IT skills dominated by customs and culture, technology service providers need to design BLCT with consideration of extra investment on upgrading existing IT infrastructure and increasing awareness of BLCT benefits to overcome societal pressure. The managers need to consider blockchain as a robust solution for mitigation ASC risk related to uncertainty in supply and demand, crop diseases, climate change, weather conditions, and payment delays as BLCT helps in improving traceability and transparency, increasing trust by eliminating intermediaries and real-time information available and also reducing human interference. This study highlights that the managers need to implement BLCT to improve innovation capability and mitigate SC risks effectively as blockchain helps in utilizing knowledge, products, ideas, and systems efficiently for the firm's benefit through real-time data availability. The findings reveal that policymakers need to frame robust and specific policies and regulations for the speedy adoption of blockchain. BLCT also helps meet the regulatory requirements of stringent food safety and quality regulations by providing accurate real-time data related to product movement throughout the ASC. After all these benefits, the top management is hesitant and has no trust to support BLCT adoption because of its immaturity and absence of regulations as novel technology. The managers need to be aware of the benefits of BLCT for supporting its adoption in ASC. The technology service providers need to provide cost-effective and innovative BLCT design and increase awareness by providing successful implementation examples and their relative benefits in profitability and durability.</p><p>Additionally, managers need to be aware of the indirect effect of BLCT for the relationship of SUCI, GLPR, and cost with SSCP. This means BLCT somehow supports SUCI, GLPR, and cost to enhance SSCP further. Therefore, this study provides implications for both managers and service providers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and future scope</head><p>Our study discovered the mediating role of blockchain technology to improve the SSCP of the agri-food sector in Indian ASC. However, authors have previously discussed blockchain's critical success factors for sustainability and blockchain adoption factors separately. This study explained blockchain's mediating role in achieving agriculture supply chain sustainability based on UTAUT and TOE theory on BLCT adoption. The proposed research model on BLCT identifies nine factors: GLPR, SUCI, SUCR, IEEC, RESU, PERE, TMSU, INNC, and cost that influence BLCT adoption. The proposed model was validated by performing a survey in Indian ASC, and an overall sample from 316 respondents was collected. The findings suggest that SUCI, GLPR, and cost need mediating support of BLCT to affect SSCP.</p><p>For mitigating supply chain risks caused by climate change, crop diseases, supply and demand uncertainties, and the long payback period, BLCT adoption can be useful. The innovation capability of ASC can also be improved through blockchain adoption. Cost, green and lean practices, and internal and external environmental conditions are the most significant to affect blockchain adoption, respectively. The supply chain cost incurred for blockchain implementation is higher due to high resource requirements <ref type="bibr">(Wong et al., 2020a)</ref>, but the benefits that BLCT provides can reduce the overall cost of SC after its use in ASC. This study suggests that top managers need to be aware of the benefits that BLCT provides for efficiently managing supply chain operations and improving performance. The reason for low awareness and knowledge of BLCT benefits are its immaturity of implementation, lack of empirical evidence of performance benefits, and absence of robust and specific legislations 123 of its use and requirement of regulations update. Overall, cost and green and lean practices play an essential role in affecting blockchain adoption, and these factors further improve SSCP with the help of the indirect effect of BLCT. This study assists stakeholders, managers, policymakers, technology service providers, and innovative project handlers in understanding and identifying the role of critical factors affecting BLCT adoption and additionally, forming strategies for improving sustainable performance by improving SC integration, green and lean practices implementation, and reducing cost of SC and also through blockchain adoption.</p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_5"><head>Table 6 (</head><label>6</label><figDesc>It means a firm's ability to apply simple, creative, standardized, innovative solutions and technologies to improve ASC and protect it against risks related to climate, natural calamities, diseases etc. The innovative technique should provide real-time monitoring of all ASC players and bring them to one platform through a shared database. BLCT helps improve operations at regular intervals through continuous tracking of the event throughout the ASC from farm to fork. Thus, improving food safety, quality, reducing risks, and lead time leads to improved service and higher consumer satisfaction by delivering good quality products at a time. This factor refers to the overall cost of SC from hardware, software, labor, maintenance, distribution, transportation, transaction to BLCT adoption cost. The reduction of human error due to its implementation also reduces costs at retailer and manufacturer's ends. It also reduces administrative, infrastructure or facility, manpower, operational, energy, and maintenance costs due to lowered investment in paperwork, consumable items, time-saving, speedy decision making, improved management and administration, and shared database. BLCT enabled ASC to mitigate risks by efficiently managing demand and supply, thus reducing inventory management costs. Cryptographic signature protection and smart contracts may help prevent suppliers and other ASC players from frauds and ensure safe and secure transactions, thus reducing transaction costs. The improved traceability of BLCT enabled ASC leads to reduced SC cost by increasing responsiveness and assuring quality and safety of delivered food products. The cost incurred by SC risk such as climate change, riots, pandemic, order delay and missing, machine breakdown can also be reduced through BLCT adoption. Smart contracts, real-time management of all SC activities and transactions helps in improving trust among SC partners and participation of smallholders. The immutability benefits of BLCT adoption is responsible for trust enhancement and a transparent system for improved traceability in ASC. BLCT eliminates intermediaries and ensures SC traceability and transparency in ASC to reduce risks by providing a decentratlized platform to all players of ASC to access authentic real-time information of product at any time and also track food items. The increased automation and common platform for food prices' bargaining help distributors eliminate intermediaries or traders through direct payment to customers. The provenance capability of BLCT provides ASC the last mile connectivity, and all the players can trace back the orgin of the food item througot the chain. BLCT accompanied by shared database, digital tokens and unique fingerprints for each food product ensures suitability and verifiability of information. The uncertainty of return on investment and dominance of traditional solutions can affect the capability of BLCT in ASC. The real-time monitoring of food products's movements and custody promotes transparency in ASC.The common ledger for information storage and access can put the privacy of ASC firms at risk. The validation requirement for each transaction in BLCT enabled ASC to assure no change in information after storage, saving from fraud and ensuring information security. In BLCT enabled SC, the availability of comprehensive data related to the shelf life of food can be used for food waste reduction.Firms can also reduce food poisoning, food recall, food spoilage, and food contamination by real-time monitoring of food through BLCT, thus reducing waste disposal and degradation to the environment by improving natural resource management. The improved traceability also helps in improving consumer health and the quality of products delivered to them in compliance with regulations. BLCT can also promote insurance programs for securing farmers against risks such as natural disasters and climate change. It can also help in raising awareness about environmental practices followed for food production. BLCT based contracts can help in reducing the exploitation of labor by assisting authorities in fairness in payments and taxation. BLCT can also tackle corruption and the insufficient environmental, social, and economic regulations in developing countries.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Description</cell><cell>This refers to the performance measures which are believed to be</cell><cell>achieved after adopting blockchain and thus affect the intention</cell><cell>to adopt blockchain.
