<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose: In this paper, we adopt the dynamic capabilities view as a theoretical framework to empirically investigate the relationships among human resource (HR)-related quality management (QM) practices, new product development (NPD) as a specific dynamic capability, learning orientation, knowledge integration, and strategic flexibility. Learning orientation and knowledge integration represent two antecedents of strategic flexibility, and strategic flexibility is the developed ability that facilitates NPD. Design/methodology/approach: To empirically test the relationships, we used data from 236 European firms and performed Structural Equation Modeling. Findings: Results indicate that HR-related QM practices contribute to (1) creating a learningoriented company, (2) integrating knowledge, and (3) supporting successful new product development (NPD). Furthermore, knowledge integration is positively related to NPD through strategic flexibility.</p><p>Practical implications: This study is relevant for practitioners because it identifies key points in QM implementation that enable firms to be more strategically flexible and thus better able to regularly develop new products.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In recent decades, the importance of Quality Management (QM) as a key competitive variable has been widely recognized by scholars and practitioners who generally agree that QM practices have a positive effect on firms' performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Powell, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Nair, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kaynak and Hartley, 2008)</ref>. However, current business environments are characterized by high levels of dynamism and complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Teece, 2007)</ref>, but even companies with excellent quality levels in a particular period cannot be certain that they will sustain their position. Toyota, Sony, and Mercedes-Benz are examples of companies that have challenges sustaining such long-term performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Su et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Su and Linderman, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>If organizations want to sustain their positions by continuously adapting to environmental changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Teece, 2007)</ref>, it is important to study not only how QM implementation is positively related to the firm performance on which a significant portion of QM literature has focused, but also to study whether QM implementation is related to strategic variables and can make a contribution to the development of strategic abilities. The dynamic capabilities (DCs) perspective serves as an appropriate theoretical framework for investigating the possible relationships between QM and the strategic variables linked to environmental adaption. DCs are organizational abilities that help firms sustain their positions as they formulate an organizational response to environmental changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Teece et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Zollo and Winter, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Teece, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>As discussed in the literature on organizational change, highly capable managers with multi-skilled workforces, effective use of teamwork, and the creation of a unique culture that fosters organizational learning and innovation are essential for encouraging employees to adapt to change (Cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Beughelsdijk, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Wei and Lau, 2010)</ref>. Human resource (HR) practices allow employees to discover and employ knowledge and experience in organizations to develop creative ideas and discover new opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Scarbrough, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Lopez-Cabrales et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen and Huang, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Prajogo and Oke, 2016)</ref>. Thus, they provide an infrastructure that facilitates the development of DCs-NPD in this paper- <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Nielsen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Chiang and Shih, 2011)</ref>. In this endeavor, HR-related QM practices with their different focus-e.g. explorative or exploitative- <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Herzallah et al., 2017)</ref> can make organizations more sensitive to variations in the environment, become more strategically flexible and thus better able to adapt to changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Gómez-Gras and Verdú-Jover, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Hackman and Wageman, 1995)</ref>. HR-related QM practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kaynak, 2003)</ref> with their specific focus on quality have never been empirically analyzed from a DC perspective. The literature on QM and DCs does not offer an integrated framework with empirical support that identifies the role of HR-related QM practices in the development of a DC such as NPD and the development of strategic abilities.</p><p>Thus, following the new line of research suggesting that QM should be integrated with a DC framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Su et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Su and Linderman, 2016)</ref>, this paper fills the gap in the literature by empirically analyzing the relationship between HR-related QM practices, strategic flexibility, and NPD. More specifically, this study addresses the following research question: how are HRrelated QM practices related to strategic flexibility as the developed ability and NPD?</p><p>Our study contributes to the body of research by enabling identification of HR-related QM practices that can promote the development of adaptation abilities such as strategic flexibility, which finally enables firms to stand out in NPD. So far, issues related to HR practices from a DC perspective have been ignored in the managerial research agenda <ref type="bibr">(Vogel and Guttel, 2013)</ref>. Thus this study also offers valuable contributions for managers because it recommends ways to foster and identify key points in QM implementation that enable firms to be more strategically flexible and better able to develop regularly new products.</p><p>To analyze the development of a DC in this study, we conceptualize NPD as a DC.</p><p>Frequently, empirical studies have attempted to describe the nature of DCs through the analysis of NPD as a best practice that illustrates how organizations reconfigure their resources and capabilities to respond to the environment (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Barrales-Molina et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Pavlou and El Sawy, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Schilke, 2014)</ref>. Companies such as Apple, Intel, and Gillette responded to environmental changes and even imposed a specific rhythm on their environments by developing new products (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Danneels, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Helfat and Winter, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Teece, 2012)</ref>. At the same time, NPD is closely connected to QM. Firms that have implemented QM initiatives are likely to have a better foundation for implementing new NPD approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Sun and Zhao, 2010)</ref>. HR-related QM practices in particular increase communication and information exchange, assign responsibilities to employees, and facilitate autonomy to experiment, all of which enhance innovative processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Prajogo and Sohal, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Perdomo-Ortiz et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Results regarding the relationship between QM and innovation have been mixed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kim et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Perdomo-Ortiz et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Prajogo and</ref><ref type="bibr">Sohal, 2001, Zeng et al. 2017)</ref>. The findings of our study may indicate that there is a positive relationship between QM and innovation, and they may offer empirical evidence supporting the line of research that affirms the existence of this relationship.</p><p>The study is structured as follows. Section 2 provides theoretical background and justifies the hypotheses and proposed model. Section 3 then presents the research methodology used in the study: the construction of the measurement instruments, the survey procedure, the sampling performed, and the validation of the scales. Section 4 includes the results obtained by contrasting the hypotheses, and Section 5 discusses the results as well as the implications for research and management. Finally, we present the study's limitations and suggestions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical background; the research model and hypotheses development</head><p>The dynamic capabilities view is an extension of the well-established resource-based view (RBV). RBV proposes that firm resources and its heterogeneity determine the possibility of obtaining sustainable competitive advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Barney, 1991)</ref>. But RBV is being challenged by today's dynamic and turbulent environments, and these challenges have prompted scholars to extend RBV to the dynamic capabilities view <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Teece et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Helfat and Peteraf, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hitt et al., 2016)</ref>. DCs are "(t)he firm's ability to integrate, build and reconfigure internal competencies and thus to address rapidly changing environments" <ref type="bibr">(Teece et al., 1997, p. 516)</ref>. Based on this definition, we can affirm that DCs allow continuous modification of the configuration of organizational resources, thereby achieving better adaptation to the environment.</p><p>With the aim of illustrating the nature of DCs, scholars have pointed to identifiable processes 1 that can be recognized as best practices when responding to environmental dynamism <ref type="bibr">(Ambrosini and Bowman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Schilke, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Pavlou and El Sawy, 2011)</ref>. Initially, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Eisenhardt and Martin (2000)</ref> proposed a wide set of best practices that can be considered specific to DCs (e. g., alliancing, mergers and acquisitions, product development, decision-making processes, and knowledge management). However, further research has established alliance management capability and NPD as the most widely recognized DCs for understanding how firms adapt to the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Schilke, 2014)</ref>. These specific processes also help us understand the role of DCs as higher order processes that impact ordinary capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Winter, 2003)</ref>. In this way, manufacturing, marketing, and logistic capabilities are key to maintaining the status quo in a company. However, DCs such as alliance management or NPD serve to trigger the reconfiguration of routines embedded in ordinary capabilities <ref type="bibr">(Drnevich and Kriaucinas, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Helfat and Winter, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Hine et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Wilden and Gudergan, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In particular, the literature provides empirical support for the suggestion that managers invest in NPD as a strategic solution for survival in some dynamic environments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Pavlou and El Sawy, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Schilke, 2014)</ref>. Regular introduction of products involves a great variety of activities that act as driving forces to renew organizational routines or even customers' habits and competitors' strategies, thus ensuring environmental adaptation in different industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Helfat and Winter, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>1 Although some studies have claimed that identifiable processes show many commonalities in companies that ensure a competitive advantage, some recent debates (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Peteraf et al., 2013)</ref> argue that although these identifiable processes can be similar between companies, they become different because the presence of factors such as experience, context, or timing modify and adapt these processes to the specific characteristics of each organization and thereby becoming idiosyncratic capabilities.</p><p>Interest in understanding the components or underlying processes of DCs has led researchers to identify prospective mechanisms or antecedents for their development (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Zollo and Winter, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Nielsen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Zahra et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Teece, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang and Ahmed, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ambrosini and Bowman, 2009)</ref>. In particular, scholars have argued that the roles of absorptive capacity <ref type="bibr">(Wang and Ahmed, 2007)</ref>, knowledge management <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Nielsen, 2006)</ref> and learning mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Zollo and Winter, 2002)</ref> are key components in the development of DCs. These antecedents have usually been identified based on a key premise: organizational learning is the most important component of DCs because it is the mechanism organizations use to update and refine organizational knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Zollo and Winter, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Winter, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Teece, 2012)</ref>. Organizations that expect to enhance their organizational knowledge need to develop an appropriate orientation (cultural values, principles, and so on) for this purpose. Thus being a learning-orientated organization plays a fundamental role in effective DC development <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Nielsen, 2006)</ref>. Organizations with outstanding DCs usually develop them through trial and error as well as through improvisation and imitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Zahra et al., 2006)</ref>, and these firms must be able to learn from past mistakes and experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Nielsen, 2006)</ref>. Furthermore, DCs update and refine the knowledge embedded in organizational routines, and they require a balanced set of activities for this purpose related to knowledge management and organizational learning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Nielsen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Easterby-Smith and Prieto, 2008)</ref>. For this reason, learning orientation alone is not sufficient for effective DCs development. Organizations may be clearly learning oriented, but it is also necessary to complete this orientation with such necessary practices for knowledge integration as decision-making groups or behavior patterns for knowledge sharing. The role played by knowledge integration is also noteworthy because it is the bridge between the creation of new knowledge and the use of existing knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Zollo and Winter, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Nielsen, 2006)</ref>. In summary, the learning orientation will guide learning processes inside an organization that will result in the integration of new and heterogeneous knowledge. This internal context, if it is based on learning orientation and knowledge integration, strengthens the organizational ability to sense and respond regularly to a wide range of environmental changes, which could suggest the connection between such antecedents and strategic flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Volberda, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Chiang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Barrales-Molina et al., 2013)</ref>. Learning orientation, knowledge integration and strategic flexibility shape the organizational ecosystems where DCs such as NPD are generated in response to environmental changes <ref type="bibr">(Schilke, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Singh et al., 2013)</ref>. The definition of each variable is provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p><p>- <ref type="figure">----------------------------------------</ref>Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> about here -----------------------------------------QM can be defined as "a holistic management philosophy that strives for continuous improvement in all functions of an organization" <ref type="bibr">(Kaynak, 2003, p. 406)</ref>. It relies on a series of practices that vary from those oriented toward customers, suppliers, employees, and managers to those oriented toward technical aspects. Effective implementation of these practices requires an integrative approach (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Flynn et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ho et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kaynak and Hartley, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kim et al., 2012)</ref>. Although HR-related QM practices are not directly related to increased performance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Flynn et al, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kaynak and Hartley, 2008)</ref>, they do play a significant role. They enable wider dissemination of the vision that the organization aims to achieve, and they foster the involvement and identification of employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Finley, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bayo-Moriones et al., 2011)</ref>, which in turn increases employees' commitment to QM and facilitates the implementation of technical QM practices. That may be the reason that the published research on QM identifies HR management as one of the most important factors for successful implementation of QM <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Kaynak and Hartley, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Nair, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Sila and Ebrahimpour, 2005)</ref>. Consistent with the current research, this study focuses on three HR-related QM practices: training, employee empowerment, and teamwork. These three practices have been extensively documented in QM literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Saraph et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Anderson et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Flynn et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Powell, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ahire et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Kaynak, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Sila and Ebrahimpour, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kaynak and Hartley, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kim et al., 2012)</ref>. Their definitions are included in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>.</p><p>- <ref type="figure">----------------------------------------</ref>Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> about here - <ref type="figure">----------------------------------------</ref>HR practices are strategically valuable for a firm because they are firm-specific, meaning they are difficult to imitate or replace <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Barney 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Lepak and Snell, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Longoni and Cagliano, 2016)</ref>. A strategic HR management system, which consists of those unique and valuable HR practices that enhance organizational performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Delery and Doty, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Lepak and Snell, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Chuang and Liao, 2010)</ref>, includes HR-related QM practices such as "high performance work practices" <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Osterman, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Chuang and Liao, 2010)</ref>. HR management literature proposes that these practices significantly contribute to organizational innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Lau and Ngo, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Shipton et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Lopez-Cabrales et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen and Huang, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ceylan, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Zhou et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Fay et al., 2015)</ref>. Training develops employees' abilities, knowledge, and skills, which can provide a source of new ideas, processes, and practices.</p><p>Empowerment motivates employees and facilitates decentralization, both of which generate new ideas and opportunities for innovation. Teamwork develops individual initial ideas, encourages employees to exchange knowledge, and produces a divergence of orientation, thereby creating a wider range of options. Moreover, teamwork breaks down barriers so that communication and information exchange are improved, both of which contribute to innovation.</p><p>Drawing on the literature and the theoretical foundation it provides, we propose a research model (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) that includes the relationships among HR-related QM practices: learning orientation, knowledge integration, strategic flexibility, and NPD. In the remainder of this section, we present the discussions leading to the research hypotheses.</p><p>- <ref type="figure">----------------------------------------</ref>Insert Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> about here - <ref type="figure">----------------------------------------</ref>HR-related QM practices HR-related QM practices can play a fundamental role in the learning orientation of an organization. First, training employees in ways that facilitate their problem-solving abilities will contribute to learning-oriented organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Yang and Chen, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Flores et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Training fostered by QM managers facilitates intellectual stimulation, experimentation, dialogue, and motivation, all of which strengthen learning orientation in firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Lloréns et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ruiz et al., 2005)</ref>. Second, empowerment fosters employees' interaction and enhancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Silos, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Baird and Wang, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Zeng et al., 2017)</ref>. All these abilities enhance communication and the exchange of ideas among an organization's members, activity that facilitates learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ahire et al., 1996)</ref>. In addition, team mechanisms such as quality circles or suggestions systems for knowledge codification and transfer are also conducive to creating an environment that fosters learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Arthur and Huntley, 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Linderman et al. (2004)</ref> propose that the use of teams promotes socialization, which enables knowledge-sharing, aids in the generation of new ideas for improvement, and facilitates the use of existing knowledge in the workforce. Under QM, teamwork facilitates communication and evaluates alternatives according to their benefits and disadvantages, thereby promoting a learning-oriented organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Ruiz et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Caemmerer and Wilson, 2010)</ref>. The implementation of these HR-related QM practices will contribute to the creation of a work environment that leads to stronger learning-oriented organizations. For instance, Amancio Ortega, founder and president of Zara until 2011, developed a learningoriented organization through the implementation of horizontal communication systems, teamwork, and the delegation of decision-making, all of which empower employees. Designers and manufacturers at Zara set up teams for a continuous learning-orientation process and analyzed customers' preferences, including their tendencies and consumption behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Martínez, 2012)</ref>. Consequently, the following hypothesis is proposed: H1a: HR-related QM practices are positively related to learning orientation.</p><p>QM teams are comprised of cross-functional members who share their knowledge and propose new improvement possibilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Silos, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Chiles and Choi, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Zeng et al., 2017)</ref>. This teamwork contributes to the exchange of individual knowledge and experience, thus generating the knowledge integration process. Furthermore, QM encourages employees to work according to common methodologies such as plan, do, check, and act (PDCA) as well as prompts them to establish common goals for all teams. The use of a common language among team members leads to similar behavior that contributes to knowledge integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Edwards et al., 2011)</ref>. To run all these processes, management must provide the resources needed to carry out proper and complete training of employees in the principles, procedures, and tools that QM uses <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Flynn et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Kaynak, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kaynak and Hartley, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kim et al., 2012)</ref>. Further, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Huang et al. (2001)</ref> argue that the knowledge integration process is conducted through social interaction, which is fostered by employees' empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Silos, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Baird and Wang, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>To improve its knowledge integration capability, Fiat, for instance, created a new team-based structure that incorporated a division for the development of platforms and components <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Becker and Zirpoli, 2003)</ref>. Therefore, we suggest the following hypothesis: H1b: HR-related QM practices are positively related to knowledge integration. The implementation of QM is a positive context for NPD because, among other factors, good alignment exists between the market and the technological state of the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Perdomo-Ortiz et al., 2006)</ref>. Empowering employees encourages them to participate actively in the improvement of process efficiency and product quality, and empowerment provides them with the structure needed to make these improvements <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ahire et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Silos, 1999)</ref>. All these improvements may result in developing new products and services that generally satisfy customers.</p><p>Furthermore, when teamwork is initiated in such cross-functional teams as NPD teams, experts from different fields are able to combine their specialized knowledge to generate new ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Madjar et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Chiang and Hung, 2014)</ref>. Teamwork is considered a crucial factor in enhancing the individual creativity that is important to the success of NPD projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Dayan and Benedetto, 2009)</ref>. At the same time, a team problem-solving approach leads employees to improve existing products or services <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Kim et al., 2012)</ref>. Additionally, empowerment and teamwork strengthen communication channels, promote autonomy and self-evaluation, reduce restrictions caused by technical aspects, and foster the capacity for innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Perdomo-Ortiz et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Prajogo and Sohal, 2001)</ref>. Toyota Prius and Toyota Lexus represent two examples of successful NPD that utilize a team-based structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Liker, 2004)</ref>. For this purpose, an organization must create a work environment characterized by trust, open communication, and participation, and it must provide the resources needed to carry out proper, complete training. QM-related HR practices, then, play a crucial role in creating such an environment and providing necessary resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Flynn et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ahire et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Kaynak, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Sila and Ebrahimpour, 2005)</ref>. According to the arguments offered above, we propose the following hypothesis: H1c: HR-related QM practices are positively related to NPD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning orientation</head><p>Learning orientation involves a climate of cooperation and open communication whose key features include shared vision, commitment, open-mindedness, and intra-organizational knowledge sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Calantone et al., 2002)</ref>. This ideal climate, in turn, influences what kind of information is gathered and how it is interpreted, evaluated, and shared <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Sinkula et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Moorman and Miner, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Hult et al., 2004)</ref>. As a result, frequent and regular knowledge-flows occur in organizations with effective learning orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Huang and Wang, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Tamayo-Torres et al., 2016)</ref>, and these flows promote the sharing of individual specialist knowledge related to customer needs, technical systems, and organizational assets. A good example is Pixar, which created a professional-development program called Pixar University with the intent of building common values, spirit, and communication among employees. Although employee training was the primary goal of Pixar University, this program enabled specialized employees (cartoonists, computer programmers, designers, artists, and administration staff) to understand and respect the tasks that each performed <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Catmull, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Nowadays, the level of complexity of organizational knowledge is so high that all relevant knowledge cannot be contained within a specific department or organizational community <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Grant, 1996)</ref>. Consequently, knowledge integration is fundamental for the advancement of new organizational projects. In this context, learning orientation can be considered one of the structural variables that defines the level of knowledge integration potential. Consistently, previous research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kogut and Zander, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Szulanski, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Kenney and Gudergan, 2006)</ref> has defined learning orientation as a requisite inseparable from the structure and context in which the integration process occurs. Based on the foregoing explanation, becoming a learning-oriented organization can be seen as a necessary step toward developing knowledge integration. In order to achieve shared beliefs, employees must be willing to work in a context of regular social interaction that is based on trust and open-mindedness.</p><p>Such an environment promotes intra-organizational knowledge sharing. Thus, we formulate the next hypothesis: H2: Learning orientation is positively related to knowledge integration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Knowledge integration</head><p>Initially, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Grant (1996)</ref> suggested that knowledge integration can be considered the origin of fast response capability and, subsequently, empirical studies have contributed to explaining that knowledge integration helps to renew regularly the knowledge basis of the firm and incorporate new external knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Okhuysen and Eisenhardt, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Kenney and Gudergan, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Alegre et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Majchrzak et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Eriksson, 2014)</ref>. In this way, recent studies point out that knowledge integration is seen as a valuable mechanism to sense and understand changes in such highly dynamic environments as the biotechnology sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alegre et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Kamuriwo and Baden-Fuller, 2016)</ref> and other high-tech industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Caridi-Zahavi et al., 2016)</ref> because the integration of knowledge facilitates sharing of valuable knowledge among members of the firm when facing these changes. For these reasons, knowledge integration can be used to promote sensing continual environment demands and adjust organizational responses to them. In essence, knowledge integration can strengthen the strategic flexibility of the organization, understood as its ability to sense and respond to major external changes by identifying new opportunities and threats, and then implementing regular strategic changes that can exploit the new conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Volberda, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adner and Helfat, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Shimizu and Hitt, 2004)</ref>. We would expect, then, that a firm with knowledge integration capability should develop strategic flexibility. Thus, we formulate the next hypothesis: H3: Knowledge integration is positively related to strategic flexibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strategic flexibility</head><p>In turbulent environments, strategic flexibility becomes a fundamental capability for responding to diverse environmental demands. In fact, firms can realize their strategic flexibility through NPD and offer new products or services that respond to the sensed opportunities and threats. Previous empirical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kandemir and Acur, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Thomas, 2014)</ref> suggest this connection between strategic flexibility and NPD when the environment is perceived as turbulent, and in these conditions, strategic decision-making processes must be able to better fit market demands through NPD. NPD can be seen consistently as the result derived from strategic and tactical decisions that respond to the environment. Strategically flexible firms are able to detect and understand the opportunities and threats from the environment and at the same time, they are able to make a set of tactical decisions to coordinate investments and the cross functional teams that launch the new products and services exploiting the new conditions sensed <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Dess and Lumpkin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Barrales-Molina et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Tamayo-Torres et al., 2016)</ref>. The smartphone industry offers an outstanding example of turbulent environments in which firms demonstrate their strategic flexibility through remarkable efforts on NPD to offer new versions of smartphones twice a year <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Suarez and Grodal, 2015)</ref>. The resulting NPD shows that the ability to be strategically flexible so that it can sense new market demands and exploit them by adding new product features that respond to competitor actions, customer demands, and national regulations. Thus, we can formulate the next hypothesis: H4: Strategic flexibility is positively related to NPD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research methodology</head><p>The data for this research were drawn from a study that focused on QM implementation, its structural components, and its relationships to DCs in several European countries. Data obtained through cross-sectional email surveys, which is useful for reaching a large number of subjects, are appropriate for this study because our research questions require studying the relationships between multiple variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Kaynak, 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construction of the instrument and content validity</head><p>To identify the different items and scales included in this research, we performed an indepth literature review. All scales of HR-related QM practices and strategic flexibility were composed of original items in the literature. Individual relationships between QM practices have already been tested in various studies, which suggest their interdependent nature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Kaynak, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kim et al., 2012)</ref>. For this reason, considering the similarity and interrelationships between HR-related QM practices and following previous research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ho et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Lau and Ngo, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rahman and Bullok, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Naor et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Lopez-Cabrales et al., 2009)</ref>, we group all HR-related QM practices into a second order factor. Scales for learning orientation, knowledge integration, and NPD were created after reviewing the related literature. NPD capability is reflected by organizational routines supporting innovation processes aimed at introducing new product innovations <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Lawson and Samson, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Schilke, 2014)</ref>. Following recommendations from previous research on NPD (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Kandemir and Acur, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Laaksonen and Peltoniemi, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Schilke, 2014)</ref>, we used performance scores on NPD to avoid slant derived from managerial responses. In other words, we used four items of NPD performance as a proxy for NPD measurement. These items measure how an organization introduces new processes, services or products, and enters new markets. The list of scales, items, and their sources are presented in Appendix A. For all the scales, we used a Likert-type scale of seven points.</p><p>Once designed, the questionnaire was pre-tested by five quality managers from firms in different sectors. We tested the study using these responses because the test sample was similar to our actual sample. This pilot test enabled the clarification of possible ambiguities, correction of errors, and the solution of formatting problems. After a thorough analysis of the questionnaire, the quality managers recommended some modifications that would facilitate comprehension of the questions and a few minor changes in wording. These changes were incorporated into the questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Target population and survey procedure</head><p>The target sample for the study was composed of 3,024 European firms. The firms contacted were chosen randomly from the Amadeus database and Actualidad <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Económica (2004)</ref>.</p><p>The procedure for data collection consisted of emailing a letter explaining the research project to the CEO or the quality manager of each firm. This letter included a direct link to a questionnaire available online. By clicking on the link, respondents could access the questionnaire, complete it online, and then send it automatically to a central computer where all responses were saved. To mitigate sampling error, this research offered the possibility of sending a summary of the survey results to respondents, and multiple mailings were sent to increase the response rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Ravichandran, 2000)</ref>. Ultimately, we received 254 replies. Eighteen answers were unusable because they contained an error or were duplicated. The online questionnaire does not allow its submission if it was incomplete, thereby removing the possibility of missing values.</p><p>Consequently, we had 236 usable questionnaires, a 7.8% final response rate. Some nonrespondents explained that they did not want to participate in this research because (1) they had already responded to some survey studies; (2) they did not have time to fill out the questionnaire; and/or (3) their companies did not permit them to respond to surveys. While the response rate for this study is relatively low, which may limit the study's generalizability, such a response rate is common for this type of study. Successful management studies such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Wu et al. (2012)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Shah and Ward (2003)</ref> had similar response rates-6.15% and 6.7%, respectively. The sampling frame, identified through Amadeus database and Actualidad <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Económica (2004)</ref>, covers a wide variety of industries and countries, thus the concern of generalizability was largely mitigated.</p><p>We also estimated non-response bias. This test determines whether there is any significant difference between early and late respondents <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Amstrong and Overton, 1977)</ref>. To test for this bias, an independent sample t-test was run for the HR-related QM practices and the other variables related to DCs. The results obtained did not show any significant difference between the two groups. Additionally, some χ 2 tests were run to test whether there was any significant difference in three demographic variables (number of employees, total sales, and activity sector) between the two waves of responses. Once again, the results showed no significant differences.</p><p>Finally, we investigated the possibility that common method variance might be present.</p><p>First, the questionnaire was pre-tested to eliminate ambiguities. This is one of the procedural remedies utilized to avoid this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Podsakoff et al., 2012)</ref>. Second, if common method bias is a serious threat to the research results, a single factor would account for most of the variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Podsakoff et al., 2012)</ref>. Thus, following Schilke (2014), we performed Harman's one-factor test.</p><p>According to the literature, common method variance is not a serious threat if the one-factor model has a poor fit with the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Schilke, 2014)</ref>. Final results show that the one-factor model did not fit the data (2/df = 9.65; CFI = 0.467; RMSEA = 0.249; NFI = 0.443; and NNFI = 0.411), thus common method variance seems not to be a problem for this study. Nevertheless, as Harman's one-factor test has several limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Podsakoff et al., 2012)</ref>, we also studied the fit of the measurement model, greater than 0.90, and the correlations between variables, neither of which suggests a problem with common method variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Volberda et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample demographics</head><p>Replies came from the eleven European countries selected: Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Romania, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Austria, Belgium, Sweden, and Germany. Spain (62.71%) and Italy (17.8%) were the countries from which the most responses were received. The rest of the sample (19.49%) was distributed in similar proportions between the other countries.</p><p>The original sample was composed of manufacturing and service firms. By activity sector, the 236 firms used in this research are distributed as follows: 49 belong to different activities in the service sector (20.76%), 43 to machinery and components (17.80%), 31 to construction (13.14%), 28 to the food industry (11.86%), 22 to the metal industry (9.32%), 20 to the chemistry sector (8.47%), 18 to electricity and electronics (7.63%), and the remaining 26 to miscellaneous sectors (11.02%). Our cross-industry sample is appropriate, as <ref type="bibr">Pannirselvan and Ferguson (2001)</ref> suggest, because distinctions between manufacturing and services have become blurred, as manufacturers have become more responsive to customers, and service organizations have become more concerned about quality process and output.</p><p>Approximately 12.29% of the firms had 50 or fewer employees, 46.19% employed 51-250 employees, 27.12% employed 251-1,000 employees, and 12.29% employed over 1,000 employees. Among the firms, 2.12% of the firms reported annual sales of 1 million Euros or less, and 7.63% of the firms had annual sales of 1-7 million Euros. Firms with annual sales of 7-40 million Euros comprised about 51.27% of the final sample, and approximately 38.98% of the firms had annual sales of more than 40 million Euros.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Validity and reliability of scales</head><p>All the assumptions of multivariate analysis-normality, linearity, homoscedasticity, and multicollinearity-were tested for all the variables.

In the light of their recommendation, the observation has been retained in the analysis.</p><p>To assess construct validity, and following the procedure of <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Kaynak and Hartley (2006)</ref>, all scales were analyzed using an extensive validation process. We first established the content validity of the scales by performing an extensive literature review. Second, we obtained the reliability values of the scales by calculating Cronbach's α (Appendix A). After reliability was confirmed, unidimensionality was tested. For this purpose, we ran exploratory factor analyses using principal component extraction and varimax rotation techniques 1 . Next, as a final refinement for unidimensionality, the scales were evaluated utilizing Lisrel 8.53 software and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In particular, we analyzed three measurement models: two for HR-related QM practices (first-order and second-order models) and another for DC variables.</p><p>As presented in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, goodness-of-fit statistics related to all measurement models indicate a satisfactory fit of the measurement models to the data. The results of the second order model for HR-related QM practices show that the standardized factor loadings on each HR-related QM practice and their corresponding t-values are all significant <ref type="bibr">(Training λ=0.62;</ref><ref type="bibr">Empowerment λ=0.56;</ref><ref type="bibr">Teamwork λ=0.74;</ref>. Composite reliabilities for the refined scales are included in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.</p><p>Third, the CFA allowed us to analyze the scales' convergent validity. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Hulland (1999)</ref>, the items must have significant factor loadings <ref type="bibr">(t-value&gt;1.96, p-value&lt;0.05</ref>) and an individual reliability (R 2 ) greater than 0.5. Some items were removed from the scales to fulfill this requirement. All of the purified scales satisfied the requirements for convergent validity (Appendix A).</p><p>Next, we analyzed the discriminant validity of the scales. Following <ref type="bibr">Anderson and Gerbing (1998)</ref>, we constructed confidence intervals (±2 standard errors) around the estimated correlation between two factors. If this interval does not include 1.0, discriminant validity is achieved. Results confirmed that none of the confidence intervals include 1.0. As an additional test for discriminant validity, we compared the squared correlation of each pair of factors to average variance extracted (AVE) for each factor. To achieve discriminant validity, squared correlation of two factors must be less than the variance extracted for each factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Fornell and Larcker, 1981)</ref>, which the results confirm.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research implications</head><p>Hypotheses 1a, 1b, and 1c propose a positive relationship between HR-related QM practices and learning orientation, knowledge integration, and NPD. We wish to point out that the results obtained underscore the importance of HR-related QM practices for organizations.</p><p>The results of our study link HR-related QM practices to a DC such as NPD, thereby supporting the findings of studies specifically arguing that HR-related QM practices can contribute to performance through other variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Sousa and Voss, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Nair, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kaynak and Hartley, 2008)</ref>. Our study indicates that there is a positive relationship between QM and innovation, and it offers empirical evidence supporting the line of research that affirms the existence of this positive relationship.</p><p>Our results are also consistent with previous research affirming that HR-related QM practices such as training to enhance knowledge and empowerment to experiment for improvement can lead to a learning-oriented environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Sitkin et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Zhang et al., 2012)</ref> that supports the integration of knowledge throughout an organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Chiang and Shih, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Linderman et al. (2004)</ref> found a positive relationship between the use of teams and knowledge creation. Our study advances knowledge by supporting the relationship between the teamwork and learning orientation that precedes knowledge creation and subsequent knowledge integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Zollo and Winter, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Winter, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Nielsen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Barrales-Molina et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Our findings corroborate the theoretical contributions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Zollo and Winter, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Teece, 2007)</ref> that highlight the value of such organizational mechanisms as cross-functional teams and the knowledge articulation that initiates the teamwork that promotes knowledge integration and the development of new organizational routines for NPD. To sum up, our results empirically confirm that HR-related QM practices contribute to (1) creating a learning-oriented company, <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(2)</ref> integrating knowledge, and (3) supporting a successful NPD. Finally, we have to note that HRrelated QM practices are indirectly and positively related to strategic flexibility through knowledge integration. This conclusion agrees with the proposal of Gómez-Gras and Verdú-Jover (2005) that QM organizations develop better strategic flexibility than non-QM organizations because organizations that rely on QM practices are oriented from control to learning and from processes to customers. These movements and the integrated knowledge increase firms' options for formulating environmental adaption strategies and supporting the specific orientation of HR-related QM practices versus traditional HR practices.</p><p>Next, we focus on the relationships between learning orientation, knowledge integration, strategic flexibility, and NPD. As asserted by hypotheses 2 and 3, the positive relationship between learning orientation, knowledge integration, and strategic flexibility are supported. In this sense, our study adds empirical evidence to the theoretical connection between learning orientation, knowledge management, and strategic flexibility. Our results highlight the importance of organizational context to the effective integration of specific knowledge from different functional areas that can promote the open feedback, collaboration, and brainstorming that may be desirable when it comes to sharing and assimilating specialized knowledge.</p><p>Although some theoretical contributions argue the value of knowledge management to strategic flexibility (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Grant, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Nielsen, 2006)</ref>, our results emphasize that knowledge integration can be considered a necessary step to respond successfully to environmental demands. In other words, strategic flexibility is promoted by the combination of ideas and expertise contributed by different functional areas or departments. Once again, our results highlight the value of enhancing learning orientation in firms with mechanisms like cross-functional teams that integrate specialized knowledge and then disperse it throughout an organization, which strengthens strategic flexibility.</p><p>Finally, our results also support hypothesis 4, which asserts a positive relationship between strategic flexibility and NPD. These findings suggest that strategic flexibility can be seen as one of the developed abilities that underlies a specific DC such as NPD. This result is consistent with other empirical studies that shed light on how firms employ NPD to respond regularly to environmental opportunities and threats (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Pavlou and El Sawy, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Kandemir and Acur, 2012)</ref>. In other words, our findings show that the ability of a firm to be strategically flexible is demonstrated through NPD.</p><p>These results generate solid empirical support for the literature on DCs that confronts the challenge of explaining the nature of DCs through NPD. First, as we mentioned earlier, our study responds to some recent calls for connecting a DCs view with other related fields such as HR management and QM (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Vogel and Güttel, 2013)</ref>. Our findings highlight the need to pay more attention to HR-related QM in organizations that wish to develop DCs successfully. Second, these findings shed light on the micro-foundation of DCs, explaining and testing the antecedents of NPD in a context related to QM. In conclusion, this study contributes to the research on operations because our results show that variables such as QM, HR management, and NPD can be linked to the achievement of adaptive capabilities in organizations that are able to survive in hypercompetitive environments. In this sense, QM can play a significant role not only in daily activities of the organization but also in its strategic orientation for long run success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial implications</head><p>This study offers valuable contributions for managers because it recommends ways to foster and identify key points in QM implementation that enable firms to be more strategically flexible and better able to develop regularly new products. First, the results obtained generate a solid justification for implementing QM in an organization, as observed positive relationships with DC development support the QM implementation decision. In making this idea specific, we derive two new conclusions. One, our conclusions argue for the value of dedicated efforts and attention by managers to the HR-related practices proposed by QM, as we have empirically justified the positive relationships of these practices to NPD. We have also justified the notion that integrating two constructs-HR-related QM practices and NPD-can, given their importance in responding quickly to hypercompetitive environments, contribute significantly to the survival of an organization. As we have emphasized, QM is a multidimensional construct, and our results demonstrate the interdependence of HR-related QM practices.</p><p>As to specific practices, managers should create a culture that trains, develops, and empowers all employees, as they can play an increasingly active role in an organization. Our results also underline the importance of teamwork, which managers should promote. To achieve a high level of teamwork, managers should be cognizant of such issues as trust, techniques, tools for teamwork, problem solving, and the creation of spaces and times dedicated to teams, all of which are necessary for creating an environment that guarantees obtaining all possible benefits from the teams created.</p><p>Next, the analysis of three variables-learning orientation, knowledge integration, and strategic flexibilityemphasizes the attention that managers must pay to knowledge management if HR-related QM practices are to be beneficial. Thus organizations in which knowledge management plays a highly relevant role-or simply organizations that aim to stimulate this variable-can do so by focusing on the practices and structure that we have studied in our research.</p><p>Finally, managers should be cognizant of the value of building DCs when implementing QM. Our results suggest that investments in developing DCs such as NPD will ensure a better and regular response to turbulent environments. Beyond those traditional variables related to DCs (sustainable competitive advantage and performance), our study serves to highlight the point that strategic flexibility leads to the creation of specific DCs a such as NPD, which facilitates continuous environmental adaptation, thus becoming one of the pillars that sustains competitive advantages and achieves regular levels of performance. All these results, derived from European organizations with different sizes and activities that range from services to manufacturing, offer a roadmap for increasing competitive level and strengthening positions for survival in current turbulent markets facing international threats from Asian and American competitors. In particular, most of the analyzed companies are in Spain and Italy, two countries whose services and manufacturing industries are under strong pressure from international competition and must continue strengthening their competitive abilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The present study is as rigorous as possible so that it provides reliable and conclusive results. Nevertheless, the study has some limitations that must be noted. First, our study has a significant strategic focus. Because variables such as strategic flexibility, NPD, and learning orientation can be considered strategic variables, a cross-sectional study limits interpretation of them. As strategic variables show a long-term orientation, some of their effects may appear only in the future. Further, other HR-related QM practices such as performance appraisal or retribution are not included in this study. Moreover, the cross-sectional character of the study does not allow observation of the relationships between variables over time, thus further limiting interpretation of the results. Second, the low response rate could possibly limit the study's generalizability. Our literature review did not reveal any significant control variables that theoretically change the relationships between variables. Thus, we opted for a parsimonious model to provide clear and understandable results. Finally, the data were obtained from a single respondent in each organization and are self-reported. One consequence of this procedure is that the data may be less objective than data in studies that use multiple respondents or that analyze objective databases. The results must, therefore, be interpreted carefully.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and further research</head><p>This study aimed to empirically analyze the relationships between HR-related QM practices and NPD through strategic flexibility development. The results obtained identify a series of relationships affirming that HR-related QM practices are positively related to DC development, and, consequently, to organizational adaptation. Even so, it would be interesting for future studies to test our model with objective measures of organizational performance or competitive advantage.</p><p>This study also demonstrates the importance of the role HR-related QM practices play in organizations. We observed that these practices possess some characteristics that make it difficult for competitors to imitate them. However, the development of HR-related QM practices is not uniform among all initiatives for QM implementation (e.g., ISO standards, Malcolm Baldridge, or the EFQM model) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Gutierrez-Gutierrez et al., 2010)</ref>. Thus, a future line of research could analyze the behavior of these HR-related QM practices, based on the initiatives implemented by the organization, in greater depth. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Drnevich and Kriauciunas (2011)</ref> assert that the greater the dynamism, the greater the contribution dynamic capabilities may make. It would thus be interesting for future research to introduce dynamism of the environment as a moderating factor in the relationships analyzed.</p><p>Including dynamism or other factors such as turbulence or hostility would produce a more precise image and enable us to draw new conclusions about the potential of QM to stimulate DCs and thus guarantee organizational success.
