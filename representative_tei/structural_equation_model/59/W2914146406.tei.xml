<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background:</head><p>To analyze the longitudinal association between academic performance and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), vigorous physical activity (VPA), and sedentary time (SED) in a three-year longitudinal study. A secondary aim was to determine whether moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and vigorous physical activity were indirectly related with academic performance via waist circumference (WC). Methods: Physical activity (PA) and SED were measured by accelerometers. Academic performance was assessed by national tests in Danish and Math. Structural equation modeling was performed to evaluate whether MVPA, VPA and SED were associated with academic performance and the potential indirect relationship between PA and academic performance via WC. Results: MVPA and VPA were associated with academic performance, mediated via WC (β=0.036, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.002: 0.070 and β=0.096, 95%CI: 0.027: 0.164, respectively). SED was directly associated with academic performance (β=0.124, 95%CI: 0.030: 0.217; MVPA model and β=0.132, 95%CI: 0.044: 0.221; VPA model). Conclusions: Both PA and SED time were positively associated with academic performance. Based on this, PA should be encouraged in children and youth not only to promote physical health, but also to promote academic performance. Future studies are encouraged to distinguish between school-related SED and other SED activities and their relationship with academic performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between physical activity and academic performance in children and adolescents, and results are summarized in several reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> . Despite the considerable number of published studies, a recent systematic review did not find clear evidence regarding the relationship between physical activity and academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . One of the important issues that warrants consideration is study design. The vast majority of previous studies have been crosssectional, and the results are inconsistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . Most of the longitudinal studies that exist report positive relationships between physical activity and academic performance.</p><p>Booth et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> followed 4,755 children and adolescents from 11 to 16 years-old. More physically active children at 11 years-old exhibited higher academic performance at 13 and 16 years-old, compared to their less active peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . However, others have reported conflicting results <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . Hansen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> reported no significant linear or nonlinear relationship between physical activity and academic performance in a three-year followup study conducted with North American children. Moreover, Haapala et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> observed that total physical activity was related to worse academic performance in Finnish girls, and better academic performance in boys. Therefore, more work is necessary to examine relationships between physical activity and academic performance across time.</p><p>In addition, only a few studies have evaluated the relation between sedentary time and academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> , and to our knowledge only two studies with a longitudinal design <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . One study found that accelerometry-based sedentary time and academic performance were positively, longitudinally associated, whereas screen time was negatively associated with academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . Both longitudinal studies found that time spent studying or reading was positively associated with academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . Thorough examination is warranted to better characterize the relationship between sedentary time and academic performance.</p><p>One issue that further complicates examining these relationships is the fact that body weight has been shown to be negatively related to both physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> ; however, few studies have investigated the possible synergic relationship among these three factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . Telford et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> found that children who attended physical education classes conducted by specialists showed smaller increase in percentage of body fat and also greater improvements in academic performance compared to children who attended common-practice physical education classes. A better understanding of the physical activity-academic performance relationship is needed to inform parents, teachers, policy makers and the greater community. Therefore, the current investigation aimed to analyze the longitudinal association between academic performance and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), vigorous physical activity (VPA), and sedentary time (SED) in a three-year longitudinal study. A secondary aim was to determine whether moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and vigorous physical activity were indirectly related with academic performance via waist circumference (WC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>The current investigation was part of the Childhood Health, Activity, and Motor Performance School Study Denmark (CHAMPS-study DK), which was the research part of a community initiative: the Svendborg Project. Because the complete methodology of the CHAMPS-study DK has been extensively published elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , only the variables of interest are described here. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. It was approved by the local scientific ethics committee (ID S20080047) and registered in the Danish Data Protection Agency (J.nr. 2008-41-2240).</p><p>Parents had to provide written consent before their children were included in the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements</head><p>Since 2010, the Danish school system has performed a national standardized test to assess academic performance of all the children enrolled in Danish schools. Therefore, the current study was able to evaluate the association between physical activity and academic performance in 902 students from seven-to-12-years of age, starting in 2010 during a three-year period (2010 -2013). The national test is a standardized computer test, which advances according to the children's performance. Thus, a question answered correctly would be followed by a more complex question. Similarly, a less complex question would follow an incorrect answer. The children were tested in Danish in the second, fourth, sixth and eighth grades, whereas Math performance was assessed in the third and sixth grades. Both subjects were evaluated in three different domains. In particular, language understanding, decoding and text comprehension were domains evaluated in the Danish tests, and algebra, geometry and basic mathematics skills were domains tested in Math. The total score for each subject could range from 0 to 300 points. A composite academic performance score was calculated by summing scores from both subjects (Danish and Math). In the sixth grade, an average of the performance in Danish and Math was used because participants were tested in both subjects at this school class.</p><p>Mother's education was collected via a questionnaire and categorized into five levels: primary and lower secondary education, general upper secondary education, vocational education and training, bachelor degree and masters or PhD degree.</p><p>Information on learning difficulties and physical disabilities hindering participation in physical activities were obtained via a questionnaire. Pubertal status was assessed by self-report of sexual maturation using a scale of pictures of breast development for girls and genital development for boys. Numbers were rated 1-5, according to criteria described by Tanner <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . Pubertal stage was dichotomized into later puberty (stage four and five in the scale) and pre-and early puberty (stages one, two and three).</p><p>From 2010 to 2013, all participants were physically examined and tested at least once a year. Height was measured to the nearest 0.5 centimeter (cm) with a portable stadiometer (Seca 214, Seca Corporation, Hanover, MD). Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg on an electronic scale (Tanita BWB-800S; Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with the participant wearing light clothes. Waist circumference (WC) was assessed with a measuring tape at umbilicus level to the nearest 0.5 cm. Two measurements were performed, and in cases where the difference between the first and the second measurement was greater than one cm, a third measurement was performed.</p><p>The average of the two nearest measurements was calculated and used for the analysis.</p><p>Physical activity was measured using Actigraph GT3X accelerometer (ActiGraph LLC, Pensacola, FL) four times in the current study (winter 2009/10; summer/fall 2010; summer/fall 2012; spring 2015) using 2 second epochs. GT3X+ accelerometers were also used in the last two measuring points. The accelerometers were delivered personally by the research staff, who explained to the children how to attach the device properly on the right side of the hip using an elastic belt. The device was only supposed to be removed while night sleeping and during activities involving water.</p><p>Periods with 30 or more minutes with consecutives zeros counts were considered as nonwear periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . A valid day was noted at a minimum of 10 hours of wear time <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</p><p>Children with four or more valid days in at least two measuring points were included in the analyses. It was not required that children presented valid weekend days to be included in the analyses. Evenson et. al's cut-points <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> were used to calculate the minutes spent in sedentary (SED: ≤100 counts per minute [cpm]), moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA: ≥2296 cpm) and vigorous physical activity (VPA: ≥4012 cpm) because of its valid estimation for the age range of the participants in the present study <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . Light physical activity was not used in the current study. More details regarding the analysis in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analyses and statistics</head><p>STATA version 14.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) was used for all analyses. For descriptive purposes, means and standard deviations are presented, and ANOVA was performed to test for differences between boys and girls and among grades.</p><p>The pathways examined in the analyses are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref>. Generalized Structured equation modeling (GSEM) was used to determine whether SED, MVPA or VPA were longitudinally associated with academic performance. In summary, the first model included MVPA and SED in the diagram to evaluate the association between SED, MVPA and academic performance, and the potential indirect association via WC.</p><p>In the second model MVPA was replaced with VPA, to evaluate the association between SED, VPA and academic performance, besides the potential indirect association via WC.</p><p>In addition to the co-variates presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref> (school type [control and intervention], age, sex, height, school class and mothers' education), pubertal status (later puberty and pre-and early puberty) all analyses were furthermore adjusted for season of accelerometry measurements (fall, winter, spring and summer), accelerometer wear time, learning difficulty of the participants (yes and no), physical disabilities (yes and no) and cluster structure (students nested in classes and classes nested in schools).</p><p>Note that all follow-up measures were included in one box for each respective variable in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref>, because it is difficult to show the complexity of all variables assessed at all time points within one figure, but information from each time point was used in the analyses. In all analyses performed, the term "direct association" refers to the association of physical activity (MVPA and VPA) and sedentary time with academic performance, the term "indirect association" refers to the association of physical activity with academic performance mediated via waist circumference, whereas the term "total association" refers to the sum of the direct and indirect association of physical activity, sedentary time with academic performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Older children had higher WC, were taller, heavier, and spent more time in sedentary activities, and less time in MVPA compared to younger children, both when analyzing boys and girls together or independently. However, there were no differences in academic performance or time spent in VPA across different grade levels. Boys spent more time in MVPA and VPA than girls, regardless of grade level. Girls presented higher scores in Danish than boys (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> VPA was related to a decrease in WC of 0.029 and 0.078 cm, respectively (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The current study investigated the three-year relationship between objectively measured MVPA and VPA and SED and academic performance in Danish children aged seven-to-twelve-years-old at enrollment of study. MVPA and VPA were indirectly associated with academic performance via WC. Moreover, SED time was directly and positively associated with academic performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Longitudinal association between MVPA, VPA and academic performance</head><p>In the current investigation, both physical activity and sedentary time were Previous investigations have reported diverging results regarding the relationship between physical activity and academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . The longitudinal study available with the largest sample size (n=4,755 children evaluated for five yearsfrom grades <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . The same study evaluated a possible dose-response in the physical activityacademic performance relationship. Booth, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> found that only children in the highest MVPA quintile presented higher academic performance compared to their lowest quintile peers, whereas no significant difference in academic performance was observed in children in other quintiles of MVPA time <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . The authors speculated that higher physical activity intensities were more closely related to improvements in academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indirect association via waist circumference</head><p>The results from this study showed that MVPA and VPA were indirectly associated with academic performance via WC mediation. The negative association between weight status and academic performance is relatively well-documented in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . One example is a randomized controlled trial study examining the effect and obesity individually or combined seems to affect cognitive function <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . However, the number of studies evaluating the possible synergic association between physical activity, weight status and academic performance was insufficient to draw firm conclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</p><p>Theoretically, weight status may be on the pathway between physical activity and cognition/academic performance, but further investigation is necessary to verify this.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other possible underlying mechanisms on the physical activity-academic performance relationship</head><p>It is not in the scope of the current investigation to analyze the mechanisms that might explain the relationship between physical activity and academic performance.</p><p>However, it is worth mentioning that physical activity might be related to academic performance via numerous pathways. A recent systematic review reported associations between physical activity level and 1) executive functions (i.e. inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility), 2) neurobiological measures (i.e. white matter structure, characteristics of the prefrontal cortex and medial frontal gyrus), 3) psychosocial measures (i.e. physical self-concept, family and friend support, social competence), 4) mental health outcomes (i.e. depression, quality of life, self-esteem), and 5) behavioral mechanisms (i.e. self-control, cognitive self-regulation, affective self-regulation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</p><p>Moreover, increased aerobic fitness in children has been found to be associated with decreased regional cortical thickness 30 , increased regional white matter integrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , increased hippocampus and striatal volumes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , and better academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . A relatively well-described association between physical activity and aerobic fitness can be found in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . Therefore, it is plausible that higher physical activity level not only relates to academic performance via WC, but also by affecting the aerobic fitness level 4 (although it was not tested in the current investigation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Longitudinal association between sedentary time and academic performance</head><p>The current investigation observed a positive association between SED time and academic performance, which has also been observed in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . It seems that objective measures of SED time present a positive association or no association with academic performance in children and adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , but specific SED activities (e.g.</p><p>watching TV, surfing on the internet) appear to be negatively associated with academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . For example, one study found that sedentary time measured by accelerometers exhibited positive association with academic performance, yet various components of sedentary time showed different individual relationships. Specifically, screen time was negatively associated with academic performance, and time spent studying and reading was positively associated with academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . SED time is a complex behavior to monitor, especially related to academic performance. A considerable amount of time the students are studying would represent SED activities (i.e. lessons, homework). Therefore, it is extremely challenging and important to be able to distinguish between SED activities related to schools, such as community band, as lessons and homework and SED activities related to leisure time, e.g., screen time (watching TV, computer and video games). Because of the aforementioned limitations, investigators from the largest study evaluating the relationship between physical activity and academic performance chose not to evaluate the association between SED time and academic performance, although the authors reported a decrease in the relationship coefficients between MVPA and academic performance when SED time was included as covariate <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . Unfortunately, the current study did not collect data on the SED time context. It is likely that the combination of direct measures of SED time with selfreported SED time context information is the most appropriate approach to evaluate the relationship between SED time and academic performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study strengths and limitations</head><p>The main strengths of the current investigation are the longitudinal design with several measuring points, relative large sample size, the comprehensive data collection that renders it possible for us to adjust for many known confounders, comprehensive assessments of Danish and Math subjects by use of standard national tests and objective measures of different physical activity intensities. Also, the use of statistical modelling capable of examining the potential indirect association of MVPA and VPA with academic performance via WC can be considered a strength. Nevertheless, there are limitations to be taken into account. The CHAMPS-study DK is an intervention that increased the amount of physical education classes in the intervention schools. However, the intervention had no effect on academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> and all analyses were adjusted for the intervention (intervention and control group). It was not possible to test the psychometric measures of the academic tests, and students were not tested in each academic subject every year. Thus, the amount of information could have been more</p><p>comprehensive, but the tests followed the national test system in Denmark. The current study did not collect information on the context in which the sedentary activity children were involved. Thus, it was not possible to properly evaluate the relationship between SED and academic performance. It is possible that an appropriate adjustment for sedentary time with and without relation to academics would weaken the observed positive relationship. In addition, while accelerometry is considered the gold standard measure for physical activity in epidemiological studies, between accelerometry and anthropometric measures, the accelerometers present the biggest measurement error which could have weakened the strength of relationships between physical activity and academic performance. Especially in Denmark accelerometry is problematic, because cycling is a major part of total PA that is not well captured by accelerometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . Finally, the results of the current study should be interpreted carefully and cautiously transferred to other cultures. Physical activity level differ across different countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> and these differences might influence the physical activity-academic performance relationship.</p><p>In conclusion, physical activity was associated with academic performance in children and adolescents. In addition, physical activity (MVPA or VPA) was only indirectly associated with academic performance via waist circumference. It seems that higher physical activity intensities have stronger longitudinal relationship with academic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . Although the strength of the positive longitudinal association between physical activity and academic performance was weak, the current study does support the growing body of evidence suggesting that greater amounts of time spend in physical activities do not decrease students' academic performance. Regarding the observed positive relationship between sedentary time and academic performance, it is recommended that future studies consider the context of sedentary activity (studyrelated vs. screen-time related).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>.

It is worth mentioning that the interpretation of the MVPA and VPA relationship with academic performance was independent of SED time. In addition, given the mutual adjustments performed in the MVPA and SED model, the interpretation of the MVPA association with academic performance should be considered in the light of substituting light physical activity minutes with MVPA minutes. Whereas, in the VPA and SED model, the interpretation of the VPA association with academic performance should be interpreted by substitution of light or moderate physical activity minutes with VPA minutes.</figDesc></figure>
