<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In a highly competitive market, customer satisfaction is always a question mark in minds of sellers to satisfy their buyers' needs. Customer satisfaction has become one of the most important issues in marketing because of its crucial role in sustaining customers and maximizing profit <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Khan, 2013)</ref>. Therefore businesses need to maintain a positive relationship with their customers and to plan a good customer relationship management that helps them satisfying their customers and create value for their business <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hassan, Nawaz, Lashari, &amp; Zafar, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kebede &amp; Tegegne, 2018)</ref>. A relationship marketing strategy is particularly important to service industries because of the intangible nature of services and high level of interaction with customers. A key feature of the strategy of relationship marketing is that not only does it lead to customer retention and increase the profitability of the company, but it also provides a sustainable competitive advantage for the service company <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hashem, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fotiadis &amp; Williams, 2018)</ref>. Given the open sky policy, the civil aviation market has become highly competitive, demanding professional excellence in the management and marketing of the airline services. Therefore, the formulation of a sound customer relationship practices have become a necessity in the airline industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kumudha &amp; Bhunia, 2016)</ref>. Air transportation is one of the most significant players in tourism development. In recent years, global aviation has effectively responded to demographic, legal-political, socio-economic and technological changes and changed the way they do business.</p><p>In this turbulent environment, a customer orientation has become a necessity <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Martín-Consuegra, Molina, &amp; Esteban, 2006)</ref>. Although a lot has been talked about 'customercentricity', this concept will remain new until it is implemented in each and every activity of the airline <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kumudha &amp; Bhunia, 2016)</ref> Relationship marketing tools are used in a different extent by airlines. These tools are the crucial solution to compete more successfully and learn about customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mohamud, 2019)</ref>. Relationship marketing is one aspect strengthening the business generic strategy to gain sustainable competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jamart &amp; Kupka, 2009)</ref>. Hence it is critically significant for business to retain customers and to keep them loyal, especially in a service industry such as airlines. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to create differentiation in this competitive airline service market. Information that is easy to obtain and use, a wide range of options, and the characteristics of intangible services have also changed the market. Price, advertising, and promotion strategies are widely used to attract customers and maintain relationships with them, even though they are very easy to imitate and replace <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Johan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chenini &amp; Touaiti, 2018)</ref>. Given the increase in the market size, as well as increasing competition, players in the industry should invest in improving the customer relationship. This would ensure customer satisfied and help in acquiring new customers, in addition to retaining the existing ones, and maintaining their loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahadmotlaghi &amp; Pawar, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kumudha &amp; Bhunia, 2016)</ref>. The relationship marketing adopted by airlines may provide different benefits and enhance customer trust in and commitment to airlines, and ultimately improve their loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chao, Chen, &amp; Yeh, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hassan et al., 2015)</ref>. Previous studies have acknowledged the role of customer relationship management on customer retention, airlines need to seek the satisfaction of their passengers and target their loyalty. This will help them increase their market share and improve their competitiveness. This study aims to explore and evaluate the relational marketing practices that affect customer loyalty in the Egyptian airline sector. Exploring and evaluating the relationship marketing practices is expected to help the airline management to frame marketing strategies to maintain customer loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kumudha &amp; Bhunia, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">LITERATURE REVIEW</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.1</head><p>Customer Relationship Management and Relationship Marketing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is defined as 'the implementation of the relationship marketing principles through managing customer data and use of technology' <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Domazet, Zubović, &amp; Jeločnik, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hoang, 2015)</ref>. Relationship marketing aims at building long-term relationships with customers, generating further business and ultimate profit. It is designed to contribute to strengthening brand awareness, and increase understanding of consumer needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Williams &amp; Chinn, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mensah &amp; Mensah, 2018)</ref>. Good relationship marketing creates trust about the institution in the customers' mind. The relationship marketing builds foster customer loyalty that will benefit both the customer and the service institution <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Domazet et al., 2010)</ref>. It identifies, establishes, maintains, and enhances relationships with customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hashem, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Yilmaz, 2018)</ref>. There are many reasons for adopting CRM where competition for customers is intense. From a purely economic point of view, firms learned that it is less costly to retain a customer than to find a new one. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hassan et al. (2015)</ref> it takes an average of 8 to 10 physical calls in person to sell a new customer in industrial sales, but it takes 2 to 3 calls to sell an existing customer. In addition, it is 5 to 10 times more expensive to acquire a new customer than obtain repeat business from an existing customer. In service sector, the leaders in the implementation of such business approach are the financial institutions (banks and insurance companies), the telecommunication sector, and the tourist and catering companies (hotels, tourist agencies, restaurants, etc.). According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Domazet et al. (2010)</ref> the process cycle of CRM is as follows: collecting data about consumers continuously, storing it in databases, profiling consumer segments based on data analysis, discovering causes of consumer satisfaction/dissatisfaction, identifying critical success factors, developing long-term relationships through continuous interaction with consumers and properly set communication channels, adjusting products to the needs of (individual) consumer, improving the satisfaction of internal and external consumers, and creating consumers' trust, loyalty and familiarity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">CRM Dimensions</head><p>Various studies have stated various dimensions of CRM. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sin, Tse, Yau, Lee, and Chow (2002)</ref> have divided CRM dimensions to six categories: shared values, communication, bonding, trust, reciprocity, and empathy. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jumaev and Hanaysha (2012)</ref> has proposed three dimensions of CRM: empathy, commitment, conflict handling that affect customer satisfaction, and trust. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hashem (2012)</ref> has suggested four dimensions of CRM: commitment, trust, bonding, and communication. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Khan (2013)</ref> has proposed eight key dimensions of CRM: bonding, emotions tangibility, empathy, reciprocity, trust, commitment, communication, and conflict handling. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jesri, Ahmadi, and Fatehipoor (2013)</ref> has divided CRM into: trust, commitment, communication, conflict handling, and competence. In the following sections, a definition for CRM dimensions is presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shared Values</head><p>Shared value has long been considered as an important component in building buyer-seller relationships in many studies (i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Evans &amp; Laskin, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Heffernan, O'Neill, Travaglione, &amp; Droulers, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Christou, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Payne, Ballantyne, &amp; Christopher, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sin et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wilson, 1995)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Taleghani, Gilaninia, and Mousavian (2011, p. 159)</ref> have defined shared values as "the extent to which partners have beliefs in common about what behaviours, goals and policies are important, unimportant, appropriate or inappropriate, and right or wrong". <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Moore (2014)</ref> has defined the concept of shared value as corporate practices that enhance the competitiveness of a company and advance social conditions in the communities in which it operates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jumaev and Hanaysha (2012)</ref> argued that customer value is a superordinate goal and customer loyalty is a subordinate goal. According to goal and action identity theories, a superordinate goal is likely to regulate subordinate goal. Thus, customer value regulates customer loyalty toward the service provider. The concept is now embraced by many of the world's leading corporations such as Nestle, Intel, Unilever, Coca-Cola and Western Union, and the framework and language of shared value has spread quickly beyond the private sector to governments, NGOs, civil society and academia <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Moore, 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bonding and Trust</head><p>Both seller and buyer must link together in order to have a long term association with one another. Bonding is one dimension of a business relationship between parties acting in a unified manner toward a desired goal. Various bonds exist between parties and indicate different levels of relationships. Bonding controls social and business behaviour in society, and may remove doubt, forms close relationships, and build trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hashem, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gilboa et al., 2019)</ref>. Trust is the faith which exists between parties. In reality is the bond that keeps in touch two parties for the longer time <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jesri et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Khan, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mårtensson &amp; Neij, 2013)</ref>. Trust indicates that each person of relationship, to what extent can considered other person promise and is defined as the willingness to trust and reliance to audience <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jesri et al., 2013)</ref>. Trust is an important construct in relational exchange because relationships characterized by trust are so highly valued. Trust has been posited as a major determinant of relationship commitment. Creating trust in customer mind sets its commitment. In order to increase the levels of trust, companies must focus on keeping promises to their customers and consistently carry their best interest at heart <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jumaev &amp; Hanaysha, 2012)</ref>. Trust is considered a key determinant of loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Mårtensson &amp; Neij, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Flavián, Guinalíu, and Gurrea (2006)</ref> explain trust as a set of beliefs, which is based on an individual's own perception about attribute. It can be divided between honesty and good will.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tangibility</head><p>Tangibility play very important role in the relationship marketing and even some time emotions used for keeping promises. Each and every relationship needs physical aspects to build it stronger. The physical facilities, equipment, and appearance of personnel play a vital role in the making the relationship marketing <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Khan, 2013)</ref>. Tangibility relates to the physical aspects of a service. Physical aspects include appearance of equipment, physical facilities, materials associated with the service, appearance of personnel and communication materials, convenience of physical facilities and layouts. In addition to the appearance of the facilities, it also takes into account the convenience offered the customer by the layout of physical facilities. The higher customers appreciate the physical aspects, the higher the overall evaluation of service quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Auka, Bosire, &amp; Matern, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Commitment</head><p>Commitment is another important determinant of marketing relationship strength and useful construct for measuring customer loyalty likelihood and predicting future purchase frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lyons &amp; Branston, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hashem, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gilboa et al., 2019)</ref>. It explains the extent that person intends to keep a valuable relationship, and it is similar to trust in studying customers' loyalty. In marketing literature, commitment is a strong, stable and continuous tendency in order to keep and preserve a valuable relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Emami, Lajevardi, &amp; Fakharmanesh, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Khan, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nella &amp; Christou, 2014)</ref>. Marketing scholars have documented that relationships can be built upon multiple forms of commitment. Social bonding can be a contributing factor of a potential emersion of trust and commitment, although the impact of social bonding might differ depending on the customer segment commitment is a desire to maintain a valued relationship, and can be based on many facets <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Mårtensson &amp; Neij, 2013)</ref>. Commitment in marketing refers to an orientation that specific intentions and behaviours characterize with the purpose of realizing value for both parties over the long term <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Taleghani et al., 2011)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dealing with conflicts</head><p>It is important to resolve conflicts for good business relationship. Customers switch to competitor brands because a certain conflict arises and was not solved effectively. For solving such conflicts it is important to have a strong relationship between sellers and buyers. The Stronger the relationship, the easier the conflict can be resolved <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Khan, 2013)</ref>. Conflict handling is defined as cooperative supplier try to minimizing negative results from significant potential involvement. Avoiding conflicts, trying to solve problems before they occur, and the ability to solve problems in suitable time are aspects to handle such conflicts effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jesri et al., 2013)</ref>. In interpersonal communication, conflict occurs when an individual perceives incompatibility between his or her personal goals, needs, or desires and those of the other party. Conflict handling requires cooperative behaviour from exchange partners, in a negotiation setting, cooperative versus competitive intentions have been found to be linked to satisfactory problem solution. A good conflict resolution will result in relationship quality positively. Conflict handling is an important relationship builder. However, it is difficult to service industries to achieve zero service failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jumaev &amp; Hanaysha, 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Customer satisfaction and loyalty</head><p>Measuring customer satisfaction is a good way to know if customers received the service with their expectations. It is an important factor in building customer relationship. Customer satisfaction is often a comparison of experiences with prior expectations. In order to bring success and profit for a business, it is necessary to satisfy customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gretzel et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hoang, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chatzigeorgiou &amp; Christou, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mombeuil, Fotiadis, &amp; Wang, 2019)</ref>. Customer satisfaction is significantly taken into account as assurance for customer retention. It is one of the top management main concerns in businesses. Satisfaction has been thoroughly studied for consumer services. Relationship satisfaction is the customer's positive feeling that comes from the customer's evaluation to the buyer-seller relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Halimi, Chavosh, &amp; Choshalyc, 2011)</ref>. Customer satisfaction is completely dependent of the customer expectation and how the customer's actual perception of the product's performance matches the expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Rizan, Warokka &amp; Listyawati, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Nella &amp; Christou, 2016)</ref>. It is a frequent predictor of customer loyalty (El-Adly, 2019). The value of customer loyalty is that it undoubtedly impacts the company's continual existence and future progress. Customer loyalty can be illustrated as the customer's commitment to a company, or the customer's desire to keep an enduring relationship with the vendor. The most important goal of customer relationship marketing is to obtain and keep customers. Based on previous studies, all marketing activities intend to create customer loyalty. Customer loyalty is an intention to keep a valued relationship. Managers and marketers should highly pay attention to customer loyalty as an important factor that has to be developed to develop company's profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Halimi et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pirnar et al., 2019)</ref>. Relationship marketing is considered as the road that leads to achieve and create loyalty, because loyalty cannot be achieved unless there are good relations with customers. Since relationship marketing is an activity of important marketing activities that cannot be disregarded, since each institution needs to build a solid base of loyal customers. In order that companies can achieve their objectives, and to be a leader in providing the best service among all competitors; they should identify their customers first, to be able to build long -term relationships with these customers and to have closer bonds with them in a way that creates state of pleasure and confidence and security with this customer. In other words when a customer is confident with the services provided by the staff and committed in dealing with them, they become satisfied loyal to the institution and its staff and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Christou, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Christou, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Christou, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Nsour, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sezgen et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">CRM and airline industry</head><p>Many airline managers think of passenger needs from their own perspective. However, customer demands and expectations are changing in today's world. Therefore, airlines have to think in CRM as a long term investment, with the true benefits earned through profitable lifelong customer relationships. CRM comprises the acquisition and deployment of knowledge about customers to enable the airline to sell more of their services more efficiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahadmotlaghi &amp; Pawar, 2012)</ref>. Furthermore, CRM is an essential component of the corporate strategy of airlines to differentiate themselves from competitors. CRM is a strategy for airlines to individualize their service, create better communicational channels with customers and ensure satisfaction of customers as a base of loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Christou et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahadmotlaghi &amp; Pawar, 2012)</ref>. If the airline has chosen the right CRM and marketing strategy, it can immediately increase the effectiveness of its services. The effectiveness of the strategy adopted supports the organization's capability to win customers from competitors which is the base for business continuation. Other benefits of CRM to airlines include ability to target profitable customers, addressing individualized marketing messages, and customized products and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Amoako, Arthur, Christiana, &amp; Katah, 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Research Framework</head><p>Loyalty is a deeply held commitment to specific behaviour (i.e. re-buy or re-patronize) towards a preferred product or service. One of the basic assumptions in relationship marketing is that long-term loyal customers are profitable. Customer relationship profitability is achieved through a chain that starts with perceived value that creates customer satisfaction that, in turn, strengthens the relationships so that it lasts longer and thus becomes more profitable <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jesri et al., 2013)</ref>. This study integrates the dimensions of CRM to measure its effect on customer loyalty. This integration provides a better understanding to the predictors of customer loyalty in service industry. Therefore, this study adopts six dimensions of CRM, these are shared values, bonding, trust, tangibility, commitment, and dealing with conflicts. It tests the causal relationships between these dimensions and customer satisfaction and loyalty. The developed research framework (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) indicates seven hypotheses to measure this effect in airline companies. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHODOLOGY</head><p>This study adopts the quantitative approach to test the research hypotheses. The questionnaire is the data collection method. It is developed from literature studies to measure the causal relationships developed in the research framework. The form includes two parts. The first aims to describe the personal information of the passengers including their gender, age, qualification, number of flights in the last 12 months, and purpose of travel. The second part includes ten latent variables. The latent variables represent the eight constructs included in the research framework (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Shared values are measured by 3 items, bonding (3 items), trust (3 items), tangibility (4 items), commitment (3 items), dealing with conflicts (3 items), satisfaction (3 items), and loyalty (4 items). The items appearing in Table (2) under each construct was developed based on literature review, reviewed and piloted on 40 passengers to check its face and construct validity. Preliminary statistics showed good corrected itemtotal correlation among items of each construct in addition to acceptable internal consistency. After piloting the questionnaire, forms were randomly distributed to EgyptAir passengers during the months of February-April, 2017. EgyptAir is the national flag carrier of Egypt and one of the society's major pillars that contributes largely of Egypt's social and economic development. EgyptAir was established in 1932 as a pioneer air carrier in Middle East and Africa. In the recent years, EgyptAir has faced drastic challenges due to the critical period that the region has been through and had its negative impact on tourism in general and consequently on air traffic. 7.4 million passengers have flown on EgyptAir in 2013-2014 but the company aims to increase the number to 12 million passengers by 2020. The corporate strategy of the company aims to enhance its image to be the customer first choice in Egypt, and internationally to increase its market share (EgyptAir 2017) 215 questionnaires valid for analysis were returned. Data were coded and entered in SPSS and analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM). SEM is advanced multivariate technique that is used to measure complicated models with latent constructs and multi causal relationships among constructs. WarpPls version (5) was used in analysis. It is a variance-based technique that uses Partial Least Squares as analysis procedures. Measurement model was generated to measure the indictor loadings, the average variance extracted (AVEs) by each construct, Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability. The measurement model aims to check construct validity (convergent and discriminant validity) and reliability (internal consistency and composite reliability). Afterwards the structural model was generated to measure the causal (cause-effect) relationships between CRM dimensions, passenger satisfaction and loyalty.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Measurement model</head><p>The measurement model looks at the relationships between indicators and latent variables. The model fit indices for the measurement model reveals a good model fit. Indices include average path coefficient (APC)=0.259, P&lt;0.001, average Rsquared (ARS)=0.678, P&lt;0.001, average adjusted R-squared (AARS)=0.674, P&lt;0.001, average block VIF (AVIF)=2.363, average full collinearity VIF (AFVIF)=2.939, Tenenhaus GoF (GoF)=0.692, Sympson's paradox ratio (SPR)=1.000, Rsquared contribution ratio (RSCR)=1.000, Statistical suppression ratio (SSR)=1.000, and nonlinear bivariate causality direction ratio (NLBCDR)=1.000. Looking at Table 2, it is revealed that average variance extracted (AVEs) for the measurement model constructs are greater than 0.50 which reflects the convergent validity of the measurement model constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>. The square root of AVEs is higher than correlations among measurement model which means that discriminant existed <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kock, 2015)</ref>. Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability exceed 0.70 for all constructs reflecting the reliability of measurement model constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hair, Black, Babin, &amp; Anderson, 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Structural Model</head><p>The structural model tests the causal relationships between the research model's constructs. According to Figure ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), seven hypotheses were tested. It is revealed that there is a significant effect between 6 out of 8 dimensions of CRM and customer satisfaction: Shared values have a positive significant effect on satisfaction (β=0.15, P&lt;0.05, and the first Hypothesis (H1) is supported), Bonding is significantly affecting satisfaction (β=0.15, P&lt;0.05, and H2 is supported), and the same are Trust (β=0.12, P&lt;0.05, and H3 is supported), Tangibility (β=0.13, P&lt;0.05, and H4 is supported), Commitment (β=0.38, P&lt;0.01, and H5 is supported), and Dealing with conflicts (β=0.12, P&lt;0.05, and H6 is supported). The dimensions of CRM explain 73% of the variance in customer satisfaction (R square =0.73). Furthermore, customer satisfaction has a positive significant impact on customer loyalty (β=0.79, P&lt;0.01, and H7 is supported). Customer satisfaction explains 62% of the variance in customer loyalty (R square = 0.62). Relationship marketing aims to improve the satisfaction and loyalty of customers in order to build long term relationships. This concept depends on a number of procedures that help keep customers satisfied. These procedures were translated in this study in a number of constructs through which it can be revealed that EgyptAir (the national airline company of Egypt) adopts such procedures or not and how effective is this adoption on passenger satisfaction and loyalty. The first dimension of CRM is shared values (the first hypothesis measuring the effect of shared values on passenger's satisfaction). Shared values refer to the beliefs of passengers towards the services provided by EgyptAir and how appropriate they are. The structural model revealed a significant relationship between shared values and passenger satisfaction. Passengers perceive the services provided by EgyptAir to worth the value paid. EgyptAir involves customers in their customer-related decisions and offer incentives to buy the company services. These practices are certainly affecting passenger satisfaction and transfer them to be loyal passengers through time. This finding is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Heffernan et al. (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Taleghani et al. (2011)</ref> who highlighted the role of shared values in building long term buyer-seller relationships. In addition to shared values, bonding was found significantly contributing to passenger satisfaction (the second hypothesis of the study testing the relationship between bonding and passenger's satisfaction). Bonding represents the link between EgyptAir and their customers. This includes the procedures employed by the company to strengthen relationships with passengers, and how accurate does EgyptAir implement prior promises to passengers. Linking with customers and implementing promised services lead customers to feel that they belong to the company. This positive feeling is definitely a predictor to passenger satisfaction. This finding is concurrent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Khan (2013)</ref> who cited that linking with customers in order to build long term relationship is an important component of CRM.</p><p>Having shared values with passengers and linking to customers could have a positive impact on passenger satisfaction unless trust is not missing. Trust (the third hypothesis of the study testing the effect of trust on passenger's satisfaction) is the main concern that keeps customers linked, engaged and loyal to a business. Passengers' trust in the promises of the service provider, the confidentiality and privacy of personal information, and the trusted information provided by the company could build strong longer relationships between business and customers. This study revealed a positive impact of trust on EgyptAir passenger satisfaction. This finding is similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Rizan et al. (2014)</ref> who believes that customers feel satisfied with a business if they have an honest investment and engagement with the service provider. Tangibility (the fourth hypothesis of the study investigating the impact of tangibility on passenger's satisfaction) is considered the core of service quality leading to customer satisfaction. It focuses on the tangible services provided by the airline. Respondents of this study positively perceive the inflight service and its good appeal, courteous employees, attractive tickets, and comfortable and appealing aircraft design. Hence it is logic that tangibility affecting the satisfaction of passengers. This finding is similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jesri et al. (2013)</ref> who stated that tangibility is an important dimension of CRM that affects passenger satisfaction. As for the effect of commitment on passenger's satisfaction (the fifth hypothesis of the present study), commitment is perquisite of building trust. The greater the business is committed to its goal and mission, the greater the customers are satisfied and loyal. The respondents of passengers in this study think that EgyptAir is committed to a high quality level of service; it fulfils their commitments towards customers, and is committed to maintain a standard level of quality. The commitment of EgyptAir leads to its customer satisfaction as a result. This finding is definitely true according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Taleghani et al. (2011)</ref> who claimed that commitment is a crucial determinant for measuring the likelihood of customer loyalty and predicting future purchase frequency. Dealing with conflicts is another vital determinant of passenger satisfaction (the sixth hypothesis of the current study). The capability of airline to seriously dealing with any issues relating to customer complaints is a success key. Dealing with conflicts completes the cycle of bonding, trust, and commitment of the company. Handling complaints and having declared procedures to deal with it, and offering instant solutions are key factors affecting the passenger satisfaction. According to passengers involved in this study, they have a positive impression about seriousness of EgyptAir in handling complaints according to declared regulations in a timely manner. Therefore, it is revealed that dealing with conflicts ability of EgyptAir has positively affected their passenger satisfaction. This finding is again similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jesri et al. (2013)</ref> who showed the role of dealing of conflicts and its contribution to customer satisfaction. While customers are satisfied about the services of airline, they become loyal through time (the seventh hypothesis of the study testing the influence of passenger's satisfaction on their loyalty). This study confirms the results of a previous study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jesri et al. (2013)</ref> who claimed that customer relationship is achieved through a chain that starts with perceived value that creates customer satisfaction and, in turn, strengthens the relationships so that it lasts longer and thus customers become loyal. This study revealed a positive effect of customer satisfaction where passengers could continue buying EgyptAir services; share the positive things about EgyptAir, and recommend others to use EgyptAir services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS</head><p>Airlines are among businesses caring strongly about their passenger satisfaction and loyalty. EgyptAir, the national airline company of Egypt, has been investigated through its passenger in the current study to perceive the effect of its relational marketing procedures on passenger satisfaction and loyalty. Using structural equation modelling to analyse 215 responses from EgyptAir passengers, it is revealed that relational marketing dimensions are positively affecting passenger satisfaction. However, these dimensions have small effect size on passenger satisfaction. Mean values of relational marketing dimensions refer to neutral opinions of passengers on airline shared values practices, bonding, dealing with conflicts, and satisfaction of passengers. It is worth to pay attention to such practices to enhance the passenger satisfaction and loyalty to the airline. Having shared values with customers, implementing what the company promises and its commitment to a high level of service quality, in addition to trust building between the company and its passengers, appealing tangible services provided by the company and instant dealing with customer conflicts and complaints according to the declared regulations could strongly have a positive impact on the perception of passengers to the services provided by the company and forming a positive attitude toward the airline. EgyptAir has courteous employees, attractive aircrafts, and builds long term relationships with customers. These customer-centred practices have significantly affecting the satisfaction of the customers and succeeded to convert them to loyal marketers speaking positively about the company and recommend its services to others. Generally service providers in tourism and hospitality sectors have to keep a strong relationship with customers where the word of mouth and reviews of customers have a crucial impact on other customers who consider seriously the comments and opinions of those tried the service and make a decision accordingly. In addition the competition among airlines has become fierce, and online travel portals help passengers to search, compare, and buy airline services globally which should be taken considerably by airlines to retain their passengers and increase their customer-base.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Implications</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contribution to Knowledge</head><p>This study contributes to theory adopting and incorporating constructs from previous studies in a rigorous model to investigate the effect of customer relationship marketing dimensions on customer satisfaction and loyalty. It evaluates the perceptions of EgyptAir passengers towards its provided services, practices relating to customers, its commitment to promised and declared itineraries. The study adds to the extant knowledge in airline sector and provides a research model that can be used to investigate the activities of customer relationship marketing in the sector. Academics and researchers are invited to adopt the developed model, develop it further and test it in different contexts. Testing the causal relationships between constructs of the model could help increase the understanding of the factors affecting passengers of airlines and their loyalty to specific ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial implications</head><p>This present study contributes to practice by revealing a number of results relating to the relationships of the airline with their customers. Although having positive and significant findings in this study and having a clear effect of relational marketing activities on customer satisfaction, the regression loadings and mean values of opinions refer to the need to better improvement of such practices. it is revealed in this study that commitment of the company to what it promises have the greatest effect on its passenger satisfaction, and this is followed by shared values, bonding and tangibility. Constructs of bonding, tangibility, trust, and dealing with conflicts need to have a stronger effect on customer satisfaction. EgyptAir and airlines need to:</p><p>• Build stronger relationships with customers and improve communication procedures with them and engage them more in their decisions. This will help customers understand the areas of defect and the procedures airlines could take to improve their services and respond to passengers' feedback. Finally this communication increases passengers' satisfaction and loyalty. • Improve marketing efforts as marketers of airline services could use the findings of this study to increase the customer satisfaction through building a trust between airlines and their passengers reflecting the importance of their feedback and how airlines try to improve their services in order to satisfy their customers and have loyal passengers. • Introduce the dimensions that influence passenger satisfaction in their loyalty programmes in order to have loyal customers and positive word of mouth about the flights, its services, facilities and complaints' handling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Limitations and further research</head><p>One limitation of this study is it investigates the opinions of passengers on different routes, short and long haul flights.</p><p>Long haul flights and short flights should be investigated separately and a comparison of findings should be introduced. A comparison between EgyptAir and other airline companies should be conducted. Furthermore, the majority of the sample units were males. Additionally, the sample size could be increased for better generalization concerns. Further research should focus on these limitation and academics are invited to test and develop the research model in other tourism sectors.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
