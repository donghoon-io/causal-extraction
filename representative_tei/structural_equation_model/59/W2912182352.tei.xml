However, studies in general have examined only a small number of experiential dimensions, typically focusing on experiential attributes that occur during the festival, with minimal study of pre-or postfestival experiences and as such limits the analysis of such diverse attributes within an event experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Son &amp; Lee, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Tkaczynski &amp; Stokes, 2005</ref>; J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Wong et al., 2015)</ref>. Moreover, studies have revealed significant relationships between sociodemographic characteristics and the importance of festival attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Formica &amp; Uysal, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Yolal, Çetinel, &amp; Uysal, 2009)</ref>. At the same time, other studies have focused specifically on the relationship between the importance of attributes to satisfaction or consumer behavior, though typically based on a single festival case study <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Crompton &amp; Love, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Smith &amp; Costello, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Tkaczynski &amp; Stokes, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Yoon, Lee, &amp; Lee, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Yuan &amp; Jang, 2008)</ref>. In contrast, to gain a better understanding of the festival-goer, this research focuses more generally on exploring who the festival-goer is and what is important to him/her in determining their overall experience, and not limiting the research to one case study festival. However, it is first necessary to introduce the dimensions of the festival experience as a basis for proposing hypotheses to be explored in the research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Music &amp; Entertainment</head><p>Previous studies that have explored the dimensions of the festival experience typically refer to the festival-specific theme or genre, or the characteristics by which the festival is identified. Generally, such studies have found that festival-unique features are most strongly related to satisfaction and behavioral intent <ref type="bibr">(Papadimitroui, 2013)</ref>. Moreover, numerous but also enormously diverse in scope, scale, and type and, hence, audience. It is surprising, therefore, that few if any specific attempts have been made to explore critically the festivalgoer; that is, who they are and what experiences they seek.</p><p>This article, therefore, sets out to propose a model that depicts the relationship between the festival-goers and their experience. More specifically, it seeks to examine the extent to which the festival-goers' sociodemographic characteristics determine the importance of specific attributes in the UK music festival experience, thereby identifying particular aspects of the festival experience upon which festival organizers might directly focus their management efforts. To achieve this, this research examines UK festival-goers in general. That is, it does not focus on a specific type of music festival, genre, size, or location, because although these festival attributes may influence the sociodemographic make-up of the festival audience, popular music festivals in the UK offer a wide range of genres and subgenres, and festival-goers generally attend multiple festivals.</p><p>Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) is used to identify factors of the festival experience, and linear regression reveals the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics of festival-goers and the resulting experience constructs against the overall evaluated experience. In so doing, this article not only addresses a notable gap in the literature by evaluating the importance of specific experience attributes in the context of popular UK music festivals, but also has practical implications for festival organizers wishing to better direct their management and marketing efforts more strategically towards the elements of the festival experience that are most important to their targeted audience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Review and Hypothesis Development</head><p>As the research surrounding consumer experiences has developed over recent years, it has become increasingly clear that not all elements of the consumer experience can be controlled by providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Verhoef et al., 2009)</ref>. Therefore, it has become recognized that it is necessary to focus on understanding the variety of factors that influence the consumer's experience. Putting it another way, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Backman, Uysal, and Sunshine (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Formica and Uysal (1998)</ref> also found relationships between festival motivations and age, income, and marital status. Therefore, as another significant element of the festival experience, the significance of entertainment leads to the development of the second hypothesis:</p><p>H2: The importance of entertainment has a positive relationship to the overall experience.</p><p>Although music and entertainment are a core part of the festival experience, the festival cannot be staged without the support of additional services. Thus, the support services provided at festivals are another element of the festival experience deserving examination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Service</head><p>Early research proposed that the quality of service determined consumer satisfaction and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cole &amp; Illum, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Cronin, Brady, &amp; Hult, 2000</ref>; J-S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lee, Lee, &amp; Yoon, 2009)</ref>. In fact, satisfaction was often considered to be commensurate with perceived quality, satisfaction being regarded as the (desired) result of service delivery (D. A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Baker &amp; Crompton, 2000)</ref>. However, as service quality research began to be applied within an events context, it became clear that service was but one of multiple determinants of satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brown, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Crompton &amp; Love, 1995)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Pine and Gilmore (1999)</ref> were among the first to argue that services, as an externally managed dimension, may influence a customer's experience but that personal and memorable experience is a response or outcome to the service delivered <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cole &amp; Chancellor, 2009)</ref>. Therefore, services may or may not influence consumers' feelings and senses, or their thinking, actions and relationships, which are dimensions of experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Schmitt, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Within the context of festivals, services have been identified as a determinant of festival quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Wan &amp; Chan, 2013)</ref> and value <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Yoon et al., 2010)</ref>. Typically, festival service attributes include friendliness and professionalism of staff, information, signage, food, facilities, and comfort amenities <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cole &amp; Chancellor, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Crompton &amp; Love, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Tanford &amp; Jung, 2017)</ref>. In some studies, food the unique features of core activities at a festival have also been found to be strong motivational factors, which are known to have the strongest or most significant relationship with satisfaction and, in some cases, future behavior (see, e.g., T. H. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lee &amp; Hsu, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Savinovic, Kim, &amp; Long, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Schofield &amp; Thompson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Smith, Costello, &amp; Muenchen, 2010)</ref>. Examining music festivals more specifically, some have found that the importance of music varied between different clusters of festival attendees, dependent on their motivations for attendance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bowen &amp; Daniels, 2005)</ref>. Conversely, others have found that music quality strongly influences satisfaction and future behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Thrane, 2002)</ref> and that music performance produces more value than other aspects of the festival <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Andersson, Armbrecht, &amp; Lundberg, 2012)</ref>. Thus, music as the core feature at popular music festivals is a key factor to be considered when evaluating the overall festival experience and, subsequently, leads to the development of the first hypothesis: H1: The importance of music attributes has a positive relationship to the overall experience.</p><p>As music festivals often provide a multitude of activities in addition to music, these other forms of entertainment are identified as a significant element of the festival experience. This includes the quality and variety of other things to do and activities beyond music. D. A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Baker and Crompton (2000)</ref> found that both generic and specific entertainment features of a festival have a greater potential to increase satisfaction and are more likely to motivate attendees to return. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cole and Chancellor (2009)</ref> similarly found entertainment features to have a stronger impact on visitors' experience whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Wan and Chan (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Wu and Ai (2016)</ref> determined it to be a key component of and positively influence festival quality. Similar findings were confirmed by D. A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Baker and Crompton (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen, Lee, and Lin (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Cole and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Illum (2006), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Yoon et al. (2010)</ref>. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Uysal, Gahan, and Martin (1993)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Yolal et al. (2009)</ref> identified a significant relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and the importance of festival attributes. They found that as age and education level increased, so did the importance of event novelty among festival-goers. Backman, BROWN AND SHARPLEY is assessed as a separate construct; however, this is usually in the context of a food festival where food is evidently core to the experience. In contrast, however, the support services provided at festivals are regarded by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Crompton (2003)</ref> to be "maintenance" attributes. He suggested that these maintenance attributes, such as the physical environment, information services, and comfort amenities, are perceived to meet a minimum threshold level of quality before festival-goers can be satisfied through motivator attributes or further sociopsychological benefits from an event. Therefore, although services may not be identified as an important determinant of satisfaction, if deficient they may undermine the whole festival experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Crompton, 2003)</ref>. Hence, the importance of services to the festivalgoer is another factor that should be considered in relation to the overall festival experience. Based on the empirical findings discussed in literature, the third hypothesis in this study is:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3:</head><p>The importance of service attributes has a positive relationship to the overall experience.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Crompton (2003)</ref>, the sociopsychological benefits that provide greater meaning and value to the festival-goer's experience include involvement, which can be achieved through engaging with and participating in the festival. Engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Poulsson and Kale (2004)</ref> argued that successful experiences are those that engage the consumer and have personal relevance, offering novelty and surprise. More specifically, and in contrast to a focus on satisfaction as a key driver of financial performance and consumer behavior, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Fleming and Asplund (2007)</ref> proposed engagement as an emotional construct reflecting human behavior. Their concept of "human sigma" proposed that engagement creates a longer lasting, more meaningful, deeper connection between organizations and consumers, increasing the probability of preferred consumer behavior. This has been confirmed in further studies such those by Y. H. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kim, Duncan, and Chung (2015)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kumar et al. (2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Ralston, Ellis, Compton, and Lee (2007)</ref>, and I. A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Wong and Tang (2016)</ref>. Although the human sigma concept has not been applied to a festival or event context, empirical research suggests that engagement and participation at festivals positively influences the value and meaning of the festival-goer experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bennett, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Berridge, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hudson, Roth, Madden, &amp; Hudson, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Mannell, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Shamir &amp; Ruskin, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Sundbo &amp; Darmer, 2008)</ref>, the perceived quality of a festival, satisfaction, and consumer behavior (Y. H. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kim et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Lei &amp; Zhao, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Packer &amp; Ballantyne, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Pitts &amp; Spencer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">J. Wong et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Wu &amp; Ai, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Wu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Wu &amp; Ko, 2013)</ref>. As communication and interaction between the festival-goer and the festival influences emotional attachment and engagement, this is a vital component of the festival experience. Thus, festival organizers should arguably consider how best to engage their consumers to provide valued, deeper and more meaningful festival experiences that satisfy and delight. However, engaging with the festival as a dimension of the festival experience may or may not be of intrinsic value or importance to the festival-goer. Thus, the review of the literature surrounding engagement informs the development of the following, fourth hypothesis: H4: The importance of engagement has a positive relationship to the overall experience.</p><p>Whereas engagement with the festival may influence festival-goers' overall experience, there are other additional attributes that may add value but that do not fall into the core festival activities, entertainment, or services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Added Value</head><p>Value may be added to the festival experience through the availability of souvenirs <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Yoon et al., 2010)</ref>, VIP packages and upgrades, good weather <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Leenders, 2010)</ref>, and other personalized aspects. Souvenirs in particular are identified as a key element of the festivalscape (Y. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Lee, Lee, Lee, &amp; Babin, 2008)</ref> and, as such, have been examined as an element of the festival environment and a key dimension of the festival experience. Specifically, research has found that souvenirs have an indirect effect on satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Özdemir &amp; Çulha, 2009)</ref>, a significant effect on value (J-S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lee et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Yoon et al., 2010)</ref> UNDERSTANDING FESTIVAL-GOERS 703 through satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Choo, Ahn, &amp; Petrick, 2016)</ref>. Souvenirs are also regarded as contributing to the personalization of experiences and added value <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Prahalad, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The experience at music festivals may also be personalized through active participation and the access and availability of personalized accommodation options, VIP access, and other upgrades. However, there is little research regarding these additional elements of the festival experience. Although these attributes add value to the experience, their importance to the festival-goer has not been established. Yet, there has been some research to demonstrate that sociodemographic characteristics, such as age, have been significant in relation to tourist wants and needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Collins &amp; Tisdell, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Gibson &amp; Yiannakis, 2002)</ref>. Therefore, based on previous research regarding the relationship between attributes that add value and the overall experience, the discussion leads to the development of the fifth hypothesis: H5: The importance of added value has a positive relationship to the overall experience.</p><p>Nevertheless, festival activities, services, and added value are not the only aspects of the festival experience. The image and branding of a festival is also found to be a component of the festival experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Image and Branding</head><p>Image is referred to by <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Wu and Ai (2016)</ref> as the overall impression of an organization that is "left in the customers mind as a result of accumulative feelings, ideas, attitudes and experiences with the organisation" (p. 362). The overall perception of an organization generates meaning for the consumer and may induce an emotional response as memories associated with the organization are recalled <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bravo, Montaner, &amp; Pina, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Dowling, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Hatch &amp; Schultz, 2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Wu and Li (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Nguyen and Leblanc (2001)</ref> found that the overall image on an organization may be determined by the consumer's evaluation of the quality of their experience. Thus, research has found that image consequently impacts on satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Andreassen &amp; Lindestad, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Aziz, Ariffin, Omar, &amp; Siow, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Ramseook-Munhurrun, Seebaluck, &amp; Naidoo, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">J. Wong et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Wu, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Wu, , 2014))</ref>, on consumer behavior, and on behavioral intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Huang, Li, &amp; Cai, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">J. Wong et al., 2015)</ref>. Thus, the image and branding of a festival generates consumer expectations, from which the congruity between consumer expectations and perceptions contributes to the overall festival experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chon, Christianson, &amp; Lee, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">J. Lee &amp; Beeler, 2006)</ref>. However, whereas the influence of image and branding on the consumer experience is evident, it remains unclear whether it is an important attribute of the experience for festival-goers, let alone whether there is any relationship between festival-goers' sociodemographic characteristics and festival image. Nevertheless, tourism research has revealed some significance between age and destination image <ref type="bibr">(Beerli &amp; Martin, 2004</ref>; S. S. <ref type="bibr">Kim &amp; Morrison, 2005)</ref>. Hence, this leads to the development of a sixth hypothesis: H6: The importance of image and branding has a positive relationship to the overall experience.</p><p>In considering the image and branding of a festival, the literature has also highlighted the ethical aspects of the music festival as an area in which festival-goers may or may not acknowledge and influence their experience and/or consumer behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics</head><p>There is an increasing awareness of the ethical and environmental issues surrounding festivals <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Getz, 1997)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Mair and Laing (2012)</ref>, for example, reported that consumer demand is be one of the main reasons that festival organizers pursue environmentally sustainable practices at music festivals, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Sharpe's (2008)</ref> research found environmental responsibility to be an important dimension of music festivals. Other studies have identified a positive relationship between environmentally sustainable practices and decision-making processes (e.g., do Paço &amp; Raposo, 2009; Y. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kim &amp; Han, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Song, Lee, Kang, &amp; Boo, 2012)</ref>. The role of corporate sponsorship at festivals has also been discussed in relation to festival experiences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Johansson and Toraldo (2017)</ref>, for example, referred to sponsorship as a countercultural and inauthentic element <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">IP: 157.228.206.154 On: Fri,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_3">25 Oct 2019 07:58:28</ref> Delivered by Ingenta Article(s) and/or figure(s) cannot be used for resale.

Satisfaction is therefore an important representation of a consumer's experience. Research has similarly shown that the perceived quality of a product or service has a positive relationship to both satisfaction and consumer behavior. In the context of festivals, numerous studies exploring the festival experience confirm a positive relationship between festival quality, satisfaction, and consumer behavior (D.</p><p>A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Baker &amp; Crompton, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cole &amp; Chancellor, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cole &amp; Illum, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">J.

Hence, this research focuses on exploring the relationship between the importance of festival specific attributes to the overall festival experience. In doing so, it analyzes the influence of festival-goers' sociodemographic characteristics to determine any significant relationships and to better understand festival-goers' wants and needs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposed Model</head><p>In event research, experience is becoming a popular field of academic exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Geus et al., 2016)</ref>, as it is increasingly recognized to be a critical component in future consumer behavior. For festivals in particular, experience is a primary determinant of repeat attendance (D.

However, they did not specifically examine the impact of sponsorship on the consumer experience. In addition, although the role of sponsorship is subject to debate in terms of an "authentic" festival experience, the concept of authenticity itself has been found to influence festival-goers' experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Anderton, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Matheson, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Raybould, Digance, &amp; McCullough, 1999)</ref> as they desire an experience that "entails the feeling of a 'must see' or 'once-in-a-lifetime' experience" <ref type="bibr">(Getz &amp; Cheyne, 2002, p. 142</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Getz, 2008)</ref>. What is regarded as "authentic" and how important this is within the festival experience, however, may only be perceived by the festival-goer.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Characteristics</head><p>Data were collected through a self-administered, online survey. This data collection method was employed owing to the practical limitations associated with administering a paper or electronic survey in person at a music festival. Similarly, this enabled a wider and broader scope of festivalgoers to be included in the study, as opposed to limiting to particular festivals. Specifically, an online survey avoids issues associated with security, privacy, and storage of data among potentially intoxicated festival-goers and adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, it may avoid any bias associated with the high-spirited nature of music festivals, allowing sufficient time for attendees to reflect upon their experience. While many authors discussed the importance of collecting data during the lived experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jackson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">O'Neill, Getz &amp; Carlsen, 1999)</ref>, according to consumer behavior research, purchase decisions are often based on the recalled, evaluated experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Gardial, Clemons, Woodruff, Schumann, &amp; Burns, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Larsen, 2007)</ref>. Therefore, the online survey was timed to be live from September to October 2014 (i.e., at the end of the typical UK music festival season). This was to allow for a suitable period of time to have passed following festival attendance so that festival-goers will have been able to reflect and evaluate their experience with minimal emotional bias (or "postfestival blues"), yet without forgetting too much of their experience. However, the survey incorporated attributes of pre-, peri-, and postfestival experience.</p><p>The first page of the online survey detailed the aims and guidelines of the research and declared how the data would be used and stored. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Rubin (2000)</ref> discussed the issues of privacy in utilizing online surveys; however, participants were not required to leave any information that would directly identify them and, as such, anonymity and confidentiality were assured.</p><p>The online survey was disseminated using a cluster, snowball sampling technique via social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and festival-specific online forums and discussion boards such as the "Download Fan Forum" and the "E-Festivals" websites. As a result, a total 792 responses were received with 586 completed surveys. experience is vital if festival organizers are to strategically manage and improve their festivals. Just as many have found that the perceived quality and satisfaction of individual attributes contribute to the overall visitor experience, so too has research revealed that the importance and value of attributes to festival-goers also plays a significant role in the overall experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Getz, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Gummerus, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Moufakkir &amp; Pernecky, 2014)</ref>.

However, their importance to the festival-goer has received only limited academic attention.

The importance of specific attributes of the festival experience may therefore play a significant role in the overall experience.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref> presents the test model for this study.

The seven sociodemographic constructs included: age, gender, marital status, where the festival-goer grew up, level of education, approximate annual income, and employment status. The festival experience constructs were measured using a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (not important) to 5 (extremely important) and were divided into six sections. The first section addressed the prefestival experience (11 attributes); during the festival (36 attributes) was subdivided into festival product, service, enhancers, and emotions; and, finally, the postfestival experience (3 attributes). Overall experience questions were also on a 5-point Likert-scale; however, 1 was anchored at low quality or very dissatisfied with 5 at high quality or very satisfied. Both basic and advanced statistical tests were conducted including descriptive statistics (means, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and linear analysis structural equation modeling (SEM) for hypothesis testing. Validity and reliability were examined using chi-square, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO)-Bartlett test, varimax rotation loadings, and Cronbach's alpha. The findings were significant at the 0.05 level of confidence.</p></div>

Focusing on the important components of the research, absolute values of less than 0.400 were suppressed for higher coefficients. The correlation matrix revealed numbers larger than 0.400 over almost all statements; only three items were eliminated due to low factor loading (&lt;0.400). The KMO of sampling adequacy was 0.893, which is higher than the minimum 0.6 required for further analysis, whereas statistical significance also existed (0.000), suggesting conversion validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988)</ref>.</p><p>Concerning the validity of variables, Cronbach's alpha values (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>) indicated satisfactory levels of internal consistency, revealing overall reliability as 0.928 and all variables were over 7 (minimum value 7; <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Nunnally, 1978)</ref>. Chi-square was used for model fit, which showed χ 2 = 14965.75. To establish validity in the variables, exploratory factor analysis was also performed with varimax rotation, of which most of the loadings were relatively high.</p><p>Eight components emerged from the factor analysis, which were subsequently labeled according to the characteristics associated with the attributes. These were comprised as: overall experience, music, other entertainment, services, engagement, added value, ethics, and festival image. The examination of the components revealed that the total R 2 = 0.388. This score reveals the importance of this research (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref>).</p><p>Regression analysis was statistically significant in accordance to ANOVA, producing the following results: music (sig. &lt; 0.01), other entertainment (sig. &lt; 0.01), services (sig. &gt; 0.05), engagement (sig. &gt; 0.05), added value (sig. &lt; 0.01), ethics (sig. &gt; 0.05), festival image (sig. &gt; 0.05), which reveals the importance of festival attributes to the overall experience. The standardized coefficients indicate that the primary factor influencing overall experience is other entertainment, followed by added value and music.

As a result, only three of the seven hypotheses presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref> are confirmed. relation to sociodemographics, most of the statistical significances were associated with age, followed by gender, with where the festival-goer grew up and employment status with the least statistical significances.   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis Testing</head><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref>, only three of the seven hypotheses have been confirmed. These include the relationship between other entertainment, added value, and music to the overall experience. More specifically, the importance of other entertainment UNDERSTANDING FESTIVAL-GOERS 713 heightened importance of music may have a stronger influence on the overall experience than other festival experience attributes. Specifically, the results show that the more important the music is to the festival-goer, the lower the overall experience is rated. These results were consistent across all festival-goers, regardless of the different sociodemographic characteristics. This finding confirms the studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Andersson et al. (2012)</ref>, Papadimitroui (2013), and <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Thrane (2002)</ref> that music has a strong influence on the festival-goer's experience at music festivals and is of high importance and value.</p><p>Confirming studies from J-S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lee et al.

(2010)</ref>, the importance of added value attributes has also been revealed to have a similar, direct relationship with the overall experience. The research shows that the more important added value is to the festival-goer, the lower the experience is rated. That is, the importance of experiential attributes that add value, such as souvenirs, VIP upgrades, and personalized experiences, is found to negatively influence the overall festival experience. This is similarly consistent among all festival-goers.</p><p>This research demonstrates that festival-goers who assign higher value and importance to the music-related or added value attributes of the festival do not rate their overall experience as highly as others. This suggests that they are either much more critical and harder to please than other festival-goers, or perhaps their expectations in these areas are higher. Either way, if festival organizers wish to improve the overall experience for these festival-goers, they need to focus and invest their management efforts into the core, musicrelated aspects and added value elements of the festival.</p><p>Another finding from the research demonstrates that the importance of entertainment has a direct relationship to the overall experience. This finding confirms studies from D. A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Baker and Crompton (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cole and Chancellor (2009)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Wu and Ai (2016)</ref> in that entertainment positively influences festival-goers' perceptions of their experience. Specifically, entertainment is pivotal in influencing attendees' experiences, inducing responses of laughter and joy <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Pine &amp; Gilmore, 1999)</ref>, providing fun, enjoyment, and enriching experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cole &amp; Chancellor, 2009)</ref>. This suggests that either festival-goers who place higher importance on entertainment are more easily pleased, or that their expectations are being met (or exceeded). In turn, this suggests that if festival organizers wish to improve the overall experience, they must find other ways to do so for those who do not place high importance on entertainment attributes of the music festival.</p><p>Although other factors (services, ethics, engagement, festival image) of the festival experience are still valued by festival-goers, these were not found to have a direct influence on the overall experience, suggesting festival organizers should focus on music, added value, and entertainment aspects of the festival.</p><p>Examining the relationship between sociodemographic and attributes of the festival experience also revealed some significant findings. For gender, the research revealed that, generally, festival experience attributes are more important to females than males, supporting previous related studies on gender differences in tourism such as K. L. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Baker and Draper (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Patino, Kaltcheva, Pitta, Sriram, and Windsor (2014)</ref>. In examining the relationship with age, most attributes of the festival experience are more important to younger festival-goers, except for festival ethics, which is typically more important to older festival-goers. This contrasts previous research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Uysal et al. (1993)</ref> but supports studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Gibson and Yiannakis (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Sikula and Costa (1994)</ref>. Single festival-goers valued music, other entertainment, and added value more than those in a relationship, supporting <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Backman et al.'s (1995)</ref> research. However, the festival image and ethics were least important to single festival-goers. No previous significant research has analyzed the relationship between marital status and image or ethics at a festival; therefore, this fills a gap in the literature. Similarly, there has been no empirical research into the relationship between where festival-goers have grown up and the importance of experience attributes. However, this research reveals that festival-goers who grew up in the south of England or abroad rate ethics to be more important than those living in the north of the country. Those who grew up in the north of England and internationally rate "added value" to be more important, whereas this BROWN AND SHARPLEY is least important for those in the south of England. In examining the relationship between education and experience attributes, the results show that as the level of education increases, the importance of attributes decreases. In contradiction to K. L. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Baker and Draper's (2013)</ref> study, as approximate annual income rises, the importance of experiential attributes decreases. Finally, unemployed festival-goers rated added value attributes to be more important than employed festival-goers, perhaps due to the value of their investment in attending a music festival. No previous research has examined the relationship between employment status and the importance of experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall Festival Experience Through the Importance of Festival Attributes</head><p>The research findings also demonstrate the hierarchy of festival attributes in influencing overall festival experience. The most important variable is other entertainment, followed by added value and music. The importance of the findings is also revealed by the direct influence of those factors (other entertainment, added value, and music) on the overall festival experience. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref> displays the influence of the importance of other entertainment, added value, and music to the overall festival experience. The findings confirm that the more important other entertainment is to the festivalgoer, the higher rated the overall festival experience is. This correlates with other studies such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al. (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cole and Chancellor (2009)</ref>, and Tkaczynski and Stokes (2010) among others. Conversely, the more important music and added value is to the festival-goer, the lower rated the overall festival experience is. The findings suggest that as the importance of music and added value factors increase, the overall experience decreases. This may be explained by the value of these attributes to individual festival-goers, in that as the importance increases it has a more significant effect on the festival-goer and, therefore, they may be more at risk of being disappointed if their expectations are not met (J-S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lee, Lee, &amp; Choi, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Smith &amp; Costello, 2009)</ref>. Other factors of service, ethics, image, and engagement do not impact on the overall experience; however, that is not to say that they should be disregarded. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cole and Chancellor (2009)</ref> determined in their research, services and amenities are provided for visitors, but may not be as enjoyable and engaging as other elements of the festival experience. Therefore, they may not have as much impact on the overall experience. The sociodemographic characteristics of festivalgoers, such as gender, age, marital status, where the festival-goer grew up, level of education, approximate annual income, and employment status can all influence the importance of factors of the festival experience; however, the overall rationale remains the same. Therefore, the visual representation in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref> offers significant value for festival organizers to better understand the contribution of the examined factors to the overall festival experience.</p><p>This study provides both theoretical and practical contributions. From a theoretical perspective, it confirms previous research regarding the importance of core festival activities such as music and entertainment, as well as revealing the importance of added value to the overall festival experience. It also determines the relationship between the importance of festival attributes and the overall festival experience. More specifically, it focuses on providing conceptual evidence through the examination of a model depicting the importance of festival attributes to the festival-goer in determining their overall experience. Moreover, it fills a gap in the literature by examining the influence of the importance of festival attributes (including pre-, peri-, and postfestival) to determining overall experience, while also revealing the impact of sociodemographic characteristics to the importance UNDERSTANDING FESTIVAL-GOERS 715 and design of festivals to maximize success and deliver optimal experiences for festival-goers.</p><p>The main significance of this study to festival organizers is that it enables them to predict the value of the overall festival experience based on the importance of festival attributes to their targeted or typical festival-goer. Furthermore, festival organizers can focus on the design and management of specific areas of the festival to deliver better experiences for their festival-goers, ultimately to maximize their success financially and experientially for the festival-goer. In so doing, they can strategically improve their festivals, attracting increased attendance and repeat visitation to more demanding festival-goers and improve profit margins. In addition, the festival industry can better understand the needs and desires of their festival-goers and how this may impact on the overall festival experience.</p><p>Despite these outcomes, the limitations of the study need to be highlighted. In particular, online surveys lack personalization and are limited to the standardized format of collecting surface opinions and, hence, are unable to clarify or delve deeper into responses. Therefore, qualitative research may provide further understanding of festival-goers' preferences. Using an online method also limits the sample to the internet population, which may inadvertently bias the research due to the demographic and psychographic characteristics of the online population, although it can be argued that most of the UK population has internet access. Similarly, the researcher's background and sharing of the survey on their own social media platforms within their social circle has also had an influence on the geographic makeup of the sample. It could also be surmised that the researcher's social network may share interests and sociodemographic characteristics that may also contribute to the resulting sample. However, the validity and reliability of the research has been confirmed through KMO, Cronbach's alpha, and chi-square.</p><p>The findings also point to the need for further research to determine other factors that may influence the overall festival experience. Potential further research could focus on the impact of festival-goers' psychographic characteristics such as motivations, frequency of attendance, and preferred music genre. Distinct types of festivals may attract different types of festival-goers who may of festival attributes. On a practical level, the research provides information to festival organizers that may influence the strategic management and design of the festival. Based on the findings, festival organizers may direct their efforts more efficiently towards the specific areas of the festival experience that are regarded as most important to their targeted or typical festival-goer while also acknowledging the impact of these factors to the overall festival experience. Festival organizers may also promote and advertise festivals more efficiently, attract specific market segments, and better understand their festival-goers needs and desires.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Research</head><p>This research has contributed to knowledge and filled a gap in the understanding of festival-goers and the experiences they seek by examining sociodemographic characteristics of festival-goers and exploring the influence on the importance of festival experience attributes (including pre-, peri-and postfestival) to the overall festival experience at UK music festivals. More specifically, it reveals that the importance of music, entertainment, and added value are crucial in determining the overall festival experience. Regardless of the festival-goers' sociodemographic characteristics, these factors remain a consistent influence on the overall festival experience. The importance of other entertainment has the most influence on the overall festival experience, followed by added value and music. However, although the importance of other entertainment has a positive influence on the overall experience, the importance of music and added value negatively influences the overall experience. Whereas other attributes (services, ethics, engagement, and festival image) of the festival experience are important to the festival-goer, these do not appear to have a significant relationship to the overall festival experience. That is not to say that these elements do not play a role in the overall experience, as they are still regarded important to the festival-goer and should be managed appropriately. Therefore, in exploring the festival-goer's experience, it can be understood that attributes of the festival are valued individually and/or collectively value particular attributes of the festival. The model proposed may also be utilized for further examination of different festivals or events, which will strengthen the theoretical and practical importance of the model. This could contribute towards the development and improvement of the model while also enabling the comparison of findings and perspectives.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Introduction</head><label></label><figDesc>Festivals in general have long been considered in the academic literature (see, e.g., Crompton IP: 157.228.206.154 On: Fri, 25 Oct 2019 07:58:28 Delivered by Ingenta Article(s) and/or figure(s) cannot be used for resale.
