<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To explore the law of megaproject social responsibility behavior (MSRB) among internal organizations under institutional pressure, this paper presents a theoretical and empirical study to investigate how institutional pressure affects MSRB through the mediating role of organizational social responsibility cognition and the mediating roles of the communication mechanism and relationship strength based on new institutional sociology. Based on a total of 147 responses from a broad questionnaire survey, structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to test the proposed hypotheses. The research results show that institutional pressure has a promoting effect on MSRB, and organizational social responsibility cognition mediates the relationship between institutional pressure and MSRB. Additionally, the communication mechanism and relationship strength have no effect on the relationship between institutional pressures and MSRB. The research results provide a new theoretical foundation for the analysis of MSRB and practical suggestions for policymakers on the governance of MSRB.</p></div>

Global infrastructure construction is ushering in a new round of development opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Pernille &amp; Karyne, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Zeng et al., 2018)</ref>. The annual global investment in megaprojects around the world is around US$6-9 trillion, accounting for 8% of global GDP <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Flyvbjerg, 2014)</ref>. According to McKinsey &amp; Company, the investment in infrastructure projects will increase to US$57 trillion globally by 2030 <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Zeng et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Megaprojects refer to large public projects that involve multiple stakeholders, play a major role in the economic development <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andrić et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Zhang et al., 2021)</ref>, and have a profound impact on society <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kim, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Yang et al., 2018)</ref>. Megaprojects are mainly classified into infrastructure projects and urban group projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Giezen et al., 2013)</ref>. The rapid pace of urbanization has created a huge demand for megaprojects in developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Yun et al., 2020)</ref>. As a country that has implemented numerous megaprojects and increasingly pays attention to sustainable development of megaprojects, China has made impressive achievements in the field of megaproject construction in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Zhai et al., 2017)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Yun et al. (2020)</ref>, megaproject is defined as a large-scale public project with a total investment higher than the 0.01 percent of GDP, a complex technology system, a strategic significance, andas well a s a profound social influence. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wan et al. (2020)</ref>, megaproject refers to a large-scale and multibillion-dollar infrastructure project commissioned by a government. In China, megaprojects are usually proposed or led by the government and refer to projects with a large scale, long implementation periods, and complex stakeholders, which are of strategic importance to the development of society and the country. In recent years, China has successfully implemented numerous megaprojects <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Zhai et al., 2017)</ref>, such as the Three Gorges Project, the South-to-North Water Transfer, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, achieving several "wonders of the world" one after another.</p><p>As megaprojects have a tremendous impact on society, the economy, and environment <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Zeng et al., 2018)</ref>, their sustainable development has attracted great attention from various sources (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">He et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wang et al., 2020a)</ref>. Megaproject social responsibility (MSR) refers to the responsibility that megaprojects' stakeholders need to fulfill so as to transparently and ethically conduct their decisions and activities through the whole project life-cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Zeng et al., 2015)</ref>. Social responsibility is important for achieving the sustainability of megaprojects <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Zeng et al., 2015)</ref>, improving the social benefits of megaprojects <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Flyvbjerg, 2014)</ref>, and promoting social and economic development <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carole et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Zhao et al., 2015)</ref>. In addition, MSR is undoubtedly one of the important value elements for evaluating the success of engineering projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Turner &amp; Zolin, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The implementation of MSR is closely related to the behavior of various stakeholders, and the successful implementation of MSR requires close cooperation between all parties over the whole project life-cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lin et al., 2017)</ref>. The stakeholders are the participating entities in the implementation of organizational social responsibility, and their decisions and activities have an important impact on the implementation of MSR. For example, the green construction behavior of construction companies can help reach organizational environmental responsibility objectives. It is thus important for project teams to manage stakeholders in megaprojects <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Yang et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>However, at present, there is a lack of effective measures for the management of stakeholders' social responsibilities in megaprojects, resulting in such frequent problems as engineering accidents and casualties caused by builders' production safety negligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ma et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Xue et al., 2015)</ref>, NGO protests, employee strikes, social conflicts, and even project termination caused by a weak awareness of community responsibility of the management party <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lee et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Institutional pressures formed by laws, regulations, and contracts can promote stakeholders' performance of MSR. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Makino (2002)</ref> believes that institutional environment forms a kind of pressure on the survival of enterprises, and that institutional pressure, to some extent, will restrain enterprises' social responsibility behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Feng, 2018)</ref>. Institutional pressure refers to the forces of rules, norms, social concepts, or cultures that make the form, structure, or behavior of enterprises tend to be reasonable, easily recognized, and supported <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Wang et al., 2008)</ref>. Institutional pressure includes regulatory pressure, normative pressure, and cultural cognitive pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Scott, 2010)</ref>. At present, given that most stakeholders in China have not paid enough attention to MSR, it is normally the quickest and most effective way for the government to improve this through laws and regulations, construction standards, or bidding documents and contracts.</p><p>At present, most studies examine the effect of institutional pressure on the implementation of social responsibility in a single corporate. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Li's et al. (2019a)</ref> regression analysis shows that institutional pressure is a driving factor on corporate social responsibility, and <ref type="bibr">Xie et al. (2017b)</ref> found that a good institutional environment can strengthen corporate social responsibility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Yu (2014)</ref> also opined that institutional pressure, as the external environment, plays a significant role in promoting corporate social responsibility based on new institutional theory.</p><p>However, megaprojects, as temporary organizations, consist of several companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Xie et al., 2018)</ref>, which form a network of close contacts. Institutional pressure is regarded as an important external influencing factor for megaproject social responsibility behavior (MSRB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Wang et al., 2018)</ref>. MSRB refers to the actions taken by stakeholders to deal with social responsibility issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Xie et al., 2019)</ref>. Existing research reveals that institutional pressure affects the performance of social responsibility by influencing the characteristics of management <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Feng &amp; Rong, 2016)</ref>, and institutional pressure can also affect the implementation of social responsibility by increasing managers' attention to social responsibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Yu &amp; Liu, 2015)</ref>. However, it is unclear how institutional pressures spread across various organizations in a megaproject and affect MSRB as a whole. Therefore, this article answers the question of how institutional pressure affects MSRB, focusing on the MSRB of internal organizations under institutional pressure.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">MSR and MSRB</head><p>MSR involves economic, legal, environmental, political, and ethical responsibility. Economic responsibility means that megaprojects should provide valuable facilities and services to society <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Korytárová &amp; Hromádka, 2014)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Velásquez (2012)</ref> point out, legal responsibility means that construction projects must meet the requirements of laws and regulations, which is also the most basic social responsibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Zeng et al., 2015)</ref>. Environmental responsibility means that construction activities should not be at the expense of ecological stability. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lichtenstein et al. (2013)</ref> emphasized the importance of environmental protection in construction. Ethical responsibility mainly includes occupational health and safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Velásquez, 2012)</ref>, taking care of special employees (such as migrant workers and disabled people), and other responsibilities related to employees. As megaprojects usually involve government departments, political responsibility aims to provide public services and, more importantly, promote social stability and fairness <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Orji &amp; Awortu, 2015)</ref>. Megaprojects can increase employment, improve the physical and mental health of community residents, and increase the public's happiness so as to promote social stability and progress, especially in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Zeng et al., 2015)</ref>. Moreover, major infrastructure projects play an important role in eradicating local poverty and in solving immigration problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fincher, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the Social Action Theory of Talcott Parsons, the present study defines MSRB as the behavior that multiple heterogeneous actors in megaprojects choose to adopt to fulfill their social responsibility in the context of complex influencing factors, and the process of their interactions through the whole project life-cycle. As MSR is jointly completed by the organizations that formally participate in project construction, the MSRB is essentially the social responsibility behavior of those participating organizations. According to Social Action Theory, social action is an activity carried out by actors using specific means to achieve their goals, which is subject to the conditions surrounding the action, the values of actors, social norms, etc. Behavior has multiple dimensions, including behavioral performance and behavioral strategies. Behavioral performance focuses on what the organization does, while behavioral strategies pay more attention to how the organization does it. The present study focuses on "the performance of MSRB".</p><p>Over the last decade, an increasing number of construction firms from China have entered the international market <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pheng &amp; Hongbin, 2003)</ref>. In particular, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has galvanized the international market <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Zhou et al., 2017)</ref> and accelerated the Chinese construction enterprises to participating in the construction of megaprojects globally, such as the A2 highway in Poland. This increasing internationalization requires megaproject participants to pay more attention to their MSR performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Xie et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Different from corporate social responsibility behavior, the heterogeneity, interactivity, and complexity of participants make the influencing factors of MSRB much more complicated. These can be roughly divided into internal influencing factors and external influencing factors. The internal influencing factors include the characteristics of participants, such as their internationalization level <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ma et al., 2016)</ref>, industry status <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cambra-Fierro et al., 2013)</ref>, leadership <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2017b)</ref>, and CEO narcissism <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lin et al., 2018)</ref>. The project culture can also affect the implementation of social responsibility. External influencing factors include external stakeholder pressure, external appeal, and institutional environment. The external stakeholders represented by non-governmental organizations are increasingly concerned about (and demanding) the social responsibility of projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Winch &amp; Bonke, 2002)</ref>. Improper social responsibility behavior has a negative impact on the project <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brockman, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Xie et al. (2019)</ref> found that external appeal has a positive impact on hypocritical MSRB. The external institutional environment in which a project is located also affects social responsibility behavior. A good institutional environment can promote the adoption of social responsibility <ref type="bibr">(Xie et al., 2017a)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast with traditional construction projects, megaprojects are more closely associated with socioeco-nomic systems. Thus, their impact surpasses the project level to a higher and wider organization field <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Li et al., 2019b)</ref>. The course of megaprojects' decision making, planning, management, and coordination reflects the interaction between multiple actors with different conflicts of interests and are influenced by politics, the economy, and institutions. Megaprojects are not isolated islands: their huge social impact makes the decision making and implementation of a megaproject happen under an open social environment, making a megaproject a complex organizational field <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Li et al., 2019b)</ref>. Therefore, research into MSRB should take full account of its organizational field background. As new institutional sociology emphasizes the analysis of participants' behavior in the context of an organizational field <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hoffman, 1999)</ref>, it is appropriate to apply new institutional sociology to study MSRB.</p><p>Institutional theory is widely recognized as a powerful theoretical framework and has been widely applied to explore a range of research topics, such as the internationalization progress of higher education <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alsharari, 2019)</ref>, changes in management accounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burns &amp; Scapens, 2000)</ref>, and inter-organizational relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Rozenfeld &amp; Scapens, 2021)</ref>. According to new institutionalism theory, institutional pressure -composed of regularization, normativeness, and culture-cognition -affects organizational behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Scott, 2010)</ref>. Institutional pressure includes not only laws and regulations, but also stakeholder pressure and project cultural pressure. While new institutionalism theory considers the external environment of megaproject participants, it ignores the characteristics of megaproject participants. Many studies point out that the organization's reflection and judgment on institutional pressure depends on the characteristics of the organization itself and its social responsibility cognition. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Liu and Wang (2016)</ref> found that actors choose the most suitable CSR behavioral measure for themselves according to their own position in the environment and their understanding of the environment. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Powell and DiMaggio (1991)</ref> believe that the impact of institutional pressure on actors is influenced by the media of communication and proliferation: the transmission of institutional information affects the understanding, interpretation, and acceptance of the receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Scott, 2010)</ref>. Through the above analysis, it is easy to see that the impact of institutional pressure on MSRB is restricted by the participants' own social responsibility cognition and communication mechanism (CM). Therefore, the present study focuses on how institutional pressure affects MSRB, with the role of social responsibility cognition and CMs taken into consideration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Effects of institutional pressure on MSRB</head><p>Institutional pressure (IP) is an important external influence factor affecting MSRB <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Wang et al., 2018)</ref>. Institutional pressure, also named "the institutional environment", refers to social concepts, rules, norms, or cultures that promote the formation, structure, and behavior of a company to be reasonable, acceptable, and supported <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Shen, 2010)</ref>. Institutional pressure drives megaproject construction enterprises (stakeholders) to take more responsibility and pay more attention to the impact of their decisions or activities on society.</p><p>According to new institutionalist theory, institutional pressure includes the three basic elements of regularization, normativeness, and culture-cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Scott, 2010)</ref>, and good institutional pressure can promote social responsibility. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows some specific examples that form institutional pressures. Of these, regularization usually refers to the adoption of such mandatory means as laws, regulations, rules, and systems to achieve particular purposes, and the regulatory pressures in the engineering field mainly include government regulations, legal systems, government supervision, industry norms, and engineering-related legal provisions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hart and Saunders (1998)</ref> have shown that mandatory pressure can significantly promote corporate social responsibility behavior. If enterprises violate the system norms, they may lose some of their legitimacy, reduce their reputation in the industry, and even threaten their own economic benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mezias, 1990)</ref>. Legitimacy refers to the extent to which organizational behavior is accepted by stakeholders based on current social norms and values <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Suchman, 1995)</ref>. Normative pressure mainly refers to the external environment restricting organizational behavior through values and norms, but it can also refer to the expectation of organizational behavior in the organization's environment (thinking or hoping that the organization does something specific in some way) that creates behavioral pressure on the organization. Largely due to ethical and moral attributes and altruism in social responsibility, in addition to government and public policies, the external public and media can play an effective role in promoting the company without the company's voluntary participation and preventing the disguised behavior of enterprises <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Wang et al., 2018)</ref>. Culture cognitive pressure mainly refers to the cultural influence of the external environment on corporate cognition, so that enterprises can adopt similar behaviors independently, mainly referring to the behavior of enterprises imitating organizations that are recognized by themselves. For instance, when leading enterprises in the industry have good social responsibility performance, other enterprises will be forced to imitate their behavior due to competitive pressures. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Liu and Wang (2016)</ref> also found similarities in social responsibility between companies with relatively close links; their behaviors were in line with the behavior of core companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chen et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Wang et al. (2018)</ref> found that, compared with regulatory pressure and normative pressure, the impact of imitation pressure on the megaproject organizational behavior is more significant. Based on the above analysis, we propose the following hypotheses: Although institutional pressure can have an impact on MSRB, it is important to note that institutional elements, whether they are regulation, norms, or culture-cognition, need to be transmitted and diffused. The information "deliverer", and the way of transmission, will affect the recipient's understanding, interpretation, and acceptance of it. In other words, the action mechanism of institutional pressure on the actor will be affected by the media of transmission and diffusion.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H 1 :</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Institutional pressure affects MSRB through social responsibility cognition</head><p>Organizational social responsibility cognition mediates the effect of institutional pressure on social responsibility behavior. The institution acts on the actor of social responsibility behavior and influences the participants to adopt social responsibility. However, the behavioral actor's own social responsibility cognition is different, which leads to a difference in the adoption of social responsibility behavior. Some studies point out that the characteristics of enterprises affect the social responsibility of enterprises, and the organization's reflection and judgment on institutional pressure depends on the characteristics of the organization itself and its social responsibility cognition. For example, industry leaders are often more active in fulfilling social responsibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cambra-Fierro et al., 2013)</ref>, and a high level of internationalization normally means having a good CSR performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Orji &amp; Awortu, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Othman &amp; Abdellatif, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Stone, 2008)</ref>. "Cognition" is usually a unique attribute at the individual level that reflects the decision maker's perception of social responsibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lin et al., 2018)</ref>. Similarly, if we treat the organization as a complete individual (e.g., a construction unit), the social performance behavior of each "individual" in megaprojects is influenced positively by its social responsibility cognition.</p><p>The participants have particular perception and ability to understand -existing in the environment and being subject to the environment -and they can also under- The atmosphere of fulfilling social responsibility in construction industry stand and choose according to their own situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Giddens, 1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Giddens, , 1986))</ref>. Social responsibility behavior, as well as social responsibility cognition, is influenced by three institutional pressures of regulation, normativeness, and culture-cognition. For example, institutional pressures influence the firm's strategic cognition, thus affecting ambidextrous innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Song &amp; Zhao, 2021)</ref>. The institutional pressure largely impacts on its own social responsibility cognition.</p><p>Organizations involved in megaprojects face two levels of social responsibility: the project and the organization itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lin et al., 2018)</ref>. The social responsibility of the organization itself is different from the social responsibility of the project itself, and the focus of the present study is the social responsibility behavior adopted by the organization in the project dimension. A project is a temporary organization that allocates inputs of MSRB into the project according to the characteristics of the project and its own ability. The organization is permanent, and the corresponding organizational social responsibility is part of the organizational culture and strategy. It is relatively stable and represents the level of organizational social responsibility cognition. Therefore, this study regards the performance of organizational social responsibility as the level of organizational social responsibility cognition. Organizations that attach more importance to social responsibility are more sensitive to the requirements of social responsibility in the surrounding pressure. It is easier for organizations to receive the requirements of institutional pressure in the project, and the organizations are more likely to do this for their own social responsibility behavior to improve their own social responsibility cognition. Consequently, we propose: H 2 : Organizational social responsibility cognition (SRC) mediates the relationship between institutional pressure and MSRB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Effects of the communication relationship and relationship strength on MSRB</head><p>The CM can affect the effect of institutional pressure on behavior. A megaproject is a temporary organization field <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Xie et al., 2018)</ref>, and the institutional environment is an important behavior code of the organization. The disseminator and mode of information can affect the understanding, interpretation, and acceptance of the recipient <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Scott, 2010)</ref>. The impact of institutional pressure on actors is influenced by the media of communication and proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Powell &amp; DiMaggio, 1991)</ref>. In megaprojects, the temporary project team relies on effective communication to quickly and clearly understand each other's views and intentions, clarifying rights, responsibilities, and interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Powell &amp; DiMaggio, 1991)</ref>, and promoting a consensus and collaboration to complete tasks. Communication is a two-way process that requires information sharing and exchange of thoughts and feelings (DeSanctis &amp; Monge, 2010): it is important for the spread of institutional pressure in the project and the interaction of agents' behaviors.</p><p>The process and results of agent communication affect the relationship between institutional pressure and MSRB. Smooth information sharing and communication between participants enables the government's will, community, and public expectations, and the behavioral orientation of other organizations in the same industry to be delivered quickly and accurately -improving the transmission effect of social responsibility concepts and behaviors. Consequently, the CM is necessary when communicating and spreading social responsibility between organizational networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chen et al., 2018)</ref>. Therefore, we propose: H 3 : CM positively moderates the relationship between IP and MSRB.</p><p>The communication methods between major project organizations include formal CMs and social networks among stakeholders. Through such formal CMs as joint offices, conferences, and information platforms, project teams can collect, analyze, and communicate information in a timely manner; quickly understand the status of the project; and make appropriate and timely decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Wu et al., 2017)</ref>. The timeliness, accuracy, completeness, and adequacy of information exchange are recognized standards to measure communication quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cigrang et al., 2014)</ref>, and are used to measure the level of CM in the present study.</p><p>The frequency and intensity of communication between organizations affects the effect of institutional pressure on social responsibility behavior. In contrast with corporate social responsibility, engineering social responsibility cannot be realized by only one enterprise or organization. In the megaproject of multi-agent close interaction and interdependence, the influence of enterprise behavior and various factors on the enterprise is regulated by the engineering network. CM reflects the communication mode between organizations under the formal organizational structure, while the social network represents the actual behavior patterns and work practices between organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Powell &amp; DiMaggio, 1991)</ref>. The megaproject stakeholder network reflects the interaction patterns between internal and external stakeholders, provides tools for IP diffusion, offers a path for the dissemination of MSR, and promotes the similarity of socially responsible behavior among enterprises <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Liu &amp; Wang, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>When the frequency of exchanges between organizations increases, institutional pressure will spread more rapidly in the organization, thus promoting its effect. In this research, the frequency of interactions and degree of influence is measured by inter-organizational relationship strength (RS). Therefore, we propose:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">H 4 :</formula></div>

Of the world's 30 most impressive megaprojects, more than a quarter are in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Li, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Yun et al., 2020)</ref>. Qianhai is the core area of Shenzhen, one of the four first-tier cities in China, covering an area of 14.92 km 2 with a scale of 2600-3000 m 2 and a planned employment population of 650,000. It holds an important position connecting Shenzhen and Hong Kong, and is also an important place connecting Chinese mainland with the world. The planned investment in the Shenzhen-Qianhai district construction project is over CNY 1 billion (approximately USD 156 million), and its construction is of great strategic significance to China's economic and social development. The project includes housing, roads, tunnels, and many other types of facilities, and involves many overseas construction companies. It is a typical and representative group megaproject in China and therefore provides a suitable case for the study of MSRB.</p><p>A broad questionnaire survey was used for data collection. The questionnaire used a Likert-5 scale from 1 (totally inconsistent) to 5 (totally consistent) to measure the selected constructs. The measurement items of MSRB were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lin et al. (2017)</ref>, which captured three participating entities' MSRB, including project owner, construction company, and supervision company. To measure CM, we mainly referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Wu et al. (2017)</ref> and used a total of five measurement items. Based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Wang et al. (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Yu (2014)</ref>, the measurement of IP consists of 13 items, including 4 for regulatory pressure, 5 for normative pressure, and 4 for cultural cognitive pressure. The SRC measurement was adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lin et al. (2017)</ref>, using a total of 9 items. The measures used for the RS were based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Granovetter (1973)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Autry and Golicic (2010)</ref>, including communication frequency and degree of influence. The Appendix contains details of the questionnaire.</p><p>After the questionnaire development, random sampling was used to select the target respondents. 11 construction sites were selected and the questionnaire was randomly distributed to a total of 196 megaproject managers working on the sites: these include owner, contractor, and supervisor to ensure their reasonable representativeness in MSR practices. In addition, to improve the effectiveness and accuracy of the survey data, the research team entrusted the Guangzhou Municipal Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau to issue a government </p></div>

Finally, the members of the research group carried the government document construction sites to conduct on-the-spot visits and surveys. The questionnaires were completed by either an on-site paper version or online questionnaire using the online questionnaire platform Questionnaire Star. The respondents were asked to complete the questionnaire based on the megaproject on which they were working. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows the three steps in the survey process. All 196 questionnaires were collected, comprising 65 paper-based questionnaires and 131 electronic questionnaires. Those less than 90% complete, with same answers to more than 80% of the questions, or obviously randomly answered were deleted.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Data analysis method</head><p>The data analysis is by multiple regression: this is a statistical method to establish the quantitative relationships between multiple variables in linear or non-linear mathematical models. Here it is used to explore the relationship between institutional pressure (comprising regulatory pressure, normative pressure, cultural cognitive pressure), organizational social responsibility cognition and MSRB, and, more specifically, verifying the mediating effect of social responsibility cognition between institutional pressure and MSRB, verifying the moderating effect of CM and relationship strength between institutional pressure and MSRB, and verifying the moderating effect of relationship strength between social responsibility cognition and MSRB.</p><p>Reliability refers to the degree of consistency of results obtained by repeated measurements on the same respondent in the same way. Here, Cronbach α coefficient is used for reliability analysis. Validity refers to the extent to which analytical measurement tools or means can accurately measure the things to be measured. The measurement scale used is universally acknowledged and mature in the field of MSR currently. Before the formal investiga-tion, a pre-investigation was carried out, and some items that failed in the reliability and validity verification were deleted before the final questionnaire was obtained and the reliability and validity of the questionnaire were proved.</p><p>Multicollinearity is mainly tested by the coefficient of tolerance and variance inflation factor (VIF) of regression model, where VIF is the reciprocal of tolerance. Theoretically, when VIF ≥ 10, the model has serious multicollinearity; the closer the VIF is to 1, the weaker the multicollinearity is <ref type="bibr">(O'brien, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Descriptive statistical analysis</head><p>The 147 valid questionnaires are mainly from managers with management experience of megaproject construction work. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows the respondents' profile information, indicating that the majority are from state-owned enterprises (70.7%), construction companies (75.1%), and have an undergraduate degree and above (62.6%). The male to female ratio is approximately 14:1, which is consistent with the general male dominance in construction projects, especially in construction sites. The number of managers accounts for 88.4%, of which 58.5% were junior managers and 26.5% were middle and senior managers; 66.0% have been working more than 5 years and 32.0% over 10 years. These are reasonable representatives of the situation in China.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1.">Influence of institutional pressure on MSRB</head><p>Firstly, the control variables of Project ID, Organizational roles, and Organizational ownership are placed into regression Model 1 with the MSRB as the dependent variable (as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>). Project ID refers to the 11 different construction sites; Organization roles are project owner, construction company, and supervision company; and Organization ownership comprises state-owned, private-owned and foreign-owned organizations. The results show there is no significant correlation between the control variables and MSRB, indicating that the differences in MSRB of organizations are not affected by Project ID, Organizational roles, or Organizational ownership. Secondly, institutional pressure is added into the regression model (Model 2). As shown in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>, institutional pressure is significantly positively correlated with MSRB (b = 0.627, p = 0.000 &lt; 0.05), so H 1 is not rejected. In order to further examine the role of the three dimensions (regulatory pressure, normative pressure, cultural cognitive pressure) in institutional pressure, the three variables are added into the regression model (Model 2a). The results show that only regulatory pressure has a significant (positive) effect on MSRB (b = 0.311, p = 0.002 &lt; 0.05). The most likely reason is that the development of social responsibility of megaprojects in China is still at the initial stage, with the public and organizations themselves having no clear understanding of the social responsibility of projects. As a result, the implementation of social responsibility in megaprojects mainly relies on the government's mandatory requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2.">Influence of organizational social responsibility cognition on MSRB</head><p>In order to further test the mediating effect of organizational social responsibility cognition in MSRB, a threestep analysis is needed. The first step is to test the impact of institutional pressure on MSRB, and the Model 2 test has passed (b = 0.623, p = 0.000 &lt; 0.05). The second step is to test the impact of institutional pressure on social responsibility cognition (Model 3), and the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">7</ref> results show that institutional pressure has a significant impact on organizational social responsibility cognition (b = 0.632, P = 0.000 &lt; 0.05). The third step is to test the influence of institutional pressure and social responsibility cognition on MSRB (Model 3a). The Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">7</ref> results show that the influence of institutional pressure on MSRB is not significant (b = 0.147, p = 0.057), the regression coefficient being reduced from 0.623 in Model 3. However, the influence of organizational social responsibility cognition on MSRB is significant (b = 0.753, p = 0.000 &lt; 0.05). Therefore, H 2 also cannot be rejected. </p></div>

To avoid multicollinearity, the "CM" and Institutional pressure variables are centralized and then multiplied. The Table <ref type="table">8</ref> results show that the CM has no significant moderating effect on the relationship between institutional pressure and MSRB (b = -0.043, p = 0.414 &gt; 0.05), and there is almost no change in R 2 and significance between Model 4 and Model 4a. H 3 is therefore rejected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.4.">Influence of relationship strength on MSRB</head><p>In order to test the moderating effect of relationship strength on the relationship between institutional pressure and MSRB, institutional pressure, relationship strength, and their cross-term are introduced into Model 5a.

The Table <ref type="table">9</ref> results show that the regulatory effect of relationship intensity on the relationship between institutional pressure and MSRB is also not significant (b = 0.006, p = 0.708), with little change in R 2 and significance between Models 5 and 5a. Therefore, H 4 is also rejected.</p><p>To test the moderating effect of relationship strength on the relationship between organizational social responsibility cognition and MSRB, Social responsibility cogni-tion, Relationship strength, and their cross-term are introduced into Model 6a. To avoid multiple collinearity problems, this time the Social responsibility cognition and Relationship strength variables are centralized and multiplied. The Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">10</ref> results show that the regulatory effect of relationship strength on the relationship between organizational social responsibility cognition and MSRB is again not significant (b = 0.000, p = 0.990 &gt; 0.05), with little change in R 2 and significance between Model 6 and Model 6a.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Currently, the adoption of MSR in China is mostly led by the Chinese government. The findings show that the more institutional pressure is applied, the better MSRB of the organization (H 1 ). Moreover, regulatory pressure is the primary source of institutional pressure on MSRB (H 1a ), while the normative pressure and cultural cognitive pressure have no significant effect on MSRB (H 1b and H 1c ). This finding is mainly due to regulatory pressure playing an important role in megaproject participants' behavior, as echoed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">He's et al. (2020)</ref> finding that sufficient government regulatory pressure can improve the contractor's environmental behavior. However, normative pressure and cultural cognitive pressure can only be created and formed by a large number of organizational actors, which means that normative pressure and cultural cognitive pressure could hardly be developed when there are still relatively few megaprojects being constructed. For megaprojects, the government is usually like a "wind vane" or "focus", and the behavior of enterprises usually revolves around this focus <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(McAdams &amp; Nadler, 2010)</ref>. For MSR, the government plays a leading role <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ma et al., 2017)</ref>. However, some studies conclude that the driving force of regulatory pressure on social responsibility is ineffective, because social responsibility contains voluntary and altruistic characteristics, and a better way is to promote the development of social responsibility through normative and cultural cognitive pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Wang et al., 2018)</ref>. In other words, enterprises can improve and implement social responsibility by creating a better MSR environmental atmosphere that consciously fulfills or implements MSR. However, as the present study suggests, it will take time to create such an environment.</p><p>In addition, the participant's MSRB is affected by its own social responsibility cognition under institutional pressure (H 2 ), which is consistent with previous research finding that institutional pressure affects the performance of social responsibility by affecting the characteristics of enterprises <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Feng &amp; Rong, 2016)</ref> with social responsibility cognition. The response and judgment of the organization to institutional pressure largely depends on its social responsibility cognition, and it chooses the most suitable behavior measures based on its position in, and understanding of, the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Liu &amp; Wang, 2016)</ref>. The organizations that attach importance to social responsibility are more sensitive to the requirements of the surrounding institutional pressure for social responsibility in the project, and are more likely to adhere to the requirements of institutional pressure for their own MSRB, thus improving their own social responsibility cognition. The higher the level of an organization's corporate social responsibility cognition, the more sensitive it is to institutional pressure, and the more attention it pays to its own social responsibility behavior in the project.</p><p>It is worth noting that, in the present study, information communication mechanism and relationship strength have no significant moderating effect on the relationship between institutional pressure and MSRB (H 3 , H 4 , and H 5 ) -a conclusion also supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ma et al. (2019)</ref>, where the positive effect of MSR in megaprojects is weakened by the interactions of primary stakeholders. How- ever, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wang (2014)</ref> believes that a smooth CM can promote the cooperation of megaproject participants to fulfill their social responsibilities for two main reasons. First, in the study of communication relationship, only the relationship between participants is considered, while the social responsibility cognition of participants is not considered: if an organization with a large influence has a low social responsibility cognition, it may have a negative impact on the whole network. Second, although enterprises with a high social responsibility cognition are sensitive to institutional pressure and engineering social responsibility, they are also willing to take the initiative to adopt social responsibility. However, this kind of behavior has not been noticeably publicized and praised in megaprojects, which implies that the organization taking the initiative to adopt MSRB has not obtained substantive benefits. With the increase of the communication intensity between organizations, they will find that adopt MSRB is meaningless. In addition, under the influence of other participants, even if the enterprise itself pays attention to social responsibility, it may no longer be willing to prevent "idle work" in the project. This study finds that a precondition for the communication between participants to promote social responsibility behavior is for the vast majority of participants to accept that social responsibility is important for megaprojects. It is also found that current institutional pressure mainly promotes the MSRB through regulatory pressure, while normative pressure and cultural cognitive pressure have less impetus (H 1b and H 1c ). This is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Yu and Liu's (2015)</ref> f inding that regulatory pressure has the greatest impact on the adoption of social responsibility. In this context, the smooth communication between the agents may not only diffuse the effect of institutional pressure better, but also help them avoid some social responsibility behaviors (that they thought unnecessary) through cooperation and other means, which weakens or even offsets the positive impact of institutional pressure on MSRB.</p><p>It is therefore important to create an atmosphere of social responsibility through normative pressure and cultural cognitive pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Wang et al., 2018)</ref>: normative pressure changes organizational behavior through shaping certain values, while cultural cognitive pressure mainly affects organizational behavior through imitation. Ethical behavior is most important in social responsibility behavior, and regulatory pressure can only regulate the behavioral bottom line. For responsibility and obligation beyond the bottom line, normative pressure and cultural cognitive pressure play more significant roles. To maximize social responsibility behavior, a more important and fundamental means is to shape the cultural atmosphere. In addition to compulsory measures, the government prioritize leading enterprises to set an example and encourage good social responsibility behavior through rewarding them with some reputation or other benefits so that, when other organizations realize the benefits of adopting social responsibility, they will actively imitate and form a virtuous circle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and future research</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>A megaproject is a temporary organizational field and, in order to achieve the common construction goal, all participating organizations form a temporary institutional field through material exchange, information exchange, and task cooperation. Under institutional pressure formed by the organizational institutional environment, each participant takes corresponding social responsibility actions. In addition, the relationship of communication and exchanges between participants influences the effect of institutional pressure. In order to clarify the rules of the social responsibility behavior of participants in megaprojects under institutional pressure and improve the overall efficiency of MSR, this study analyzes the rules of MSRB from the perspective of new institutional sociology, which provides theoretical support for the management of MSR. The following conclusions are drawn from the study.</p><p>Institutional pressure promotes MSRB, and organizational social responsibility cognition plays a mediating role between institutional pressure and MSRB. Further analysis shows that regulatory pressure is a significant determinant of MSRB, but normative pressure and cultural cognitive pressure have no significant effect on MSRB. Similarly, CM has no significant effect on the relationship between institutional pressure and MSRB, and relationship strength has no significant effect on the relationship between institutional pressure and MSRB and the relationship between social responsibility cognition and MSRB.</p><p>At present, institutional pressure on MSR is mainly from regulatory pressure, which means the government mainly uses mandatory measures to require enterprises to adopt social responsibilities. Smooth communication and strong relationships between participants may lessen the effect of institutional pressure. Social responsibility behavior is not a spontaneous behavior, but is driven by fully accepting the concept of social responsibility and fully understanding the necessity and superiority of social responsibility behavior. When this happens, and the information exchange between the project participants is sufficient and the communication is smooth, enterprises cooperate together to adopt any social responsibility behaviors previously seen as unnecessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p>Based on our research results, in order to improve the social responsibility behavior of megaprojects in practice, cultivation of MSRB can be divided into two stages of first implementing "mandatory measures" and then "creating a cultural atmosphere of social responsibility". In the first stage, when regulatory pressure is dominant, the information CM may inhibit the spread of social responsibility behavior; therefore, managers need to focus on strengthening the supervision and guidance of key organizations. When the second stage is reached and the cultural atmosphere of social responsibility of the project is established, the information CM becomes the catalyst for the diffusion of social responsibility behavior.</p><p>(1) Mandatory measures first. Firstly, the government adopts compulsory means to attract the attention of all participants to social responsibility and raise its awareness in each participant. Given that the concept of MSR is vague and its consciousness is relatively weak in China, some compulsory means are indispensable, such as laws and regulations, relevant regulations, and contractual constraints: the government sends a strong signal to society that this issue is very important through the formulation of laws and regulations related to social responsibility. Then all social sectors begin to attach importance to this issue, forcing companies to focus on it, so as to improve the awareness of the agents' social responsibility.</p><p>(2) Creating a cultural atmosphere of social responsibility. Mandatory measures can only regulate the behavioral bottom line, but the requirements of social responsibility are obviously higher than that. Normative pressure and cultural cognitive pressure play more significant roles in determining behavior beyond the bottom line. Social responsibility behavior has ethical properties and requires the voluntary initiative of participants. Therefore, the use of compulsory measures to promote social responsibility behavior is only a temporary means, while the real long-term mechanism is the construction of a cultural atmosphere: for example, providing a guide the public for engineering social responsibility, attracting media reports on the process of engineering social responsibility, and regularly rewarding projects and organizations that focus on socially responsibility behaviors. The main and fundamental means of encouraging social responsibility behavior is by shaping the cultural atmosphere, i.e., creating a cultural atmosphere of social responsibility throughout megaprojects, and using flexible means to "force" organizations to regard their own social responsibility behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future research</head><p>This study is limited by the respondents being solely from the megaproject construction sites in Shenzhen, thus inevitably restricting the generalizability of the findings. In addition, social responsibility behavior is mainly examined at the construction stage, while the behavior rules in different project stages are likely to be different. In order to further improve the reliability and practicability of the research results, future research needs to be conducted with respondents at the national or even global level, and the social responsibility behavior rules involved in different construction stages analyzed and compared. In addition, in the face of this internationalized world, what elements might influence the MSR of international contractors is also a question worth addressing. </p></div>
