<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Parental rearing-styles are crucial for psychosocial adjustment both during childhood and adulthood. The current study examined whether: (a) parental rearing-styles predicted psychosocial adjustment in young-adulthood, (b) this relationship was mediated by attachment styles, and (c) gender differences occur in these relationships. Two hundred and forty (103 male and 132 female) university students completed measures assessing parental rearing-style, current attachment style, romantic relationship satisfaction, friendship quality, self-esteem, and social competence. Multigroup structural equation modelling, conducted separately by gender, revealed that parental rearing-style predicted psychosocial adjustment during young-adulthood. Further, there was also evidence of gender differences and that selfmodels and other-models of attachment mediated this relationship. Together, these findings reinforce the importance of perceived parental rearing-style for subsequent psychosocial adjustment.</p></div>

Therefore, the current research examined the extent to which young-adults' self-model and other-model of attachment mediated the relationship between parental rearing-style and psychosocial adjustment. The distinction was made between the self-model and other-model of attachment to reflect the potential differences in the variability of these internal working models (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bartholomew &amp; Horowitz, 1991)</ref>. The self-model reflects the extent to which an individual has internalised self-worth and the expectation that others will behave positively towards them; whereas, the other-model pertains to the extent to which others are believed to be available and supportive <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Griffin &amp; Bartholomew, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>H5 Self-model and other-model would mediate the relationship between recalled parental rearing-style and psychosocial adjustment during young-adulthood.</p><p>The role of gender as a moderator in the relationship between parental rearing-style, current attachment style, and psychosocial adjustment was also examined.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>An opportunity sample of 240 undergraduates (103 male, 132 female, and 5 unknown) was recruited whilst the students were at leisure from a university campus in the UK. The mean age of the participants was 20.39 (SD = 2.80 years).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>Parental rearing-styles A modified version of The Parenting Style Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Steinberg, 2007)</ref> was used to assess the participants' reports of parental rearing-styles. As the Parenting Style Index was originally designed to be administered to assess adolescents' reports of current parenting experiences <ref type="bibr">(Steinberg, Lamborn, Dornbush, &amp; Darling, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Steinberg, Lamborn, Darling, Mounts, &amp; Dornbusch, 1994)</ref>, the items were modified to assess retrospective accounts of parental rearing-style prior to attending university. The revised 9item involvement subscale (e.g., "My parents kept pushing me to do my best in whatever I did") and the revised 9-item psychological autonomy-granting subscale (e.g., "When I got a poor grade in school, my parents made me feel guilty") demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (α.= .81 and α = .83, respectively). Participants responded to the items using a 4point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 4 (Strongly agree) and were instructed to respond to the items focusing on the parent(s) or guardian(s) who influenced their daily life the most. Items for the psychological autonomy-granting subscale were recoded except: "My parents let me make my own plans for things I wanted to do" such that high scores indicated higher psychological autonomy-granting and higher involvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attachment Style</head><p>The Relationship Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bartholomew &amp; Horowitz, 1991)</ref> was used to assess the participants' adult attachment style. Participants were presented with a separate description that characterised secure, fearful, preoccupied, and dismissing attachment styles and asked to report on a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 (Not at all like me) to 7 (Very much like me), the extent to which each attachment style was characteristic of their approach to relationships. High scores indicated stronger endorsement of the particular style.</p><p>Following the procedure outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Griffin and Bartholomew (1994)</ref>, the self-model and other-model of attachment were calculated from the participants' scores. The self-model score was calculated by summing the participants' responses to the secure and dismissing items and subtracting the participants' responses for the preoccupied and fearful items. The other-model score was calculated by summing the participants' responses to the secure and preoccupied items and subtracting the participants' responses for the dismissing and fearful items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Romantic Relationship Satisfaction</head><p>The seven-item Relationship Assessment Scale <ref type="bibr">(Hendrick, 1988)</ref> was used to assess participants' satisfaction in their current romantic relationship or in their most recent romantic relationship (e.g., "How good is your relationship compared to most?"). Participants responded to the items using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Low satisfaction) to 5 (High satisfaction). Two negatively worded items were reverse coded such that high scores indicated higher satisfaction. The Relationship Assessment Scale demonstrated acceptable internal consistency in the current study (α = .88). Participants were instructed to complete the items focusing on their current or most recent romantic relationship and were told to leave the items blank if they had not had a romantic relationship (n = 36).</p><p>Friendship Quality A modified version of the Multidimensional Friendship Qualities Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Bukowski, Hoza, &amp; Boivin, 1994)</ref>, with items changed to be age appropriate, was used to assess friendship quality. Similar modifications to the items have been made to assess friendship quality in college students (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Neimeyer, Saferstein, &amp; Hagans, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Wiltz, 2003)</ref>. The original scale comprised of five subscales assessing: Companionship (4 items e.g., "My friend and I spend all our free time together", α = .70), conflict (4 items e.g., "I can get into fights with my friend", α = .80), help/aid (5 items e.g., "My friend helps me when I'm having trouble with something", α = .88), security (5 items e.g., "If I have a problem at university or at home, I can talk to my friend about it", α = .83), and closeness (5 items e.g., "I feel happy when I am with my friend", α = .87). Participants were asked to complete the items with respect to one close friend, other than their romantic partner, using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Not true) to 5 (Really true). High scores indicated higher friendship quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Rosenberg's (1965)</ref> Self-Esteem Scale, which has been used extensively with similar samples (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Robins, Hendin, &amp; Trzesniewski, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Schmitt &amp; Allik, 2005)</ref>, was used to assess participants' self-esteem (e.g., "I feel that I have a number of good qualities"). Participants responded to the 10 items using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 3 (Strongly agree) to 0 (Strongly disagree), and items were reverse coded such that higher scores indicated higher self-esteem. The scale demonstrated modest internal consistency (α = .52).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Esteem</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Competence</head><p>The Interpersonal Competence Questionnaire <ref type="bibr">(Burhmester, Furman, Wittenberg, &amp; Reis, 1988)</ref> was used to assess social competence. The scale comprises 5 8-item subscales assessing different competences: Initiation (e.g., "Asking or suggesting to someone new that you get together and do something, e.g., go out together", α = .90), negative assertion (e.g., "Telling a companion you don't like a certain way that he or she has been treating you", α = .86), disclosure (e.g., "Revealing something intimate about yourself while talking with someone you're just getting to know", α = .83), emotional support (e.g., "Helping a close companion work through his or her thoughts and feelings about a major life decision e.g., a career choice", α = .85,), and conflict management (e.g., "Being able to admit that you might be wrong when a disagreement with a close companion begins to build into a serious fight", α = 76). Participants responded to the items using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (I'm poor at this) to 5 (I'm extremely good at this) with high scores indicating greater competence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants were randomly given one of six versions of the questionnaire. Six versions were created to counterbalance the order of presentation of the scales. Participants received standardised instructions and were asked to work through the questionnaires at their own pace. The British Psychological Society ethical guidelines were followed during the data collection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SEM analysis strategy</head><p>One of the requirements for SEM is that there is no missing data when the analysis is performed. As there was missing data, where less than two items within a scale were missing the data was replaced with the series mean and if there were more than two missing items within a scale the participant's data were deleted from the analysis. Some of the data could not be replaced as 36 participants did not complete the romantic relationship satisfaction items because they felt that the items did not apply to them. Four participants did not report their gender and a further six did not complete any items for at least one of the scales and, as such, were excluded. This resulted in a sample of 194 participants (111 female and 83 male). Latent variables were created to represent the variables of interest when the scale administered to participants contained previously validated subscales to remove the error associated with the measurement of these <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Raykov &amp; Marcoulides, 2006)</ref>. Although a latent variable was created for parental rearing-style and both the parental autonomy giving and parental involvement subscales loaded above the accepted level of .60 <ref type="bibr">(Netmeyer, Bearden, &amp; Sharma, 2003)</ref>, examination of the residuals revealed that it was not appropriate to create a latent variable. Therefore, for the purpose of the analysis the parental autonomy giving and parental involvement subscales were treated as separate variables. A latent variable of friendship quality was created; however, the help/aid and conflict subscale failed to load above the accepted level of .60 <ref type="bibr">(Netmeyer et al., 2003)</ref>. Following the recommendations of MacCallum, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Browne, and Sugawara (1996)</ref>, and in recognition of the sample size, the help/aid and conflict subscales were removed from the model. A latent variable was also constructed for social competence. However, the emotional support subscale and the conflict management subscale failed to load about the accepted level of .60 <ref type="bibr">(Netmeyer et al., 2003)</ref> and, as such, were removed from the subsequent analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multigroup SEM</head><p>Multigroup SEM was used to examine the hypothesised model (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and test the various hypotheses that: (a) parental rearing-style would predict romantic relationship satisfaction, friendship quality, self-esteem, and social competence (hypotheses one to four);</p><p>(b) the self-model and other-model of attachment styles would mediate these relationships (hypothesis five); and, (c) gender would moderate these relationships (hypothesis six) using Amos version 18 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arbuckle, 2009)</ref>. The analysis comprised separate groups according to the participants' gender. The final model (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) was a good fit of the data. The Goodness of Fit Index = .90, Comparative Fit Index = .91, and Root Mean Square Error Approximation = .074 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bryant &amp; Yarnold, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Byrne, 2001)</ref>. However, the chisquare was significant indicating that the model was not a complete fit of the data,  2 (68) = 140.13, p &lt; .001, although this often occurs with sample sizes of less than 200 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bentler, 1990)</ref>. The procedure outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Byrne (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cheung and Rensvold (2002)</ref> was implemented to examine potential gender differences and to test hypothesis six.

There were no such significant direct relationships in females between the indicators of parental rearingstyle, romantic relationship satisfaction, friendship quality, self-esteem, and social competence, self-esteem; therefore, hypothesis one, two, three, and four were not supported in females.</p><p>For the requirements of mediation to be met, and to test hypothesis five, it is necessary that the mediator variable is predicted by the predictor variable and that the mediator variable predicted the outcome variable <ref type="bibr">(Baron &amp; Kenny, 1984)</ref>.

The path between parental involvement and self-model was stronger in males than in females. For females, parental involvement predicted the other-model of attachment: Higher parental involvement predicted higher other-model attachment scores and the path was stronger in females than in males. Therefore, the first condition of mediation was met for parental involvement and the self-model and other-model in males and for parental involvement and the other-model in females and, as such, further analysis was conducted to test hypothesis five. However, females' early parenting experiences did not predict the self-model and in both groups parental autonomy granting did not predict the self-model and other-model; therefore, hypothesis five was not support for the self-model in females and for parental autonomy granting.</p><p>There was some evidence that the self-model and the other-model mediated the relationship between previous parental involvement and psychosocial adjustment providing partial support for hypothesis five (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The aim of the study was to examine whether: (a) parental rearing-style predicted psychosocial adjustment during young-adulthood assessed as romantic relationship satisfaction, friendship quality, self-esteem, and social competence (hypothesis one, two, three, and four respectively); (b) these relationships were mediated by current self-model and other-model attachment style (hypothesis five); and, (c) there were gender differences in these relationships (hypothesis six).</p><p>In males, and in support of hypothesis two and three, parental involvement directly predicted friendship quality and self-esteem, and parental autonomy granting directly predicted friendship quality: Positive parental rearing-style predicted higher scores on all of these psychosocial adjustment measures. These findings suggest that creating a positive parental rearing-style that fosters a sense of independence during childhood potentially leads to enhanced friendship quality and self-esteem during young-adulthood in males. One potential explanation for this finding is that greater psychological autonomy afforded by positive parenting experiences allows individuals to develop and refine their social skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Shulman, Collins, &amp; Dital, 1993)</ref> and that these social skills facilitate friendship quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lindsey, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Rubin et al., 2004)</ref>. Further, the findings of the present research are consistent with previous research that suggests when parents invest in the parental-child relationship and foster a warm, supportive relationship this, in turn, boosts the individual's self-worth <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Grolnick, Price, Beiswenger, &amp; Sauck, 2007)</ref>. Additionally, creating a supportive parent-child relationship may also facilitate the development of social competencies that are important for the development and maintenance of satisfying relationships with peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Rudolph, Hammen, &amp; Burge, 1995)</ref>. Therefore, the findings of the present research suggest that it is particularly important for males to have positive parenting experiences during childhood for their subsequent psychosocial adjustment during young-adulthood.</p><p>The self-model and other-model partially mediated some of the relationships between parental rearing-style and psychosocial adjustment in males, providing support for hypothesis five. Specifically, the self-model partially mediated the relationship between parental involvement and romantic relationship satisfaction and friendship quality in males. One potential explanation for this finding is that, as demonstrated in earlier research, positive parental rearing-styles shape the propensity with which an individual develops a secure attachment including a sense of self-worth <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Berry et al., 2006)</ref> and that this sense of selfworth and expectation of positive behaviour from others are crucial for the development of satisfying romantic relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amitay et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Markman et al., 1988)</ref>. Similarly, the self-model and the other-model partially mediated the relationship between parental rearingstyle and social competence in males. A potential explanation for this result resides in the fact that the self-model and the other-model of attachment reflects the extent to which an individual believes that they have the skills to interact with others and that others are available and supportive respectively. Specifically, if an individual believes that others are more available they may be more likely to initiate interactions with them and, as such, refine their social competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Larson, Whitton, Hauser, &amp; Allen, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>In females, the other-model fully mediated the relationship between previous parental involvement and romantic relationship satisfaction, self-esteem, and social competence providing support for hypothesis five. One potential explanation for these relationships is the importance of parental rearing-style for the development of internal working models <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Berry et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Nosko et al., 2011)</ref>. In particular, the availability of the other-models internal working model may influence behaviour such that those females with more positive othermodels demonstrated higher levels of romance and assurance compared to those with less positive other-models <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Guerrero &amp; Bachman, 2006)</ref>. Similarly, positive parental rearingstyle may have facilitated the development of social skills which could have been reflected in the females' social competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Rudolph et al., 1995)</ref>. The other-model may have also fully mediated the relationship between parental rearing-style and self-esteem in females because of the importance of how individuals perceive others for the development and maintenance of their self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Murray et al., 2000)</ref>. Specifically, having a positive-other model of attachment would reinforce an individual's belief that others are available for them and, as such, foster their self-esteem.</p><p>The present study did find some evidence to support hypothesis five that current attachment style mediated the relationship between parental rearing-style and psychosocial adjustment during young-adulthood. However, attachment style failed to fully mediate all of the relationships. Therefore, the lack of medication, especially for females, suggests that there are other potential explanations for the relationship between parental rearing-style and current psychosocial adjustment. For example, it may be that core beliefs mediate the relationship between parental rearing-style and psychosocial adjustment. Core beliefs are schematic representations that guide behaviour and judgements in social contexts and social interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fossel &amp; Wright, 1999)</ref> and develop from an individual's interaction with their primary caregiver during early childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Young, 1990)</ref>. Research has also suggested that core beliefs are resistant to change <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beck, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Padesky, 1994)</ref> and, as such, it may be that these cognitive schemas are what guide an individual's social interactions and ultimately foster psychosocial adjustment. Therefore, future research should examine the role of core beliefs in the relationship between parental rearing-style attachment styles, and psychosocial adjustment during young-adulthood. An alternative explanation for the partial mediation resides in the respondents' selfperceptions of their parental rearing-style. Specifically, some of the participants may have been reporting an inconsistent account of their actual parental rearing-style. For example, some of the participants may have reported overly positive experiences whereas others may have reported overly negative experiences. Previous research has suggested that bias can emerge in both retrospective accounts <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hardt &amp; Rutter, 2004</ref>) and current experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fan et al., 2006)</ref>. These potential biases could also be related to the individual's level of selfknowledge and, in turn, their psychosocial adjustment. Specifically, some researchers have argued that having an overly positive self-knowledge of traits facilitates and enhances psychosocial adjustment <ref type="bibr">(Bromgard, Tafimow, &amp; Bromgard, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Brookings &amp; Seratelli, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Taylor &amp; Brown, 1988)</ref> whereas other researchers have argued that realistic selfknowledge is crucial for psychosocial adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Colvin &amp; Block, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Joiner, Kistner, Stellrecht, &amp; Merrill, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Robins &amp; Beer, 2001)</ref>. Therefore, it may be that potential biases in recounting parental rearing-style may also be linked to biases in self-reported psychosocial adjustment. Consequently, future researchers could further explore this issue through examining the consistency of individuals' reports with other information sources such as their parents, peers, or romantic partners for the same variable.</p><p>In support of hypothesis six, gender moderated the relationship between young-adults' parental rearing-styles, attachment styles, and psychosocial adjustment. For young-adult males the direct paths between parental rearing-styles and psychosocial adjustment, the paths between parental involvement and the attachment styles, and the paths between the selfmodel and social competence and romantic relationship satisfaction were stronger than the comparable paths in females. However, in females the paths between the other-model and romantic relationship satisfaction, self-esteem, and social competence were stronger than the comparable paths in males. Gender may have moderated the relationships between parental rearing-style, attachment, and psychosocial adjustment because of potential differences experienced by males and females regarding appropriate conduct acquired during the social learning and socialisation processes that resulted from the parental rearing-styles (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Updergraff et al., 2002)</ref>. The differences in path strengths may also reflect gender differences that emerge in adults' social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Johnson, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Pagano &amp; Hirsch, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Salas &amp; Ketzenberger, 2004</ref>) and aspects of psychosocial adjustment such as selfesteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Zuckerman, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>There are some limitations with the present study which should be addressed in future research. For example, the present study used a cross-sectional design which relied on participants retrospective accounts of their previous parental rearing-styles. Such a design is limited by the accuracy of the participants' retrospective accounts, which although have been questioned by some, are regarded as a useful starting point for investigating a phenomena within the area of social development (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hardt &amp; Rutter, 2004)</ref>. One potential way to overcome this limitation would be to adopt a research design similar to <ref type="bibr">Simpson, Collins, Tran, and Hayden (2007)</ref> who initially examined children at one-years-old and then followed them to young-adulthood. Although, such an approach may be constrained by sample size and sample attrition it would be useful to examine children's parental rearing-style during early childhood, using a range of techniques to overcome common method variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Lindell &amp; Whitney, 2001)</ref>, and then follow the children through to young-adulthood. The research also examined global parental rearing-style and did not distinguish between maternal and paternal parental rearing-styles or compare psychosocial adjustment according to family type.</p><p>Previous research has reported differences in adolescents' psychosocial adjustment according to maternal parental rearing-style and paternal parental rearing-style <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Milevsky, Schlechter, Netter, &amp; Keehn, 2007)</ref>. Additionally, it may be that because of the changing nature of the family unit individuals experience a range of parental rearing-style during childhood. For example, research with adolescents has reported that different patterns in the psychosocial profiles of individuals according to whether they experience shared parenting or non-shared parenting <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson, Hetherington, Reiss, &amp; Howe, 1994)</ref>. Therefore, future research should further examine the potential effects of shared and non-shared parenting for psychosocial adjustment during young-adulthood.</p><p>The present study also relied on participants to acknowledge whether they considered themselves to be in a romantic relationship and there may have been some variation in how the participants defined such a relationship. Further, the Chronbach's alpha for the self-Running head: PREDICTING PSYCHOSOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 20 esteem measure was below the acceptable value of .70, and whilst the scale is reported to reliable and valid <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Greenberger, Chen, Dmitrieva, &amp; Farruggia, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Strauss, 2005)</ref>, the findings of the present study pertaining to self-esteem should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Consequently, future research should further examine the relationship between earlyparenting experiences and self-esteem. Also, the sample size was close to the minimum recommended of 200 for SEM (see <ref type="bibr">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001)</ref>, the sample size is likely to have influenced power in the analysis. However, modelling by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">MacCallum et al. (1996)</ref> suggests that the sample size for the current study is appropriate for .80 power.</p><p>In summary, the findings suggest that parental rearing-style continue to be important in to young-adulthood. Specifically, we found evidence that memories of positive parental rearing-style predicted a range of psychosocial adjustment measures during young-adulthood.</p><p>There was also evidence of differences in these relationships according to gender and the results indicate that the early parenting experiences of males are particularly important for psychosocial adjustment. Together, these findings suggest that there is clear evidence of the importance of early experiences and that these early experiences may vary according to gender. </p></div><figure
