<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>With the technological developments and social changes, social entrepreneurship has become an important concept that is nowadays often addressed. The European Commission defines social entrepreneurship as one of the lifelong learning skills. In the information decade, it is seen that within the context of lifelong learning, entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial individual, entrepreneurship education and similar concepts have been stressed as important <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Yavuz-Konakman &amp; Yanpar-Yelken, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Social entrepreneurship emphasizes that social responsibilities should be handled in an innovative way to create a social value in the society which offers solutions to social problems from the perspective of entrepreneurship <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kılıç-Kırılmaz, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">OECD, 1999)</ref>. In terms of producing innovative social projects and increasing the productivity of the society <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Eren, 2010)</ref>, the role of education in bringing the concept of social entrepreneurship to individuals is considered important in the context of lifelong learning. Because education almost entirely surrounds a community, providing training for the next generation is an institute which has very comprehensive and critical values <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Parlak, 2017)</ref>. In addition, the model and content of education are also changing regarding the variety of technology. Educational institutions have to keep pace with changes and constantly improve the quality of education in order to educate the people the society needs. This is expressed as the training of the creative, innovative, learning to learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Çalık &amp; Sezgin, 2005)</ref>, and entrepreneurial individuals who have competencies required with respect to the times <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Akar &amp; Aydın, 2015)</ref>. It seems that technological developments have an effect on social entrepreneurship, where individuals are taught to support lifelong learning and develop entrepreneurial skills. Especially considering the recent technological advances, the integration of new technologies into education is necessary and the existence of technology in education becomes undeniable.</p><p>As evolving Web 2.0 tools become indispensable for individuals, they are used in education and for educational purposes. It is important to educate the community and future generations. However, in order to take part in education and establish oneself in society, effective use of Web 2.0 tools is necessary. Digital literacy is an important concept that comes to mind for effective use of technology by individuals. Considering the dynamic and prevalent use of Web 2.0 tools in today's educational environments, it is believed that effective use of Web 2.0 tools by students influences digital literacy skills. From these perspectives it is anticipated that social entrepreneurship, lifelong learning, digital literacy skills and the use of Web 2.0 technologies may be interrelated, and the framework of this paper is designed with this foresight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Entrepreneurship</head><p>While creating innovative solutions to immediate social issues, social entrepreneurship mobilizes ideas, capacities, resources, and social mechanisms for a sustainable progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Ladeira &amp; Machado, 2013)</ref>. Common ground of the definitions made for the concept of social entrepreneurship in the literature is the solution of a social issue in an innovate approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Austin, Stevenson, &amp; Wei-Skillern, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">İrengün &amp; Arıkboğa, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Thompson, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Katzenstein and Chrispin (2011)</ref>, assuming a social mission and focusing on the emphasis of social benefit, social entrepreneurship is distinguished from entrepreneurship, which is based on capital. The main characteristic of social entrepreneurship which distinguishes it from capital-based entrepreneurship is its altruism <ref type="bibr">(Konaklı &amp; Göğüs, 2013)</ref>. Individuals show awareness in the social environment with their characteristics that feature the social values. Activities performed to find innovative and permanent solutions to the issues that are closely related to society such as unemployment, health, refugee problems, education, environmental problems, women, the elderly, the disabled, animals, etc. are addressed within the scope of social entrepreneurship. Individuals who perform such an activity are called "social entrepreneurs". According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dees (1998)</ref>, who is a pioneer of the social entrepreneurship concept, social entrepreneurs are the changing agents in the society. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Urbano, Toledano, and Soriano (2010)</ref> describe social entrepreneurs who meet the social needs through social values as the accelerators of the transformation. <ref type="bibr">Denizalp (2007)</ref> defines sensitive people who notice social problems in the society and lay persistent emphasis on the problems in an unattempted approach and have gained the confidence of the society with their realistic attitudes as social entrepreneurs. Given the definitions regarding the social entrepreneur individuals, it can be said that they all have a social mission. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abu-Saifan (2012)</ref> states that social entrepreneurs' primary goal is to achieve their social mission.</p><p>Changes within the society cause individuals to become more aware of the increasing/changing needs. <ref type="bibr">Heimstra (1976)</ref> states that lifelong learning is an internal learning process that continues along individuals' lives in accordance with personal interests, needs and skills (see <ref type="bibr">Coşkun &amp; Demirel, 2012)</ref>. It is thought that this definition regarding lifelong learning is related to the characteristics of a social entrepreneur individual who can notice the issues within the social environment in the society, creates a social value with his/her interests, skills and missions and can handle innovative points of view in the solutions to the problems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Havolli and Ahmeti (2008)</ref> state that improvement of entrepreneurship requires motivated and creative individuals who tend to solve problems through qualified education. Thus, how social entrepreneur individuals improve their lifelong learning skills is deemed important for the future of society. In the Decree of European <ref type="bibr">Parliament and Council (2006)</ref> on "lifelong learning", the importance of the contribution to the support of enhancing the entrepreneurial spirit is stated among the general objectives of the lifelong learning program. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Balay (2004)</ref> emphasizes that individuals with the ability to understand, interpret and develop information are lifelong learning individuals. It is thought that lifelong learning individuals would find solutions in meeting the social needs of society through a more innovative perspective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lifelong Learning</head><p>With the very rapid exchange of information, individuals have been feeling the need for continuous learning <ref type="bibr">(Coşkun &amp; Demirel, 2012)</ref>. Another reason for this is that Internet and recent technologies have entered our lives very quickly. According to <ref type="bibr">Perelman's (1992)</ref> new understanding of education, learning cannot be trapped between walls (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Erişti, 2010)</ref>, and learning is not only limited to the school years, but handled as a lifelong process <ref type="bibr">(Erişti, 2010, p. 7)</ref>. All these developments bring along the mentality that education cannot be limited to a certain period of human life. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -OECD (1999), human's development occurs in an endless process throughout a life time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kahlert (2000)</ref> defines lifelong learning as individuals acquiring knowledge from several sources and learning opportunities for life. They must develop themselves for life to adapt to scientific, technological and cultural changes and meet their own needs. Lifelong learning covers several formal and informal forms of education and training which also include the obligatory skills to be brought to individuals such as searching for information, improving the found information, and using it independently and actively. In the Eighth Development Plan, lifelong learning is described as adapting to the improving life standards, using the manpower effectively in the step taken towards a globalizing economic world, transferring and disseminating information and communication technologies towards broad areas and as a novel approach that aims to raise humans in accordance with the need for a population possessing the knowledge and skills to be used in manufacturing and service industry. It is understood from all definitions regarding lifelong learning that what matters is that individuals continuously develop themselves.</p><p>Limited space or time of learning does not matter to lifelong learning individuals. Moreover, belief that education can be provided only by a teacher in the classroom has been abandoned. Individuals can actualize learning almost everywhere, independently and in an engaged way. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cisco (2008)</ref> articulates that the paradigm change in this century forms the objectives that need to be achieved by students, such as acquiring a series of skills, receiving a qualified education, communicating with diverse cultures and continuing lifelong learning to become successful in the modern world. With today's mobile technologies, individuals undoubtedly have the mission of learning brought along by lifelong learning. After all, learning is regarded as the condition of adapting to developments and vice versa <ref type="bibr">(Edwards &amp; Usher, 2008, p. 62)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Web 2.0 Tools</head><p>Advancing technology highly affects new generations <ref type="bibr">(Mihalcea, Mitan, &amp; Vitelar, 2012)</ref>. As a ring of the technological chain, Web 2.0 technologies are defined as the second generation of Web technologies. Technological developments described as the accelerator of social transformation allow for the upbringing of a generation with high tendency of using technological tools. They grow and breathe with technology and do everything using technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Tapscott, 2009)</ref>. Described as "digital native", "y generation", "quick learner", "technophile", this generation is regarded as being very accustomed to technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hansen &amp; Leuty, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Shih, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Twenge et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Development of Web 2.0 has changed the user roles. Web 2.0 tools have freed individuals from being pacificated and they have been effective for individuals in developing new contents and applications in accordance with their needs to become more active and creative <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Tonta, 2009)</ref>. According to their nature, Web 2.0 tools have characteristics such as inherited structure, how users create individual products and contents and using the power and union of the crowd <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Anderson, 2007)</ref>. Web 2.0 tools include blogs, wikis, podcasts, RSS (Rich Site Summary), instant messaging, and social networks. Each of these tools are utilized in education in diverse ways with their characteristics. For instance, blogs are websites that are created by individuals or groups and involve texts, pictures and audio files preferred by individuals for introducing themselves and expressing their opinions while wikis allow users to add, delete or edit contents <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Horzum, 2010)</ref>. Accordingly, it can be said that blogs and wikis can be useful for expressing opinions on a given subject. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tavales and Skevoulis (2006)</ref> argue that podcasts are auxiliary tools for individuals to learn a given instructional material independently. Therefore, individuals can use podcasts for learning purposes without the limitation of time and space. Similarly, RSS, instant messaging, and social networks have the characteristics of Web 2.0 tools. Such tools provide individuals with independent learning. An individual can access the needed information independently. Discussion websites created by communities that are interested in a given issue give entrepreneurs the opportunity to grab a value, and entrepreneurs may find solutions to that issue by interacting with individuals or groups with similar opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Maltby, 2012)</ref>. Individuals can reflect their social entrepreneurial spirits and lifelong learning trends using Web 2.0 tools, and these tools have the characteristic inherent structure, the power of union and activating the individuals to help them observe problems from different perspectives. It is expected that individuals who use Web 2.0 tools to access, create information and experience social environments, have improved lifelong learning trends and social entrepreneurship skills.</p><p>It is thought that individuals can take efficient roles in the solution to a problem by getting together with members and groups with which they interact through social media. Web technologies have an undeniable power for individuals to access required information to solve problems they experience in society. It is deemed important that individuals solve a given problem by handling it with proper information and in accordance with their needs. Yet, not every report shared or every account on social networks is true as is known. So many fake profiles and reports on social network websites require individuals to set their literacy skills to work, and it is emphasized that digital literacy skills are important in the awareness of the quality of shared reports and reliability of social network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Digital Literacy</head><p>Digital literacy requires proper use of different technologies and the ability to access, produce and share the correct information and to use technology in learningteaching processes <ref type="bibr">(Hamutoglu, Canan-Güngören, Kaya-Uyanık, &amp; Gür-Erdoğan, 2016)</ref>. Several web technologies such as search engines, social networks, news websites, blogs, wikis, etc. can be utilized. However, all pieces of information obtained from these web technologies may not be correct and reliable. Information acquired from unreliable sources may misguide social entrepreneur individuals. It is expected that social entrepreneur individuals who interact with members and groups for a given purpose have improved digital literacy skills. Otherwise, production and sharing of abusing and misleading information would have an efficient role in creating risk among the society <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Çubukçu &amp; Bayzan, 2013)</ref>. Individuals with advanced digital literacy skills differentiate from others in terms of solving problems they face and expressing themselves. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Tornero (2004)</ref> reports that digital literacy skills improve students' creativity and ability to express themselves. Creativity is of importance for social entrepreneurs to solve social problems through different perspectives. The use of Web 2.0 tools also requires advanced digital literacy skills, which have been defined as accessing the correct information by using different technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Çubukçu &amp; Bayzan, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim of the Study</head><p>It is emphasized in this study that lifelong learning tendencies, usage of Web 2.0 tools and digital literacy skills are important in individuals' characteristics of social entrepreneurship. It is thought that lifelong learning tendencies, usage of Web 2.0 tools, and digital literacy levels have a correlation with social entrepreneurship characteristics. It is worth to note that in the literature there is a limited number of studies that investigate the direct effect of individuals' lifelong learning trends, the use of Web 2.0 tools, and the level of digital literacy variables on social entrepreneurship characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abu-Saifan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Balay, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Khalid, 2010)</ref>, the relationship between entrepreneurship and Web 2.0 tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hughes, 2016)</ref>, the effect of ICT use on entrepreneurship level <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Yavuz-Konakman &amp; Yanpar-Yelken, 2014)</ref>, the relationship between lifelong learning trends and social entrepreneurship characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Sezen-Gültekin &amp; Gür-Erdoğan, 2016)</ref>. In addition, the relationship between lifelong learning trends of Web 2.0 tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hew &amp; Cheung, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Scalater, 2008)</ref> and the relationship of Web 2.0 tools with digital literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bates, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Çubukçu &amp; Bayzan, 2013)</ref> are present in the literature. In this context, this study looks for the answer to the question whether lifelong learning, Web 2.0 tools, and digital literacy directly affect social entrepreneurship, or whether Web 2.0 tools have an indirect effect on social entrepreneurship through lifelong learning and digital literacy. Hence, this study aims to find direct effects of lifelong learning, Web 2.0 tools, and digital literacy on social entrepreneurship, and indirect effects of Web 2.0 tools on social entrepreneurship through the lifelong learning and digital literacy, and comparing these two different models. Therefore, in the light of obtained findings, the present study is important in terms of revealing the variables that are effective in educating social entrepreneurial individuals and emphasizing the importance of these variables in education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>The aim of the present study is to find out direct and indirect effects of digital literacy, lifelong learning trends, and Web 2.0 tools on social entrepreneurship. In this context, the study was designed by descriptive cross-sectional survey model, used to determine the unique and specific characteristics of obtained data <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fraenkel &amp; Wallen, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The participants in the conducted study were prospective teachers (N=809) studying at Sakarya University, Faculty of Education in the spring term of the 2016-2017 academic year. The sample were chosen randomly among the prospective teachers. The socio-demographic characteristics of the participants are presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, the study group consisted of 75.9% (f = 614) female and 24.1% (f = 195) male participants. The age range of participants was from 20 to 60 (df = 5.07); 50.9% (f = 412) were interested in social activity while 49.1% (f = 397) were not interested in any social activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Entrepreneurship Qualifications Scale</head><p>The Social Entrepreneurship Qualifications Scale (SEQ-S) was developed by <ref type="bibr">Konakli and Gogus (2013)</ref>. The scale was a 5-point Likert-type, consisting of 21 items with three main sub-scales, namely self-confidence, personal creativity and risk taking. The self-confidence sub-scale comprised eight items, for example, "It is easy for me to make new environment / friends". The personal creativity sub-scale consisted of six items, and "Before I start doing a job, I think there are different ways I can do this job" is an example. Finally, the risk-taking sub-scale included seven items, for example, "It's exciting for me to start a hard job". While the Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficient was reported at .85 for the total score of the scale, the reliability for self-confidence, personal creativity, and risk taking sub-scales was .77,.70, and 72, respectively. The CFA results of the SEQ-S indicated good fit indices (χ2 = 427. 15, df=186, χ2 /df= 2.29; RMSEA= 0.63; SRMR=.60, NFI= .90; NNFI=.95; CFI=.95; GFI=.90; AGFI=.86) <ref type="bibr">(Hooper, Coughlan &amp; Mullen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schermelleh-Engel, Moosbrugger, &amp; Müler, 2003)</ref>. The total score of 21 items is the measure of the person's social entrepreneurship qualification. If the person's score on the scale is lower than 42 then the qualification is low, if the score is between 42 and 63 it is medium, and if the score is above 63 then high social entrepreneurial features are mentioned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lifelong Learning Trends Scale (LLLT-S)</head><p>This scale was developed by Gur-Erdogan and Arsal ( <ref type="formula">2016</ref>), and consisted of 17 items, assessed on a 5-point Likert scale with a two factor-structure. The factors were determined as "willingness to learn" and "openness to improvement". Within the dimensions of willingness to learn, there were 11 items, for example, "I prefer to be selfmotivated during the learning process", and the openness to improvement dimension comprised six items. "It is important for me to advance in my career" is an example for the dimension of openness to improvement. A total exposition of the factors was 43.44%, and Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient was calculated as .86 while ω value was found to be .89. The fit indices of the scale, found that χ2 value is significant (p &lt;0.05), RMSEA=0.07, RMR=0.02, GFI=0.93, AGFI=0.90, NFI=0.93, NNFI=0.93, CFI=0.94. The total score of 17 items is the measure of the lifelong learning trends. If the score on the scale is lower than 34, social entrepreneurship features are low; if the score is between 34 and 51, they are medium, and if the score is above 51, they are high.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Digital Literacy Scale</head><p>The Digital Literacy Scale (DL-Q), which was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ng (2012)</ref> and adapted to Turkish by <ref type="bibr">Hamutoglu et al. (2016)</ref>, was administered in the study. The scale was a 5-point Likert type scale, ranging from 1 "Strongly Disagree" to 5 "Strongly Agree", and had a total of 17 items. The original form of the scale comprised four dimensions such as attitude, technical, cognitive and social-emotional dimension. Within the dimension of attitude, there were seven items, for example "I like using ICT for learning". The technical dimension included six items, and "I can learn new technologies easily" is an example. "I am familiar with issues related to web-based activities e.g. cyber safety, search issues, plagiarism" is an example for the cognitive dimension, which included two items, and finally, "ICT enables me to collaborate better with my peers on project work and other learning activities" is an example for the social dimension which comprised two items, as well. The adapted scale explained 65.78% of total variance, and the fit indices were examined and found for χ2=268.45 (n=113, p=0.00), RMSEA=.071, GFI=.93, AGFI=.91, CFI=.98, NFI=.96, NNFI=.97, and SRMR=.05. The reliability of the scale was computed with Cronbach Alpha correlation coefficient, which was calculated for the whole scale at .93; attitude dimension .88; technical dimension .89; cognitive dimension .70 and social dimension .72. The total score of 17 items is the measure of the digital literacy level. If the score on the scale is lower than 34, social entrepreneurship features are low; if the score is between 34 and 51, they are medium, and if the score is above 51, they are high.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Frequency of Web 2.0 Usage Questionnaire</head><p>The questionnaire looked into the frequency of Web 2.0 tools such as Facebook, MSN, Wiki, Blogs, VPS, and Podcast, and ranged namely 1 "Never", 2 "Once in a month or a few days in a month", 3 "Once in a week or a few days in a week", and 4 "Every day" by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Horzum (2010)</ref>. Views from different experts in the educational technology department (5), assessment and evaluation department (2), and teachers (20) had been taken into consideration in terms of clarity, content and face validity of the items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analyses</head><p>The analysis of the data included descriptive statistical analysis and correlations conducted using SPSS 23.0 (The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). In addition to this, structural equation modelling (SEM) was utilized to evaluate model fit and performed via AMOS 23.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The correlation analyses were first performed in the research to show the mean and standard deviation values of the variables and the relationship between the variables. The findings obtained are given in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. As can be seen in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, the mean values of social entrepreneurship, lifelong learning, digital literacy and frequency of using Web 2.0 tools are equal to or higher than the median. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the participants are social entrepreneurs, inclined to lifelong learning, competent in terms of digital literacy and use Web 2.0 tools at an average frequency.</p><p>The Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to examine the relationships between variables. The findings show that social entrepreneurship has a moderate positive correlation to lifelong learning (0.67), to digital literacy (0.54) and has a weak positive correlation to frequency of using Web 2.0 tools (0.15). Moreover, lifelong learning has a moderate positive correlation to digital literacy (0.40) and a weak positive correlation to the frequency of using Web 2.0 tools (0.11). The relationship between digital literacy and frequency of using Web 2.0 tools is weak and positive (0.10). All relationships were found significant, and based on this finding, Structural Equation Models were set between the variables.</p><p>Two different models were compared and tested with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in the study. The first model measures the direct effects of individuals' lifelong learning skill, digital literacy levels, and frequency of using Web 2.0 tools on their social entrepreneurship statuses. This model was named "model one". The second model, how frequency of using Web 2.0 tools affects lifelong learning skills and digital literacy levels was investigated, and the contribution of this mutual effect to social entrepreneurship statuses was evaluated. The model examining the indirect effects was named "model two". Path analysis diagrams of the two models are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Fits of the models regarding the social entrepreneurship variable and direct and indirect effects of lifelong learning, digital literacy and frequency of using Web 2.0 tools were examined. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the fit coefficients of the two models. As for the criteria to be considered for fit indexes, 0.90 refers to acceptable fit and 0.95 refers to perfect fit for the GFI, CFI and NFI indexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bentler, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bentler &amp; Bonett, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Marsh, Hau, Artelt, Baumert, &amp; Peschar, 2006)</ref>, .85 refers to acceptable fit and .90 refers to perfect fit for AGFI <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Schermelleh-Engel &amp; Moosbrugger, 2003)</ref>.

Finally, for SRMR, .05 refers to perfect fit and .10 refers to acceptable fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Schermelleh-Engel &amp; Moosbrugger, 2003)</ref>. Given all these values, it is seen that all of the values regarding the two models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> refer to perfect fit.</p><p>These two models of perfect fit were compared. As it would have led to error to evaluate the two models separately in the comparison, the direct and indirect effects of two models were combined to draw one single model. The model of the variables affecting the social entrepreneurship variable is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. As seen from the model in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> social entrepreneurship variable has three subdimensions and these can be listed according to their effect size as follows: self-confidence (β=0.77, p&lt;0.001), risk taking (β=0.76, p&lt;0.001) and personal creativity (β=0.67, p&lt;0.001). It is clear that lifelong learning appears to be the most important variable that affects social entrepreneurship (β=0.72, p&lt;0.001). The second most important independent variable affecting social entrepreneurship is digital literacy (β=0.32, p&lt;0.001). The effect of usage frequency of Web 2.0 tools on social entrepreneurship is lower and insignificant considering other variables (β=0.05, p&gt;0.001). These independent variables explain 84% of the variance in the social entrepreneurship variable. In addition to these direct effects, the model includes indirect effects. As illustrated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, total effects are decomposed into direct and indirect effects. According to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, lifelong learning and digital literacy directly and significantly affect social entrepreneurship (p&lt;0.001). While frequency of using Web 2.0 tools has a low direct effect on social entrepreneurship (β=0.05, p&gt;0.001), it has a higher indirect effect through lifelong learning (β=0.72, p&lt;0.001) and digital literacy (β=0.32, p&lt;0.001).</p><p>In all these findings, social entrepreneurship variable was highly and directly influenced by lifelong learning and digital literacy variables, and indirectly from the frequency of using Web 2.0 tools. The frequency of using Web 2.0 tools highly and directly affect the lifelong learning trends and digital literacy levels of prospective teachers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>Social entrepreneurship is one of the concepts that have gained importance recently. Furthermore, lifelong learning, digital literacy and effective usage of Web 2.0 tools are among other prominent characteristics alongside the social entrepreneurship characteristics of today's human. In this context, this study aimed to examine if there is a relation between lifelong learning trends, digital literacy levels, frequency of using Web 2.0 tools, and social entrepreneurship characteristics. To this end, mean and standard deviation values of the variables and the relationship between the variables were first shown in correlation analyses in the study that uses the descriptive, crosssectional survey model. Next, two different models were compared and tested with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in the study. It was found according to mean and standard deviation values of social entrepreneurship, lifelong learning, digital literacy and frequency of using Web 2.0 tools that the means of the values are equal to or higher than the median. Based on the means, it was concluded that the participants are social entrepreneurs, inclined to lifelong learning, competent in terms of digital literacy and use Web 2.0 tools at an average frequency.</p><p>Pearson's correlation coefficient was applied to examine the relationships between the variables, and the analysis showed that social entrepreneurship has a moderate positive correlation to lifelong learning, and digital literacy, and a weak positive correlation to frequency of using Web 2.0 tools. Furthermore, lifelong learning has a moderate positive correlation to digital literacy and weak positive correlation to frequency of using Web 2.0 tools, and a weak positive correlation was found between digital literacy and frequency of using Web 2.0 tools.</p><p>Based on the fact that all relationships were found to be significant in the correlation analysis, structural equation models were created between the variables. The fit indices of the models were examined and they are a perfect fit in both models. These two models of perfect fit were compared. As it would have led to error to evaluate the two models separately in the comparison, the direct and indirect effects of two models were combined to draw one single model.</p><p>The mentioned model established that lifelong learning and digital literacy directly and significantly affect social entrepreneurship, and the frequency of using Web 2.0 tools weakly and indirectly affects social entrepreneurship.</p><p>The results show a direct relationship between social entrepreneurship and lifelong learning. The European <ref type="bibr">Parliament and Council (2006)</ref> mentions the importance of entrepreneurial spirit in lifelong learning, and American Consortium of Entrepreneurship Education defines entrepreneurship training as the process of lifelong learning and lists the stages of creating the entrepreneurial spirit <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Noruzi, Westover, &amp; Rahimi, 2010)</ref>. The social entrepreneurship process involves change to support social, economic and environmental performances. This change can be examined in five aspects: social vision, sustainability, social networking, innovation, and financial yields <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Nga &amp; Shamuganathan, 2010)</ref>. Actualization of social entrepreneurship aspects requires a continuous learning process. Lifelong learning involves implicit and explicit knowledge, and individuals put their skills and experiences into practice to play a critical role in the actualization of continuous learning. Compared to the younger, it is observed that older individuals are more inclined to entrepreneurship in this learning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Arenius &amp; Minniti, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Beugelsdijk &amp; Noorderhaven, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Weber &amp; Schaper, 2004)</ref>. Social entrepreneurship is regarded as one of the lifelong learning opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Morfopoulos &amp; Tyrie, 2011)</ref>. In this context, the fact that individuals who are more active in the process of lifelong learning have higher levels of social entrepreneurship was proven with the findings of this study, too.</p><p>The study also shows that digital literacy has a direct effect on social entrepreneurship. Digital literacy is among the concepts that are included in the definition of citizenship <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(İşman &amp; Canan Güngören, 2014)</ref>. It also covers the new form of learning, which is digital learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Sefton-Green &amp; Erstad, 2013)</ref>. Accordingly, digital literacy provides both content and access. With digital age, digital learning and digital literacy, the concept of entrepreneurship has also started to change. As individuals interact with others and go online, digital literacy which involves learning these steps plays a critical role in the emergence of social entrepreneurship <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Souza, Okada &amp; Silva, 2014)</ref>. Creating the entrepreneurial spirit is considered within the main objectives of developing digital literacy skills (Alberta Education, 2010). It is understood that the research results are analogous with the literature.</p><p>A higher indirect effect of frequency of using Web 2.0 tools on social entrepreneurship is one of the research results. Web 2.0 which is the second generation of web technologies has caused individuals to differentiate and acquire diverse knowledge, skills and attitudes. In this sense, Web 2.0 has allowed for further development of digital literacy and lifelong learning skills. As Web 2.0 is among the indispensable technologies of today, digital literacy and lifelong learning skills are also one of today's critical skills. Web 2.0 tools are used in many stages of education, and there are contents for providing the digital literacy and lifelong learning skills. With the usage of Web 2.0 tools in education, it has been observed in the studies that levels of cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Khalid, 2010)</ref>, motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adrian, 1998)</ref>, student learning and achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hew &amp; Cheung, 2013)</ref>, information literacy skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ata, 2011)</ref>, digital literacy skills (Hamutoglu, Canan Güngören, Gür-Erdoğan, &amp; Kaya Uyanık, 2017; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ng, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Williams &amp; Chinn, 2009)</ref> and lifelong learning skills <ref type="bibr">(Scalater, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Torres Kompen, Edirisingha, &amp; Mobbs, 2008)</ref> have increased. According to the research results, Web 2.0 has an impact on digital literacy and lifelong learning skills, while digital literacy and lifelong learning skills affect social entrepreneurship, which is a finding that coincides with studies in the literature.</p><p>Considering the direct effects of lifelong learning trends and digital literacy skills on the increase of social entrepreneurship skills of prospective teachers, in the light of the obtained findings it is suggested that the programs within the context of lifelong learning and digital literacy accompany educational policies. It is believed that these supplements will increase these skills. Furthermore, another result of the study also implies that the frequency of using Web 2.0 tools indirectly affects social entrepreneurship. Through this finding the more frequent use of Web 2.0 tools in the education programs for students will increase lifelong learning trends and digital literacy, and indirectly contribute to social entrepreneurship skills.</p><p>An experimental study can be designed with variables of lifelong learning, digital literacy and usage frequency of Web 2.0 tools, which influence social entrepreneurship to support and generalize the results obtained from this study. Thus, it is possible to observe the interaction of these variables on the individuals. In addition, research with another sample of participants, is suggested for further studies.</p><p>Finally, it may be concluded that lifelong learning trends, digital literacy levels and frequency of using Web 2.0 tools have a direct and indirect impact on social entrepreneurship. Putting forth the variables that have an impact on social entrepreneurship as an important concept in our era, other characteristics that should be considered for raising social entrepreneur individuals were determined. Lifelong learning, digital literacy, and frequency of using Web 2.0 tools are the effect variables in this study. Other variables which remain important, are deemed to be gaining further importance and affect social entrepreneurship can be utilized in future studies, and the model can be further expanded. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uvod</head><p>S razvojem tehnologije i društvenim promjenama socijalno poduzetništvo postaje važan koncept o kojemu se u današnje vrijeme često raspravlja. Europsko vijeće definira socijalno poduzetništvo kao jednu od vještina cjeloživotnoga učenja. U informacijskom desetljeću koncept cjeloživotnoga učenja podrazumijeva i poduzetništvo, poduzetnog pojedinca, obrazovanje u poduzetništvu i druge sintagme koje nalazimo u literaturi (Yavuz-Konakman i Yanpar-Yelken, 2014). Socijalno poduzetništvo naglašava da se sa socijalnom odgovornošću mora postupati na inovativne načine kako bi se stvorile socijalne vrijednosti u društvima koja nude rješenja za probleme iz perspektive poduzetništva <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kılıç-Kırılmaz, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">OECD, 1999)</ref>. Kada je riječ o stvaranju inovativnih projekata i povećanju produktivnosti društva <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Eren, 2010)</ref>, uloga obrazovanja u osvještavanju koncepta socijalnog poduzetništva kod pojedinaca vrlo je važna u kontekstu cjeloživotnoga učenja. S obzirom na to da obrazovanje u potpunosti okružuje zajednicu, osposobljavanje za buduće generacije institucija je koja mora sadržavati cjelovite i ključne vrijednosti <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Parlak, 2017)</ref>. Nadalje, model i sadržaj obrazovanja također se mijenja u svijetlu raznovrsne tehnologije. Obrazovne institucije moraju ići u korak s promjenama i moraju nuditi kvalitetno obrazovanje kako bi obrazovali ljude koji su potrebni društvu. To podrazumijeva osposobljavanje pojedinaca koji su kreativni, inovativni, koji uče kako učiti <ref type="bibr">(Çalık i Sezgin, 2005)</ref>, i pojedince poduzetnike koji imaju kompetencije potrebne za vrijeme u kojemu žive <ref type="bibr">(Akar i Aydın, 2015)</ref>. Čini se da je razvoj tehnologije imao učinak na socijalno poduzetništvo u kojemu se pojedinci osvještavaju o važnosti cjeloživotnoga učenja i razvijaju poduzetničke vještine. U svjetlu nedavnog napretka tehnologije integracija tehnologije u obrazovanje također je potrebna, a postojanje tehnologije u obrazovanju je neosporno.</p><p>Web 2.0 alati postaju neophodni za pojedince, a koriste se i u obrazovanju, doduše u obrazovne svrhe. Važno je obrazovati zajednicu i buduće generacije. Međutim, za uključenost u obrazovanje i društvo potrebna je učinkovita upotreba Web 2.0 alata. Digitalna pismenost važan je koncept koji je povezan s učinkovitom upotrebom tehnologije od pojedinca. S obzirom na u današnje vrijeme dinamičnu i raširenu upotrebu Web 2.0 alata u obrazovanju, vjeruje se da učinkovita upotreba Web 2.0 alata učenika utječe na vještine digitalne pismenosti. Iz te perspektive, predviđa se da socijalno poduzetništvo, cjeloživotno učenje, digitalna pismenost i upotreba Web 2.0 alata mogu biti u međusobnoj povezanosti, a okvir ovoga rada temelji se na toj premisi.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Socijalno poduzetništvo</head><p>Dok stvara inovativna rješenja za trenutna društvena pitanja, socijalno poduzetništvo mobilizira ideje, potencijale, resurse i društvene mehanizme za održivi razvoj <ref type="bibr">(Ladeira i Machado, 2013)</ref>. Zajednički nazivnik definicija koncepta socijalnog poduzetništva jest rješenje društvenoga problema inovativnim pristupom <ref type="bibr">(Austin, Stevenson i Wei-Skillern, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">İrengün i Arıkboğa, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Thompson, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Prema <ref type="bibr">Katzenstein i Chrispin (2011)</ref>, prihvaćajući društvenu misiju i usredotočujući se na naglašavanje društvene koristi, socijalno poduzetništvo razlikuje se od poduzetništva koje se zasniva na kapitalu. Glavna karakteristika socijalnog poduzetništva po kojoj se ono razlikuje od kapitalnog poduzetništva jest altruizam <ref type="bibr">(Konaklı i Göğüs, 2013)</ref>. Pojedinci pokazuju osviještenost u društvenom okruženju karakteristikama čija su svojstva društvene vrijednosti. Aktivnosti koje se izvode kako bi se iznašla inovativna i trajna rješenja za probleme koji su tijesno vezani uz društvo poput nezaposlenosti, zdravstva i problema izbjeglica, obrazovanja, ekoloških problema, pitanje žena, starijih osoba, onesposobljenih, životinja itd. rješavaju su unutar djelokruga socijalnog poduzetništva. Pojedince koji sudjeluju u takvim aktivnostima nazivamo "socijalnim poduzetnicima". Prema <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dees (1998)</ref>, koji je uveo koncept socijalnog poduzetništva, socijalni poduzetnici su agenti promjena u društvu. Urbano, Toledano i Soriano (2010) opisuju socijalne poduzetnike, koji zadovoljavaju potrebe društva putem društvene vrijednosti, kao akceleratore promjena. Denizalp (2007) definira socijalne poduzetnike kao osjetljive ljude koji uočavaju probleme u društvu, uporno naglašavaju rješavanje problema putem neisprobanih pristupa i svojim su realnim stavovima zadobili povjerenje društva. Uzimajući u obzir definicije socijalnog poduzetnika, može se reći da je u svima sadržana društvena misija. Abu-Saifan (2012) tvrdi da je osnovni cilj socijalnog poduzetnika ostvariti društvenu misiju.</p><p>Promjene unutar društva izazivaju pojedince na to da postanu osvješteniji o različitim i učestalim potrebama. Heimstra (1976) tvrdi da je cjeloživotno učenje unutarnji proces učenja koji se nastavlja tijekom života pojedinca u skladu s osobnim interesima, potrebama i vještinama <ref type="bibr">(vidi Coşkun i Demirel, 2012)</ref>. Smatra se da je ta definicija cjeloživotnoga učenja povezana s karakteristikama socijalnog poduzetnika, točnije pojedinca koji može primijetiti probleme u društvenom okruženju, koji stvara društvenu vrijednost vlastitim interesima, vještinama i misijom te može prihvatiti inovativne pristupe rješavanju problema. <ref type="bibr">Havolli i Ahmeti (2008)</ref> tvrde da unapređenje poduzetništva zahtjeva motivirane i kreativne pojedince koji kroz obrazovnu kvalifikaciju naginju k rješavanju problema. Stoga se za budućnost društva važnim smatra način na koji socijalni poduzetnici mogu poboljšati svoje vještine cjeloživotnoga učenja. U Uredbi europskoga parlamenta i vijeća (Decree of European <ref type="bibr">Parliament and Council, 2006)</ref> o "cjeloživotnome učenju" važnost davanja podrške za obogaćivanje poduzetničkog duha navodi se među općim ciljevima programa za cjeloživotno učenje. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Balay (2004)</ref> naglašava da su pojedinci sa sposobnošću razumijevanja, interpretiranja i stvaranja informacija pojedinci koji su cjeloživotni učenici. Smatra se da pojedinci, cjeloživotni učenici, mogu iznaći rješenja za društvene potrebe posredstvom inovativnijih vidika.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cjeloživotno učenje</head><p>Brzom izmjenom informacija pojedinci osjećaju potrebu za stalnim učenjem (Coşkun i Demirel, 2012). Internet i moderne tehnologije ubrzano su ušle u svakodnevni život i na taj način također potaknule spomenutu situaciju. Prema Perelmanovu (1992) novom shvaćanju obrazovanja učenje se ne može zatvoriti unutar zidova (vidi Erişti, 2010) i učenje nije ograničeno samo na godine provedene u školi, nego je to cjeloživotni proces <ref type="bibr">(Erişti, 2010, str. 7)</ref>. Sve te razvojne promjene sa sobom su donijele promišljanje da se obrazovanje ne može ograničiti na određeno razdoblje u čovjekovu životu. Prema Organizaciji za ekonomsku suradnju i razvoj -OECD (1999), čovjek se razvija u beskonačnom procesu tijekom života. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kahlert (2000)</ref> definira cjeloživotno učenje kao usvajanje znanja pojedinaca iz nekoliko izvora i prilika za učenjem tijekom života. Pojedinci se moraju i sami razviti kako bi se prilagodili znanstvenim, tehnologijskim i kulturološkim promjenama i zadovoljili vlastite potrebe. Cjeloživotno učenje pokriva nekoliko formalnih i neformalnih oblika obrazovanja i osposobljavanja koja također uključuju obvezne vještine kojima se pojedinci moraju poučiti poput traženja informacija, unapređivanja nađenih informacija, i njihove neovisne i aktivne upotrebe. U Osmome razvojnome planu cjeloživotno se učenje opisuje kao prilagodba boljim životnim standardima, učinkovita upotreba ljudskih potencijala u iskoraku prema globalnom ekonomskom svijetu, transfer i diseminacija informacijskih i komunikacijskih tehnologija za šira područja te kao novi pristup odgoju čovjeka u skladu s potrebama populacije koja posjeduje znanja i vještine koje se mogu koristiti u proizvodnji i uslužnoj djelatnosti. Iz spomenutih definicija cjeloživotnoga učenja uočljiv je naglasak na kontinuiranom razvoju pojedinca.</p><p>Ograničeni prostor ili vrijeme za učenje nije od velike važnosti za cjeloživotnoga učenika. Štoviše, uklonjeno je mišljenje da se obrazovanje može provesti samo s nastavnikom unutar razreda. Pojedinci mogu svoje učenje ostvariti gotovo svugdje, neovisno i uključeno. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cisco (2008)</ref> tvrdi da je promjena paradigme u ovome stoljeću oblikovala ciljeve koje učenici moraju usvojiti kako bi bili uspješni u modernome svijetu. Primjerice, usvajanje niza vještina, dobivanje kvalitetnoga obrazovanja, komunikacija s različitim kulturama i kontinuirano cjeloživotno učenje. S današnjim mobilnim tehnologijama pojedinci, bez sumnje, imaju misiju učenja putem cjeloživotnog učenja. Konačno, učenje se smatra stanjem prilagodbe razvoju i obrnuto <ref type="bibr">(Edwards i Usher, 2008, str. 62)</ref>.</p></div>

Kao prsten u tehnologijskom lancu, Web 2.0 tehnologije definiraju se kao druga generacija Web-tehnologija. Razvoj tehnologije opisan kao akcelerator društvenih promjena omogućuje odgoj generacije s vrlo visokom tendencijom upotrebe tehnologijskih alata. Oni rastu i sazrijevaju s tehnologijom i s njom sve odrađuju <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Tapscott, 2009)</ref>.

Razvoj Web 2.0 promijenio je uloge korisnika. Web 2.0 alati pretvorili su pasivne korisnike u učinkovite pojedince koji stvaraju nove sadržaje i aplikacije u skladu sa svojim potrebama te kako bi postali aktivniji i kreativniji <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Tonta, 2009)</ref>. S obzirom na svoju prirodu Web 2.0 alati imaju karakteristike poput svojstvene strukture, način na koji korisnici stvaraju proizvode ili sadržaje i uporabu moći i zajedništva mase <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Anderson, 2007)</ref>. Web 2.0 alati uključuju blogove, wikije, podcastove, RSS (Rich Site Summary), instant poruke i društvene mreže. Svaki od spomenutih alata koristi se u obrazovanju na različite načine s obzirom na svoje karakteristike. Primjerice, blog i web-stranice koje stvaraju pojedinci ili skupine, uključuje tekst, slike i audiozapise kojima se pojedinci koriste uglavnom da bi se predstavili i iskazali svoje mišljenje, a wikiji omogućuju korisnicima dodavanje, brisanje ili uređivanje sadržaja <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Horzum, 2010)</ref>. Prema tome, moglo bi se reći da blog i wiki mogu biti korisni za iskazivanje mišljenja o nekoj temi. <ref type="bibr">Tavales i Skevoulis (2006)</ref> smatraju da su podcastovi pomoćni alati kojima se pojedinci koriste kako bi samostalno naučili određeni nastavni sadržaj. Stoga pojedinci mogu upotrebljavati podcastove sa svrhom učenja bez vremenskoga i prostornoga ograničenja. Slično tome RSS, instant poruke i društvene mreže imaju karakteristike Web 2.0 alata. Takvi alati omogućuju pojedincima samostalno učenje. Pojedinac neovisno može pristupiti potrebnim informacijama. Web-stranice za rasprave koje kreiraju zajednice sa zajedničkim interesom ili temom daju poduzetnicima mogućnost da "ugrabe" priliku ili im ponude rješenja za problem putem interakcije s pojedincima ili grupama sa sličnim mišljenjima <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Maltby, 2012)</ref>. Pojedinci mogu iskazati vlastite poduzetničke sadržaje i trendove cjeloživotnoga učenja koristeći se Web 2.0 alatima, a ti alati imaju svojstvene strukture, moć udruživanja i poticanja pojedinaca da osvijeste probleme iz različitih perspektiva. Smatra se da pojedinci koji se koriste Web 2.0 alatima i time pristupaju informaciji, stvaraju informaciju i imaju iskustvo društvenog okruženja, imaju bolji trend cjeloživotnoga učenja i vještine socijalnog poduzetništva.</p><p>Smatra se da pojedinci mogu preuzeti učinkovite uloge u rješavanju problema na način da se sastanu s članovima i skupinama s kojima su putem društvenih medija u interakciji. Web-tehnologije imaju nedvojbenu moć omogućavanja pristupa informacijama kako bi se riješili problemi na koje pojedinci nailaze u društvu. Smatra se važnim da pojedinci riješe problem na način da imaju valjanu informaciju koja je u skladu s njihovim potrebama. Ipak, nije svaki izvještaj ili svaki prikaz na društvenim mrežama istinit. Postoje mnogi profili ili prikazi na društvenim mrežama koji su lažni. Stoga je potrebno osvijestiti pojedince o važnosti pismenosti i vještine digitalne pismenosti ne bi li se prepoznala kvaliteta podijeljenih izvještaja i povećala pouzdanost društvene mreže.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Digitalna pismenost</head><p>Digitalna pismenost podrazumijeva odgovarajuću upotrebu različitih tehnologija i sposobnost pristupa, stvaranja i dijeljenja sadržaja, kao i upotrebu tehnologije u procesu učenja i poučavanja (Hamutoglu, Canan-Güngören, Kaya-Uyanık, i Gür-Erdoğan, 2016). Nekoliko web-tehnologija poput tražilica, društvenih mreža, webstranica s vijestima, blogova, wikija itd. može se koristiti s tom svrhom. Međutim, svi dijelovi informacije dobiveni putem te web-tehnologije ne mogu biti točni i pouzdani. Informacija dobivena iz nepouzdanog izvora može zavesti socijalnog poduzetnika. Očekuje se da socijalni poduzetnik koji je u interakciji s članovima i grupama različitih interesa ima razvijenu digitalnu pismenost.

Pojedinci s visokim stupnjem digitalne pismenosti razlikuju se od ostalih s obzirom na rješavanje problema s kojima se suočavaju i s obzirom na način na koji se izražavaju. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Tornero (2004)</ref> izvješćuje da digitalna pismenost poboljšava kreativnost učenika i omogućuje im da se bolje izraze. Kreativnost je važna za socijalne poduzetnike prilikom rješavanja problema iz drukčijih perspektiva. Nadalje, upotreba Web 2.0 alata zahtijeva poboljšane vještine digitalne pismenosti. S obzirom na to, digitalna pismenost definira se kao pristup točnoj informaciji upotrebom različitih tehnologija <ref type="bibr">(Çubukçu i Bayzan, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>

Skala se naslanja na Likertovu skalu od 5 stupnjeva i sadrži 21 česticu s tri glavne podskale, samopouzdanje, osobna kreativnost (6 čestica) i preuzimanje rizika (7 čestica). Podskalu samopouzdanje čini osam čestica, npr.: "Lako se mogu sprijateljiti i biti u novome okruženju." Podskala osobna kreativnost sastojala se od šest čestica poput: "Prije nego što započnem posao, promislim postoje li drukčiji načini na koje ovaj posao mogu napraviti.". Na kraju podskala preuzimanje rizika čini sedam čestica poput: "Meni je uzbudljivo upustiti se u težak posao.". Dok je Cronbach Alpha koeficijent pouzdanosti za ukupan rezultat skale bio 0,85, pouzdanost za podskale samopouzdanje, osobna kreativnost i preuzimanje odgovornosti bili su 0,77, 0,70, i 0,72 pojedinačno.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rasprava i zaključak</head><p>Socijalno je poduzetništvo koncept koji u posljednje vrijeme dobiva na važnosti.

U tom je kontekstu ovo istraživanje pokušalo istražiti postoji li poveznica između trendova cjeloživotnoga učenja, razine digitalne pismenosti, učestalosti upotrebe Web 2.0 alata i karakteristika socijalnoga poduzetništva. S tom svrhom prikazane su srednje vrijednosti, vrijednosti standardne devijacije varijable i povezanost među njima u korelacijskim analizama. Istraživanje je provedeno primjenom deskriptivnog, presječnog modela ankete. Nadalje, dva različita modela uspoređena su i testirana koristeći se strukturalnim modeliranjem (SEM). S obzirom na srednje vrijednost i vrijednosti standardne devijacije za socijalno poduzetništvo, cjeloživotno učenje, digitalnu pismenost i učestalost upotrebe Web 2.0 alata srednje su vrijednosti jednake ili više od medijana. S obzirom na srednje vrijednosti zaključujemo da su ispitanici socijalni poduzetnici, skloni cjeloživotnome učenju, kompetentni s obzirom na digitalnu pismenost i da srednje često upotrebljavaju Web 2.0 alate.</p><p>Pearsonov koeficijent korelacije ispitao je povezanost među varijablama, a analiza je pokazala da socijalno poduzetništvo ima umjerenu pozitivnu korelaciju s cjeloživotnim učenjem i digitalnom pismenošću, a slabu pozitivnu korelaciju s učestalošću upotrebe Web 2.0 alata. Nadalje, cjeloživotno učenje ima umjerenu pozitivnu korelaciju s digitalnom pismenošću i slabu pozitivnu korelaciju s učestalošću upotrebe Web 2.0 alata. Slaba pozitivna korelacija uočena je između digitalne pismenosti i učestalosti upotrebe Web 2.0 alata. S obzirom na činjenicu da su sve povezanosti bile značajne u korelacijskoj analizi, strukturalno modeliranje primijenjeno je među varijablama. Indeksi prikladnosti modela provjereni su i oba modela imaju dobru prikladnost. Uspoređena su dva modela koja imaju dobru prikladnost.

Ostvarenje aspekata socijalnog poduzetništva nalaže stalan proces učenja. Cjeloživotno učenje uključuje implicitno i eksplicitno znanje, a pojedinci svoje vještine i iskustva uključuju u praksu i time imaju ključnu ulogu u realizaciji cjeloživotnoga učenja.

Taj koncept pokriva i novi oblik učenja koji nazivamo digitalno učenje (Sefton-Green i Erstad, 2013). Shodno tome, digitalna pismenost nudi i sadržaj i pristup. S digitalnim dobom i digitalnom pismenošću koncept poduzetništva također se počeo mijenjati.

Web 2.0, odnosno druga generacija web-tehnologija, omogućila je pojedincima da se istaknu i usvoje različita znanja, vještine i stavove. U tom smislu Web 2.0 je omogućio daljnji razvoj digitalne pismenosti i vještina cjeloživotnoga učenja. S obzirom na to da je Web 2.0 jedna od neophodnih tehnologija današnjice, digitalna pismenost i vještine cjeloživotnoga učenja također su ključne vještine današnjice. Web 2.0 alati koriste se u više razina obrazovanja, a postoje i sadržaji koji omogućuju učenje vještina digitalne pismenosti i cjeloživotnog učenja. Istraživanja su pokazala da upotreba Web 2.0 alata u obrazovanju poboljšava razine vještina suradnje <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Khalid, 2010)</ref>, motivacije <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adrian, 1998)</ref>, učenja i postignuća učenika <ref type="bibr">(Hew i Cheung, 2013)</ref>, informacijske pismenosti <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ata, 2011)</ref>, digitalne pismenosti (Hamutoglu, Canan Güngören, Gür-Erdoğan i Kaya Uyanık, 2017; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ng, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Williams i Chinn, 2009)</ref> i vještina cjeloživotnoga učenja <ref type="bibr">(Scalater, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Torres Kompen, Edirisingha i Mobbs, 2008)</ref>. Prema rezultatima istraživanja Web 2.0 alati imaju učinak na digitalnu pismenost i vještine cjeloživotnoga učenja, a digitalna pismenost i vještine cjeloživotnoga učenja imaju učinak na socijalno poduzetništvo, što je rezultat koji se podudara s istraživanjima u literaturi.</p><p>S obzirom na izravne učinke trenda cjeloživotnog učenja i vještina digitalne pismenosti na povećanje vještina socijalnog poduzetništva kod budućih učitelja, u svjetlu dobivenih rezultata predlaže se da programi u kontekstu cjeloživotnog učenja i digitalne pismenosti prate obrazovnu politiku. Smatra se da bi ti dodaci poboljšali spomenute vještine. Nadalje, drugi rezultat istraživanja također implicira da učestalost upotrebe Web 2.0 alata neizravno utječe na socijalno poduzetništvo. Tim pokazateljem učestala upotreba Web 2.0 alata u obrazovnim programima za studente povećat će trendove cjeloživotnoga učenja, digitalne pismenosti i neizravno doprinijeti vještinama socijalnog poduzetništva.</p><p>Eksperimentalno istraživanje može se planirati s varijablama cjeloživotno učenje, digitalna pismenost i učestalost upotrebe Web 2.0 alata, što utječe na socijalno poduzetništvo kako bi se podržali i generalizirali rezultati dobiveni u ovome istraživanju. Stoga je moguće uočiti interakciju tih varijabli na pojedince. Za buduća istraživanja preporuča se provedba na drugom uzorku ispitanika.</p><p>Na kraju je zaključeno da trendovi cjeloživotnoga učenja, razine digitalne pismenosti i učestalost upotrebe Web 2.0 alata imaju izravan i neizravan utjecaj na socijalno poduzetništvo. Ističući varijable koje imaju učinak na socijalno poduzetništvo kao važan koncept današnjega vremena, druge karakteristike koje bi trebalo uzeti u obzir za razvoj pojedinca -socijalnog poduzetnika također su određene. Cjeloživotno učenje, digitalna pismenost i učestalost upotrebe Web 2.0 alata varijable su učinka u ovome istraživanju. Dobivene su i druge bitne varijable koje dobivaju na važnosti, utječu na socijalno poduzetništvo i mogu se koristiti u budućim istraživanjima i tako proširivati model istraživanja.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
