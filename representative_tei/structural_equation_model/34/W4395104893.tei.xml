<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Higher education institutions had to deploy E-learning for all their students during the year 2020 in Chile, shifting from face-to-face to distance education. This change needed the adaptation of students to uncertain scenarios and affected the online system's outcomes. For example, there were issues with the internet connection, students got distracted easily, and they tend to turn off cameras so often they are losing face-to-face contact, and teachers were unfamiliar with the technology due to their age. This research explores the effects of online learning based on both technology acceptance and success models within this context. We conducted an online survey in engineering students belonging to Chilean universities, using five variables: information quality, system quality, user satisfaction, behaviour intention, and actual use of e-learning. The study used the partial least squares path modelling technique to analyse the measurement and structural model. We conclude that the quality dimension had a more significant impact on user satisfaction. Also, this satisfaction is an indirect antecedent of the use of e-learning systems. These findings show the importance of the system's characteristics in the final acceptance of the e-learning system by Chilean university students in the context of a pandemic.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The Chilean higher education system had to switch from face-to-face to online mode during 2020. Chilean universities needed to prioritise learning flexibility and be creative and inclusive due to the health emergency of COVID-19. In Chile, decisions were made to allocate resources and services to promote E-learning. The communication between the student and the teacher was expected to decrease concerning face-to-face mode, and it was not clear whether Elearning was influential in the development of student's abilities.</p><p>As a learning process, Chilean universities carried out contingency plans to engage students through the Internet and conducted E-learning in synchronous and asynchronous modes. Electronic equipment was offered to students who lacked the requisite resources for virtual classrooms, allowing distance education to be fully accessible. Synchronously, the student and the teacher interacted with each other at the same time in videoconferencing meetings. Because most of the evaluations were done asynchronously utilising text analysis or group work, class attendance was not a reason for failing a course or a requirement for taking a final exam.</p><p>The educational development units at the universities enforced actions to provide tools and more information to teachers and students. Teachers delivered their study material to their students via the E-learning system and email and were trained to facilitate the use of the distance education system. They were compelled to do it as they have foreseen that the E-learning modality is going to remain in time. During video conferencing, the tendency among students was to turn off cameras, so face-to-face contact was lost. Some teachers did not have the minimum conditions to apply E-learning, such as a stable internet connection, and others were not very friendly with technology because of age.</p><p>Thus, despite the potential of E-learning, the skills that students will develop may be harmed, raising doubts about the value of E-learning in the Chilean higher education system. The analysis of various aspects that influence the efficiency of E-learning is complicated. Some actions could have been in conflict with the necessary E-learning settings according to the perception of students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Objectives</head><p>This paper explores the effects of online learning based on both technology acceptance and success models within a pandemic context in Chile. We propose a model in conformity with the information gathered from the literature review. The measurement and structural model is evaluated using the technique of partial least squares path modelling (PLS-PM) in engineering students at three universities in Chile. We discuss the findings and insights from the analysis of the acceptance of E-learning into students' experiences, with a focus on strategies related to system characteristics in the Chilean higher education system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Review</head><p>The acceptance and use of the features of E-learning and the continued use and success of the system are problematic in these uncertain times for higher education institutions. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Davis (1989)</ref> and is based on the TRA model <ref type="bibr">(Fishbein and Ajzen, 1980)</ref>. TAM model explains the use of Information Technology (IT) by modelling how users accept and use a technological tool. It seeks to predict the behaviour of these users based on their attitudes and intentions. The TAM model relates convictions, attitude, intention and behaviour to indicate IT acceptance:</p><p>• Perceived usefulness (PU) refers to the degree to which a person believes that, by using a particular IT system, they will improve their job performance; • Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) indicates the degree to which a person believes that using a particular IT system will expend less effort to perform their tasks. • Attitude toward use (AU), which is the positive or negative feeling regarding the performance of a behaviour (e.g., using an IT system); • Behaviour intention (BI) is the degree to which a person has formulated prearranged plans to engage in some future behaviour.</p><p>The main characteristics of the TAM model have perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which represent the certainties that lead to the acceptance of the technology. They are directly affected by external variables and affect AU, which directly affects behaviour intention, leading to the latter being directly affected by perceived usefulness and indirectly by perceived ease of use. Perceived ease of use has a causal effect on perceived usefulness, and all the variables mentioned have a significant impact on the user concerning the use of the system.</p><p>The D&amp;M model has proven to be useful for analysing information system success, with several empirical studies confirming the theory's validity <ref type="bibr">(Stacie Petter, DeLone, &amp; McLean, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stacie Petter &amp; McLean, 2009)</ref>. This model has also been used in E-learning research (G. <ref type="bibr">Cheng, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cheng, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Freeze et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ramírez-Correa et al., 2015)</ref>. It consists of six interrelated dimensions: system quality, information quality, service quality, usage, behaviour intention, and net benefits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Research framework</head><p>According to their significant relationships with behaviour intention, the research framework integrates TAM and Delone&amp;McLean models (See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). However, the proposed model does not include the quality of service. Some studies have presented problems incorporating the quality of service <ref type="bibr">(Stacie Petter &amp; McLean, 2009)</ref>, as students are often unable to understand who supports the platform's technical issues of the E-learning system <ref type="bibr">(Freeze et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lee &amp; Sidhu, 2015)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Delone &amp; McLean Components</head><p>System Quality (SQ) determines how the system's characteristics influence the users' perspective on the information system. It refers to the reliability, convenience, simplicity of use, functionality, and other system metrics.</p><p>Improvements in the SQ have also been linked to increased system user satisfaction (US). In the D&amp;M model, US is defined as the approbation or likeability of the system and its output. Information Quality (IQ) refers to the features of the result supplied by the information system, such as accuracy, timeliness, and completeness metrics. The behaviour intention (BI) increases as user happiness rises. This is often assessed in terms of organisational effectiveness, perceived utility, and impact on work practices <ref type="bibr">(DeLone &amp; McLean, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">DeLone &amp; McLean, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>According to this idea, hypothesis 4 is presented:</p><p>H4: US positive effects the BI in E-learning systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">TAM Components</head><p>Behaviour Intention refers to how a person has formulated prearranged plans to engage in some future behaviour. The system (USE) usage is defined as its output described in current or self-reported usage. The increase in BI leads to a greater USE, as the E-learning system is used more frequently <ref type="bibr">(DeLone &amp; McLean, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">DeLone &amp; McLean, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Based on these findings, we propose the following hypothesis:</p><p>H5: BI positive effects USE in E-learning systems.</p><p>We applied a pre-questionnaire to 16 students and nine teachers to identify and select a subset of items proven to work from previous studies of individual acceptance and success of E-learning. Two judges coded the responses to items observed for each factor of the research model. As a result (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), three items on SQ, two on IQ, one on BI, one on USE were used from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Salloum et al. (2019)</ref>. In addition, two US items were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Abu-Dalbouh et al. (2013)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Measure items Component Item System Quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Salloum et al., 2019)</ref>. SQ1: I consider the interaction of the E-learning system to be satisfactory.

In USE, the options were: never, rarely, sometimes, very often, and always.</p><p>The research model was evaluated to estimate causal relationships from statistical data and qualitative assumptions using PLS-PM, a multivariate statistical technique. The great advantage of this type of model is that it allows proposing the style and direction of the relationships expected to be found between the various variables contained in it, and then go on to estimate the parameters specified by the relationships proposed at the theoretical level. For this reason, they are also called confirmatory models, since the fundamental interest is to "confirm" by means of the analysis of the sample the relationships proposed on the basis of the explanatory theory that it has been decided to use as a reference.</p><p>The theoretical specification of the model makes it possible to propose causal relationships between variables so that some variables cause an effect on other variables, which, in turn, can transfer these effects to other variables, creating concatenations of variables. There are two types of structural equation models: Path analysis, involving only observable variables, and confirmatory factor analysis, involving latent and observable variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data Collection</head><p>An online survey was applied from March 10 to March 26, 2021. Responses were collected among students from the University of Playa Ancha (Valparaíso and San Felipe campuses), the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso, Technical University Federico Santa María, and University of Valparaiso. The survey link was sent via email.</p><p>In this study, 104 valid responses were obtained from volunteer students (N = 104). The participating students were from undergraduate and graduate courses, with degrees in environmental, construction, industrial, computer, transportation engineering, and international business (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Numerical Results</head><p>The estimated model was tested using Partial Least Squares Path Modelling (PLS-PM), a variance-based structural equation modelling technique. Firstly, there is an evaluation of the measurement model. The measurement model allows us to evaluate whether the theoretical concepts or constructions are properly measured through the observed elements. Secondly, the structural model is reviewed. The extent and significance of the causal relationships between the different variables are evaluated based on this model.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> illustrates the quality of the model adjustment measures. The standardised root means square residual (SRMR) is using to detection of model misspecification. A cut-off of 0.10, or more conservatively 0.08, is considered a good fit. For the estimated model, the SRMR is 0.088, which shows that the model specification is within the acceptable thresholds. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">5</ref> presents the coefficients of composite reliability and average variance extracted (AVE) for all model variables. The internal consistency of the measurement scales is observed in the composite reliability coefficient, these are higher than 0.7, and therefore, we can affirm that the items measure the variables in a convergent way. AVE coefficient represents the proportion of construction variance that its indicators can account for. It is checked that this coefficient is more significant than 0.5 for all variables; we can therefore assert that there is a converging validity for each of the latent variables. The discriminatory validity between the constructions was evaluated using the Fornell-Lacker criterion; the Heterotrait-Monotrait test confirmed this result. Each construction measures different aspects.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Graphical Results</head><p>The estimated model shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> was tested using PLS-PM. The nomological network of the figure shows how satisfaction is explained and, in turn, this explains the intent-mediated use. In particular, the analysis results show that the variable use is explained by Behaviour Intention (R-Square = .28), and in turn, Behaviour Intention is determined by User Satisfaction (R-Square = .31). On the other hand, the variable System Quality determines Information Quality (R-Square = .34), and these two explained User Satisfaction (R-Square = .53). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Proposed Improvements</head><p>The findings of the structural model show that improving the quality of the system has a significant impact on the use of the electronic education system. Accordingly, we propose investment in robust technology platforms. More precisely, the total effect of the system's quality on the intention to use is 0.715; thus, each point of improvement in the system impacts almost 3/4 points on the intention of use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Validation</head><p>Regards validate the importance of both path coefficients and determination coefficients, a bootstrapping procedure with 5,000 subsamples was used to generate t-statistics and the confidence intervals. The results of the process validate the findings, as seen in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> and<ref type="table">7</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>This research explored the effects of e-learning on technology uptake and success models in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. We conclude that the quality dimension has had a more significant influence on user satisfaction. Furthermore, this satisfaction constitutes an indirect precedent for the use of e-learning systems. These findings demonstrate the importance of system characteristics in the ultimate acceptance of the e-learning system by Chilean university students in the context of a pandemic.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Research model</figDesc><graphic coords="3,157.23,72.00,297.38,68.30" type="bitmap" /></figure>
