<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper examined the innovation process in the Australian Public Service (APS) using a Bayesian network (BN) founded on an empirically derived structural equation model.</p><p>The focus of the BN was to examine the impact of leadership style and organisational culture on workplace innovation and career satisfaction in the APS. Using scenario analysis, the best combination of managerial actions for enhancing APS career satisfaction was determined. The results emphasise the benefit of encouraging management to adopt a transformational leadership style and instilling innovative culture in their organisation. In addition, innovative culture was a key driver of workplace innovation, which served to improve the career satisfaction of APS employees.</p><p>Implications are discussed to propose practical strategies for organisations wish to encourage innovation among employees.</p></div>

There is little financial reward for being innovative since public sector agencies are funded by legislative appropriations while public servants are paid with fixed salaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Borins, 2006)</ref>. Instead, innovation in the public sector is constrained both externally and internally. Externally, public sector agencies are often monopolists <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Borins, 2002)</ref>. The lack of competition impedes the pursuit of labour efficiency and also diminishes the incentives for innovation in the public sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Mulgan &amp; Albury, 2003)</ref>. In addition, the media and opposing parties are often keen to expose the public sector failures of the incumbent party including unsuccessful innovation projects, which could potentially damage the careers of the public servants involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Borins, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Internally, public organisations are usually large bureaucracies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Borins, 2002)</ref> in which rules and regulations stifle the capacity of government employees to initiate and implement creative and innovative ideas. Due to the inherent proclivity in public organisations toward legal requirements, adhering to rules and regulations is often considered paramount by leaders, rather than initiating innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Golembiewski &amp; Vigoda, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Nusair, Ababneh, &amp; Bae, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Another challenge is that public sector organisations generally have bureaucratic structures, which hinder the ability of employees to initiate and implement innovative ideas. Approval processes in the public sector can be embedded and burdensome, which restrains innovation in organisations. These challenges are forcing public organisations to implement a new style of leadership that encourages and fosters innovation, and to create organisational cultures which enhance employee creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(McAdam, Moffett, Hazlett, &amp; Shevlin, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Nusair et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Scholars have long considered the relationship between organisational attributes and an organisation's propensity to innovate <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Damanpour &amp; Schneider, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Demircioglu &amp; Audretsch, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Fernandez &amp; Moldogaziev, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kim &amp; Chang, 2009)</ref>. This perspective is important because organisational attributes provide practical implications that can be applied to improve innovation in public sectors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kim and Chang (2009)</ref> conducted a survey to evaluate the capacity for innovation in 46 departments in the Korean central government. The results showed that leadership style, learning culture, performance-based rewards, and information and knowledge sharing appeared to raise innovation capability in governmental agencies. A study of innovation adoption in local governments in the United States by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Damanpour and Schneider (2009)</ref> revealed that both leader characteristics and innovation characteristics influenced the adoption of innovation. Leaders with a pro-innovation attitude were found to positively affect innovation adoption because they tended to allocate resources and motivate employees toward the adoption of complicated innovations. Based on their study of the US Federal Government, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Fernandez and Moldogaziev (2013)</ref> found that instilling an empowerment culture within employees improved organisational performance by creating a workplace environment which facilitated innovative behaviour, such as finding innovative ways to correct errors in service delivery and redesigning work processes. A study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Demircioglu and Audretsch (2017)</ref> focused on the likelihood of innovative activity in the Australian Public Service. The authors asserted that intrinsic factors such as experimentation and motivation to improve performance were crucial in achieving innovation in the public sector context.</p><p>These studies have critically contributed to the literature concerning the factors affecting innovation in public sectors. However, there is a lack of research into the cause-and-effect relationships between these variables and innovation outcomes. The majority of studies treat organisational attributes independently, ignoring the possible combined effects (De Vries, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Bekkers, &amp; Tummers, 2016)</ref>. In addition, most of existing empirical studies on public sector innovation were qualitative in nature, using a case-study approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(De Vries et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, more empirical research with quantitative evidence is necessary to increase theoretical and practical understanding of how innovation outcomes can be enhanced. The aim of this paper is to address this research gap. Next, there is a description of the research model, based on a literature review of the relevant constructs and factors, and an empirical model that shows the relationships between the constructs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Literature review</head><p>As discussed in recent reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson, Potočnik, &amp; Zhou, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Zhou &amp; Hoever, 2014)</ref>, many influences on individual, team and organisational innovation have been studied. These works assume that innovation is itself a valuable outcome because it provides organisations with a competitive advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amabile, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Damanpour &amp; Wischnevsky, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, most studies focus on the antecedents of innovation rather than its consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kim, Hon, &amp; Crant, 2009)</ref>. There are very few studies addressing the impact of innovation beyond economic performance of the firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Glor, 2014)</ref>. This paper argues that career satisfaction is an important outcome of innovation. Career satisfaction is a more enduring attitude than job satisfaction and it includes reactions to the work itself and to anticipated benefits for one's career beyond the current job <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Heslin, 2005)</ref>. Career satisfaction is the sense that one is doing well in one's career <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Ng, Eby, Sorensen, &amp; Feldman, 2005)</ref>. Employees with higher career satisfaction are more likely to remain at organisations where they are employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Joo &amp; Park, 2010)</ref> and to experience a sense of purpose and worklife balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Heslin, 2005)</ref>. This is important in both private and public sector organisations where high rates of attrition might be due to disinterest or disengagement in the job <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Sullivan &amp; Baruch, 2009)</ref>. In the current study, career satisfaction was operationalised as work meaningfulness and reward and recognition for one's work.</p><p>Workplace innovation is a combination of individual and team practices that result in new and improved ways of doing things in a workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Totterdill &amp; Exton, 2014)</ref>. As well as the benefits to the organisation, such innovation can influence career satisfaction for employees <ref type="bibr">(Kim et al., 2009)</ref>. This study operationalised workplace innovation as individual creativity and team innovation.</p><p>The literature suggests that two main antecedents to workplace innovation are the organisation's culture and its leadership (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chan, Liu, &amp; Fellows, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">McMurray, Islam, Sarros, &amp; Pirola-Merlo, 2013)</ref>. With regard to culture, it is proposed that an ambidextrous culture for innovation is an antecedent to both workplace innovation and career satisfaction.</p><p>The concept of an ambidextrous culture for innovation is based on Ambidexterity Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bledow, Frese, Anderson, Erez, &amp; Farr, 2009)</ref>. The theory predicts that innovation will occur in organisations that successfully manage competing demands (since new systems or processes are needed to deal with the conflicting demands). In particular, an organisation may have to balance how many resources it devotes to exploring new ideas and how many resources it uses in exploiting those ideas in the production of new goods or services <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Benner &amp; Tushman, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>In the current study, the ambidextrous culture for innovation was operationalised as an innovative culture and a performance-oriented culture.</p><p>Leadership is known to have strong influences on workplace innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Damanpour &amp; Schneider, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Yang &amp; Kassekert, 2010)</ref> as well as the culture of an organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Gumusluoglu &amp; Ilsev, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kissi, Dainty, &amp; Liu, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Yukl, 2006)</ref>. Thus, for this study, leadership for innovation was operationalised by transformational leadership and consideration leadership.</p><p>Transformational leadership motivates employees, creates the organisational conditions for innovation, and leads to competitive advantages for the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Chen, Lin, Lin, &amp; McDonough, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wipulanusat, Panuwatwanich, &amp; Stewart, 2017a)</ref>. In particular, the intellectual stimulation characteristic of transformational leadership has a strong influence on innovation, because this encourages using the exploratory thinking style to approach problems from different perspectives and come up with novel solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bass &amp; Bass, 2009)</ref>. In addition, employees are not criticised for their ideas, no matter how far-fetched, nor how different they might be to the leader's own ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006)</ref>. Consideration leadership, first described in the Ohio State studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Stogdill, 1950)</ref>, is a leadership dimension where leaders show care and concern for their employees and express appreciation and support for them. Consideration leadership also empowers employees and thus, they are encouraged to be more innovative <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(De Jong &amp; Den Hartog, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">An empirical model for the innovation process</head><p>The authors recently conducted a study that employed structural equation modelling (SEM) using data from a survey of 3,125 engineering professionals in the Australian Public Service (APS). Comprehensive details of the development and assessment of the model can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Wipulanusat, Panuwatwanich, and Stewart (2018)</ref>. In brief, the extant literature supports a model in which leadership for innovation influences workplace innovation directly and also, indirectly, through ambidextrous culture for innovation.

Ambidextrous culture for innovation shows a moderate and positive effect on workplace innovation (0.32, p &lt; 0.001). The path coefficient from workplace innovation to career satisfaction has a moderate and positive influence (0.29, p &lt; 0.001). Lastly, there is a significant relationship from ambidextrous culture for innovation to career satisfaction, represented by the strong and positive standardized coefficient (0.66, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Overall, the model provides meaningful connections among the climate for innovation constructs (i.e. leadership for innovation and ambidextrous culture for innovation) that can be implemented strategically to increase workplace innovation and, in turn, strengthen career satisfaction. The model could be implemented to help resolve the current shortage of engineering professionals in government departments. The findings highlight the importance of providing engineers with sufficient opportunities to engage in creative and innovative projects to develop their professional careers.</p><p>However, a limitation of the model was that the factors were considered as indicators representing latent constructs, which only provided an abstract causal explanation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Anderson &amp; Vastag, 2004)</ref>. Therefore, only the relationships among the broad organisational perspectives (model constructs) were depicted in this model, thereby providing only an overarching understanding of the priority of the specific activities (model factors). That is, the model cannot indicate which strategies require the highest priority for change and development in order to accomplish organisational outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Panuwatwanich, Stewart, &amp; Mohamed, 2009)</ref>. To address this limitation, a Bayesian network (BN) analysis was conducted to enhance the explanatory power of the SEM in order to examine the causality within the empirical model. The BN can be employed as a decision-making tool to facilitate innovation in the APS. Therefore, BN increased the model's explanatory capability by analysing the variables at the factor level to reveal the pathways to desired outcomes, and explain the priority and relationships among the factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Bayesian network</head><p>Using probability theory, the BN generates a causal map which is applied for knowledge representation and reasoning under uncertainty. BN is implemented to conduct statistical inference from evidence acquired from observed events, when there is also a requirement to forecast additional events yet to be observed. BN is implemented to conduct statistical inference from evidence acquired from observed events, when there is also a requirement to forecast additional events yet to be observed. In this study, BN was applied to provide a visual assessment for a decision-support framework for problems involving uncertainty, complexity, and probabilistic reasoning which was used to evaluate various scenarios and/or the impact of possible decisions. The mathematical model applied in BN relies on Bayes' theorem of probability theory which can be conveyed as hypotheses and evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Niedermayer, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Bayes' theorem, which describes how prior knowledge about hypothesis 𝐻 is updated by observed evidence 𝐸, is shown in Eq. 1.</p><p>𝑃(𝐻/𝐸) = 𝑃(𝐸/𝐻)•𝑃(𝐻) 𝑃(𝐸)</p><p>(1) By using BN, the belief in hypothesis 𝐻 can be updated given the additional evidence 𝐸. Where 𝑃(𝐻/𝐸) is called the posterior probability, which is the probability that hypothesis 𝐻 is in a particular state, after considering the effect of the evidence provided; 𝑃(𝐸/𝐻) is called the conditional probability, which is the likelihood of the evidence, given the hypothesis to be tested; 𝑃(𝐻) is called the prior probability of the hypothesis, which is the likelihood that hypothesis 𝐻 will be in a particular state, prior to consideration of any evidence; 𝑃(𝐸) is independent of hypothesis 𝐻 and can be regarded as a normalising or scaling factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kragt, 2009)</ref>. Bayes' theorem is useful in practice to estimate unknown 𝑃(𝐻/𝐸) from three probability terms 𝑃(𝐸/𝐻), 𝑃(𝐻), and 𝑃(𝐸).</p><p>BN is an effective modelling tool because it allows both inferences and sensitivity analysis, as well as visualisation and quantification of the propagation of effects between variables (de Oliveira, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Possamai, Dalla Valentina, &amp; Flesch, 2012)</ref>. BN is a methodology comprising of quantitative and qualitative elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Sharma &amp; Chanda, 2017)</ref>. The qualitative approach involves structural learning, which produces graphical representation of the independence among variables and illustrates statistical dependencies through directed acyclic graphs (DAG). This approach conceptualises the topology of the BN using connected nodes which depict important domain variables, and arrows that represent the causal relation. The quantitative approach provides parameter learning and domain knowledge using the degree of dependency represented in probabilistic terms. This is achieved by coding the conditional independencies between variables and integrating their joint distribution. A set of conditional probability tables (CPT) designate the probability distribution. Each node, treated as random variables, has a CPT that stipulates the quantitative probability information. When a variable has no parent node, it is represented by a marginal probability distribution. The outcome is illustrated by the probability value of each child node in the CPT, where every possible combination of values of its parent nodes is considered to be the cause of an event <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(de Oliveira et al., 2012)</ref>. The results can then be used to conduct a sensitivity analysis where the differences among these conditional and marginal probabilities are examined to determine which nodes have the maximum impact on target variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cardenas, Voordijk, &amp; Dewulf, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>BN also provides an inference engine to make reasonable interpretations of the model parameters. It has two applications: prediction and diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Sharma &amp; Chanda, 2017)</ref>. It is an effective method to predict the efficiency of different strategies and to evaluate the impact of various scenarios and potential strategic actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mohammadfam, Ghasemi, Kalatpour, &amp; Moghimbeigi, 2017)</ref>. In terms of diagnosis, the reasoning is determined by identifying causes from a set of observations to establish the most likely strategies from target variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Ülengin, Önsel, Aktas, Kabak, &amp; Özaydın, 2014)</ref>. Therefore, BN can be applied to support managerial decisions when determining the interactions between various strategies and target variables.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Linking SEM to BN</head><p>This study applied an integrated approach by linking SEM to BN. While both approaches are very useful for quantitative analysis, both methods have certain limitations that need to be considered. Because latent constructs are the causes of their indicators (observed variables), SEM can only predict statistical results at the hypothetical level of latent constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anderson, Mackoy, Thompson, &amp; Harrell, 2004)</ref>. Moreover, SEM is not appropriate to effectively reveal the causal relationships between all latent constructs and indicators and thus, can only explain established theoretical relationships of constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Ekici &amp; Ekici, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Gupta &amp; Kim, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Observable consequences from potential managerial action cannot be predicted using SEM, therefore it has no causality inference capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Anderson &amp; Vastag, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hahn, Lee, &amp; Jo, 2015)</ref>. It is limited in its support of scenario analysis for managerial decisions. Thus, the primary weakness of SEM is its inability to convert knowledge from the theoretical model into managerial actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Anderson &amp; Vastag, 2004)</ref>. For BN, it also has some limitations that restrict its performance for theoretical construction because DAG development relies on expert judgement, which is only as accurate as the reliability of the expert's background knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Boehmke, Johnson, White, Weir, &amp; Gallagher, 2016)</ref>. BN can only provide theoretical explanations which are not as reliable as an empirical validation by SEM <ref type="bibr">(Anderson et al., 2004)</ref>. BN develops relationships based on conditional independence, and thus, cannot discern between causal and spurious relationships since determining the causal relationships is not possible when using only statistical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Pearl, 1998)</ref>. These limitations of SEM and BN can be addressed by applying a theoretically based and empirically validated model from SEM to develop BN at the factor level. By applying the integrated approach, this study identifies causal relationships among factors that affect workplace innovation and career satisfaction, and then conducts scenario analysis to further identify specific managerial actions that can be implemented to improve career satisfaction. Conditional independence, which implies there is no direct causal relationship, is significant to make inferences because it establishes the relevance of the data on one node in relation to another <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Anderson &amp; Vastag, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">de Oliveira et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Causal modelling</head><p>The DAG was constructed based on an empirically validated model that was developed using SEM. The process of developing the DAG followed the approaches used in studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Gupta and Kim (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Panuwatwanich et al. (2009)</ref>. The DAG development began by analysing the chronological sequence of the constructs. The framework followed the empirical model</p><p>shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The framework illustrates the sequence of constructs where leadership for innovation directly affects the culture for innovation and workplace innovation. Culture for innovation directly impacts workplace innovation and career satisfaction. Therefore, the output from climate for innovation consists of workplace innovation and career satisfaction.</p><p>In the DAG, all causal relationships of factors within each construct are incorporated in the causal map. The reasoning of which causal factors precede the effect factors, can be used to establish the between-constructs relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cardenas et al., 2017)</ref>. The between-construct structures confirmed the strong and statistically significant relationships. For example, leadership for innovation has a positive influence on ambidextrous culture for innovation (0.64, p &lt; 0.001) and workplace innovation (0.64, p &lt; 0.001). The factors within the associated constructs were firstly separated and then connected to the factors determined by the betweenconstruct relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Anderson &amp; Vastag, 2004)</ref>. Because the two factors extracted to characterise leadership for innovation included transformational leadership and consideration leadership, there was no causal relationship between these two factors within this construct.</p><p>Transformational leadership and consideration leadership were found to be direct causes of  is required to quantify the conditional probability table (CPT). This step involves the quantitative part of the BN which calculates the conditional probabilities of nodes. This is useful because it determines the exact relationships among factors. This means the probability of various states of a node is conditional on the different configurations of its parent states <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mohammadfam et al., 2017)</ref>. BN also depends on the chain rule which is the joint probability distribution of each variable, whereby the BN can calculate the marginal and conditional probabilities for each node in the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Chanda &amp; Goyal, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Yang &amp; Xu, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>If the DAG has N variables, 𝑋 1 , 𝑋 2 ,…, 𝑋 𝑛 is presented as nodes.

The joint probability distribution also involves the specification of a CPT for each node (Fuster-Parra, García-Mas, Ponseti, Palou, &amp; Cruz, 2014). The independencies from the DAG were interpreted to the probabilistic model which was used to determine the factors affecting the innovation process in the APS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Bayesian network construction</head><p>Once the DAG has been developed, the BN states need to be defined for the purpose of building a model. Generally, variables may be either discrete or continuous and these are dependent upon the measured phenomena. A discrete variable is represented by a finite set of fixed values.</p><p>Alternatively, a continuous variable consists of any value from a selected range <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chen &amp; Pollino, 2012)</ref>. In this study, a 5-point scale was used to assign values to factors. A continuous variable can be converted to a discrete variable to determine the BN states. To do this, continuous values must be discretised in terms of the states of each node. This method was used to support the managerial capability of the BN and to avoid mathematical complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Gupta &amp; Kim, 2008)</ref>. In this study, the equal-width method, which discretises the variables by dividing the range of values into a predefined number of intervals of equal-width, is inappropriate due to an uneven distribution of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chen &amp; Pollino, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Yang &amp; Xu, 2017)</ref>. This study determined the states of the BN nodes using the same assumptions as those adopted in de <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Oliveira et al. (2012)</ref>. Given the chance of occurrence of each BN state, the numerical values of factors, based on a 5-point scale, were discretised by classifying the scale into three states: low, medium, and high. Specifically, survey score ranging between 1-2.5, 2.5-4 and 4-5 were classified as Low, Medium and High BN states, respectively.</p><p>In this study, the parameter learning of the BN was developed using Netica software.</p><p>Netica automatically determines the parameter learning process, creates the cognitive map,</p><p>analyses the probabilistic values for each parameter, and subsequently enables both inferences and sensitivity analysis. The parameter learning process automatically learns from a file of cases. The spreadsheet was constructed, for each of the 3,125 survey respondents, with columns corresponding to the variables of interest for each node, and each row represented the corresponding BN state in each node. The DAG was developed in the software by drawing the nodes in the network and linking them to indicate their causal relationships. After constructing the DAG, all the cases in the spreadsheet were incorporated in Netica through a compilation process. There are three automated algorithms available in Netica, which can be used for parameter learning of the CPTs: counting, expectation-maximisation (EM) and gradient descent. The most straight forward method to calculate the CPT is the counting algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Ticehurst, Curtis, &amp; Merritt, 2011)</ref>. In addition, the counting algorithm has been accepted as a true Bayesian learning algorithm, and should be implemented whenever possible (Norsys Software Corp., 2010). The spreadsheet also met the requirement of the counting algorithm since there were no missing data in the file of cases. Therefore, the counting algorithm was used to quantify the CPT underlying all nodes to develop the BN model.</p><p>The occurrence probability of each situation was calculated to determine the probability distribution values. The probability of each state for a specific child node is determined by the CPT for all combinations of the parents' states. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the CPT that presents the probability distribution of the innovative culture node. For example, when the transformational leadership and consideration leadership nodes are both in the low state, the probabilities of low, medium and high states of the innovative culture node are 72.4, 25.0 and 2.6 percent, respectively. These probabilities show the beliefs for the three states, which total 100 percent.</p><p>The CPT is also used to check the minimum sample size required for the parameter estimation. The node with the greatest number of cells in its CPT decides the least number of required cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mohammadfam et al., 2017)</ref>. For example, in this study, the individual creativity node can be used in this regard. Accordingly, this node with three states has four incoming arcs. The 3,125 samples available in this study well exceeded the acceptable sample size for reliable CPTs (i.e. 3 × 3 4 = 243). Once the CPTs have been learned, the 'Compile the net' feature was used to determine the probabilistic inference. This learning process calculated the probabilities of all nodes in the BN, which were presented graphically in the form of a belief bar. The current innovation management context of the APS was represented by the BN in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. The compiled network has a total of 8 nodes and 20 causal relationships between nodes in the BN.</p><p>Each node has different probabilities which are presented as percentages in the three states: high, medium and low (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). The belief on the innovative culture node, for instance, shows that the high state is equal to 25.3 percent, which can be expressed as P(innovative culture = high) = 0.253. While 55.5 percent of respondents believed that there was a medium state of innovative culture in their organisation, 19.2 percent considered it to be at a low state. Therefore, because the medium state has the highest percentage, a medium innovative culture is likely to occur. The two values expressed at the bottom of each numerical node are the mean and standard deviation for that node. For example, the mean value of innovative culture is equal to 3.18. This makes it apparent that there is considerable room for improvement by inculcating an innovative culture in the APS.</p><p>After constructing the BN, it was observed that some nodes were characterised as dependent variables of other nodes. For instance, transformational leadership and consideration leadership directly influence innovative culture. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>, a high state of transformational leadership (47.8 percent) and a high state of consideration leadership (73.9 percent) are likely to take place. These two nodes can result in the innovative culture node, which has a probability of 55.5 percent of being in a medium state. These two nodes also act separately in determining a high probability of performance-oriented culture. Thus, transformational and consideration leadership generates a medium probability of innovative culture; but, at the same time, promotes a high chance of performance-oriented culture. Also, individual creativity is dependent on transformational and consideration leadership as well as innovative and performance-oriented culture. Additionally, transformational and consideration leadership have a direct effect on individual creativity as well as an indirect effect through their influence on innovative and performance-oriented culture. Our sample shows a high level of probability for individual creativity. This phenomenon occurs in the same manner for team innovation. Leaders also indirectly promote meaningful work, as well as reward and recognition, through their influence on culture factors (i.e. innovative and performance-oriented culture) and workplace innovation (i.e. individual creativity and team innovation). These causal relationships lead to a high state for meaningful work (60.1 percent). Interestingly, engineers in the APS have reported a medium level of probability for the reward and recognition node (58.0 percent), which correlates with the mean value of 3.04. Therefore, it is necessary to implement a strategy to promote reward and recognition in an effort to increase career satisfaction and address current shortages in engineering professionals in the APS.</p></div>

To conduct the sensitivity analysis, the 'sensitivity to findings' feature of Netica was performed to identify which input nodes had the greatest explanatory power on the target node.</p><p>The sensitivity analysis presents the variance reduction and the percentage of variance reduction for each of the input nodes. Moreover, in order to provide a clearer comparison of the relative sensitivity, a normalised variance reduction was calculated by dividing the percent variance reduction of each node by the highest percent variance reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Brandmayr, Kerber, Winker, &amp; Schramm, 2015)</ref>. Variance of beliefs indicates the uncertainty of these estimations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cinicioglu, Önsel, &amp; Ülengin, 2012)</ref>.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). For workplace innovation, the individual creativity node has a lower mean value than team innovation which suggests there is considerable opportunity to increase individual creativity. Thus, the individual creativity node was selected as the target node to determine its critical factors, and the results of the sensitivity analysis have been summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>.</p><p>When the variance reduction of the input variable is relatively high, this suggests that the output variable's uncertainty is highly sensitive to the input variable. If the measure is relatively low, the output will be fairly insensitive to the associated factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cardenas et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Sensitivity analysis provided the ranking of the factors according to their explanatory power on individual creativity. The critical factors are transformational leadership and innovative culture with variance reductions of 12.3 and 11.7 percent, respectively. It can be inferred that transformational leadership and innovative culture have the greatest explanatory power over individual creativity.</p><p>As the ultimate goal of the BN is to improve reward and recognition, this node was selected as a target node for the sensitivity analysis. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, factors were ordered according to their variance reduction. Innovative culture had the maximum variance reduction of 19.5 percent, while the variance reduction of the other nodes was comparatively small. Innovative culture is a dominant factor in its influence on the reward and recognition node. Therefore, fostering innovative culture is necessary for the fulfilment of reward and recognition. </p></div>

The impact of transformational leadership on other nodes was evident when the chance of 100 percent occurrence of a high state was assumed. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>, this led to the chance of high innovative culture increasing to 38.4 percent. The mean value of innovative culture in this situation reached 3.52, hence representing an increase of 10.7 percent (3.18 → 3.52). In addition, the chance of high individual creativity increased from 54.0 to 71.2 percent. This reflected an increase in the mean value of individual creativity by 7.7 percent (3.76 → 4.05).</p><p>Therefore, transformational leadership is essential to improve both innovative culture and individual creativity.</p><p>Leaders with transformational leadership style show support and consideration for staff.</p><p>These behaviours increase employee creativity and innovation in the workplace (García-Morales, Jiménez-Barrionuevo, &amp; Gutiérrez-Gutiérrez, 2012; <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Yang &amp; Kassekert, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Transformational leadership has four characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006)</ref>: individualised consideration, intellectual stimulation, inspirational motivation, and idealised influence.</p><p>The transformational leader gives individualised consideration to each follower's needs for growth and achievement by acting as a coach or mentor.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3">Scenario 3: The effect of transformational leadership and innovative culture</head><p>Another viable approach to improve reward and recognition is to promote more than one potential factor concurrently. However, improving the four factors within climate for innovation would require many obstacles to be overcome and could deplete resources before reaching the expected aims. Thus, it is recommended to integrate the two greatest explanatory factors highlighted by the sensitivity analysis for this scenario. This could be achieved by instantiating the high state for both transformational leadership and innovative culture to analyse their effects on increasing the likelihood of reward and recognition, as shown in Figure 3.57 36.9 59.5 3.92 ± 0.79 6. It was observed that reward and recognition had the highest variation on its mean value, increasing by 20.4 percent (3.04 → 3.66); however, this is still short of a high state. Thus, there is still considerable opportunity for further improvement to increase the perception of reward and recognition for engineers in the APS.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Oberfield, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Trottier, Van Wart, &amp; Wang, 2008</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.4">Scenario 4: Maximise perceptions of reward and recognition</head><p>As presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>, the backward inference was conducted by instantiating the high state for the reward and recognition node. Compared to the current organisational situation, it can be observed that there is a significant change in the probabilities of innovative culture where a major chance of a high level of posterior probability occurs (55.4 percent). In order to maximise the perception of reward and recognition, this "goal seeking" analysis reveals that innovative culture needs to be improved from its baseline level of a medium state to a high state level.  As presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">5</ref>, the prior and posterior mean values of each factor were compared to consider their change rates. It can be observed that the posterior mean value of innovative culture has the highest change rate (21.07 percent). This is consistent with the sensitivity analysis which shows that the reward and recognition node was impacted primarily by innovative culture. The factor that has the second major influence is transformational leadership with a change rate of 8.96 percent. Therefore, transformational leadership directly impacts innovative culture and indirectly influences reward and recognition. To efficiently achieve reward and recognition, the first priority should be to instil an innovative culture in the organisation. A second and complementary option would be to support managers to practice and develop a transformational leadership style in their workplace. It is important to note that reward and recognition is not significantly impacted by consideration leadership and performance-oriented culture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>Although A sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify which critical factor had the greatest influence on the target node. Transformational leadership was found to be the key factor to instil individual creativity. The most significant factor affecting reward and recognition was innovative culture. After identifying these critical factors, a scenario analysis was essential to develop policy tools for decision-makers and formulate strategies to improve the innovation process in the APS. The BN was used for scenario-based simulations to conduct "what-if" and "goal-seeking" analyses. The importance of innovative culture was reaffirmed as the most influential factor on reward and recognition, as shown in the "what-if" analysis. Moreover, reward and recognition was best accomplished when efforts were combined to develop transformational leadership and instil an innovative culture. The "goal-seeking" analysis showed that if the ultimate organisational goal is to optimise reward and recognition, then the first priority should be to instil innovative culture in the organisation. A second, and complementary, option would be to support managers to practice and develop transformational leadership in their workplace. It is important to note that reward and recognition was not significantly impacted by consideration leadership or performance-oriented culture.</p><p>Researchers can benefit from integrating the strengths of SEM and BN. SEM provided an empirically validated model based on theoretical considerations, which was appropriate as a basis to develop a causal map. The BN was performed to assess and refine causal relationships between the factors identified in the empirical model. The BN was then applied for scenario analysis, which converted knowledge from the theoretical model into managerial actions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Implications</head><p>There are two sets of implications from this study. Firstly, if organisations wish to encourage innovation among employees, they need to promote an innovative culture.</p><p>One way to promote a culture of innovation is through deliberate knowledge sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Mura, Lettieri, Radaelli, &amp; Spiller, 2013)</ref>. This involves organisational practices for the exchange of information and sharing ideas and suggestions, both within teams and across team or departmental boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Elrehail, Emeagwali, Alsaad, &amp; Alzghoul, 2018)</ref>. When such practices are encouraged among employees, groups, and within the organisation as a whole, they lead to the generation of new ideas that are useful for developing new business opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Heffner &amp; Sharif, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Lundvall &amp; Nielsen, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Within organisations, the implementation of "slack innovation programs" can stimulate creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Rahrovani, Pinsonneault, &amp; Austin, 2018)</ref>. To do this, organisations must provide time, technology and resources for individuals or teams to work on creative ideas and turn them into innovative products. Among private sector firms, Google's "20% rule," which allows employees to work with anyone they choose on new ideas for 20% of their working hours, reportedly led to the development of Gmail, AdSense, and Google Earth. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Rahrovani et al. (2018)</ref> claim that such programs work best for employees who are experts in their job area and who see themselves as innovative. It is important to identify these employees and allow them the freedom and resources to be innovative.</p><p>In public service organisations, the pressure to be accountable for resource use <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Glor, 2014)</ref> would make it difficult to employ slack resource programs. However, it is still possible to empower employees to identify problems in current processes and suggest their own solutions to these problems. This is especially the case for service delivery where managers can support and reward employees for improvements they make <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Fernandez &amp; Moldogaziev, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The current research shows that reward and recognition are influenced by high levels of innovative culture.</p><p>A second major implication of this study is that if organisations wish to promote an innovative culture and encourage creativity among employees, they need to promote the use of transformational leadership at all levels of the organisation. Transformational leadership is enacted through a set of behaviours, which are said to be assessable and learnable <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Parry &amp; Sinha, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>As well as selecting transformational leaders as much as possible, organisations could look to use developmental approaches for existing managers who are judged to have leadership potential. Although there is often cynicism around the effectiveness of leadership training programs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kelloway and Barling (2000)</ref> argued that if training focused on producing small, sustainable changes in leaders' behaviour then this would impact on subordinates more effectively. They believe the key to successful training programs is having the leaders develop concrete action plans with challenging, specific and achievable goals.</p><p>Others have pointed out the importance of combining structured training with 360degree feedback and coaching or mentoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Day, Fleenor, Atwater, Sturm, &amp; McKee, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The term "360-degree feedback" means that feedback comes from multiple sources (e.g., subordinates, peers, superiors, clients, suppliers, other stakeholders) who can assess a leader's behaviour based on their own interactions with the leader <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Atwater &amp; Waldman, 1998)</ref>. These people provide confidential ratings on the degree to which the leader demonstrates the behaviours expected for transformational leaders. The results are fed back to the leader by a leadership or executive coach who then helps the leader to set goals for improving in the areas they were rated poorly. On-going coaching or mentoring (ideally across several months) then supports the leader to gradually change their behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kelloway &amp; Barling, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) is an instrument that is commonly used to assess transformational leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bass &amp; Bass, 2009)</ref>. It allows assessment of what is known as the "Full Range Leadership" (FRL) model: Five dimensions of leadership behaviours that fall under either transactional (day-to-day leadership that focuses on managing and rewarding performance) or transformational leadership (future-oriented leadership that inspires followers to give their best).</p><p>As the present study found that perceptions of reward and recognition occur when there is both transformational leadership and an innovative culture, it is recommended that strategies to improve both should be used together.</p><p>Although the scope of this paper is limited to engineers in federal departments and the results are restricted to the strategies regarding innovation and career satisfaction within the APS, the results of the findings and the insights are crucial and can be applicable to wider </p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>For</head><label></label><figDesc>this study, SEM provided an empirically validated model based on theoretical construction appropriate to develop a causal map. The BN was performed to assess and refine causal relationships between the factors identified in the empirical model. The BN was developed through the aggregation of SEM to attain qualitative causal relationships and by analysing the data to learn the quantitative probabilities. The first step involved creating a Bayesian causal map, i.e. directed acyclic graph (DAG). The graph is acyclic when paths which begin and end in one node are prohibited if the arcs flow in the same direction. DAG has a set of nodes and directed arcs, where the nodes depict the factors, and the causal relations between them are presented by the directed arcs. The arcs between the nodes indicate a dependency relationship and direction of influence, while the CPT establishes the strengths of these relationships. The DAG also allows the analysis of conditional independencies, where an absence of an arc between one node and its successors illustrates conditional independence.</figDesc></figure>

Furthermore, transformational leadership and consideration leadership were considered to be direct causes for individual creativity and team innovation. This association between A and B is based on a common cause C, which can be denoted as A ← C → B. The causal mechanisms were identified as follows:  Innovative culture ← Transformational leadership → Performance-oriented culture  Innovative culture ← Consideration leadership → Performance-oriented culture  Individual creativity ← Transformational leadership → Team innovation  Individual creativity ← Consideration leadership → Team innovation After all the causal relationships among factors were identified, the DAG was constructed based on the empirically validated model, as shown in Figure 2. The DAG illustrates a link between transformational leadership and innovative culture which means that innovative culture is a child of transformational leadership. In other words, transformational leadership is a parent of innovative culture.</figDesc></figure>

This study applies a theoretically based and empirically validated model from SEM to develop a factor-level BN. The study sought to improve current understanding of the innovation process within the APS. The BN was performed to assess and refine causal relationships between the factors identified in the empirical SEM model. It revealed critical insights into the specific mechanisms to enhance individual creativity, as well as reward and recognition within the APS.</figDesc></figure>

To further improve on the present research, future studies could be conducted to broaden the scope to state and local government levels. Federal Government heavily regulates state and local governments. Thus, engineering tasks are more structured and rule oriented. The future work should study which factors are important for engineers to develop innovation in the state and local governments under legislative constraint from the Federal Government. For the methodology, future research may also compare prediction outcomes of the BN with backpropagation neural networks (BPN) or classification and regression trees (CART). This comparison study could help to discover network architecture with the most accurate prediction.</figDesc></figure>
