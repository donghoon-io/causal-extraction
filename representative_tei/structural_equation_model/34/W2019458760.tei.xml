<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this paper is to develop a comprehensive taxonomy of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices and develop a structural equation modelling-driven decision support system following GSCM taxonomy for managers to provide better understanding of the complex relationship between the external and internal factors and GSCM operational practices. Typology and/or taxonomy play a key role in the development of social science theories. The current taxonomies focus on a single or limited component of the supply chain. Furthermore, they have not been tested using different sample compositions and contexts, yet replication is a prerequisite for developing robust concepts and theories. In this paper, we empirically replicate one such taxonomy extending the original study by (a) developing broad (containing the key components of supply chain) taxonomy; (b) broadening the sample by including a wider range of sectors and organisational size; and (c) broadening the geographic scope of the previous studies. Moreover, we include both objective measures and subjective attitudinal measurements. We use a robust two-stage cluster analysis to develop our GSCM taxonomy. The main finding validates the taxonomy previously proposed and identifies size, attitude and level of environmental risk and impact as key mediators between internal drivers, external drivers and GSCM operational practices.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Over the last two decades, environmental issues have mainstreamed into the public sphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barkemeyer et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Holt and Barkemeyer 2012)</ref> and policy domains (e.g. De Gobbi 2011). Businesses are increasingly under pressure to address their potential negative impacts on the environment, not only within their organisations but out into their supply chains. Supply chain management (SCM) as defined by <ref type="bibr">Stock and Boyer (2009)</ref> is the management of a network of relationships within a firm and between interdependent organisations and business units consisting of material suppliers, purchasing, production facilities, logistics, marketing and related systems that facilitate the forward and Cite as: <ref type="bibr">Kumar, V., Holt, D., Ghobadian, A., and Garza-Reyes, J. (2014)</ref>. Developing Green Supply Chain Management Taxonomy Based Decision Support Systems. International Journal of Production Research -forthcoming reverse flow of materials, services, finances and information from the original producer to final customer, with the benefits of adding value, maximising profitability through efficiencies and achieving customer satisfaction. The practice of green supply chain management (GSCM) goes a step further and combines environmental management practices with the traditional SCM concepts. GSCM also considers upstream, downstream and internal operational practices (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Carter and Ellram 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bowen et al. 2001b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhu, Sarkis, and Lai 2008b)</ref> and encompasses policies and activities adopted by organisations to reduce their negative impacts on the natural environment <ref type="bibr">(Mollenkopf et al.2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Sarkis, Zhu, and Kee-hung 2011)</ref>. GSCM is an integral component of an organisation's overall strategy of moving towards an environmentally sustainable business model <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Zhu, Sarkis, and Geng 2005)</ref>. Not surprisingly, GSCM is attracting increasing attention from operations and SCM researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Srivastava 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Verghese and Lewis 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Mishra, Kumar, and Chan 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bhattacharya et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wang and Chan 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Govindan et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Tseng et al. 2014)</ref>. A common critique of the majority of GSCM-related publications is their anecdotal and descriptive nature (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Srivastava 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Carter and Rogers 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Seuring and Muller 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sarkis, Zhu,</ref> and Kee-hung 2011; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kim and Rhee 2012)</ref>. Some prior studies offer concepts, models or propagate theories, but these are rarely tested empirically. The empirical research has tended to be based on small samples or a limited number of cases. Where concepts are tested empirically, in common with a young field of study, there is little empirical replication or validation of previous research to facilitate cumulative theory development <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Mollenkopf et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>In the social sciences, classification using taxonomies or typologies can play an important role in the development of theory. Although often used as interchangeable descriptors, distinct differences exist between a typology and a taxonomy. A typology is generally a multidimensional conceptual classification, whereas taxonomy is a classification of empirical entities (after <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bailey 1994)</ref>. By their nature, taxonomies are more robust because they rely on empiricism and objective characteristics of firms to develop archetypal clusters of organisations. Taxonomies offer a convenient tool for measurement and facilitate (amongst others): description; reduction of complexity; identification of similarities; identification of differences; identification of relationships between types and dimensions; and comparisons between types <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bailey 1994)</ref>. Clustering firms into archetypal groups is considered critical to theory development <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bacharach 1989)</ref>, and to the identification of strategic configurations <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ketchen and Shook 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Tsikriktsis 2004)</ref>. The aim of this paper is to replicate and test the veracity of one of the early, influential GSCM studies, namely the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg (1996)</ref> which examined the logistics end of the supply chain and proposed a taxonomy (empirically driven) of manufacturing and merchandising organisations' green logistics behaviour. We extend the boundaries of <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg's (1996)</ref> research by (a)</p><p>developing a comprehensive (including all the key components of supply chain) taxonomy of GSCM practices; and (b)</p><p>enhancing its generalisability by drawing on a broader sample of organisations both in sectoral and size terms.</p><p>Moreover, we explore the impact of external and internal drivers on GSCM operational practices through a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach. We also contribute to practice by equipping GSCM practitioners with necessary decision-making information that is vital for designing GSCM policies.</p><p>The objectives of this paper therefore are:</p><p>1. To replicate the <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg's (1996)</ref> constructs and examine whether their taxonomy extends to a differently configured sample, and operating in a different geographical area; 2. To extend the Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg's taxonomy beyond logistic practices;</p><p>3. To develop a GSCM taxonomy for the totality of a supply chain based on external variables, internal variables and operational practices of firms; 4. To test the relationship between internal drivers, external drivers and GSCM operational practices to assist decision-makers; and 5. To develop an SEM-driven decision support (DS) system following the GSCM taxonomy for managers.</p><p>We begin by examining the literature in greater depth including a reflection on previous GSCM typologies and taxonomies. Then we present the methodology and data analysis utilised in this study before developing a GSCM taxonomy through two-stage cluster analysis. We then propose the use of SEM as a DS tool to assist managers to better understand the interrelationship between the variables and to shape their decision-making. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of this study and providing directions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background to research</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Previous empirical research</head><p>The previous empirical GSCM research is dominated by two sets of studies augmented by a number of other significant one-off studies. The Carter and colleagues set uses one main data-set to examine environmental purchasing issues <ref type="bibr">(Carter and Carter 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Carter, Ellram, and Ready 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Carter and</ref><ref type="bibr">Jennings 2002, 2004)</ref>, while the Murphy and colleagues set focuses on green logistics issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">, 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Murphy and</ref><ref type="bibr">Poist 2000, 2003)</ref>. Other notable studies include research examining green logistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Autry, Daugherty, and Richey 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ciliberti, Pontrandolfo, and Scozzi 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Mishra, Kumar, and Chan 2012)</ref>; supplier performance and selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Zhu and Geng 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Awasthi, Chauhan, and Goyal 2010)</ref>; or drivers and benefits of environmental management <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Yang et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Blome, Hollos, and Paulraj 2013)</ref>. A common feature of all these studies is an exclusive rather than inclusive focus, i.e. they all examine an individual component of SCM rather than adopting an inclusive approach by including all the components in a single study.</p><p>For GSCM to develop beyond an embryonic discipline -rooted either in anecdotal studies or empirical studies exclusively focusing on an individual component of the supply chain -it is necessary to conduct more systematic empirical research and more importantly to conduct systematic empirical research that spans all components of the supply chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Beamon 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">van Hoek 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhu, Sarkis, and Lai 2008b)</ref>. A number of scholars have taken up the challenge of conducting inclusive integrated empirical GSCM research. Most notable is a series of work by <ref type="bibr">Zhu, Sarkis, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lai (2008a, 2008b)</ref> based on the manufacturing and processing industries in China. The data for these studies were collected from managers participating in management workshops at the workshops <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Zhu and Sarkis 2004</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">, 2007)</ref> or through postal surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Zhu, Sarkis, and Geng 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhu, Sarkis, and Lai 2007</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2008a</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2008)</ref>. These studies, while making a significant contribution, suffer from three limitations. First, they are reliant on purposive sampling techniques drawing on experience of firms adopting best practice providing a onedimensional perspective. Second, the response of participants in a managerial workshop is likely to be influenced by the cues received during the workshop. Third, the sample for these studies was drawn from a narrow geographical area. Using random sampling, seeking responses from respondents in their natural habitat without cues other than those present in the workplace and broader geographic area will provide greater reliability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lack of replication research</head><p>Mature fields of science rely on serial testing of new theories to establish their veracity, a process Kuhn (1962) termed 'normal science'. This point is well recognised and accepted within the extant literature. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amir and Sharon (1991)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Flynn et al. (1990)</ref> argue that verification and elaboration of theory through replication is an essential component of theory building. Business and management disciplines, in general, suffer from lack of research that replicates and builds on the previous research leading to incremental verification and development of robust theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hubbard 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hubbard, Vetter, and Little 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Eden 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Tsikriktsis 2004</ref>). The position is arguably more acute in the operations and SCM disciplines <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Frohlich and Dixon 2006)</ref>. Systematic replication of previous research studies is indispensable in the scientific process because it offers protection against uncritical assimilation of erroneous empirical results <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hubbard 1996)</ref>, and it is a critical ingredient of meta-analysis, which is an important step in the systematic evaluation of the body of empirical evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Eden 2002)</ref>. Replication with extension is even more crucial as it determines the limits and scope of original findings to see if they can be generalised to other contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hubbard, Vetter, and Little 1998</ref>). Yet the use of replication research, and especially that with extension, remains limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Tsikriktsis 2004)</ref>, especially in the SCM and GSCM fields. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Keller et al. (2002)</ref> encourage researchers to utilise existing scales, especially those well represented in the literature, and when necessary combine and refine these measures in an effort to achieve more accurate and valuable research conclusions. Based on this advice, our study builds on the constructs and the resultant taxonomy developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg (1996)</ref>. We use the same constructs (as the replication component of our study)</p><p>and we extend the study by considering the entire components of the supply chain rather than focusing narrowly on the reverse logistic as well broadening the sectoral scope, size and geographic scope of the sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Use of taxonomies and typologies</head><p>Typologies (conceptually based) and taxonomies (empirically based) not only offer a robust route to developing general theories but they also allow researchers to generalise, stratify and construct mid-range theories and they offer managers a robust mechanism for benchmarking their organisations against other appropriate organisations. Whilst both typology and taxonomy are classification systems, we suggest that taxonomy is more robust than typology because taxonomies are empirically based.</p><p>Scholars have put forward a number of classifications (typically typologies) categorising firms' strategic behaviour towards the environment (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Handfield et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aragon-Correa 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Henriques and Sadorsky 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Apart from the conceptual classification of GSCM behaviours offered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Handfield et al. (1997)</ref>, others such as Aragon-Correa (1998) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Henriques and Sadorsky (1999)</ref> focused on a firm-level behaviour, rather than specifically focusing on GSCM behaviour. Higher level classifications implicitly assume that such behaviour applies to all functions and in practice such assumptions may not hold. We suggest that it is better to develop such classifications bottom-up (functional level up) rather than top-down as is the case with most of the current conceptually based typologies.</p><p>Taxonomies are arguably more robust than typologies because of their reliance on empiricism. Again, firmlevel taxonomies dominate the environmental literature (e.g. Aragon-Correa 1998; Henriques and Sadorsky 1999).</p><p>However, a number of scholars have developed organisational level environmental taxonomies <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bowen et al. 2001a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ciliberti, Pontrandolfo, and Scozzi 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gattiker and Carter 2010)</ref>. These, even more than typologies, need to be developed bottom-up. Highly aggregated taxonomies while valuable are likely to fail to capture what in reality happens at functional levels of the organisation. This is particularly serious in the case of functions covered by SCM as in many organisations these functions have the greatest impact on the physical environment. Previous taxonomies in the GSCM field, while making a significant contribution, focus on narrow components of GSCM. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg (1996)</ref> study identified three types of logistics behaviours -progressives, moderates and conservatives -using a score developed from a series of survey questions on the environmental stance of the organisations. The focus of this study was reverse logistics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ciliberti, Pontrandolfo, and Scozzi (2008)</ref> also considered logistics from a socially responsible environmental perspective. <ref type="bibr">Bowen et al. (2001a)</ref> predominately examined the purchasing function of organisations and to a lesser extent aspects of logistics, and identified four archetypal practices.In developing their taxonomy, <ref type="bibr">Bowen et al. (2001a)</ref> used K-means cluster analysis (similar to the firm-level taxonomies developed by Aragon-Correa 1998 and Henriques and Sadorsky 1999), whilst <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg (1996)</ref> used self-selected cut-off points.</p><p>There is a paucity of taxonomies examining and describing the behaviour of constituent components of GSCM. The situation is more acute when it comes to inclusive taxonomies covering all components of GSCM. Arguably the most influential exclusive taxonomy addressing a constituent component of GSCM is the Murphy cluster of studies because it is widely cited in literature reviews (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Carter and Dresner 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Carter and Rogers 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Sarkis, Zhu, and Kee-Hung 2011)</ref>. Despite being widely cited and leaving aside its narrow focus, Murphy's proposed taxonomy has not been tested extensively. Greater confidence in the taxonomy proposed by Murphy calls for replication across different types of samples and different geographic locations. The study presented in this paper attempts to address some of the weaknesses of the previous studies. Apart from the points made previously, we draw our sample from across the firms with varied GSCM practices rather than the 'best practice firms', hence, increasing the generalisability of our findings. Furthermore, generalisability is enhanced by drawing our sample from among a wide range of industries. We have also partially replicated the original constructs developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg (1996)</ref>, hence, assessing the robustness of Murphy, Poist and Braunschwieg's taxonomy. However, in line with sentiments expressed by scholars such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Beamon (1999)</ref> and van Hoek (1999), we have adopted an inclusive approach developing a GSCM taxonomy for the totality of supply chain. To this end, we have developed and tested additional scale variables. We have adopted a more robust statistical methodology than <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg (1996)</ref> by drawing on the statistical approach outlined by Aragon-Correa (1998), <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Henriques and Sadorsky (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Bowen et al. (2001a)</ref>.</p><p>We also believe that the understanding of all GSCM constructs is vital for decision-makers looking after supply chain design and operations. In model-driven DS systems the general types of quantitative models used involve various decision analysis tools including analytical hierarchy process, decision matrix and decision tree, multi-attribute and multicriteria models, forecasting models, Monte Carlo and discrete event simulation models, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bonczek, Holsapple, and Whinston 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Power and Sharda 2007)</ref>. In this paper, we propose the use of SEM as a support tool for decisionmakers. We have therefore tested the relationship between internal drivers, external drivers, and GSCM operational practices using the SEM technique. We believe that the understanding of these relationships will be valuable for decision-makers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research design</head><p>Data were collected through a postal survey using the offices of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  The validity of the questionnaire was further assured by obtaining feedback from a panel of six experts proposed by CIPS for their knowledge and expertise in this field. Following the validation phase, the questionnaire was piloted to further assure validity. SEM and path analysis have emerged as statistical tools to explore the interrelationship between the variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kline 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">McQuitty 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Shah and Goldstein 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kumar et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kumar, Batista, and Maull 2011)</ref>. Hence, SEM was used as a main methodological framework to illustrate the inter-relationships between internal drivers, external drivers and GSCM operational practices. We propose that SEM can also act as a DS tool for GSCM decision-and policy-makers by providing a better understanding of the relationships between these factors.</p><p>Of the total number of questionnaires distributed (1457), there were 149 usable responses, a 10.2% response rate (of which 147 were used in the cluster analysis).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scale development</head><p>GSCM practices were determined by identifying which of the 32 operational activities (Appendix 1) were undertaken (yes/no) by the organisations, to provide a total percentage score and a percentage score for each of the six subgroupings of operational activity. These activities were based on the best practice case examples and ranged from actions most organisations would undertake, to those only the most proactive would embrace. There were few missing values and the scales developed for the internal and external drivers were calculated using average scores for each group of constructs to compensate for any missing values <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Jonsson 2000)</ref>. In each case, each construct was also factorised using principal components analysis, with varimax rotation (after <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ketchen and Shook 1996)</ref> to check the number of dimensions and correlated with the average score scale to confirm the suitability of either scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Findings and discussions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cluster analysis</head><p>The taxonomy presented in this paper was developed using two-stage cluster analysis of the scale variables measuring GSCM operational practices, and internal and external drivers (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Two-stage cluster analysis is an exploratory tool designed to independently determine clusters of organisations that share highly similar configurations, and is capable of using continuous scale data (e.g. average scores for internal and external drivers and percentage scores for GSCM activity) and categorical data (e.g. characteristics of respondents). This analysis independently produced three clusters, which is within the range specified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lehmann (1979)</ref> that the numbers of clusters should be between n/30 and n/60 (in this case 2.45-4.9), where n represents the total number of cases (n = 147).</p></div>

Using the 32-item total GSCM scale, self-selected cut-offs were developed (high 66-100%; moderate 44-65%; low 20-43%; very low 0-19%) to describe operational activity within each construct relative to the total operational activity across the sample. The classification of the driver scales was based on the mean score for the construct related to the original Likert scale used.</p><p>The third cluster is operationally more active than clusters 1 and 2.

In all three clusters, there are low levels of industrial networking, suggesting that even the most operationally active are still not getting involved in outreach activities, such as green business networks or lobbying groups. Supplier education, coaching and mentoring is also very low or low in all three groups, again related to lack of outreach activities. Whereas, internal environmental operations management practices, such as ecoefficiency measures are the most frequently undertaken activities in all three clusters.</p><p>The categorical variables are examined in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, identifying which groups of organisations dominate the various clusters. The public sector, construction and utilities are predominantly based in cluster 3, with more than 50% of these groups in that cluster. The transport and logistics group is evenly distributed across all three clusters, and to a certain extent this is also true of the service/manufacturing and the manufacturing group. The largest proportion of the service sector (40%) is based in cluster 2. Higher risk and impact organisations are predominantly based in cluster 3, whereas those organisations designating themselves as lower risk or impact are spread over all three clusters. Cluster 3 is also dominated by large and very large organisations, while cluster 1 contains many of the small and medium size organisations. This suggests that the most proactive organisations are large and/or high environmental risk. This finding supports the work by both <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Banerjee (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Bowen et al. (2001a)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Banerjee (2001)</ref> identified a link between operational proactivity and levels of risk. The taxonomy developed by <ref type="bibr">Bowen et al. (2001a)</ref> also demonstrated a link between size and operational proactivity with the smallest business units operationally less active. Thus 11% of those that considered environmental issues to be very important are in cluster 1, and 78% in cluster 3. However, as Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> indicates, some of the smaller organisations and/or those with lower levels of environmental impact and risk were still operationally very active. This suggests that some other factor(s) apart from risk and size influence the adoption of advanced GSCM practices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Replicating the Murphy constructs</head><p>The previous section established that some other factor(s) other than size or risk might influence environmental proactivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Walton, Handfield, and Melnyk (1998)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Seuring and Muller (2008)</ref> suggest that the most advanced companies have the most strategically proactive approach to leveraging environmental management for competitive advantage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Srivastava (2007)</ref> also describes GSCM as a source of competitive advantage, with <ref type="bibr">Kopicki et al. (1993)</ref> and van Hoek (1999) describing reactive, proactive or value-seeking environmental management strategies of firms. This overall environmental culture of an organisation might be very important as a driver. However, it is sometimes difficult to establish whether it is employees, upper management, founder ideals, middle management or 'green champions' who drive environmental programmes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Carter, Ellram, and Ready 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ghobadian, Viney, and Holt 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ogbonna and Harris 2001)</ref>. Therefore, a range of 'actors' within an organisation may influence GSCM initiatives and their relative success. Perhaps trying to identify which specific group is the most influential is less important than assessing the influence of the overall organisational environmental attitude or commitment to improving environmental performance.</p><p>Aspects such as the internal environmental culture of an organisation might not be fully captured by the internal driver construct in this research instrument, as the internal dynamics of each case are extremely difficult to identify and measure without detailed case study work. Alternatively, publicly available environmental policies can be analysed to assess the strategic approach to environmental issues of each organisation (in a similar manner to <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Henriques and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Sadorsky 1999, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Holt and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Anthony 2000)</ref> and validate the results using surveys. Since the respondents in this sample were anonymous, it was not possible to do this.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to validate the internal factors driving environmental management using additional measures. This is where the concept of 'environmental attitude', after <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg (1996)</ref>, might be replicated and extended, to encapsulate the overall environmental culture of the organisation. This concept may act as a surrogate measure of internal factors, based on a series of indicator questions. Rather than using a simplistic measure, such as the presence/absence of an environmental policy, a multiconstruct measure of environmental attitude might be developed based on the principles established by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg (1996)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, this variable of 'environmental attitude' was replicated using the scale previously identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg (1996)</ref> which classified organisations into attitudinal clusters described as 'conservative', 'moderate' or 'progressive', using a series of constructs to develop an environmental attitudinal score.</p><p>This scale variable (as indicated in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) represented a cumulative score from the results of four questions originally proposed by Murphy as detailed below (score allocated indicated).</p><p>1. General importance of environmental issues: (4) extremely important (3) important (2) of moderate importance (1) of slight importance (0) of no importance.</p><p>2.

The scores ranged from 2 to 13, with a maximum possible of 13 and cut-off points between the three classifications self-selected in a similar manner to <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg (1996)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparing the clusters and the replicated taxonomy</head><p>The findings from the two-stage cluster analysis were then compared with the replicated constructs from <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg (1996)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> indicates the percentage (%) of respondents within each cluster that responded to the items measured in the Murphy, Poist and Braunschwieg study. Hence, 78% of those in cluster 3 believed that managing environmental issues was extremely important. <ref type="bibr">Bowen et al. (2001b)</ref> identifies a positive link between the strength of environmental 'attitude' of the organisation and the proactivity of GSCM practices, and this is supported by the findings in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>. An organisation in cluster 3 tends to believe that managing environmental and ethical issues is of great importance to their organisation, has a formal environmental policy, and tends to consider environmental issues in purchasing and logistics on a par with other criteria. Organisations in cluster 1 tend to consider environmental and ethical issues of 'slight or no importance', typically have only an informal environmental policy if at all, and do not consider environmental issues in purchasing or logistics. In comparison, organisations in cluster 2 tend to occupy the middle ground, considering managing environmental and ethical issues as moderately important, and if environmental issues are considered in purchasing and logistics, they are of minor consideration. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Status of environmental policy *</head><p>We have a formal environmental policy and guidelines 0. Previously, we presented the items used from <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg (1996)</ref> to designate each respondent as progressive, moderate or conservative. In Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, we now present the makeup of each of the clusters developed in the GSCM taxonomy and relate membership of each to the attitudinal designation of each member replicated from the Murphy constructs. This comparison suggests that the Murphy constructs show similarities with the clusters developed within this paper. Cluster 1 contains the majority of the conservative organisations, cluster 3 contains the majority of the progressive organisations and cluster 2 contains the majority of the moderate organisations.</p><p>However, some of the attitudinally progressive (15%), and conservative (4%), organisations are also in cluster 2.This suggests some organisations espouse conservative values but are operationally more active than the majority of the rest of the conservative group. Equally some organisations espousing progressive views are operationally less active than expected. This points to a gap between the rhetoric of environmentalism and actual GSCM practices. In summary, their espoused values overstate the operational reality and in others their espoused values are more conservative than their actual operational practices. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Murphy et al. 1996)</head><p>Therefore in studies of GSCM, and other environmental/social issues, it is important that the research instrument captures not only their espoused values and strength of opinion on the importance of such issues, but also the actual operational activity that occurs, as espoused values do not necessarily capture the operational reality. In a similar manner, having an environmental policy in an organisation is still only a written statement of these values and may not represent the actual extent of operational practices that enables the 'level' of environmental responsiveness to be compared between organisations. The GSCM taxonomy developed by <ref type="bibr">Bowen et al. (2001a)</ref>, focusing mainly on the purchasing component of the supply chain, displays many similarities with the taxonomy developed in this paper and that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg (1996)</ref>. In the <ref type="bibr">Bowen et al. (2001a)</ref> study, a link was identified between units with high environmental commitment and interest amongst employees following a more proactive green supply strategy.</p><p>However, whilst a pattern exists between levels of environmental concern and operational activity, in our findings some of the organisations are operationally less, or more, active than their attitudinal designations (based on Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg) would suggest. It should be noted that the full range of constructs developed in the original 1996 study are not used here and this may have affected the relative comparability of the attitudinal designations used in this paper. The cut-off points between the attitudinal classes are self-selected by the researchers in both the Murphy, Poist and Braunschwieg study and this study and these may not fully reflect actual divisions between the groups.</p><p>However, the use of the two stage cluster analysis does provide a measure of objectivity in the cut-off points between the groups and the strong similarities between the self-selected attitudinal classification of moderate, progressive and conservative and the designations of cluster 1, 2 or 3 suggests that the Murphy, Poist and Braunschwieg protocol has merit. This replication with extension supports the validity of their approach and suggests that this attitudinal classification is still valid in a different geographical and sectoral setting, and also in the context of the whole supply chain rather than just the green logistics as examined in the original study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Testing the linkages between external drivers, internal drivers, and GSCM practices</head><p>The final objective of this paper is to use SEM as a DS tool for GSCM managers. In order to act as a DS tool, SEM needs to investigate the linkages between the external drivers, internal drivers and GSCM operational practices. The investigation of the inter-relationship between the factors will assist green supply chain managers to decide where they need to pay more attention to improve the operational practices. In order to investigate these relationships, the GSCM conceptual model earlier presented in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> was tested. SEM allows detailed understanding of the particular variable in terms of key influencing factors. Once the model is established, it is compared using various fitness measures such as goodness of fit index, normed fit index (NFI) and comparative fit index (CFI), to identify the best fit model supporting the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Jöreskog and Sörbom 1989)</ref>. In this paper, we tested the conceptual framework for all the three clusters to identify the relationship between the variables studied.</p><p>Firstly, correlation analysis was carried out for all clusters together and analysis showed that all factors were significantly correlated (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">5</ref>). All the constructs were initially measured on a multidimensional scale, however the reliability test result showed that for all constructs Cronbach's Alpha value was &gt;0.70 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">6</ref>) and thus they were converted into single scale items.  The SEM model (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>) was then constructed following the conceptual model for all the three clusters.</p><p>Since SEM advocates testing alternative models and then identifying a best fit model, this procedure was followed for all three clusters. The fitness values of the best fit SEM models for the three clusters are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">7</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 4. Default SEM Model</head><p>For cluster 1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>(a)), SEM analysis reveals that all the external and internal factors were positively correlated with the GSCM operational practices. However, the best fit model had no links between the competitive factor and GSCM practices. One of the internal factors that measure the risks, culture and leadership also had no direct links with the GSCM operational practices. To cross-verify this, regression analysis was carried out for both these factors. The regression analysis supported the SEM modelling outcome as the adjusted R2 value for competitive and internal factor was found to be very low, i.e. 0.071 and 0.141, respectively. This finding indicates that competitive factors and factors linked to risks, leadership and culture are not primary drivers of GSCM practices for smaller organisations. However, the findings do not point out that they are not important, but rather suggest that other factors such as legislative pressures and general supply chain practices are significant drivers of GSCM operational practices. The best fit SEM model for cluster 2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>(b)) showed that unlike cluster 1, competitive and internal factors do play a crucial role in driving green supply chain operational practices. However, no direct link between societal factor and GSCM operational practices was observed. Again regression analysis was performed to verify the SEM model findings and analysis shows that the adjusted R2 value for the societal factor was just 0.29. This is an interesting finding opposed to cluster 1 and shows that large organisations do not follow GSCM operational practices to just build their image but rather their motivation is driven by both external and internal pressures. The SEM model for cluster 3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>(c)) showed no direct links between the competitive and societal factors with GSCM practices. The adjusted R2 value for competitive and societal factors was found to be 0.032 and 0.064, respectively. Thus, regression analysis verified the outcome of SEM analysis, suggesting that for very large organisations competitive pressure and societal image are not primary drivers but rather other external and internal drives are primarily responsible for driving GSCM practices. The findings of the SEM analysis of the three clusters show the differing nature of external and internal drivers and their impact on GSCM practices. Having a better</p><p>understanding of what factors contribute to GSCM operational practices is vital for GSCM managers and decisionmakers, since it helps them to design the right policies and allocate resources to factors that are more prominent for each cluster. SEM also identifies how these variables are linked with each other, i.e. the inter-relationship between the variables, thus acting as a DS tool for GSCM managers. By knowing how these factors influence each other, decision-makers can make informed judgements about assigning priority to a particular factor as well as planning the right strategy. For instance, if SEM identifies a strong and positive linkage between legislative and supply chain factors, GSCM managers can closely align their supply chain practices following any changes in legislation since these changes will directly affect their green supply chain practices. Thus, SEM can act as a DS tool for GSCM managers by assisting them in planning the right strategy. This fulfils the final objective of this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>This paper develops a taxonomy of GSCM drivers and operational practices that consists of three distinct clusters, with clear differences emerging between each. Cluster 1 is operationally less active and more likely to comprise smaller organisations. When examining attitudes rather than objective practices, organisations in this cluster attached a lower level of importance to managing environmental issues. We are not in a position to establish causality, that is to say, is it limited resources or know-how in smaller organisations that results in lower level utilisation of practices designed to reduce environmental impacts or specific lack of concern or awareness? In either case, these findings have clear implications for policy-makers and practising managers of larger organisations. In terms of policy, it is important to publicise and offer benchmarks that organisations can aspire towards as part of a proactive GSCM approach. In terms of practice, the results indicate the important role that larger organisations can potentially play in educating their suppliers.</p><p>Members of cluster 3 are the most active in implementing practices designed to reduce their organisation's negative impact on the physical environment. They tended to be the larger organisations and/or those with the higher levels of environmental risk and impact. From an attitudinal point of view, they also placed significant importance on managing environmental issues. Again we are not in a position to determine causality. Is it slack resources that encourage larger organisations to implement many operational practices designed to reduce their negative impact on the environment or is it simply their attitude towards environmental protection? One clear message emerging is the level of risk organisations face towards damaging the environment and taking steps to mitigate those risks.</p><p>Cluster 2 occupies the middle ground between these two opposing positions. These three clusters show an emerging link between levels of operational activity and drivers (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) and levels of risk and size (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). In part, there is some influence by sector on the clusters; however, this is not clear cut. On the other hand, the level of environmental risk and impact plays a key role in the adoption of operational practices designed to mitigate negative impact on the physical environment. Interestingly some organisations with lower levels of risk and impact are also in the more operationally active cluster 3. One explanation for this observation lies in organisations' attitudes towards the physical environment; for example, Interface, the American carpet manufacturer, that is seeking zero carbon emission by 2020 because of its founder's attitude towards the environment. In this respect, our study supports <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Murphy, Poist, and Braunschwieg's (1996)</ref> conclusions. The relationships suggested by the findings in this study are conceptualised in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 6: Mediating factors affecting GSCM response</head><p>This GSCM taxonomy does suggest that the higher risk, larger organisations are operationally the most active, which is to be expected. However, those with lower levels of risk yet positioned in highly visible sectors, such as the public sector, are also highly active. The most inactive, attitudinally conservative organisations are also typically smaller and of lower risk. Yet, the presence of these smaller, lower risk organisations within the highly active cluster</p><p>(3) and moderately active cluster (2) suggests that environmental attitude remains a critical factor driving operational activity even when their peer group is, on the whole, inactive. The fact that the most operationally active group (cluster 3) is not composed exclusively of high risk and large organisations does suggest that other factors are affecting the adoption of proactive GSCM practices in some instances, and this is perhaps related to the internal culture of the organisations and their level of environmental 'responsiveness'.</p><p>Thus, the influence of 'environmental attitude' as originally discussed by Murphy, Poist and Braunschwieg remains a key factor to explore in further detail. The apparent relatively 'crude' attitudinal designations originally used in 1996 without recourse to advanced statistical techniques, remain valid and show clear similarities with the clusters developed in this paper.</p><p>This study also proposes the novel use of SEM as a DS tool to assist GSCM managers and policy-makers. It can assist managers in decision-making by exploring the relationship between the external factors, internal factors, and green supply chain operational practices. In this study, the outcome of the SEM tool shows that the relationship between the factors varies from one cluster to the other, thus no common policy framework would work uniformly across the different sectors. Each cluster needs to be understood properly, and accordingly green polices and strategies must be devised.</p><p>Further studies should seek to explore in more detail the influence of progressive environmental attitude in the smaller, lower risk groups, which are traditionally more conservative. Future research can also aim at testing the mediating impact of environmental attitude using SEM analysis, as that would provide new insights to GSCM decisionmakers. In such organisations, it may be that internal factors are critical driving forces of this increased operational activity. In addition, further studies should seek to investigate the green supply chain taxonomy developed in this Environmental Attitude of Firm</p></div>
