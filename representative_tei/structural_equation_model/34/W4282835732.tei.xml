<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study examines the role of companionship in shaping memorable tourism experiences, traveller well-being and behavioural intentions by drawing upon a conceptual framework of well-being. Based on data collected from 430 respondents in Australia who had recent travel experience, the results from structural equation modelling (SEM) confirmed that companionship impacted on and had a significant influence on revisitation intentions and recommendations, as well as the enhancement of traveller well-being. Differences in attitudes were evident between those accompanied by family and friends and those travelling solo. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are highlighted for researchers and practitioners.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>and behavioural intentions. A tourist well-being framework that was proposed by <ref type="bibr">Vada, Prentice, Scott &amp; Hsiao (2021)</ref> focuses on three main areas: 1) antecedents of tourist wellbeing (triggers); 2) episodes of well-being (consumption contexts); and 3) consequences of tourist well-being (benefits). The current study deploys the well-being framework that was developed in <ref type="bibr">Vada et al., (2021)</ref> to delineate these preceding relationships and, more explicitly, to examine the influence of travel companionships on memorable tourism experiences, tourist well-being and behavioural intentions.</p><p>The focus on the influence of travel companionships is well justified. As social creatures, humans rely on interacting and on cooperating with others to thrive <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bowles and Gintis, 2011)</ref>. The tourism literature has highlighted travel companionships as essential to the formation of leisure preferences and participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Raymore, 2002)</ref>. Whilst travel can deliver a range of positive outcomes or benefits for tourists, these depend substantially on whether the incumbent is travelling solo or with companions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Su, Cheng &amp; Swanson, 2020)</ref>. Previous researchers have used social exchange theory to explain the influence of social interactions between tourists and host communities <ref type="bibr">(Choo &amp; Patrick, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Moyle et al, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Nunkoo &amp; Ramkissoon, 2012)</ref>. It has also been established that travel companionship decreases loneliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kleiber et al, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Morey &amp; Kritzberg, 2012)</ref> by providing emotional and social support <ref type="bibr">(Fullager &amp; Brown, 2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Radojevic, Stanisic and Stanic (2015)</ref> noted that travel companionship might influence positive outcomes arising from travel experiences, while others (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Glover &amp; Filep, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Prayag, Hassibi &amp; Nunkoo, 2019)</ref> have asserted the importance of adopting a group perspective when addressing the influence of travel companionship on tourist experiences and well-being. However, no major investigation has explored the role of companionships in generating travel-related benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Glover &amp; Filep, 2015)</ref> and no researchers have explicitly examined the influence of travel companionships on memorable tourism experiences, tourist well-being and behavioural intentions.</p><p>The present study adopts <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Seligman's (2004)</ref> PERMA (Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning and Achievement) theory to conceptualise well-being. The PERMA model comprises five building blocks of well-being, including the relationship dimension which resembles companionship. The relationship dimension within the PERMA model is posited on the claim that having meaningful and positive relationships with others provides a clear pathway to well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Seligman, 2004)</ref>. However, the application of the model in tourism has not provided a clear or deeper understanding of the types of relationships which influence well-being, or the different ways that tourist experiences can enhance existing relationships or even create new ones <ref type="bibr">(Vada et al., 2021)</ref>. This study enhances the understanding of the R (relationships) element of the PERMA well-being model by investigating the relationships among travel companionships, memorable tourist experiences, well-being and behavioural intentions. The current authors draw from the discipline of positive psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Filep &amp; Pearce, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Filep &amp; Laing, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Parsons, Houge Mackenzie &amp; Filep, 2019)</ref> by empirically testing the conceptual framework proposed by <ref type="bibr">Vada, Prentice, Scott &amp; Hsiao (2021)</ref>. The authors now present a review of the literature on tourism experiences, tourist well-being, travel companionship and behavioural intentions. A conceptual framework is proposed to test hypotheses that specify the direction of the relationships among the various constructs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Theoretical framework</head><p>Though <ref type="bibr">Vada, Prentice, Scott &amp; Hsiao (2021)</ref> have observed that tourist well-being has been predominantly examined as an outcome variable from tourist experiences, this finding can be extended by linking tourist well-being to practical outcomes related to behavioural intentions which can be implemented by tourism managers and marketers. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> the authors propose a tourist well-being framework focusing on three main areas: 1) antecedents of tourist wellbeing (triggers); 2) episodes of well-being (consumption contexts); and 3) consequences of tourist well-being (benefits). Antecedents refer to triggers which may influence tourist well-being such as positive emotions, character strengths, mindfulness, engagement, relationships, meaning and accomplishment. Several positive psychological theories offer potential explanations of how these variables influence tourist well-being. For example, Frederickson's (2004a) broaden and build theory of positive emotions claims that certain positive emotions broaden people's momentary thought-action repertoires and build their enduing physical, social and psychological resources. Previous empirical research has found that positive emotions can help people to cope with adversity <ref type="bibr">(Miao, Vittersø, Ferssizidis, Fredrickson, Steger, Catalino &amp; Ryan, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mitas, Yarnal, &amp; Chick, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tugade &amp; Fredrickson, 2004)</ref> and also contributes to improving cardiovascular health following negative emotions <ref type="bibr">(Fredrickson, Tugade, Waugh &amp; Larkin, 2003)</ref>. The PERMA model of well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Seligman, 2004)</ref> has also been claimed to contribute to longer-term well-being through its five building blocks of positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning and achievement.</p><p>Episodes refer to interactions with the natural and social environment which accur in tourism experiences and have been shown to link with well-being. Examples include museums <ref type="bibr">(Packer, 2013)</ref>, urban parks <ref type="bibr">(Chiesura, 2004)</ref>, zoos and aquariums <ref type="bibr">(Falk, Reinhard, Vernon, Bronnenkant, Heimlich, &amp; Deans, 2007)</ref>. It has also been found that experiences in nature can influence emotional well-being <ref type="bibr">(Beckmann, Ballantyne, &amp; Packer, 1998)</ref>. Acts of kindess also influence emotional connections to peole within host communities <ref type="bibr">(Filep, Macnaughton &amp; Glover, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Consequences refer to the benefits of tourist well-being such as enhancing one's inner self and reinforcing the ability to cope with everyday stresses. The benefits of experiencing constructs of well-being within tourism, such as the presence of silence (Dillette, Douglas, &amp; Andrzejewski, 2018), acts of kindness <ref type="bibr">(Filep et al., 2017)</ref>, meaning from vacation experiences such as wellness tourism and yoga tourism <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Voigt et al., 2011)</ref> has also resulted in behavioural consequences. These behavioural consequences have significant implications for tourism marketing and management as they relate to revisit intentions and positive word of mouth (WOM). Drawing upon previous studies, the current review suggests that there is a relationship between tourist well-being and behavioural intentions. For example, Lin (2012) found that psychological well-being is influenced by culinary experiences, with consequential impacts on tourist intentions to revisit. The applicable motivation and subjective well-being also affected revisitation intentions amongst hiking tourists <ref type="bibr">(Kim, Lee, Uysal, Kim &amp; Ahn, 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Furthermore, Reitsamer &amp; Brunner-Sperdin (2015)</ref> found that tourists' well-being impacted positively on their intention to return and desire to engage in positive WOM.</p><p>The existing conceptual framework is limited by not addressing the role of travel companionship on well-being and its impacts on practical outcomes such as behavioural intentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Memorable tourism experiences, tourist well-being and behavioural intentions</head><p>A Memorable Tourism Experience (MTE) has been defined as a tourism experience which is remembered and recalled after its occurrence <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kim et al., 2012)</ref>. MTEs are constructed selectively from tourism experiences, drawing on an individual's assessment of experiences, thereby consolidating and reinforcing the recollection of pleasurable memories of the destination experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kim et al., 2012)</ref>. Memorable experiences combine past activities such as encounters with accommodation, restaurants and tours at the destination and may influence future intentions, either implicitly or explicitly <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boavida-Portugal, Ferreira, &amp; Rocha, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Behavioural intentions have been defined as the degree to which a person has formulated conscious plans to engage or not in specified future behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chen &amp; Chen, 2010)</ref>. They may either be positive or negative. Positive behavioural intentions include intentions and willingness to return and positive word of mouth (WOM) communications. Existing studies have shown a relationship between MTE and behavioural intentions. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Ritchie, Tung &amp; Ritchie (2011)</ref> found that revisitation intentions are positively impacted by four dimensions of the memorable experience. <ref type="bibr">Prayag, Sameer, Muskat &amp; Chiappa (2015)</ref> also found that tourists' emotional experiences had a positive influence on memorability and tourist satisfaction and on intentions to recommend. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Oh, Fiore, and Jeoung (2007)</ref> also suggested that customer experiences are related to positive memories, satisfaction and revisit intentions.</p><p>Consistent with the preceding discussion and suggestions, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H1: MTE significantly influences behavioural intentions</head><p>Tourism experiences are forms of consumption offering physical and mental rest and relaxation, as well as the prospect of personal development and of pursuing personal and social interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gohary, Pourazizi, Madani, &amp; Chan, 2018)</ref>. The enjoyment and satisfaction that are derived from travel experiences offer a potential assessment of outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cohen, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Konu, &amp; Laukkanen, 2010)</ref>. Previous studies have shown that traveller well-being is influenced by prior memorable experiences. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sie, Phelan, and Pegg (2018)</ref> found that memorable aspects of local culture and excitement influence the overall well-being of older tourists after travel. Afshar, Foroughan, Vedadhir, and Tabatabaei (2017) also found that tourist experience is a strong predictor of the social well-being of older adults. Consistent with this suggestion, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H2: MTE significantly influences tourist well-being</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Yuksel, Yuksel, and Bilim (2010)</ref>, tourism experiences entail performing favourite tourist activities, thereby contributing to positive outcomes such as enhanced wellbeing, social interactions and acquisition of memories. This in turn strengthens tourist wellbeing and increases behavioural intentions. The positive well-being flowing from holiday experiences can also benefit the visitor economy since there is potential to formulate marketing messages that influence consumer destination choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pyke et al., 2016)</ref>. For example, Sohn and Yoon's (2016) investigation of Japanese tourists in Korea concluded that the image of the destination had an impact on tourist well-being and their intention to revisit and recommend the destination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Xu and Zhang's (2016)</ref> study of western tourists in China found that involvement in activities, perceived attractiveness and well-being had a statistically significant influence on behavioural intentions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Changuklee and Allen (1999)</ref> also found that satisfaction and overall well-being with the sun, sand and beach destination was a predictor of behavioural intentions by visitors to Myrtle Beach in the USA. Consistent with this suggestion and with the foregoing discussion, the following hypotheses are proposed:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H3: Tourist well-being significantly influences behavioural intentions</head><p>It is noted that whilst previous studies provide significant support for H1, H2 and H3 above, there are no studies which examine the influence of travel companionship on the collective relationship between memorable tourism experiences and tourist well-being on behavioural intentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Travel companionship</head><p>The concept of companionship has been prominent in the social psychology literature as a protection from the emptiness and despair that is associated with loneliness in the context of social support functions <ref type="bibr">(Buunk &amp; Verhoeven, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rook, 1987)</ref>. More importantly, the value of companionship is linked to psychological well-being, health and life satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Coleman &amp; Iso-Ahola, 1993)</ref>. Well-being and enhanced quality of life constitute central themes in positive psychology <ref type="bibr">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Smith &amp; Diekmann, 2017)</ref>. This coverage has helped to transform well-being into a "buzz word" over the past decade, omnipresent in discourse about human daily life and activities.</p><p>Companionship is a fundamental and innate human need and is essential for well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995)</ref>. Tourism scholars have highlighted travel companionship as a fundamental factor in determining leisure preferences and participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Raymore, 2002)</ref>. Social relationships associated with tourism and leisure activities have been discussed extensively in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chung &amp; Lee, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kim, Choi, Agrusa, Wang &amp; Kim, 2010)</ref>. Memorable tourism experiences can be enhanced by social relationships in tourism consumption and also travel companionship, thus influencing behavioural intentions <ref type="bibr">(Kim et al., 2010)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Choo &amp; Petrick (2015)</ref> found that travel companionship positively influenced whether travellers had memorable tourism experiences and revisited. Changuklee &amp; Allen (1999) also found that behavioural intentions were highly related to traditional travelrelated variables, such as destination attractiveness and traveling to the destination as a family tradition. Furthermore, Gracia &amp; Urbistondo (2020), found that family satisfaction was greatly influenced by traveling abroad and sharing activities. Consistent with this suggestion and with the foregoing discussion, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H4: Travel companionship has a significant moderation effect on the relationship between MTE and behavioural intentions</head><p>Previous researchers have also linked travel companionships and memorable tourism experiences with tourist well-being. For example, Gregory &amp; Fu (2018) concluded that people who travel with family members enjoy enhanced overall well-being. A link was also identified between family size and well-being, with smaller families experiencing greater sense of wellbeing <ref type="bibr">(Gregory &amp; Fu, 2018)</ref>. It has been further shown that travel experiences are significantly influenced by activities which affect positive emotions <ref type="bibr">(Olsson, Ettema &amp; Fujii, 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Zhu &amp; Fan (2018)</ref> further identified a strong relationship between travel companionship, well-being and meaningfulness. It was found that those traveling with their spouse or partner, children and other family members and friends were much happier than when traveling alone. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gao (2020)</ref> also found that travel can improve quality of family life, family functioning and children's development and well-being. Companionship further influences meaningfulness -higher levels are associated with all types of companions, other than co-workers. <ref type="bibr">Matteucci, Volic &amp; Filep (2009)</ref> identified an association between shared travel experiences and positive outcomes such as strengthened friendship ties and personal growth. Consistent with the foregoing discussion, the following hypothesis is proposed: H5: Travel companionship has a significant moderation effect on the relationship between MTE and tourist well-being Rather than being experienced and interpreted individually, tourism experiences are commonly group-based <ref type="bibr">(Crompton, 1981)</ref>. It has therefore been argued that deciding to revisit is not exclusively personal, but often a social, collective and shared intention with current or other travel companions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Choo &amp; Petrick, 2015)</ref>. Travel decisions are affected by social influences such as family influences, reference groups and social classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gibson et al, 2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fakeye &amp; Crompton (1992)</ref> confirmed that the strengthening of social ties between friends during tourism experiences enhances their well-being which therefore influences repeat visitation to the same destination. Consistent with this suggestion and with the foregoing discussion, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H6: Travel companionship has a significant moderation effect on the relationship between tourist well-being and behavioural intentions</head><p>Based on the above discussion on memorable tourism experiences, tourist well-being, behavioural intentions and the role of travel companionship on these relationships, the following conceptual framework is proposed. This framework is adapted from Vada, Prentice, Scott &amp;Hsiao's (2020) conceptual framework of tourist well-being whereby tourist well-being is viewed as an antecedent, travel companionship as the episode and behavioural intentions as the consequence. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Measures</head><p>This investigation examined the relationship between memorable tourism experiences and tourist well-being on behavioural intentions. Therefore, the main constructs deployed in this research included travel companionship, memorable tourism experiences, tourist well-being, and behavioural intentions. All measurement items were adopted from existing scales to assure their validity and reliability and were anchored on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree).</p><p>The expression travel companionship refers to a person who accompanies the tourist and who may provide non-material support such as emotional encouragement, relationship enhancement, and/or material support <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Yang &amp; Tung, 2018)</ref>. Based on Chung &amp; Lee (2019), families, friends, relatives, acquaintances and professional caregivers are generally considered travel companions. Consistent with their approach, the current study categorised travel companionships as referring to family and friends of individual travellers.</p><p>The Memorable Tourism Experience Scale was adapted for the purposes of measuring a memorable tourism experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kim et al., 2012)</ref>. These authors developed and validated the MTE scale based on the scale development procedure that was recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Churchill (1979) and</ref><ref type="bibr">Hinkins (1995)</ref>. The scale comprises seven domains, namely: hedonism, refreshment, local culture, meaningfulness, knowledge, involvement, and novelty. The Cronbach alpha levels for the MTE scale applied in previous studies have indicated acceptable inter-term consistency ranging from 0.81 to 0.90 <ref type="bibr">(Cornelisse, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Coudounaris &amp; Sthapit, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dagustani, Kartini, Oseman &amp; Kaltum, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kim, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhong, Busser &amp; Baloglu, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The well-being of tourists was measured on the basis of satisfaction with their trip, leading to overall life satisfaction. The authors adapted the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) developed by Diener, Emmons, <ref type="bibr">Larsen and Griffin (1985)</ref> to measure tourist well-being. The scale was adapted for the purposes of the current tourism study, for example, adapting the statement I am satisfied with my life to I am satisfied with my trip. Despite comprising only five items, the SWLS has demonstrated good psychometric characteristics <ref type="bibr">(Diener, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pavot, Diener, Colvin &amp; Sandvik, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pavot &amp; Diener, 1993)</ref>. The Cronbach alpha levels for the SWLS applied in previous studies display acceptable inter-term consistency ranging from 0.79 to 0.89 <ref type="bibr">(Adler &amp; Fagley, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pavot &amp; Diener, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Steger, Frazier Oisihi &amp; Kaler , 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The common measurements of behavioural intentions are: repurchase intentions, recommendation to others and positive WOM <ref type="bibr">(Cronin, Brady &amp; Hult, 2000)</ref>. In the current study, the researchers measured behavioural intentions by adapting three items from Hosany, <ref type="bibr">Prayag, Deesilatham, Causevic and Odeh, (2015)</ref> and Ma, Scott, <ref type="bibr">Gao and Ding (2017)</ref>: "I will visit this destination in the future", "I will recommend this destination to someone else", and "I am likely to talk about my happy experience at this destination with others". The Cronbach alpha levels to measure behavioural intentions that were applied in previous studies have indicated acceptable inter-term consistency ranging from 0.70 to 0.91 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baker &amp; Crompton, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gonzalez, Comesana &amp; Brea, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kouthouris &amp; Alexandria, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lam &amp; Hsu, 2006)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Sample and data collection procedures</head><p>The sample respondents were Australian residents, aged 18 years or older, who had travelled during the previous three months. Valuable insights can be gained by addressing a single tourist experience as proximate as possible in time to its occurrence, rather than on holiday recollections based on more delayed assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Filep, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nawijn, 2011)</ref>. Data were collected using an online survey based on Qualtrics™ software. The questionnaire started with an introduction to inform participants about the purpose of the study and ethical considerations.</p><p>The section included general questions about the respondent's most recent trip, for example, whether it was international or domestic and why it as undertaken (holiday, visiting friends and relatives, business and work or study). The second section enquired about the extent to which their trip was memorable and satisfying and the third section asked participants how they felt towards the destination and if they would revisit, talk about their experience or recommend the destination to others. The survey also included an open-ended question about meaningful tourism experiences and how these may have contributed to overall well-being. The final section consisted of demographic questions.</p><p>The survey questionnaire was administered to an online panel provided by Qualtrics™, a global market research firm known for its research experience and ability to reach a particular target market. Online panels are becoming increasingly common in tourism and marketing research with researchers finding such data to be reliable with reduced respondent bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brandon, Long, Loraas, Mueller-Phillips, &amp; Vansant, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dolnicar, Yanamandram, &amp; Cliff, 2012)</ref>. To ensure that only those who qualified were invited to participate in the survey, Qualtrics™ sent an email to their Australian panel with two screening questions to ensure that participation was restricted to Australian residents, aged 18 years or above and who had taken a trip during the preceding three months. To ensure that all responses were completed without missing data, all questions on the survey had a forced response. Additionally, Qualtrics™ guaranteed a variety of participants in terms of demographics by distributing the surveys to different age groups across Australia. As a result, 430 usable completed questionnaires were generated, of whom 65% were female and 34% male. Most participants were aged between 26-35 years (30.2%), had a Bachelor's degree (30.2%), and were employed full-time (39.1%).</p><p>The majority of participants were also married (59.5%) with an income of $40,000 -$59,000 (19.1%).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Hypothesis Testing</head><p>The researchers deployed Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to examine the proposed relationships. The model has a reasonable fit with the data well (χ 2 (98) = 349.762, p &lt; .0005, GFI = .903; TLI = .909; RMSEA = .077). H1 proposes that an MTE is significantly related to behavioural intentions. The results show a significant effect (β = 0.356, p&lt;.001), therefore, H1 is supported. H2 proposes that an MTE is significantly related to tourist well-being. The results show a significant effect (β = 0.447, p&lt;.001) and therefore H2 is supported. H3 proposes that tourist well-being is significantly related to behavioural intentions. The results show a significant effect (β = 0.356, p&lt;.001) and therefore H3 is supported. The results of the proposed relationships are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</p><p>Given that the proposed model implies a mediation relationship between MTE and behavioural intentions with the well-being as the mediator, post hoc analysis by using Hayes' (2017) v4 was performed to assess this mediation relationship. The results show that tourist well-being significantly mediates the relationship between MTE and the proposed outcome variable with a statistically significant indirect effect (IE=.17): 95%CI = (.12, .23). This finding indicates that tourists with memorable experiences with a tourism destination influences their mental well-being which drives them to return to the destination.</p><p>A multi-group analysis was conducted for H4-H6 to assess whether travel companionship impacted on the proposed relationships. The researchers divided the respondents into family, friends and solo travelers. The Chi-squared difference between constrained and unconstrained models was significant for travel companionship at the model level (χ2 (24) =361.96, p &lt; .01), indicative that travel companionship influenced the perceptions of memorable tourism experiences, tourist well-being, and behavioral intentions.</p><p>A path-by-path analysis was conducted and indicated were differences for two paths amongst the study variables -the travel companionship of friends and solo travelers. In the case of friends, tourist well-being (β = 0.694, p&gt;.05) had an insignificant effect on behavioral intentions. However, solo travelers' well-being (β = 0.500, p&lt;.05) had a significant effect on behavioral intentions. The moderation results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.0">Discussion and Conclusions</head><p>This study has examined the relationship between memorable tourism experiences (MTE), tourist well-being, and behavioural intentions, and the role of travel companionships in these relationships. The major findings are that: (1) MTE has a direct significant effect on behavioural intentions; and (2) on tourist well-being; (3) tourist well-being has a direct and significant effect on behavioural intentions; and (4) travel companionship has a significant moderation effect on tourist well-being, and behavioural intentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Theoretical contributions</head><p>Drawing from <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Vada, Prentice, Scott &amp; Hsiao's (2020)</ref> conceptual framework and the PERMA model, the current study provides empirical evidence on delineating the relationships between MTEs, tourist well-being and behavioural intentions, as well as revealing the role of travel companionships in these relationships. The PERMA framework in this study consists of five building blocks: positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning and achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Seligman, 2004)</ref>. The findings of this study have theoretical and practical implications.</p><p>Theoretically, the significant mediating effect of tourist well-being on the relationship between MTE and tourists' behavioural intentions extends the positive psychology literature into the marketing discipline. Whilst creating memorable experiences is important for tourist well-being, these personal benefits can be transferred to their revisit intention which is reflective of customer loyalty for tourism destination marketers. Equally, this study contributes to customer loyalty research by identifying a non-organisational offering (tourist well-being) as a factor of attracting tourists' loyalty intentions and behaviours. The literature has shown that premium service quality, expensive loyalty programs and other organisational offerings are common antecedents of customer loyalty. The current study provides a fresh perspective on addressing consumer behaviours.</p><p>The significant moderating effect of travel companionship in this study contributes to the PERMA model by extending the R (relationships) element, considering that tourism experiences can create an environment whereby families can re-connect and spend quality time together. This helps the rediscovery of identities and acquisition of deeper self-understandings.</p><p>The renewal of relationships with family and/or friends and the creation of new relationships has facilitated novel experiences which contribute to overall well-being. The finding is consistent with that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Zhu &amp; Fan (2018)</ref> in which travel companionship has a strong relationship with both happiness and meaningfulness. In their research study those traveling with their spouse or partner, children and other family members and friends are happier and find more meaning from their experiences than those traveling alone.</p><p>Whilst existing researchers has shown that travel companionships enhance tourist wellbeing, those with whom one affiliates during tourism activities may influence the types of benefits experienced <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Newman et al, 2014)</ref>. The current study further contributes to social exchange theory with regards to travel companionship and tourist well-being by showing that different travel party configurations influence revisitation and/or destination recommendations.</p><p>More specifically, as solo travellers are unaccompanied, they feel a need to share their experience with family and friends upon returning from their travel, thereby prompting an intention to recommend the destination. As has been argued by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Choo &amp; Petrick (2015)</ref>, the intention to revisit decision is not solely personal, but rather social involving the intention to share the experience with future travel companions. Therefore, this study has extended the understanding of the PERMA model and the importance of travel companionship for wellbeing, but also for destination marketers in relation to the outcomes of behavioural intentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Practical implications</head><p>The study has practical implications for the relevant practitioners as well as for travellers. The finding of the significant hierarchical relationships between MTE, well-being and behavioural intentions indicates that destination marketers should not only focus on tourism offerings to create memorable experience to attract tourists, but also take tourists' psychological well-being into account to design tourism products. Whilst it is important to develop appropriate strategies for creating memorable experiences, the marketers should identify the factors that induce psychological benefits for tourists given that tourist well-being is related to their revisit intentions. Previous researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Prebensen, Chen and Uysal, 2014)</ref> showed that tourists can co-create service experiences with the service provider and equally they may work with their provider for their own well-being. Marketers should identify means to co-create well-being with tourists as a marketing strategy to entice their loyalty behaviours and revisit intentions.</p><p>Since travel companionship has a significant moderation effect on travellers' tourist experience, well-being and behavioural intentions, tour operators should develop various group travel packages to target different travellers. For instance, for those who are generally inclined to travel alone, this package should provide enough incentive for him or her to sign up for group travel which may enhance travel experience and well-being, ultimately leading to revisit intentions. The findings of the study can also be used by marketers to segment tourist markets.</p><p>Travel companionship can be incorporated into traditional marketing segmentation criteria such as demographics, psychographics or behaviours to identify optimal target markets. To attract tourists' revisits, tourism stakeholders should design the offerings that cater for different markets, for instance, those who prefer to travel with family or friends.</p><p>Tourism marketers should also consider the R (relationships) element of the PERMA model through the influence of travel companionship on components of the service encounter by designing services and programs that cultivate favourable interactions with those accompanying visitors. This might include offering group packages and pricing options for friends to visit attractions or experience different activities that the destination offers. Though many destinations offer family or couple packages, there are fewer options for friends. Group travellers have significantly more positive tourist experiences than their solo traveller counterparts.</p><p>Although interactions with companions may seem less controllable than interactions with service providers, providers can provide activities which allow mutual enjoyment and shared experiences, from group-based discounts and prices to selecting family-friendly communication channels and family-friendly programs and services. Potentially cost-effective activities can also include volunteering or home-stay options in host communities to allow tourists to learn about a new culture and connect with the local people <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Vada et al, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Likewise, this study has also shown that solo travellers are more likely to revisit and recommend the destination to friends and family. Therefore, tourism marketers should consider special packages for solo travellers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bianchi, 2015)</ref>, whilst also highlighting possibilities to form friendships on these solo trips. Finally, innovative social media programmes could be designed to maintain new relationships that have been developed during tourism experiences and to allow tourists to keep in touch or to plan future trips <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Doyle et al, 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Limitations and future research</head><p>The current study acknowledges a few limitations which can be addressed by future researchers. Firstly, the study focused on the influence of travel companionships addressing the R (relationships) element of the PERMA model. Future researchers could expand this scope by examining other elements of the PERMA model such as positive emotions, engagement, meaning and achievement. Secondly, the sample consisted of travellers who recently visited different destinations. Future studies could examine travellers who had visited a specific destination recently with a view to acquiring further insights and a deeper understanding of the levels of behavioural intentions in particular destination contexts. Future researchers are also encouraged to conduct pre-post trip surveying, since such approaches are commonly used in evaluation design to assess changes in participant knowledge, attitudes or behaviours following an intervention. Pre-post surveys measure the same person's views at two different intervals in time which reduces recall, social desirability, effort justification and cognitive dissonance biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Colosi &amp; Dunifon, 2006)</ref>. Finally, future studies can also consider placing the travel party in the context of wider face-to-face social interactions when traveling through virtual communication with the world of family and friends via social media.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
