<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Purpose We employed the structure equation modeling (SEM) for investigating the determinants of Helath-related quality of life (HRQOL) in Iranian patients with celiac disease (CD). Methods In the present cross-sectional study, a total of 170 patients with CD were recruited. The information regarding adherence to diet, symptom severity and HRQOL were collected using celiac disease adherence test (CDAT), gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS) and SF-36 questionnaire respectively. Association between various studied variables and HRQOL was assessed using SEM. The standardized regression weights was used to assess total, direct and indirect effects. The model t was assessed to determine the "goodness of t" between the hypothesized model. Results The mean age of participants was 37.57 ± 9.59 years. The results of SEM indicated that the overall t of our model was acceptable. Adherence to the diet, GSRS score, occupation, and education level were signi cantly related to PCS of SF-36; and adherence to the diet, GSRS score, and education level were signi cantly correlated to MCS of SF-36. The analysis of indirect effect indicated that only adherence to diet indirectly via GSRS score was signi cantly associated with PCS and MCS of SF-36. There were signi cant differences between males and females regarding the relationship between education and adherence to diet (p&lt;0.001) and education level and MCS of SF-36 (p=0.03). Conclusion In adult patients with celiac disease, HRQoL was affected by age, education level, adherence to GFD, and GSRS score. Additionally, occupation and disease duration were associated with HRQoL only in women and men respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Celiac disease (CD) is a common disorder that is caused by autoimmunity to the gluten protein. It affects about 0.7 to 1% of the population worldwide <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> and its prevalence in Iran is also similar to that of world-wide reported <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Eliminating Gluten-containing foods and products is the only effective management of celiac diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In various studies in children and adults, it has been shown that adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) had a positive effect on improving symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with celiac disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Considering the chronic nature of this disease and since lifelong adherence to GFD is demanding and costly, the quality of life of these patients is affected. In addition to the treatment effect, other determinant factors were also reported that affect the quality of life in these patients. These factors including demographic factors such as education level, employment status; and disease-related factors such as the presence of comorbidities and disease duration, and presence of symptoms <ref type="bibr">[7; 8]</ref>. For example, in a study in Spain, it has been shown that age, gender, and GFD duration were factors that independently associate with HRQOL in Spain <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In addition, previous studies have indicated that symptom severity also affects the quality of life in celiac patients. For instance, Usai et al. indicated that there was a negative association between number of symptoms and comorbidities and HRQOLin patients with celiac disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, no study in Iran has assessed the determinant factors that affect the HRQOL in Iranian celiac patients. Moreover, most of the previous studies in patients with celiac disease only reported the direct correlation between different factors and HEQOL. By means of this method, only the direct effect of various variables on the outcome can be assessed. However, the exploration of indirect effects could offer new ndings in the relationship between different demographic and disease-related factors and HRQOL in patients with celiac disease. So, in the present study, we used structural equation modeling that enables analysis of the interrelationship of independent variables and their direct and indirect effect through other variables. Considering that the HRQoL is affected by different variables, de ning its determinants through this technique is bene cial.</p><p>Therefore, in the present study for the rst time, we employed the SEM technique for investigating the determinants of HRQOL in Iranian patients with celiac disease. In the present study, we analyzed 1) the relationship between different demographic and disease-related factors and HRQoL in patients with celiac disease, 2) applying SEM technique to determine the effect of these variables on HRQoL in a hypostatized model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials And Methods</head><p>In the present cross-sectional study, the adult patients (age&gt;18 years) were selected randomly from the East-Azerbaijan celiac disease registry database. In this registry, the patients were registerd if they have a positive serology tests con rmed by compatible duodenal histological ndings.</p><p>The sample size for the present study was calculated based on the Bentler recommendation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> with a minimum of ten observations per estimated parameters. So, we needed a sample size of 90 participants at least. In the present study, a total of 170 participants was recruited.</p><p>The Ethics Committee of Tabriz University of medical sciences (IR.TBZMED.REC.1399.904) approved the study and all participants gave written informed consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variables:</head><p>The information regarding demographic characteristics including age, education level, employment status, marital status, were obtained using a questionnaire. Having comorbidities was de ned as the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, cancers, chronic kidney diseases, chronic liver diseases, autoimmune diseases, in ammatory diseases, and psychological disorders.</p><p>Adherence to diet was assessed using the celiac disease adherence test (CDAT) questionnaire. This questionnaire assesses the level of adherence to gluten-free diet using seven questions on the ve Likert scale type and the total score ranged between seven and 35. We considered a CDAT score&lt;13 as good adherence, 13-17 as a moderate adherence, and &gt;17 as a poor adherence to GFD <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. This questionnaire was previously translated to Persian, and its validity was con rmed in the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The severity of gastrointestinal symptoms was assessed by the Persian version of the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS) questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. This questionnaire includes fteen questions on a seven-point Likert scale and higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.</p><p>The questionnaire assesses ve domains including diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, re ux, and indigestion.</p><p>The HRQOL was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. This questionnaire is a 36-item questionnaire that assesses physical (Physical Component Summary (PCS)) and psychological (Mental Component Summary (MCS)) health with a higher score indicating better health. This questionnaire was previously translated to Persian, and its validity was con rmed <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis:</head><p>All analysis was performed using STATA-16. The normality of data distribution was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The continuous variables were presented as mean±SD and the categorical variable were presented as frequency (%). An independent t-test and chisquare were used to compare the continuous variables and nominal and categorical variables between males and females respectively.</p><p>Association between sociodemographic factors, disease-related factors, and quality of life was assessed using structure equation modeling (SEM). As can be seen in the conceptual model (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), adherence to diet and GSRS score were considered as mediators. The standardized regression weights was used to assess total, direct and indirect effects of variables on the HRQoL. The model t was assessed to determine the "goodness of t" between the hypothesized model and the data by use of several methods including the ratio of chi-square to the degree of freedom, root-mean-squared error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative t index (CFI); and standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR).</p><p>The acceptable values were Chi-square/DF &lt;5, RMSEA&lt;0.08, CFI&gt;0.9, SRMR &lt;0.08. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered signi cant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In the present study, 170 patients with celiac disease with a mean age of 37.57 ± 9.59 were studied. Of them, 60.58% were female and 70% were married. The mean disease duration was 4.52 ± 3.36 years. There were statistically signi cant differences between males and females regarding marital status, employment status, mean PCS and MCS, and CDAT scores (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural equation modeling:</head><p>In the present study, the overall t of our model was acceptable (RMSEA [95% CI]:0.00 [0.00, 0.10]; Chi-square:2.24; DF:4, Chi-square/df: 0.56; CF:1; and SRMR:0.02).</p><p>The result of SEM analysis indicated that adherence to the diet, GSRS score, occupation, and education level were signi cantly related to PCS of SF-36; and adherence to the diet, GSRS score, and education level were signi cantly correlated to MCS of SF-36. The analysis of indirect effect indicated that only adherence to diet indirectly via GSRS score was signi cantly associated with PCS and MCS of SF-36.</p><p>We also analyzed the association between independent variables and PCS and MCS in males and females separately. As can be seen, in males, adherence to the diet, GSRS score, disease duration, and education level were directly related to PCS of SF-36; and adherence to diet and GSRS score were directly related to MCS of SF-36. The analysis of the indirect effect indicated that education level and adherence to diet were also indirectly related to the PCS and MCS of SF-36.</p><p>In females, CDAT, GSRS, and education level were directly associated with PCS of SF-36; and adherence to diet and GSRS score were signi cantly associated with MCS of SF-36. The analysis of indirect effect revealed that occupation and adherence to diet were signi cantly associated with PCS and MCS score of SF-36.</p><p>According to the results, there were signi cant differences between males and females regarding the relationship between education and adherence to diet (p&lt;0.001) and education level and MCS of SF-36 (p=0.03).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the present study the result indicated that in the whole population, adherence to the diet, GSRS score, occupation, and education level were directly associated with PCS and MCS of SF-36. Previously, a meta-analysis study on 436 patients with celiac disease, showed that dietary adherence to GFD was signi cantly associated with both SF-36 MCS and SF-36 PCS <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The direct effect of dietary adherence on quality of life may partly due to reductions in depression. Previous studies indicated that GFD had a signi cant positive effect on depression in patients with celiac disease <ref type="bibr">[16; 17]</ref>. In the present study, we also showed that in addition to the direct effect, adherence to the diet was indirectly associated with PCS and MCS of SF-36 via GSRS score. Complete adherence to the GFD is associated with mucosal healing, which resulted in improvement of symptoms.</p><p>In the present study, we also showed that education level had a direct effect on both components of quality of life. Moreover, in males, it has an indirect effect on the quality of life. Previous studies also showed a signi cant association between education level and HRQoL <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. It has been indicated that education allows for the development of cognitive skills related to personal care <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, low level of education intensi es the complications of chronic diseases because of lack of knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. It has been indicated that the education level is related to the higher socioeconomic status <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In a previous study, it has been shown that income level has signi cant effect on health-seeking behavior and access to health care <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which are correlated with higher quality of life. In addition to the direct effect, education level was indirectly associated with quality of life via an effect on adherence to the diet. Previous studies in celiac disease and other diseases indicated that a high level of education has a positive effect on adherence to dietary recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. A higher education level was correlated with better adherence to the diet via higher household income and also better self-perceived knowledge of the GFD.</p><p>We found that in males, disease duration had a negative direct effect on PCS of SF-36. This nding was similar to the result of the study in Spain <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In other chronic diseases such as diabetes similar nding was reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. As strict compliance to GFD may be di cult and costly, the this disease may cause signi cant limitations and impairment of patients` lifestyle.</p><p>In females, occupation status had a direct positive effect on both domains of quality of life. Previous studies in the women population also showed a similar result in different health conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In women who are working, the social well-being and functional well-being may be higher. This may be related to the greater social support available from coworkers and friends in the workplace and having a sense of normalcy due to their ability to work <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Besides, GFD treatment is costly <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. So, employment could have a direct economic effect on preparing gluten-free foods.</p><p>A comparison of association between demographic and clinical determinants of HRQoL between males and females indicated that education level and adherence to the diet had a signi cantly different effect on the quality of life in males and females. One explanation for this nding may be that in women a higher education level is accompanied by employment status that positively affects the quality of life.</p><p>This study had the following limitations. The data for this study was obtained cross-sectionally, and the causality could not be inferred. The data about the quality of life was obtained using a general questionnaire, not diseases speci c questionnaire. However, this questionnaire was valid and used in many previous studies to assess the quality of life in celiac patients <ref type="bibr">[4; 6; 34]</ref>. We just assessed the association between demographic and disease characteristics and quality of life in the East Azerbaijan population; this may normally restrict the generalization of its results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The result of SEM indicated that in adult patients with celiac disease, HRQoL was affected by age, education level, adherence to GFD, and GSRS score. Additionally, occupation and disease duration were associated with HRQoL only in women and men respectively. This structural model provides bene cial information for planning future health promotion programs in celiac patients. Moreover, considering the nature of determinants of QoL in celiac patients, the level of adherence to GFD can be studied in future interventional studies.</p></div>
