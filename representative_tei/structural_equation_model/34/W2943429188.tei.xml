<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Applying sensemaking research to acquisition integration, we outline factors that influence employee resistance to acquisitions. While integration is widely viewed as important to acquisition outcomes, there is limited systematic study of how employees react to the integration process. Using survey data from Chinese acquirers and applying partial least squares structural equation modelling, we examine what changes with human and task integration with the speed of when changes are made to explore relationships with employee resistance. Consistent with a temporal perspective of acquisition processes and sensemaking we find slower task integration may mitigate employee resistance to acquisition integration. However, employee resistance to the speed that changes are made likely varies for who is involved, suggesting different roles for top and middle managers. Specifically, middle management involvement with slow human integration and top management involvement with fast task integration reduces employee resistance following an acquisition.</p></div>

While some level of integration of an acquired firm is necessary <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Shrivastava, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Vermeulen, 2005)</ref>, integration is disruptive to employees of combining firms and it contributes to: 1) fear of job loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Schweiger &amp; Denisi, 1991)</ref>, 2) perceptions of unfair treatment and negative career effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Fried et al., 1996)</ref>, 3) anxiety over changed social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Astrachan, 1995)</ref>, and 4) increased uncertainty and stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cartwright &amp; Cooper, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Marmenout, 2010)</ref>. Although disruptions to employees from acquisition integration can contribute to employee resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Larsson &amp; Finkelstein, 1999)</ref>, a better understanding of what influences employee resistance is still needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Meglio, King &amp; Risberg, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Ellis, Weber, Raveh &amp; Tarba, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>By examining key decisions during acquisition integration that influences employee perceptions and acquisition outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Jemison &amp; Sitkin, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Shi &amp; Prescott, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2012)</ref>, we argue that considering what changes with when it changes and who manages integration efforts can improve our understanding of acquisition outcomes. Building on insights that employee resistance is associated with acquisition failure (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Larsson &amp; Finkelstein, 1999)</ref>, we examine the pace and level of managerial intervention in predicting employee resistance to human and task integration. Our aim is to develop and test a framework that predicts employee resistance to an acquisition.</p><p>Building on the theoretical foundation of sensemaking and sensegiving <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Maitlis, &amp; Christianson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Maitlis &amp; Sonenshein, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Weick, 1995)</ref>, we examine differential roles by top and middle managers during acquisition integration. Although top managers are assumed to initiate and lead integration, the role of middle managers in implementing change following an acquisition remains largely unexplored <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Meglio &amp; Risberg, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Meyer, 2006)</ref>. While top management begins integration planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Cullinan, Le Roux &amp; Weddigen, 2004)</ref>, middle managers confront problems of implementing changes they did not plan and dealing with employee fears of those changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Balogun &amp; Johnson, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Addressing these topics offers multiple contributions. First, our study supports acquisition research on human and task integration to develop how what changes during acquisition integration influences employee resistance (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Larsson &amp; Finkelstein, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Seo &amp; Hill, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Second, we contribute to a process view <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Jemison &amp; Sitkin, 1986)</ref>, specifically responding to insights that understanding employee responses to an acquisition requires a greater focus on integration speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Stahl et al., 2013)</ref>, or when changes are made <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Birkinshaw, Bresman &amp; Hakanson, 2000)</ref>. Third, we increase clarity about agency in acquisitions by examining who is involved in setting and implementing human and task integration. By distinguishing the impact of managers at different hierarchical levels on employee resistance, we develop differences in top and middle managers sensegiving and provide insights into the role of managers during integration. In so doing, we examine unique primary data using acquirers from an emerging economy, more precisely China, complementing a bias in management research towards Western economies (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Meglio &amp; Risberg, 2011)</ref>. However, this may also limit generalizability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theory and Hypothesis Development</head><p>Following an acquisition, employees expect change <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Risberg, 1997)</ref>, but managing the uncertainty typically associated with substantial organizational change, such as an acquisition, requires manager sensemaking and sensegiving <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Clark, Gioia, Ketchen, &amp; Thomas, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Gioia &amp; Chittipeddi, 1991)</ref>. Sensemaking involves meaning construction and reconstruction in developing frameworks to understand intended changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Gioia &amp; Chittipeddi, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Stensaker, Falkenberg &amp; Gronhaug, 2008)</ref>. Meanwhile, sensegiving involves the process of attempting to influence the sensemaking and meaning construction of others toward desired changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Gioia &amp; Chittipeddi, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Stensaker et al., 2008)</ref>. However, most research assumes that managers direct change without examining the processes of how change is implemented <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Sonenshein, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Steigenberger, 2017)</ref>, or recognizing that managers are also involved in sensemaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Vaara. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Monin, Noorderhaven, Vaara &amp; Kroon, 2013)</ref>. For both integration planning and sensegiving, either too little or too much detail is possible (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Eisenhardt, Furr &amp; Bingham, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Henneberg, Naude &amp; Mouzas, 2010)</ref> with the implication that what changes, the speed it changes (when), and managerial roles, or who is involved at different levels of an organization likely influence employee resistance to change. As a result, the initial relationships in our framework rest on research on acquisition integration and associated changes that lead to the need for sensemaking, see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>-----Insert Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> about here -----</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What Changes, or Type of Integration</head><p>Acquisition integration essentially involves organizational change <ref type="bibr">(King, Bauer &amp; Schriber, 2018)</ref>, and research on change suggests a consideration of 'high impact' elements of change may be necessary to transform organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amis, Slack &amp; Hinings, 2004)</ref>. We combine the element of pace (speed) highlighted by <ref type="bibr">Amis and colleagues (2004)</ref> with recognized dimensions of acquisition integration. Specifically, integration involves human and task integration that are distinct, but inter-related concepts that drive acquisition success <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bauer, King &amp; Matzler, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Birkinshaw et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bauer, Schriber, Degischer &amp; King, 2018)</ref>. Human integration addresses human resource management (i.e., pay and benefits) and organizational culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Cording, Christmann &amp; King., 2008)</ref>, and it focuses on creating positive attitudes and a shared identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Meglio et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Schweiger, Ivancevich &amp; Power, 1987)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Vaara (2003)</ref> finds that overlooking people issues during integration often proves detrimental. Meanwhile, the task integration focuses on operational efficiencies from combining organizational functions to improve efficiency and organizational coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bauer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Cording et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Meglio et al., 2015)</ref>, and on transferring and sharing resources and capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Birkinshaw et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Human Integration. Acquisitions disrupt employees and create uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Rafferty &amp; Restubog, 2010)</ref>, as employees are confronted by possible job losses, increased workload, and changes in reporting relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Ullrich &amp; van Dick, 2007)</ref>. Associated changes in employee identity contribute to employee resistance following an acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cho, Lee &amp; Kim, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Ullrich, Wieseke &amp; van Dick, 2005)</ref>. However, a heightened awareness of human aspects of acquisitions can reduce conflict and resistance following an acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ellis, Weber, Raveh &amp; Tarba, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Seo &amp; Hill, 2005)</ref> by establishing mutual understanding and trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Birkinshaw et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Stahl, Larsson, Kremershof &amp; Sitkin, 2011)</ref>. Trust is important to acquisition success and building it requires sensemaking of intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Searle &amp; Ball, 2004)</ref>. As a result, demonstrating a firm's commitment to employees with human integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bauer et al., 2018)</ref> can build organizational cohesion <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Rouzies et al., 2018)</ref> and reduce employee resistance. For example, human integration may decrease employee career uncertainty and lessen fear of job loss.</p><p>Conversely, overlooking human integration concerns can be detrimental to acquisition integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Vaara, 2003)</ref>. Therefore, we predict: Hypothesis 1a: Human integration decreases employee resistance following an acquisition.</p><p>Task integration. Task integration creates value from updating employee work processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Colman &amp; Lunnan, 2011)</ref>. However, coordination between combining firms on work processes disrupts prior employee routines <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bauer et al., 2016)</ref>. As a result, updating work processes inevitably lowers task performance and contributes to employee resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bauer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Cooke &amp; Huang, 2011)</ref>. For example, change in developed processes impacts the ability of teams to coordinate on interdependent tasks, as efforts become either fragmented or duplicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Summers, Humphrey &amp; Ferris, 2012)</ref>. As a result, task integration addresses coordination in updated processes, as well as discontinuation of prior tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Rouzies et al., 2018)</ref>. Still, acquisitions often struggle because employees experience discontinuity in job tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Paruchuri, Nerkar &amp; Hambrick, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Ullrich et al., 2005)</ref>, and this may contribute to employee resistance. Therefore, we predict: Hypothesis 1b: Task integration increases employee resistance following an acquisition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>When it changes, or Duration of Integration</head><p>An important decision for both human and task integration involves the speed under which changes are made <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bauer, King &amp; Matzler, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Meglio et al., 2017)</ref>. While managers in general prefer greater integration speed to accelerate improvements (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Schlaepfer et al., 2008)</ref>, employees might react either positively to reinforce improvements or negatively with resistance that unravels initial positive effects of human and task integration. This leads us to anticipate that human and task integration duration mediates the influence of human and task integration on employee resistance. Additionally, the impact of human and task integration is not free of constraints and depends on other contingencies, such as fit <ref type="bibr">(Homburg &amp; Bucerius, 2006)</ref>, decision-making preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Uzelac et al., 2016)</ref>, and institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bauer et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, we also argue later that the influence of integration duration is likely moderated by whether top management or middle management is responsible for the different dimensions of acquisition integration and associated sensegiving.</p><p>Human integration speed. How quickly managers attempt to establish a positive environment between combining firms during integration is an important consideration. Fast human integration can minimize disruption and prevent employee resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Angwin, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr">, Bauer et al., 2016)</ref>. Moving quickly with human integration can also take advantage of initial optimism from an acquisition <ref type="bibr">(Buono &amp; Bowdich, 2003)</ref>, as employees anticipate changes following an acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Risberg, 1997)</ref>. Further, an early focus on collaboration can minimize conflicts and employee uncertainty <ref type="bibr">(Jansen, Tempelaar, Van den Bosch &amp; Volberta, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ullrich &amp; can Dick, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Vaara, 2003)</ref>. As a result, moving quickly with human integration can create positive momentum <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Gates &amp; Very, 2003)</ref>, and speed can help to avoid problems during what otherwise can be a lengthy integration process <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Haspeslagh &amp; Jemison, 1991)</ref>. Therefore, we predict: Hypothesis 2a: Shorter duration of human integration lowers employee resistance following an acquisition.</p><p>Task integration speed. While a significant source of value generation from acquisitions comes from gains in efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Siegel &amp; Simons, 2010)</ref> or from implementing superior acquirer processes in a target organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andrade, Mitchell &amp; Stafford, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Jovanic &amp; Rousseau, 2002)</ref>, task integration interrupts coordination in organizational tasks resulting in coordination problems and conflicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(Shrivastava, 1986)</ref>. There is also evidence that increased integration speed comes at the expense of necessary support to employees in adapting to new routines <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Nemanich &amp; Vera, 2009)</ref>. The faster the changes in employees' task environment occur, the less likely social interactions between tasks will also be updated <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Weick &amp; Roberts, 1993)</ref> and this disrupts tacit knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Nonaka, 1994)</ref>. Meanwhile, slower task integration can allow for iteration in the use of routines to facilitate task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bauer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Lavie, Stettner &amp; Tushman, 2010)</ref> and to deepen a common understanding that refines tacit knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Levitt &amp; March, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Nonaka, 1994)</ref> that is likely associated with employee adoption of new procedures.</p><p>Therefore, we predict: Hypothesis 2b: Shorter duration of task integration increases employee resistance following an acquisition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Who Facilitates Change, or Differences in Managerial Roles</head><p>Drawing on the resource-based view, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Lamont, King, Maslach, Schwerdtfeger, &amp; Tienari (2018)</ref> suggest that the success of acquisitive growth rests on the quality and quantity of an acquirer's managerial talent. We anticipate that the impact of human and task integration duration is moderated by whether top or middle managers are primarily involved.</p><p>When considering top managers, they often need less time for sensemaking than other employees, because they typically initiate acquisitions or they are involved in developing change <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Lehn &amp; Zhao, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Stensaker et al., 2008)</ref>. However, top management involvement is also needed to initiate changes in combining organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Clark, Gioia, Ketchen &amp; Thomas, 2010)</ref>, and top managers are visible at acquisition announcement <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Hayward &amp; Hambrick, 1997)</ref>. For example, top managers can communicate the need behind an acquisition and associated changes to reduce employee uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Giessner, 2011)</ref>. However, while change can be directed from the top, it still requires sensegiving, or employees understanding change and its intent, as well as its implications. For example, acquisition integration planning only includes a few people at the top of organizations, but integration implementation involves middle managers and employees that require more time for sensemaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Stensaker et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Vaara, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Middle managers provide a conduit for employees accepting change, but they confront the dual challenge of providing sensegiving and implementing changes they did not design and may only partially understand themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Balogun &amp; Johnson, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Stensaker et al., 2008)</ref>. Further, implementation of planned changes requires a delicate balance, as employee resistance to change occurs when they perceive change does either too little or too much <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Sonenshein, 2010)</ref>. The need for implementation suggests an increased importance of middle managers during integration that is largely overlooked in acquisition research <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Meglio &amp; Risberg, 2010)</ref>. Not considering middle managers is an important omission, as research suggests they account for significant differences in firm performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Mollick, 2012)</ref>. We anticipate moderating and differential effects of top and middle managers are most evident in how fast human and task integration proceeds.</p><p>Human Integration Speed. For human integration, top manager involvement with integration can improve employee retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Steigenberger, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Zhang et al., 2015)</ref>. For example, top managers can quickly address concerns associated with a lack of information with a letter to employees that creates a sense of necessity for change <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Giessner, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Schweiger et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Schweiger &amp; Denisi, 1991)</ref>. Still, top managers often employ ambiguity to maintain latitude while outlining common ground without the means to achieve it <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Davenport &amp; Leitch, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Gioia, Nag &amp; Corley, 2012)</ref>. However, ambiguity drives sensemaking and it can contribute to shock and perceptions of injustice (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Gioia et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Yang, Treadway &amp; Stepina, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>When human integration is completed quickly, acquiring firm managers are likely to be disproportionally represented in leadership roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Welch &amp; Welch, 2005)</ref>. This can drive disillusionment and resistance from target firm managers and employees that can have more insight in how combined resources can create value (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Chreim, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Chreim &amp; Tafaghod, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Graebner, 2004)</ref>. Further, top managers can facilitate faster reaction to problems and maintain momentum <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Angwin, 2004)</ref>. These issues confirm observations that the importance of top managers to human integration matters <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Schweiger et al., 1987)</ref>. Therefore, we predict: Hypothesis 3a: For shorter duration of human integration, greater top management involvement reduces employee resistance.</p><p>While top managers can direct reorganization, it requires employee sensemaking to implement <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Crevani, Lindgren &amp; Packendorff, 2010)</ref> and this is facilitated by middle managers translating goals into initiatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Stensaker et al., 2008)</ref>. Middle manager sensegiving is more likely for issues involving organizational performance and operational effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Maitlis &amp; Lawrence, 2007)</ref> that are generally degraded during integration. For example, middle managers often provide sensegiving following structural interventions and promote an understanding of change <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Balogun &amp; Johnson, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Steigenberger, 2017)</ref>. As a result, middle managers adapt integration based on employee concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Gates &amp; Very, 2003)</ref>. We anticipate middle manager sensemaking constructs meaning that enables sensegiving to employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Sonenshein, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Huy (2011)</ref> recognizes an important role of middle managers in dealing with employee emotions, and we maintain this takes time or it is most evident for longer duration of human integration. Therefore, we predict: Hypothesis 3b: For longer duration of human integration, greater middle manager involvement reduces employee resistance.</p><p>Task Integration Speed. Deciding on organizational structure relates to prescribed changes made by top management <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Hinings &amp; Greenwood, 1988)</ref>, and for acquisitions identifying planned changes needs to be done early <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Gates &amp; Very, 2003)</ref>. Making the best use of firm resources requires avoiding delays on resource deployment decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brueller, Carmeli &amp; Drori, 2014</ref>) that can involve selecting the best, integrating the best of both, or maintaining separate processes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Ettenson &amp; Knowles, 2006)</ref>. Tasks and procedures separately co-evolve in separate organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Penrose, 1959)</ref>, and recognition of coordination problems during acquisition integration represent a consistent theme in research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Graebner et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Heimeriks et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Penrose, 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Zorn et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Task integration decisions are best made by top managers, as ambiguity on structure and processes can contribute to political behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Vaara, 2003)</ref> that is counterproductive for acquisition integration and employee acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Larsson &amp; Finkelstein, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Monin et al., 2013)</ref>. Timid integration is a greater risk than integrating too quickly, as only a one-month delay in realizing expected annual savings could reduce the net present value of an acquisition by onefifth <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Chanmugam et al., 2005)</ref>. Therefore, we predict: Hypothesis 4a: For shorter duration of task integration, greater top management involvement reduces employee resistance.</p><p>Following an acquisition, ambiguity from top management can increase political behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Vaara, 2003)</ref>. As a result, a lack of clear strategic decisions from top management on task integration can contribute to political contests <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Clougherty &amp; Duso, 2011)</ref> and conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Graetz &amp; Smith, 2010)</ref>. A lack of direction contributes to middle managers pursuing self-interest that does not align with firm goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Burgelman, 1994)</ref>. Political behavior during acquisition integration is often counterproductive <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Meyer, 2008)</ref> in that it contributes to employee uncertainty and dissatisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ferris &amp; Kacmar, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Monin et al., 2013)</ref>. For example, political behavior and associated employee uncertainty contribute to perceptions of procedural injustice <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Yang et al., 2013)</ref> that can contribute to employee resistance. Over time, challenges of middle manager involvement are likely compounded if it fills a void on the strategic direction of task integration that results in multiple, conflicting efforts from increased political behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Clougherty &amp; Duso, 2011)</ref>. Clear direction on task integration for middle managers and employees likely mitigates this challenge, and we predict: Hypothesis 4b: For shorter duration of task integration, greater middle manager involvement lowers employee resistance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>We used a cross-sectional research design using a survey administered after an acquisition occurred. Acquisitions represent a global phenomenon, but there is limited research on emerging economies <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Gubbi et al., 2010)</ref> with most research conducted in the U.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Meglio &amp; Risberg, 2011)</ref>. A gap between practice and research is highly relevant as China ranks only behind the U.S. in the number and value of acquisitions with double digit growth in merger and acquisition activity since 2000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Gaur, Malhotra &amp; Zhu, 2013)</ref>. For example, in 2017, firms in China completed over 13,000 deals worth over $720 billion <ref type="bibr">(Bureau Van Dijk, 2018)</ref>. As a result, we focused on China in developing a sample. In 2017, one of the authors contacted alumni of master degree programs from five Chinese universities describing the intent to study M&amp;A and asking if: 1) their firm completed an acquisition in the last three years, 2) they were familiar with circumstances before and after the acquisition, and 3) they would participate in the study for a small reward. A total of 145 managers indicated they would participate in the study, but doublechecking that potential respondents were in a company with acquisition activity in the last 3 years resulted in sending the Internet survey to 115 managers. This timeframe is consistent with other acquisition research designed to ensure recollection of events is still sufficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ellis, Reus &amp; Lamont, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Krishnan et al., 1997)</ref>. From our eligible sample of 115 managers, we received 108 usable responses for a response rate of 93.9 percent. Respondents were primarily middle managers that were in a position to best respond, as they represent the interface between top managers and employees <ref type="bibr">(Raes et al., 2011)</ref>. The use of key informants enables getting information from people knowledgeable about issues unavailable from archival data <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ellis, Reus &amp; Lamont, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Variable Measurement</head><p>We relied on existing scales with minor modifications to fit our research interest. We did this for two reasons: 1) established scales have already proven reliability and validity, and 2) it makes our results comparable to previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bryman &amp; Bell, 2011)</ref>. All questionnaire items were translated from English into Mandarin and back and by two people to limit translation bias. Prior to sending out the survey, we conducted a pretest to identify unclear terms and to avoid complex and abstract questions that might trigger biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Doty &amp; Glick, 1998)</ref>, with business professionals as well as with academics.</p><p>Human Integration. Human integration used three indicators borrowed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Cording et al. (2008)</ref>. Participants were asked to rate the degree of integration on the three indicators ranging from 1 = not at all, 4 = partially, and 7 = fully (AVE = 0.820; CR = 0.932).</p><p>Task Integration. Task integration used four items referring to specific functions in a scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Zaheer et al. (2013)</ref> for an acquisition context. Again, we applied a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = not at all to 7 = fully (AVE = 0.748; CR = 0.922).</p><p>Human Integration Speed. Human integration speed used a single item where the three integration items were named as examples, and this resulted from pretest suggestions to reduce the length of our survey. Integration speed was assessed as duration with a seven-point scale ranging from 1 = less than 6 months to 7 = longer than 24 months.</p><p>Task integration speed: We measured task integration speed with the four items developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Zaheer et al. (2013)</ref> using the same scaling for human integration speed (AVE = 0.860; CR = 0.961).</p><p>Employee resistance. Employee resistance used five indicators developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Giangreco and Peccei (2005)</ref>. The original measure comes from assessing resistance to change was slightly modified to the acquisition context. The questions asked, whether the target firm personal strongly opposed changes following the acquisition on a scale from 1 = not at all to 7 = fully (AVE = 0.820; CR = 0.958).</p><p>Moderators. Top and middle manager responsibility used a single item asking for the responsibility of acquisition implementation and coordination using a seven-point scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control Variables</head><p>We also added several controls for variables frequently used in M&amp;A research <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Hitt et al., 2009)</ref>. Please note, if not explicitly described, control variables are single item measures. Relative size might have a serious impact on acquisition integration, as larger relative size causes political infighting and conflict <ref type="bibr">(Gomes, Angwin, Weber &amp; Tarba, 2013)</ref>, increases coordination efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Cording et al., 2008)</ref>, and reduces the beneficial effects of shared mental models <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Dao et al., 2017)</ref>. Acquisition experience provides an indicator for well-developed acquisition routines and it can influence acquisition integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barkema &amp; Schijven, 2008)</ref>. Annual sales are an indicator for firm size that leads to increased formalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Blau et al., 1976)</ref> impacting acquisition behavior. Firm growth influences organizational behavior, as firms apply different coordination and control mechanisms in different stages of their lifecycle (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Greiner, 1998)</ref>. We assessed the average growth three years prior and following the acquisition each with a single item. Finally, an acquirer´s structure influences decision-making and behavior, and we applied the organizational structure scale with five indicators developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Covin and Slevin (1988)</ref> with a seven-point Likert scale. Due to a low loading we had to delete one item (AVE = 0.705; CR = 0.904). To control for corporate forgetting, we assessed acquisitions undertaken in the last three years <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ellis, Reus &amp; Lamont, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, we share the descriptive statistics from our survey for firm annual sales, acquisition experience, the type of transaction, and the average industry growth. Our data reflects the objective information on Chinese acquirers. Thus, we assume that sampling bias is not a serious issue for our data. For example, the overall growth rate of China's economy in 2017 was 6.9 percent <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Wildau &amp; Hornby, 2018)</ref> and this falls within the highest category of surveyed firms with 32.4 percent of firms reporting industry growth between 6 to 10 percent.</p><p>---Insert Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> about here ---For assessing our hypotheses, we used PLS SEM that is suitable for prediction-oriented research, as it maximizes the explained variance of dependent variables <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2012)</ref>. We examine integration related decisions and their effects on employee resistance with the contingency of management involvement. Thus, we do not concentrate on an overall model fit that is the focus of co-variance based SEM <ref type="bibr">(Barroso, Cepeda &amp; Rodán, 2010)</ref>. Instead, we focus on the variance explained of the dependent variable by our independent variables. Additionally, PLS SEM performs well with smaller sample sizes <ref type="bibr">(Hair et al., 2012)</ref>. For assessing the significance of the proposed relationships, we used the bootstrapping approach with 5,000 runs with the individual-level sign changes option <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Henseler, Ringle &amp; Sinkovics, 2009)</ref>. For calculating the moderators, we first, standardized the variables and second, chose the product indicator option using all possible pair combinations of the indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Chin, Marcolin &amp; Newsted, 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Common Method Bias</head><p>Having collected independent and dependent variables at a single point in time from a single respondent, common method bias raises concerns for internal validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Podsakoff et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">2012)</ref>. In considering potential impacts of common method bias, we took a-priori steps to mitigate it and then performed post-hoc analysis to detect its presence.</p><p>A-priori we took multiple measures to mitigate or minimize the potential for common method bias. First, while the tendency to agree <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Baumgartner &amp; Steenkamp, 2001)</ref> and the likelihood of non-differentiated answers <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Krosnick, 1999)</ref> can lead to problems if the task exceeds the cognitive abilities of the respondents, we assume that our respondents are welleducated specialists and able to answer the questions accurately. Second, our respondents are managers with limited time resources, but they were still willing to fill out the questionnaire.</p><p>Consistent with informal feedback, we also assume that the respondent interest in the survey avoided problems from satisfying and stylistic responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Krosnick, 1999)</ref>. Third, as acquisition failure is quite common <ref type="bibr">(King et al., 2004)</ref>, we assume that social desirability is not a serious issue for our data <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Podsakoff et al., 2012)</ref>. We also avoided complex and ambiguous questions from feedback on a pretest <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Doty &amp; Glick, 1998)</ref>, used latent variable measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Harrison, McLaughlin &amp; Coalter, 1996)</ref>, and changed the scale direction (e.g. for speed of integration) to minimize response patterns. Still, the sources of method variance might differ from measure to measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Spector et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Post-hoc we followed advice of <ref type="bibr">Podsakoff and colleagues (2003)</ref> and used the guidelines developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Liang, Saraf, Hu, and Xue (2007)</ref> to introduce a common method factor in our PLS model to assess the relationship between the substantive factor and the method factor. The ratio between method factor loadings and substantive factor loadings is 1 to 127. As a result, we conclude that common method bias is not a serious concern for our data, see Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement Models</head><p>In assessing our model, we followed the two steps recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Hulland (1999)</ref>, involving:</p><p>1) the assessment of our measurement models, and 2) the assessment of the relationships among the constructs. In a first step, we assessed our measurement models according to factor loadings (that should exceed a value of 0.7), average variance extracted (AVE) with a minimum threshold of 0.5, and composite reliability (CR) (that should exceed 0.7). Based on the analysis, we conclude that construct reliability and validity is apparent as all values apart from one item of the structure scale exceed the required thresholds, see Appendix B. In a second step, we assessed the discriminant validity of our variables with indicator cross-loadings <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Henseler et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Hulland, 1999)</ref> and on construct level with the Fornell-Larcker criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>. The analyses reveal no serious issues (see Appendices C and D), and we hold that discriminant validity is established.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis Testing</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows our results. Hypothesis 1a predicts that human integration reduces employee resistance following an acquisition, and our results suggest the path is significant and negative (ß = -0.306; p = 0.063). For hypothesis 1b, we find statistical support that task integration triggers employee resistance (ß = 0.261; p = 0.093). The relationship between human integration decisions and duration of human integration is not significant (ß = -.216; p = 0.136), but the negative sign indicates that firms try to pursue human integration quickly. Additionally, shorter duration of human integration does not influence employee resistance, as suggested in hypothesis 2a (ß = -.180; p = 0.144). However, we find that greater task integration is associated with faster task integration (ß = -0.356; p = 0.024), but slower task integration speed triggers employee resistance (ß = 0.301; p = 0.047). This result suggests partial mediation, as the direct effect of task integration remains partially significant (p &lt; .10). For assessing partial mediation, we estimate direct, indirect, and total effects simultaneously to mitigate potential biases occurring in traditional step-wise approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(MacKinnon et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Nitzl et al., 2016)</ref>. To avoid the necessity of distributional assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">2008)</ref>, we analyzed the bias corrected confidence intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Zhao et al., 2010)</ref> that are more robust than pseudo t-values <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(MacKinnon et al., 2004)</ref>. We find that 0 is not included in the bias corrected confidence intervals of the indirect effect (lower bound = -0.382; upper bound = -0.006), and the results suggest a partial mediation. We also find that human integration decisions and task integration speed, as well as task integration decisions and human integration speed, are not related to each other suggesting that managers consider them distinct.</p><p>---Insert Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> about here ---Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> helps to interpret the results for Hypotheses 3a and 3b. Hypothesis 3a argues that greater top management involvement is beneficial in cases of faster human integration, and it is partially supported (ß = 0.150; p = 0.095). A graph of the interaction shows low top management involvement with shorter duration (faster) human integration is associated with greater employee resistance. By comparison, high middle manager involvement for longer duration (slower) human integration is associated with significantly lower employee resistance (ß = -0.201; p = 0.045), supporting hypothesis 3b. Both results support our premise of differential effects for manager involvement for human integration speed.</p><p>---Insert Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> about here ---Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> helps to interpret the results for hypotheses 4a and 4b. While task integration speed increases employee resistance (ß = 0.301; p = 0.047), we find that top and middle manager involvement have different moderating effects. While the effects of greater top management involvement largely do not differ for changes in duration of task integration, low top management involvement is associated with greater employee resistance for longer duration (slower) task integration (ß = -.290; p = 0.045). This finding contradicts expectations for hypothesis 4a, as employee resistance is largely constrained to cases of longer duration (slower) task integration and low top manager involvement. For hypothesis 4b, we find partial support for a moderating impact of middle management involvement on the relationship between task integration duration and employee resistance. While middle manager involvement reduces employee resistance in cases of shorter duration (faster) task integration, middle manager involvement increases employee resistance for high duration (slower) task integration (ß = 0.195; p = 0.087). While not matching all our expectations, these results do support our premise of differential effects for top and middle manager involvement for task integration duration.</p><p>----Insert Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> about here ---Some of our controls also have significant impacts on our research model. While increasing annual sales (ß = 0.178; p = 0.075) and flexible acquirer structures (ß = 0.185; p = 0.048) slow down task integration, rapid firm growth (ß = -0.179; p = 0.096) and increased relative size (acquisition of larger target) lead to faster task integration (ß = -0.147; p = 0.076).</p><p>The latter result suggests faster implementation to reduce redundancy, and the combined significance of these controls is consistent with firms experiencing formalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Blau et al., 1976)</ref> and pursuing task integration quickly to realize synergies at the expense of employee resistance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Research on acquisitions has long been concerned about a short-sighted focus on functional integration without considering its effects on employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Cartwright &amp; Cooper, 1993)</ref>, even though it is known to contribute to acquisition failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Larsson &amp; Finkelstein, 1999)</ref>. The result has been an increased focus on integration decisions, or questioning what to integrate. In contrast, when or the speed integration decisions are implemented and who leads integration has received surprisingly little attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Meglio et al., 2015)</ref>. We develop how considering when integration takes place with agency in the integration process (who) provides a better understanding of employee resistance to acquisition integration. Our study supports and expands theory on sensemaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Weick, 1995)</ref> to outline when human and task integration happens and who leads associated efforts matters, or it begins to explain employee resistance to acquisition integration. Beyond demonstrating different roles for top and middle management, our findings elaborate theory on integration speed or a temporal perspective in acquisitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Angwin, 2004)</ref> and sensemaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Weick, 1995)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Implications</head><p>At a general level, our findings support established research that integration can stir negative sentiments and even employee resistance to acquisition integration (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Fried et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Larsson &amp; Finkelstein, 1999)</ref>. For instance, we find task integration increases employee resistance while the opposite is true for human integration. We also demonstrate increases in resistance can be mitigated by considering human integration. This supports prior research demonstrating active efforts, such as increasing organizational identification, can mediate unwanted effects following acquisitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Cho et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Seo &amp; Hill, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Further, attending to what changes and to the sequence of change (when) matters in an acquisition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Haspeslagh &amp; Jemison, 1991)</ref>, as well as who is involved, can enlighten theoretical expectations derived from insights in applying sensemaking to acquisition research.</p><p>For instance, <ref type="bibr">Pickering and colleagues (2017)</ref> find forceful and fast integration by top managers may lead to reduced client focus among employees, and our findings elaborate and provide nuance to this insight. For example, top manager involvement reduces employee resistance to task integration, especially when conducted slowly. However, low top manager involvement increases employee resistance during low duration (faster) human integration. By comparison, high middle manager involvement reduces employee resistance for low duration (faster) task integration but increases employee resistance for low duration (faster) human integration. This matches expectations that managers are responsible for acquisition integration (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Larsson &amp; Finkelstein, 1999)</ref>, but our results demonstrate differential impacts for who is involved and when. Meanwhile, our focus on temporal considerations does not reveal a significant relationship between speed of human integration and employee resistance. One potential explanation is that task integration 'trumps' efforts on the 'human' or soft side of integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cartwright &amp; Cooper, 1995)</ref> in predicting employee resistance. Resistance can go beyond a lack of enthusiasm or indifference for the integration, and it is possible early managerial interventions can avoid more serious employee resistance.</p><p>Additionally, our results have theoretical implications for sensemaking research. Our findings suggest greater middle management involvement with slow human integration and fast task integration can reduce employee resistance. While not specifically examined by us, this suggests that middle managers play a role in sensegiving during human integration. While our results are consistent with sensemaking explaining acquisition outcomes (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Vaara, 2003)</ref>, we also extend current knowledge of sensemaking and acquisition integration. Specifically, our findings suggest that sensemaking is not a passive process, or our results support that managers influence employee reactions to change (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Monin et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Gioia &amp; Chittipeddi, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Steigenberger, 2017)</ref>. Further, we underscore the need for managerial sensemaking and sensegiving in examining organizational change <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Gioia &amp; Chittipeddi, 1991)</ref>, such as an acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Clark et al., 2010)</ref>, by outlining how top and middle managers play different roles toward human and task integration. Overall, our research suggests that acquisitions are an important area for sensemaking research. demonstrate that fast task integration managed by middle managers reduces employee resistance, while the opposite is true for human integration. We attribute this to political behavior emerging during slower task integration (i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Clougherty &amp; Duso, 2011)</ref>. A similar effect does not appear with greater top management involvement in task integration, making us conclude involvement of top managers is associated with procedural justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Yang et al., 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Research</head><p>While we balance a heavy Western bias in acquisition research with a sample of managers at Chinese firms, context may influence our results. For example, observations suggest acquirers in developed nations apply a long-term perspective and a more deliberate approach to integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Kumar, 2009)</ref>. Still, Khan and colleagues (2018) suggest that Chinese expatriate managers tend to view local regulations in a target country as an obstacle to efficiency. The Chinese government also influences acquisitions with through state ownership <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chen &amp; Young, 2010)</ref>. While government influence likely exists across our sample, we do not control for the level of state ownership. Further, the effects might be different for countries with strong labor protection, as employees do not need to fear dramatic changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bauer et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Homburg &amp; Bucerius, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The combined implication of limitations associated with our sample is that additional research examining identified relationships needs to test the generalizability of our findings to other contextual or institutional settings.</p><p>Research also needs to examine relationships between employee resistance and acquisition performance. It is likely that avoiding active employee resistance is necessary, but active employee support may not be needed for acquisition success, especially if integration is not an acquirer's goal. Improving temporal impacts in acquisitions also requires a better appreciation of processes and an understanding of the extent that tasks can be performed in parallel.</p><p>Another opportunity is more closely aligning acquisition research with organizational change <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(King et al., 2018)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr">Amis and colleagues (2004)</ref> outline a consideration of the pace, sequence and linearity of change can help transform organizations. While we examine the duration (speed) of human and task integration, this stops short of other relevant considerations that are just beginning to be considered by acquisition research. For example, the degree of change also needs to be considered with the time to implement it, and the of human and task integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bauer et al., 2016)</ref>. Additionally, most acquisition research considers an acquisition in isolation, and the pace of acquisitions and other changes in combining organizations is just beginning to be considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Zorn et al., 2018)</ref>. Further, our research design is cross-sectional and our analysis stops short of examining the linearity of change and causation.</p><p>As a result, reciprocal relationships among our study variables is possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Latack et al., 1995)</ref>, or our findings depend on statistical conclusion validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Sussman &amp; Robertson, 1986)</ref>. Each of these considerations represent clear opportunities for additional research. In closing, we hope that our ideas lead to additional research on manager effects on employee resistance during acquisition integration. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><graphic coords="35,56.70,70.85,604.35,313.45" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managerial Implications</head><p>We confirm that acquisitions represent a means for developing economies to gain access to resources and compete on a global stage; however, the success of meeting acquisition goals requires avoiding active employee resistance. Thus, for top managers that face conflict with a target firm and its managers and employees, our results confirm the importance of organizational justice and behavior consistent with implicit contracts <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Cording et al., 2014)</ref>. Further, top managers need to consider middle managers and enable them to help address employee resistance during the acquisition process by involving them in planning longer human integration and giving them clear direction in executing task integration quickly.</p><p>While acquisition research has extensively examined potential sources of failure and success, only a handful of acquisition studies have paid explicit attention to unraveling the underlying microfoundations of acquisition outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Angwin, Paroutis, &amp; Connell, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Friedman, Carmeli, Tishler &amp; Shimizu, 2016)</ref>. Further, as noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Brueller, Carmeli &amp; Markman (2018)</ref>, existing knowledge tends to leave processes underlying acquisitions and postacquisition integration unexplored. For example, human resource (HR) concerns are often overlooked to the detriment of acquisition integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Meglio et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Vaara, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bagdadli, Hayton and Perfido (2014)</ref>, as well as <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Weber and Tarba (2010)</ref>, suggest that acquirers need appropriate HR practices for post-merger integration. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Graebner, Heimeriks, Huy and Vaara (2017)</ref> highlight the need of better understanding of post-acquisition integration with research opportunities on temporality, decision-making, and practices.</p><p>Our study probes agency in acquisition integration and presents an opportunity for acquisition research to examine separate roles at different managerial layers. For example, <ref type="bibr">Teerikangas and colleagues (2011)</ref>  </p></div>			</div>
