<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study investigates the key factors driving corporate green bond issuance across 19 European countries between 2013 and 2024, with a focus on institutional quality, financial market dynamics, and regulatory frameworks. Employing structural equation modeling, the research examines the interactions shaping green bond market growth. The findings underscore the pivotal role of institutional quality-particularly governance and transparency-in enhancing investor confidence and issuance volumes. However, deeper financial markets unexpectedly hinder green bond issuance, as resources are diverted toward traditional, highyield investments lacking sustainability mandates. Additionally, higher coupon rates deter issuers, further emphasizing the importance of cost-effective financing mechanisms. The study highlights the need for balanced policy interventions that streamline regulatory processes, reduce compliance burdens, and foster market access. These insights offer valuable guidance for strengthening green finance and advancing Europe's ambitious climate goals.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In recent years, the escalating urgency of addressing global environmental challenges has reshaped corporate strategies, with businesses increasingly embedding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into their decision-making. This shift represents a departure from shareholder-centric finance toward sustainable growth that balances economic and environmental goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Magill et al., 2015)</ref>. Yet, the academic debate on the impact of ESG adoption on firm value remains unresolved.</p><p>The global transition to sustainability is critical to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in reducing industrial CO2 emissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Sarkodie &amp; Strezov, 2018)</ref>. The Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for immediate climate action, but these goals require unprecedented financial investments. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates $53 trillion will be needed by 2035, with $14 trillion allocated to energy efficiency alone <ref type="bibr">(IEA, 2018)</ref>. In the EU, annual investments of $1.6 trillion will be essential from 2031 to 2050 to meet emissions reduction targets <ref type="bibr">(European Investment Bank, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Despite this pressing need, mobilizing private capital for climate initiatives remains challenging. Barriers include insufficient incentives, high risks of low-carbon technologies, and fragmented policy coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bhandary et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Polzin, 2017)</ref>. Green bonds have emerged as a critical tool to address these gaps. These instruments, earmarked exclusively for financing environmentally friendly projects, have seen global issuance grow from $103 billion in 2016 to $699 billion in 2021. However, green bonds still represent only 3-3.5% of the total bond market, reflecting significant untapped potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Sachs et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Europe leads the global green bond market, accounting for over 50% of total issuance in 2023.</p><p>The corporate green bond market, in particular, has expanded from 4.7% of total corporate bond issuance in 2020 to 11% in 2022 <ref type="bibr">(European Environment Agency, 2023)</ref>. This growth aligns with the EU's Green Deal, which aims to make Europe the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050. Yet, disparities in green bond adoption across EU member states, regulatory fragmentation, and challenges such as high issuance costs and greenwashing persist <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Flammer, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Zerbib, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>This study explores the drivers of corporate green bond issuance in Europe, focusing on the interplay of institutional quality, regulatory frameworks, and financial market conditions. By employing structural equation modeling (SEM) on a robust dataset, the research addresses gaps in existing literature by integrating institutional and market dynamics to offer actionable insights. The findings emphasize the critical role of governance, transparency, and balanced policies in fostering green finance.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows: Section 1 provides an overview of corporate green bond issuance in Europe. Section 2 reviews institutional, regulatory, and market determinants.</p><p>Section 3 outlines the research hypotheses derived from the literature. Section 4 details the methodology, including exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and SEM. Section 5 presents the results and discusses their implications. Finally, the conclusion summarizes the study's contributions and offers policy recommendations to enhance corporate engagement in green finance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Corporate Green Bond Issuance in Europe</head><p>The evolution of corporate objectives has shifted from a traditional focus on maximizing shareholder value to addressing broader stakeholder interests. Stakeholder theory emphasizes that a company's long-term success depends on balancing the expectations of diverse groups, including employees, customers, suppliers, and communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brenner &amp; Cochran, 1991)</ref>. This perspective fosters a more sustainable and strategic approach to business. However, challenges remain. Regulatory fragmentation complicates the issuance of green bonds across jurisdictions, particularly for multinational issuers <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Flammer, 2021)</ref>. Issuance costs, including certification and ongoing impact monitoring, are higher than for conventional bonds, posing barriers for smaller companies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ehlers &amp; Packer, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Zerbib, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Greenwashing practices, where environmental claims are misleading or exaggerated, deter investor confidence and emphasize the need for stricter oversight <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Xu et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Shi et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>While the market benefits from a "green premium" or greenium-strong demand that lowers yields for green bonds-this advantage does not always offset the higher costs of issuance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Nanayakkara &amp; Colombage, 2019)</ref>. Liquidity challenges also persist, particularly in regions and sectors with limited issuance, making it harder for investors to buy and sell green bonds without price penalties <ref type="bibr">(Tolliver et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Key Factors Driving Corporate Green Bond Market Growth</head><p>This paper investigates the drivers of the green bond market's growth in Europe, focusing on disparities across countries and emphasizing global institutional, economic, and governance factors. By shifting attention beyond issuer motivations, the study provides a comprehensive perspective on market dynamics and determinants.</p><p>Previous research has primarily explored regulatory support and issuer-investor preferences in promoting green projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Tu et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Azhgaliyeva &amp; Kapsalyamova, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Spielberger, 2024)</ref> but has overlooked external factors shaping the broader market. This study addresses this gap, emphasizing the dual role of financial market development in green finance.</p><p>On one hand, financial markets enhance access to capital and improve allocation, which could unintentionally favor high-emission sectors unless sustainability policies intervene. While such financing stimulates economic growth, it may reduce the appeal of long-term green bonds when focused on short-term, high-yield industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Colombage, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Pradhan et al., 2020)</ref>. On the other hand, developed financial markets can actively channel resources into eco-friendly initiatives, fostering sustainable technologies and ESG-focused investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aggarwal &amp; Goodell, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tamazian et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pan et al., 2019)</ref>. This is evident in sectors like renewable energy and electric vehicles.</p><p>However, financial market development alone is insufficient. Studies by <ref type="bibr">Horobet et al. (2022)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Acheampong et al. (2020)</ref> highlight the pivotal role of regulatory frameworks in directing resources toward sustainable goals. Thus, we hypothesize:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">The Role of Environmental Regulatory Frameworks</head><p>The literature emphasizes the pivotal role of environmental regulatory frameworks in driving the growth of the green bond market. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Flammer (2021)</ref> highlights that environmental regulations incentivize corporations to issue green bonds, positioning them as key instruments for financing sustainable projects. Hyun, Park, and Tian (2020) underscore how supportive regulatory environments reduce issuance costs and enable favorable pricing, making green bonds more attractive. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Zerbib (2019)</ref> and Packer &amp; Ehlers (2017) further explore the impact of regulatory backing and certifications on demand and pricing, noting that robust policies and standards build investor confidence and foster market growth. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Tolliver et al. (2020)</ref> stress the importance of well-designed policies in establishing incentives, shaping market structures, and attracting participants to green finance.</p><p>However, regulatory frameworks can also present challenges. Complex or stringent requirements may raise compliance costs, discouraging participation from smaller issuers.</p><p>Inconsistent policies or high certification demands can create volatility, reducing investor confidence. Policies prioritizing short-term economic objectives over sustainability risk diverting resources toward high-emission sectors, undermining green bond market development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Impact of Institutional Quality</head><p>Institutional quality-encompassing governance, regulatory transparency, and effective legislative frameworks-plays a critical role in fostering green bond issuance. Strong institutions enhance investor confidence, enabling financial markets to issue and absorb green instruments, whereas weak or corrupt systems undermine these efforts. Studies affirm this relationship; for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Xu et al. (2023)</ref> found that indicators like control of corruption, government effectiveness, and rule of law positively correlate with green finance in South Asia.</p><p>Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Nguyen et al. (2023)</ref> demonstrated that robust institutional quality strengthens the link between national culture and green bond issuance, especially in lower-income nations.</p><p>Institutional quality also amplifies the effectiveness of environmental policy support. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Acemoglu et al. (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Panayotou (1997)</ref> emphasize its mediating role in ensuring policy success, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dinda (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dasgupta et al. (2002)</ref> note its impact on governance and corruption in shaping environmental outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borghesi and Vercelli (2003)</ref> further highlight how governance frameworks mitigate globalization's adverse effects, bolstering sustainable policies.</p><p>These findings underline the importance of enforcing environmental standards and regulations to advance green finance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Impact of Issuance Characteristics</head><p>Issuance characteristics significantly shape the volume of corporate green bonds issued. Among these, the coupon rate is particularly influential. Lower coupon rates attract investors willing to trade financial returns for environmental impact, a phenomenon known as the "greenium." This dynamic reduces issuers' cost of capital and broadens participation in green bond markets.</p><p>Studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Flammer (2021)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gianfrate &amp; Peri (2019)</ref> confirm that lower coupon rates correlate with higher issuance volumes, demonstrating their critical role in market expansion.</p><p>The maturity period of green bonds also impacts issuance volumes. Institutional investors favor longer maturities for their stability and alignment with the extended timelines of environmental projects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hachenberg &amp; Schiereck (2018)</ref> show that this preference often drives higher issuance volumes, satisfying demand for sustainable, long-term returns.</p><p>The callable feature, allowing issuers to redeem bonds before maturity, has mixed implications.</p><p>While it may deter investors due to early repayment risks, especially in declining interest rate environments, it also offers issuers flexibility to refinance debt under favorable conditions. This flexibility can encourage issuance, particularly when investors are compensated with premium yields. ESG-focused investors may overlook callable risks, prioritizing environmental alignment, especially in rising interest rate scenarios.</p><p>Lastly, the sector in which a company operates plays a pivotal role. High-impact sectors facing regulatory pressures and opportunities for sustainable innovation tend to issue larger volumes of green bonds. These sectors benefit from investor preferences and government incentives, creating conducive conditions for significant green bond issuance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Macroeconomic Determinants</head><p>Macroeconomic factors such as inflation, unemployment, and government debt significantly shape the environment for corporate green bond issuance. These indicators influence investor behavior, borrowing costs, and the broader feasibility of green financing in diverse economic contexts.</p><p>Inflation is a key measure of economic stability, directly affecting default risk and borrowing costs. High inflation reduces government creditworthiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Nickel et al., 2011)</ref> and access to long-term financing, particularly in emerging economies <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Presbitero et al., 2016)</ref>. For green bonds, elevated inflation creates uncertainty, diminishing the appeal of long-term projects commonly financed by these instruments <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Tu et al., 2020)</ref>. This instability discourages green bond issuance by increasing risks and costs.</p><p>Unemployment, a crucial social indicator, impacts green bond issuance through its influence on interest rates and investor behavior. In low-interest-rate environments, driven by central banks aiming to stimulate economic activity, green bonds become attractive due to reduced financing costs. Additionally, such conditions enhance corporate ESG profiles, aligning with sustainable investment goals. Conversely, during economic downturns marked by high unemployment, firms may prioritize liquidity and short-term financial stability, reducing green bond issuance. Increased credit spreads and diminished investor confidence further exacerbate these challenges.</p><p>Government debt influences corporate green bond issuance through its effects on market conditions and investor confidence. High debt levels can crowd out corporate bond issuance by increasing competition for capital and raising interest rate spreads <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Presbitero et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yamahaki et al., 2022)</ref>. Conversely, elevated public debt may push investors toward alternative assets like green bonds to diversify portfolios and manage risk. Additionally, governments facing fiscal pressures may promote green finance through public-private partnerships or incentives, creating opportunities for corporate issuers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research hypothesis</head><p>Building on the literature and theoretical frameworks, this study proposes the following hypotheses:</p><p>-H1: Financial market development influences corporate green bond issuance volumes, with outcomes contingent on capital allocation.</p><p>• H1a: Financial market access positively affects corporate green bond issuance.</p><p>• H1b: Financial market depth negatively affects corporate green bond issuance.</p><p>• H1c: Financial market efficiency negatively affects corporate green bond issuance.</p><p>-H2: Environmental regulatory frameworks positively influence the volume of corporate green bond issuance.</p><p>-H3: Institutional quality significantly impacts corporate green bond issuance.</p><p>• H3a: Institutional quality positively influences corporate green bond issuance.</p><p>• H3b: Institutional quality mediates the relationship between policy support and green bond issuance volumes.</p><p>-H4: Issuance characteristics significantly influence corporate green bond issuance.</p><p>• H4a: Coupon rates negatively affect corporate green bond issuance volumes.</p><p>• H4b: Maturity periods positively influence corporate green bond issuance volumes.</p><p>• H4c: Callable features positively influence corporate green bond issuance volumes.</p><p>• H4d: Issuance volumes vary across sectors.</p><p>-H5: Macroeconomic factors shape corporate green bond issuance.</p><p>• H5a: Higher inflation rates reduce the volume of corporate green bond issuance.</p><p>• H5b: Unemployment rates have a dual impact on corporate green bond issuance, with both positive and negative effects.</p><p>• H5c: Government debt influences corporate green bond issuance by shaping investor demand and green finance policies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data and econometric methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Data source</head><p>This In this study, a range of supplementary data sources are utilized to provide a comprehensive analysis:</p><p>1. Climate Policies: The Climate Actions and Policies Measurement Framework (CAPMF) database is integrated to track climate mitigation efforts using 130 policy variables across 50 countries from 1990 to 2022. A two-year lag accounts for the time required for policy changes to influence corporate decisions and market dynamics.</p><p>2. Green Growth Metrics: Data from the OECD Green Growth Indicators database is employed to monitor sustainable economic progress. These metrics are also lagged by two years to reflect their impact on corporate green bond issuance.</p><p>3. Economic Indicators: Additional data includes economic metrics from the OECD database and the IMF Financial Development Index, which measures financial system development across countries. Insights into global economic trends, such as inflation and government debt, are sourced from the IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO). A one-year lag is introduced for economic variables.</p><p>4. Governance Quality: Governance metrics are drawn from the World Bank's Worldwide</p><p>Governance Indicators (WGI), providing assessments of governance across countries.</p><p>A two-year lag accounts for the time needed for governance changes to influence corporate decisions.</p><p>These datasets collectively enhance the study's robustness by incorporating climate policies, economic factors, financial development, and governance quality.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Econometric methodology</head><p>Building on prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Huang &amp; Yue, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Tolliver et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Liu et al., 2022)</ref>, this paper employs a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to investigate the determinants of corporate green bond issuance in Europe. SEM is a robust method for examining complex relationships among variables and explaining variance in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bollen, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kline, 2023)</ref>. It enables the integration of observed (manifest) and unobserved (latent) variables, allowing a detailed exploration of how economic, institutional, and policy factors interact to shape green bond issuance. Path diagrams used within the SEM framework visually represent causal relationships, enhancing clarity about market dynamics. This method is especially suited for corporate green finance as it consolidates economic indicators, institutional governance, and policy support into a cohesive model.</p><p>The SEM diagram (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) outlines a two-level model for analyzing the log of per capita corporate green bond issuance in Europe. At the first level, the model focuses on issuancespecific characteristics, such as callable status, maturity, coupon rate, and issuance currency.</p><p>Sectoral diversity is captured through dummy variables: "ccth_sector" includes consumer, communication, technology, and healthcare; "eu_sector" represents energy and utilities; "itlm_sector" covers industry, transportation, logistics, and materials; and the reference group comprises real estate, insurance, and financial services. This categorization facilitates a nuanced understanding of sectoral impacts on bond issuance volumes.</p><p>The second level examines macroeconomic and institutional factors. Key economic indicators, including financial development (spanning access, efficiency, and depth), inflation, unemployment, and government debt, provide insights into the macroeconomic conditions shaping green bond issuance. Institutional Governance and Policy Support are modeled as latent variables. Policy Support reflects the scope and enforcement of environmental policies at international, intersectoral, and sectoral levels. Institutional Governance includes metrics like control of corruption, regulatory quality, rule of law, and political stability. Together, these components highlight the broader economic and regulatory contexts influencing green bond issuance across Europe. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Data description</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Level 1: Issuance Characteristics</head><p>This level focuses on specific attributes related to corporate green bond issuances. The data includes:</p><p>• Callable: A dummy variable representing bonds that can be redeemed by the issuer before the maturity date, affecting investor returns.</p><p>• Coupon: The interest rate that the bond pays to its holders, which can influence investor demand based on market conditions.</p><p>• Log maturity: The natural logarithm of the bond's maturity period, measured in months.</p><p>• Euro: A dummy variable equal to 1 if the issuance currency is in euros, and 0 otherwise. These characteristics are critical for understanding how specific features of green bonds may influence their attractiveness and issuance volumes. The data for these issuance characteristics is primarily sourced from Bloomberg database.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Level 2: Market Conditions &amp; Economic Indicators</head><p>This level incorporates broader economic and institutional variables that indirectly impact green bond issuance:</p><p>• o Financial Institutions Efficiency: This sub-index assesses bank efficiency through three dimensions: savings-to-investment intermediation efficiency (net interest margin and lending-deposit spread), operational efficiency (non-interest income to total income and overhead costs), and profitability (return on assets and equity).</p><p>• Unemployment: Reflects the economic stability of the region, as higher unemployment may affect corporate financing decisions. Unemployment data is typically obtained from national statistics agencies and OECD database.</p><p>• Inflation: Represents the rate of price increase, which can impact borrowing costs and investor sentiment regarding long-term investments like green bonds. Inflation rates are sourced from the IMF WEO database.</p><p>• Government Debt: Indicates the level of public debt, which can affect the cost of capital and influence investor confidence in the economic environment. Government debt data is also available from the IMF WEO database.</p><p>Additionally, this level includes latent variables such as:</p><p>• Institutional Governance: Encompasses aspects like control of corruption, government effectiveness, political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law, and voice and accountability. Data on these variables is obtained from the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI).</p><p>• Policy Support: This latent variable encompasses the policies and rigor of implementing international, intersectoral, and sectoral environmental policies, which can significantly impact the green bond market. Data for policy support is drawn from the CAPMF database, a structured and harmonized climate mitigation policy database developed by the OECD as part of the International Programme for Action on Climate. It tracks climate actions across 52 countries using 128 policy variables, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of various climate policies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results and discussion</head><p>To prepare for the structural equation model (SEM), an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on data from 19 European countries issuing corporate green bonds between 2013 and 2024. Variables with factor loadings above 0.6 were retained as latent and exogenous variables for the SEM. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) followed to validate the latent constructs and ensure model fit. These analyses informed the SEM design, integrating validated latent variables and their corresponding manifest variables.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref> summarizes reliability and validity tests, confirming strong data reliability. Bartlett's sphericity tests are significant at the 1% level, while the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) values for two latent variables are 0.878 and 0.758, demonstrating good validity and a robust basis for the SEM analysis. The structural equation model (SEM) estimation results, summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref>, shed light on the factors influencing corporate green bond issuance. The dependent variable is the logarithm of the real amount of corporate (non-bank) green bond issuances per capita, ensuring a balanced analysis. Normalizing by population size addresses the 2021 green bond issuance surge and mitigates sample imbalances in the SEM framework. This standardization enhances comparability across years, reduces the dominance of high-issuance periods, and offsets the disproportionate influence of large issuers such as France and Germany. By minimizing variance from absolute issuance differences, this approach facilitates fairer cross-country and cross-period comparisons.</p><p>The findings highlight a complex interaction among financial market development, institutional quality, policy support, issuance characteristics, and macroeconomic conditions, driving green bond market expansion. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Financial Market Development (H1)</head><p>The hypothesis that financial market development drives green bond issuance is partially supported, with contrasting effects across market components. Financial market access positively influences issuance volumes, aligning with expectations that broader access enables greater participation in green finance by both issuers and investors. This inclusive environment fosters the growth of corporate green bond issuance. However, financial market depth, measured through metrics like stock market capitalization to GDP and private debt securities to GDP, exhibits a negative impact. Deeper markets may prioritize high-yield or traditional financial products over long-term, low-return green bonds unless sustainability incentives are in place.</p><p>Additionally, financial market efficiency shows a negative relationship with green bond issuance. Highly efficient markets, focused on cost minimization and short-term gains, may deprioritize green bonds due to higher transaction costs and lower yields. These findings highlight that while broader market access supports green finance, deeper and more efficient markets may hinder it without sustainability-focused policies.</p><p>Interestingly, our findings diverge from existing literature, which primarily links financial market depth to broader green growth. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yuan et al. (2023)</ref> identify a U-shaped relationship between financial market depth and green growth, suggesting that initially, deeper markets may hinder green growth but later facilitate it as maturity advances. This dynamic underscore the nuanced role of financial markets in environmental sustainability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Institutional Quality and Policy Support (H2, H3)</head><p>Policy support influences green bond issuance both directly and indirectly. Directly, environmental policy support exhibits a surprising negative effect on green bond issuance per capita. This suggests that high compliance costs, complex regulations, and operational challenges may deter issuers, particularly smaller firms with limited resources. Policies without clear incentives or those imposing extensive certification and reporting requirements could inadvertently hinder green bond growth. This finding contrasts with <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mertzanis (2023)</ref>, who identified a positive link between diverse energy policies and green bond issuance across 70 countries from 1991 to 2021. Indirectly, policy support significantly enhances institutional quality, which positively impacts green bond issuance. Institutional quality mediates policy frameworks, translating them into market stability, transparency, and improved investor confidence. For example, the European Green Bond Standard (EGBS) highlights how strong governance fosters clarity and trust in green finance, encouraging higher issuance volumes.</p><p>These results suggest that governance-focused policies are more effective in advancing green finance than standalone regulatory measures, aligning with Tolliver (2020).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Macroeconomic Determinants (H5)</head><p>The analysis of macroeconomic variables reveals nuanced effects on green bond issuance.</p><p>Elevated inflation rates tend to impede issuance by raising borrowing costs and creating economic uncertainties, though this relationship lacks statistical significance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>The corporate green bond market in Europe has emerged as a critical mechanism for mobilizing private capital to address pressing environmental challenges and advance sustainable development. This study sheds light on the complex interplay of factors driving corporate green bond issuance, including financial market development, institutional quality, policy support, issuance characteristics, and macroeconomic conditions.</p><p>The findings highlight the dual role of financial markets. While greater access to financial services facilitates broader participation in green finance, deeper and more efficient markets tend to prioritize traditional, high-yield investments over green bonds. This underscores the importance of targeted sustainability mandates and policies that can redirect financial flows toward green projects.</p><p>Institutional quality and governance emerge as pivotal drivers of green bond issuance.</p><p>Enhanced regulatory quality, transparency, and control of corruption stabilize financial markets and bolster investor confidence, enabling green finance growth. However, policy frameworks imposing high compliance costs or complex certification requirements deter smaller issuers, highlighting the need for streamlined processes to support more inclusive participation.</p><p>Issuance characteristics significantly shape green bond volumes. Lower coupon rates attract environmentally conscious investors willing to accept reduced yields, while callable bonds and longer maturities align with the extended timelines of environmental projects. Sectoral differences remain pronounced, with energy and utilities leading issuance due to regulatory pressures and their capacity for meaningful environmental impact. Expanding green finance to underrepresented sectors could unlock further potential for sustainable growth.</p><p>Macroeconomic conditions add another layer of complexity. Inflation exerts a mild negative influence by increasing borrowing costs, whereas higher unemployment correlates with increased green bond issuance, as sustainable projects are often leveraged during economic downturns to stimulate job creation. Additionally, government debt provides mixed implications, as investors view green bonds as secure alternatives during times of fiscal uncertainty.</p><p>From a policy perspective, the findings emphasize the need to enhance institutional quality through measures that promote regulatory efficiency, transparency, and accountability.</p><p>Streamlining regulatory frameworks, particularly for smaller issuers, is crucial to making green finance more accessible. Tailored incentives, such as tax benefits, public-private partnerships, and subsidies for certification costs, can further promote green bond issuance. Moreover, fostering collaboration across EU member states to harmonize green bond standards would reduce regulatory fragmentation and facilitate cross-border issuances.</p><p>Future research should explore the evolving role of European regulations in shaping green bond adoption, with a focus on industry-specific and regional variations. Additionally, the interplay between traditional green bonds and emerging instruments, such as sustainability-linked bonds, warrants further examination to understand their complementary roles in advancing sustainable finance. Expanding the scope to global markets could also provide valuable insights into institutional frameworks and investor behaviors, offering lessons to enhance green finance initiatives worldwide.</p><p>The corporate green bond market holds immense potential to drive Europe's transition to a carbon-neutral economy. By addressing existing barriers and fostering an enabling environment through institutional and policy innovations, stakeholders can accelerate the growth of green finance, bridging the gap between financial markets and climate action.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
