<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the present study was to examine the mediation effects of resilience and stress, two perceived opposite constructs, in the relationship between mindfulness and happiness. Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales short version-21 were administered to 523 undergraduate university students in India. Structural Equation Modeling with bootstrapping was applied to test the mediating effects of resilience and stress. Results showed that resilience and stress partially mediated the mindfulnesshappiness relationship. In addition, resilience partially mediated the relationship of mindfulness to stress. Findings suggest that mindfulness may play an influential role in enhancing happiness through the mediating effects of resilience and stress.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Happiness is unquestionably a personal investment worthy of pursuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Howells et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Srivastava and Muhammad, 2021)</ref>, which is believed to create life successes and also authenticate existence <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Lyubomksky et al., 2005)</ref>. Most of the human race attempts to achieve a state of thriving by rating themselves as satisfied with lives and being happy <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Myers, 2000)</ref>. As a direct indicator of quality of life, happiness is an invaluable personal goal pursued by all individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Tay et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Lord et al., 2020)</ref> as it has positive effects on longevity and on many positive life outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Seligman et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lawrence et al., 2015)</ref>. Individuals associate happiness with multiple personal benefits such as health, increased earnings, longer life expectancy, better social relationships, and a happier marriage <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Lyubomirsky et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Diener et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Diener et al., , 2018))</ref>. Thus, in the contemporary times, happiness has become a trending area for academic, management and national research <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Veenhoven, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Mindfulness is an English translation of the 2,500 year-old Pali word "sati, " a term which according to Theravada Buddhism connotes "awareness, " "attention" and "remembering or intention" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bodhi, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Analayo, 2013)</ref>. Mindfulness can be also conceptualized as a state, which can be induced through different practices (e.g., meditation), or as a trait, which is a stable disposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brown and Ryan, 2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kabat-Zinn (1994)</ref> defined mindfulness as "the awareness that arises from paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally." Comprising of self-regulation of attention and orientation to experience, mindfulness helps in establishing continuing contact with experience and it may contribute to many factors related to psychological health <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Keng et al., 2011)</ref> and happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Coo and Salanova, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Resilience embodies the personal qualities in individuals, which enable them to thrive in stressful and adverse situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Connor and Davidson, 2003)</ref>. Individuals can maintain their psychological and physical health as resilience provides them protective factors that help in absorbing negative outcomes during difficult times <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Ryff and Singer, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Connor and Davidson, 2003)</ref>. Resilience also plays a vital role in avoiding negative behavioral outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Ryff and Singer, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Ryff et al., 1998)</ref> and in enhancing overall happiness.</p><p>Stress may comprise of both minor stressful events and major stressful life events, which bring a major change in individual's circumstances or status <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Wouters et al., 2018)</ref> and are associated with a range of psychological disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Francis et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Roos et al., 2018)</ref>. Psychological stress extends the risk for chronic diseases, which constitute the greatest threat to public health, including heart disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cohen et al., 2007)</ref>. Taking into consideration the relationships between stress, physical health, and poor health behaviors; <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(McEwen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Sirois, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Jain and Cohen, 2013)</ref>, it becomes imperative to study how to decrease stress levels.</p><p>Interestingly, prior research suggests that mindfulness leads to positive affect and subjective vitality, and prevents the experience of negative affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(St-Louis et al., 2018)</ref>. Specific to our study, we find that mindfulness is correlated with both resilience and stress. Subjective sense of happiness may be increased by increasing resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hwang et al., 2018)</ref>, and by reducing stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Schiffrin and Nelson, 2010)</ref>. Though mindfulness is conducive for happiness as it facilitates awareness of what is worth doing, and doing it well <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Ryan et al., 2008)</ref> little is known about how effectively mindfulness translates into happiness by simultaneously decreasing stress and enhancing resilience. Prior research suggests individual relationships among mindfulness, stress, resilience and happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Tran et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Coo and Salanova, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hwang et al., 2018)</ref>; however, to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated effects of mindfulness on happiness through both resilience and stress together as mediators of these effects. This is particularly important as most studies focusing on stress, emphasize psychopathology rather than human strengths, whereas studies focusing on happiness tend to emphasize human strengths and qualities, resilience being a central one <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Snyder et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Addressing the need for a better conceptual understanding of the mechanism behind translating mindfulness to happiness, this paper attempts to investigate the role of resilience and stress, two perceived opposite constructs by drawing together prior academic research and a judiciously designed empirical study. We position our study on a sample of university students as resilience is viewed as an asset that supports university students' mental health requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hartley, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kelifa et al., 2021)</ref>. Secondly, university students experience more stress and issues related to mental health as compared to their peers from a non-university background <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Stallman, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Karyotaki et al., 2020)</ref>. And lastly, life at a university can be quite complex and demanding, which may require them to exercise ways of coping with stress and high pressure demands of competitive academic/coursework demands, striking balance between study and life, issues related to relationships and financial problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Karyotaki et al., 2020)</ref>. Thus, the current study may shed light on some potential psychological mechanism such as mindfulness which may help in improving university students' well-being. Examining mindfulness, resilience, and stress in university students will further contribute to knowledge in the field of happiness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS AND HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Determination Theory</head><p>We place our study within the theoretical framework of selfdetermination theory (SDT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Ryan and Deci, 2000)</ref>, which is an "organismic dialectic" approach to human motivation which has received extensive empirical validation in several life domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Ryan and Deci, 2017)</ref>. Three basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness stand at the core of SDT, which necessitate fully functional, healthy, and wellnessfilled life <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Ryan, 2013)</ref>. While the need for autonomy refers to behavioral experience which is out of will, chosen, and done with a reflective sense, need for competence refers to the experience of skill development and gaining mastery in behavioral pursuits. Similarly, need for relatedness refers to the experience of respect toward others who are important to an individual. All these needs are key psychological nutrients that are essential for psychological growth, integrated functioning, and well-being.</p><p>Mindfulness is aptly postulated in SDT. Typified as an "allowing" form of awareness, mindfulness quiets the ego and bares the attention to witness internal and external events as naturally as they occur. There is no defense or cognitive distortion while viewing the events, rather a more objective, dispassionate view of events <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Shapiro et al., 2007)</ref> marked by a clear and reflective mind and clarity of mind <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Narayanan and Moynihan, 2006)</ref>. As such, individuals with higher levels of mindfulness feel lesser amounts of stress and experience lesser physical complaints. Prior literature suggests that mindfulness leads to better awareness of internal phenomena and external conditions that an individual is experiencing. Internal phenomena may include emotions and needs, and external conditions may include pressures and stress. Thus, mindful people are in a better position to engage in reflective choices and actions that are congruent with their self <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Ryan and Deci, 2017)</ref>. Relevant to our study, research has shown that individuals who are higher in mindfulness are less likely to experience basic psychological need frustration <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Schultz et al., 2015)</ref> such as stress. Mindfulness supports self-regulation, which is a more autonomous form, and also backs more intrinsic versus extrinsic goal selection, thereby leading to a meaningful life and happiness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mindfulness and Happiness</head><p>Mindfulness is inherently linked to greater happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Huta and Ryan, 2010)</ref>. Mindfulness promotes happiness by bringing greater clarity and vividness to current experience without filtering it through any discriminatory thought <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brown and Ryan, 2003)</ref>. Mindfulness stimulates an upward spiral of positive affect and cognition, which contributes to higher happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Garland et al., 2015)</ref>. Prior research indicates that mindfulness is positively associated with happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Coo and Salanova, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chin et al., 2019)</ref>. Considering the rationale discussed above and the empirical evidence provided, it is feasible to hypothesize that mindfulness is positively related to happiness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resilience as Mediator Between Mindfulness and Happiness</head><p>Mindfulness was shown to have the potential to cultivate resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Nila et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Wang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hwang et al., 2018)</ref>. People with high levels of mindfulness gain enhanced ability to respond appropriately to difficult situations without reacting in automatic and non-adaptive ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Langer and Moldoveanu, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Wallace and Shapiro, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Sass et al., 2019)</ref>. Mindfulness training is an efficacious intervention for enhancing resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Felver et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Zarotti et al., 2020)</ref> and the association between the two has been confirmed in various empirical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Pidgeon et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kemper et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Resilience plays an important role in increasing positive psychological outcomes; and decreasing negative outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Ryff and Singer, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Ryff et al., 1998)</ref> and in enhancing overall happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bajaj and Pande, 2016)</ref>. Prior research has shown that resilience is a human strength that may have a considerable impact on subjective well-being or happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Lü et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Tan et al., 2021)</ref>. Resilient individuals are more persistent in adverse situations, cope better with everyday difficulties and have more capacity to respond to life stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mandleco and Peery, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hays-Grudo et al., 2021)</ref>. Character strengths such as hope, zest, and bravery play an instrumental role in resilience-related factors such as optimism and positive affect (Martínez-Martí and Ruch, 2017), which eventually help resilient individuals face stressors in a positive way. When faced with a stressor, such individuals experience more positive emotions and thus, are able to quickly rebound from stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Ong et al., 2006)</ref>. Therefore individuals with higher resilience can maintain physical and psychological health by absorbing negative consequences of difficult times <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Connor and Davidson, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the associations of mindfulness and happiness and the potential role of resilience in mindfulness and happiness, it is plausible to suggest that resilience mediates the relationship between mindfulness and happiness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stress as a Mediator Between Mindfulness and Happiness</head><p>It is fascinating to see that prior research gives us evidence that mindfulness has the potential to reduce mental health issues such as stress, and enhance wellbeing-related outcomes such as happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lomas et al., 2019)</ref>. Negatively related with stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Tran et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kriakous et al., 2021)</ref>, mindfulness improves an individual's ability to deal with life stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Duprey et al., 2018)</ref> by reducing the propensity to perceive situations in ways that activate stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Shapiro et al., 2007)</ref>. Higher mindfulness may lead to lowered stress due to decreased negative cognitive appraisals of threatening events and experiences. Individuals having high mindfulness levels are less likely to appraise their day-to-day experiences as stressful <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Weinstein et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arlt Mutch et al., 2021)</ref>. Their ability to regulate their emotions may make them more adaptable to various stressors in their environment as they behave in ways that are consistent with their values <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brown and Ryan, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Palmer and Rodger, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>It is a common conception that stress impedes happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Schiffrin and Nelson, 2010)</ref>. Chronic stressors may significantly affect the development of negative emotional responses which may lead to lower happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Schiffrin and Nelson, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Eppelmann et al., 2016)</ref> suggesting that individuals with less stress levels may experience increased levels of happiness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Ruiz-Aranda et al. (2014)</ref> in their longitudinal research found that individuals with high emotional intelligence evaluated situations as less stressful, which resulted in higher happiness. Managing stress may lead to reducing worrisome habits, which may further lead to increase in happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kaiser-Greenland, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Given the associations between mindfulness, stress, and happiness, we can suggest that mindfulness plays an important role in decreasing stress and stress-related outcomes and increasing subjective sense of happiness and its related outcomes. Considering how mindfulness is instrumental in decreasing stress and how lowered levels of stress may increase happiness, we hypothesize that stress may mediate the relationship of mindfulness with happiness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resilience to Stress</head><p>Resilience is a stress resistance resource for individuals who experience traumatic life circumstances as it buffers the negative impact of stress. The concept of resilience explains why some individuals, in spite of high levels of stress, thrive and get enhanced levels of ability to manage future challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kinman and Grant, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Komachi and Kamibeppu, 2018)</ref>. In a review of resilience and stress, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Ozbay et al. (2007)</ref>, suggested that resilience has the potential to reduce the effects of stress. Recent studies have suggested that enhanced resilience may help in mitigating the negative effects of occupational stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hao et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kaplan et al., 2017)</ref>. Thus, we hypothesize that resilience is negative related to stress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resilience as Moderator Between Mindfulness and Happiness</head><p>Previous studies have also shown that resilient individuals could maintain their physical and psychological health both through buffering negative consequences from difficult times and through improving psychological well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Ryff and Singer, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Connor and Davidson, 2003)</ref>. Resilience is also thought to be an important protective factor against the development of psychiatric disorder in the face of adversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Rutter, 1985)</ref>. From above reasoning, it was hypothesized that resilience may also act as a moderator between the relationship of mindfulness to happiness. Thus, we hypothesize that resilience moderates the relationship between mindfulness and happiness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedure</head><p>We invited students from an Indian university to participate in our study. 523 undergraduate students (359 males and 164 females) were recruited based on their consent to participate in the research. These students were pursuing undergraduate degree in engineering. Their average age was 20.1 years (SD = 1.3), wherein highest age was 24 and lowest age was 17. After obtaining informed consent, participants were asked to complete scales of mindfulness, resilience, stress, and happiness, in classroom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mindfulness</head><p>The 15-item Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) was used to measure participants' mindfulness scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brown and Ryan, 2003)</ref>. The MAAS is a 15 items scale. It is a six-point rating scale that ranges from "almost always, " to "almost never." An example item is: "I rush through activities without being really attentive to them." The MASS has demonstrated good internal consistency, and good convergent and discriminant <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brown and Ryan, 2003)</ref> validity. The internal consistency of the present sample was 0.82.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resilience</head><p>The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) was used to measure participants' resilience scores (A10-item version of The CD-RISC was administered) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Campbell-Sills and Stein, 2007)</ref>. An example item is: "See humorous side of problems." This scale has demonstrated good internal consistency and construct validity in prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Campbell-Sills and Stein, 2007)</ref>. The internal consistency of the present sample was 0.84.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Happiness</head><p>The Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS) was used to measure participants' happiness scores. The SHS is a four-item scale that assesses participants' subjective sense of global happiness. This scale is a seven-point scale (e.g., from less happy to more happy). An example item is "Compared to my peers, I consider myself. . ." This scale has demonstrated good levels of reliability and validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Lyubomirsky and Lepper, 1999)</ref>. The internal consistency of the present sample was 0.80.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stress</head><p>Stress was assessed using the short version of Depression Anxiety Stress Scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995)</ref>. Seven items for stress were adapted from DASS-21 to assess stress level of individuals. The participants rated themselves on a Likert scale that ranged from 0 (did not apply to me) to 3 (applied to me very much or most of the time). It includes items such as, "I tended to over-react to situations." This scale has also demonstrated good levels of reliability and validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hamill et al., 2015)</ref>. The internal consistency of the present sample was 0.72.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Means, standard deviations, and correlations of the variables were computed using SPSS 22.0. The role of resilience and stress as mediators was tested via structural equation modeling (SEM), which is a multivariate technique used to analyze observed and latent variables relationships. It can be viewed as a combination of factor analysis and multivariate regression analysis. Two methods are widely used in power analysis for SEM. One is based on the likelihood ratio test proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Satorra and Saris (1985)</ref>. The other is based on RMSEA proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">MacCallum et al. (1996)</ref>. This function is for SEM power analysis based on RMSEA.</p><p>We followed the two-step procedure of SEM using AMOS 18.0. First, we calculated the measurement model, and satisfactory results were obtained. Then, in the second step, we examined the structural model. We used indices recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hu and Bentler (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kline (2011)</ref> to assess the overall fit of the model to data. We divided the items of each latent factor into parcels to control inflated measurement errors. A random assignment approach was used to create parcels <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Little et al., 2002)</ref>. Three parcels for mindfulness latent factor and resilience latent factor and stress latent factor were formed. Happiness latent factor was defined using all items of the SHS as it consisted of only four items.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Means, standard deviations, and correlations of all the study variables are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The measurement model of the study comprised 13 observed variables and four latent variables (mindfulness, resilience, stress, and happiness). This model showed an excellent fit to the data: χ2 = 81.9; df = 59; χ2/df = 1.39; RMSEA = 0.027; PClose = 0.999; SRMR = 0.031; and CFI = 0.992. All indicators truly represented their latent factors. Then, we tested the structural model. A partially mediated model, Model 1, (with resilience and stress as mediators) and two direct paths one from resilience to happiness and one from stress to happiness revealed an excellent fit to the data: χ2 = 100.56, df = 60, χ2/df = 1.68; CFI = 0.986; SRMR = 0.051; RMSEA = 0.036; and PClose = 0.974. The results showed that the direct path coefficients in the proposed directions were significant, indicated that resilience and stress partially mediated the relationship of mindfulness to happiness (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Then, we tested Model 2, a full mediation model having direct path from mindfulness to happiness constrained to zero. The comparison of Model 1 and Model 2 was conducted using chi-square difference test. The fit of the Model 2 decreased significantly, after eliminating the above direct path from mindfulness to happiness, ( χ2 (1, N = 523) = 10.13, p &lt; 0.001). The comparison of results between Model 1 and Model 2 indicated that Model 1 was a better fit than Model 2. To find out the best model, alternative models were also tested. In Model 3 (first alternative model), we added a path from resilience to stress. Model 3 in comparison to Model 1 provided a better fit to the  The mediation effects of resilience and stress on the relationship of mindfulness and happiness were tested using bootstrapping procedures in AMOS. Using the original data set (N = 523), by random sampling, we generated 10,000 bootstrapping samples. The mediating effects of resilience and stress and their associated 95% confidence intervals are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. 95% CI values of indirect effects of mindfulness on happiness indicated that resilience and stress significantly mediated the relationship between mindfulness and happiness.</p><p>We further examined various alternative models to determine the best model. These alternative models were formed using different associations of the study variables. An alternative model (Model 4) was tested with mindfulness as mediating variable, resilience/stress as exogenous variables, and happiness as outcome variable. Model 4 also fit the data well: χ2 = 121.83, df = 60; RMSEA = 0.044; PClose = 0.781; SRMR = 0.078; and   <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, Model 3 had smaller AIC and ECVI values than the other models. Model 3 also had the better fit to data. Thus, in conclusion, the preferred model (Model 3) indicated that resilience and stress partially mediated the relationship between mindfulness and happiness.</p><p>In the first regression analysis, the dependent variable was happiness. Age and gender were entered at Step 1. These two variables accounted for small and insignificant variance in happiness (R 2 = 0.004).

The resilience score was entered at Step 3 and was also a significant predictor, accounting for an additional 13.7% of the variance and increasing R 2 to 0.229. At Step 4, the interaction of mindfulness and resilience was a significant predictor of happiness accounting for an additional 1.5% of the variance and raising R 2 to 0.244. Thus, findings support moderation by resilience of the relationship between mindfulness and happiness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gender Differences</head><p>In order to examine gender differences. We compared the first model (which allows the structural paths to vary across sexes) with the second model (which constrains the structural paths between males and females to be equal). We tested the invariance in factor loadings between the two groups, i.e., male and female, and found no significant difference between the first model and the constrained model, χ2 (6, N = 523) = 4.73, p = 0.579. This suggested that there were no significant gender differences. We also tested the path coefficients for each of the relationships and found that all paths didn't differ across sexes.</p></div>

Path coefficients for each of the relationships were also tested, and it was found that all paths didn't differ across the two ages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The current study examined the relationship of mindfulness and happiness along with the mediation effects of resilience and stress on this relationship. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore two perceived opposite mediators together of the relationship of mindfulness and happiness. Results of the study show that mindfulness is positively related to resilience and happiness; and is negatively related to stress. Results also show that resilience is positively related to happiness, negatively related to stress, and moderates the relationship between mindfulness and happiness thus strengthening its role in inculcating happiness. These results are consistent with earlier studies showing positive relationships between mindfulness and happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Coo and Salanova, 2018)</ref>; mindfulness and resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Pidgeon et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hwang et al., 2018)</ref>; and resilience and happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Lü et al., 2014)</ref>. The results are also in line with prior research that indicates negative relationship between mindfulness and stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Palmer and Rodger, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Tran et al., 2014)</ref>; resilience and stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hao et al., 2015)</ref>; and stress and happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abdollahi et al., 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, the findings of the current study reveal that resilience and stress partially mediate the relationship of mindfulness to happiness. These findings imply that resilience and stress might explain the relationship between mindfulness and happiness, to an extent. It means individuals with high levels of mindfulness are likely to show enhanced resilience, which in turn contributes to higher levels of happiness. Individuals with higher mindfulness levels are also likely to show lower stress, which in turn contributes to higher levels of happiness.</p><p>A potential interpretation may be that mindful individuals have higher regulation of attention, emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chambers et al., 2009)</ref>, and higher self-control <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Black et al., 2011)</ref>. These abilities are the backbone of developing better resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Wills and Bantum, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Jain and Cohen, 2013)</ref>, and since resilience in the face of stress is a key aspect of a healthy brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(McEwen, 2016)</ref> as it allows better coping up with stress, it subsequently increases happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Feder et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fletcher and Sarkar, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Lü et al., 2014)</ref>. In addition, mindfulness is related with increase in self-regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hülsheger et al., 2013)</ref>, and decrease in stress and negative emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jimenez et al., 2010)</ref>. Therefore, overall mindfulness may lead to increase in resilience and decrease in stress, which on their turn increase happiness.</p><p>From a theoretical perspective, our study strengthens the postulation of mindfulness in self-determination theory. In line with existing proposition that mindfulness helps to bring about autonomous form of motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Ryan et al., 2021)</ref>, our study gives evidence that students with higher mindfulness tend to be more aware of their internal phenomena such as needs and emotions and external phenomena such as conflicts and pressure, and are less likely to get influenced by automatic responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(de Bruin et al., 2015)</ref>. As such, they are at a better position to engage in choices that are reflective and actions that are congruent with their self <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Donald et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Our study also extends the literature on mindfulness as it suggests a pathway of the positive effects of mindfulness on happiness through increasing resilience and simultaneously lowering stress. Most of the early research has focused on either reducing stress or enhancing resilience. In contrast, our research is the first study, to the best of our knowledge that examines the combined role of increasing resilience and lowering stress to enhance happiness. Specifically, our research suggests that higher levels of mindfulness inculcate high levels of resilience, which helps in lowering stress and as result, increasing happiness. Our findings thus replicate and extend previous findings linking mindfulness to happiness among university students <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Palmer and Rodger, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Miller et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Galante et al., 2018)</ref> and offer a better explanation of the process by which this occurs. Interestingly, whereas much of the research has focused separately on how mindfulness leads to lower stress and increase resilience, our study shows a dual effect of both stress and resilience on happiness.</p><p>Our study conveys several important implications for student development at university level. As mindfulness is negatively related to stress, it may have the potential to reduce their difficulties (Kabat-Zinn, 1990) and enhance their psychological well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baer, 2003)</ref>. The findings strengthen the adaptive qualities of mindfulness for students who may use it to cope with stress at the time of transitioning to the university. Adolescent phase particularly puts a lot of demand on the students at the time of adjusting in the university environment leading to high levels of stress. As the university students face high levels of stress, it is important to devise interventions to decrease stress and enhance well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Ward-Griffin et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>From a practical perspective, the study findings can help in designing interventions that help individuals increase their resilience and decrease their stress in order to make a positive impact on mental health. Psychosocial factors that are associated with resilience include high coping self-efficacy, ability to reframe adversity in a more positive light, attention to health, good cardiovascular fitness, and the capacity to quickly recover from stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Southwick and Charney, 2012)</ref>. These resilience-promoting psychosocial factors may be cultivated through mindfulness training, which can be beneficial for an individual throughout the life span. Thus, the current study may be beneficial in giving suggestions for designing appropriate interventions for enhancing happiness by increasing resilience, lowering stress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS</head><p>The current research has some limitations that should be addressed. First, a cross-sectional research design has been used, making it difficult to draw any causal relationships among the study variables. In order to overcome this limitation, longitudinal or experimental designs may be used in future research. The second limitation is the use of self-report measures in assessing the variables, which poses a threat to internal validity as respondents may be biased, due to social desirability. To reduce self-report bias, multiple methods (e.g., peers, parents, and friends) for evaluation can be used in future research. Third limitation is the use of a student sample. We encourage future research to expand this by including other samples such as working professionals. Fourth limitation is that no information was collected regarding the presence of any mental disorder in the sample of students. We suggest using multi-facets mindfulness scales, and to explore which facets of mindfulness relate most to resilience, happiness, and stress. The role of other mediating variables such as psychological capital, altruism, and psychological flexibility may be also tested to further understand the mindfulness-happiness relationship. We believe it will be important to further explore the effects of social support, emotional intelligence, and parents' mindfulness on happiness through resilience and stress.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1 | The Structural Equation Model regarding the mediating effect of resilience in the relationship of mindfulness to happiness, and stress.
