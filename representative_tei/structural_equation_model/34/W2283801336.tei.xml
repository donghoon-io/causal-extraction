<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Current developments in tourism studies have sought to link international education experience to other domains of people's lives. Although the literature on tourist experience as well as various perspectives pertaining to acculturation experience towards intention are quite large, this thesis maintains that some of these perspectives on how acculturation experiences are related to intentions are still too ambiguous.</p><p>Therefore, this thesis presents a threefold idea of the phenomenon of the educational tourist acculturation experience. Reviews suggest that there has been little attempt to link social-psychological research on international students to wider tourism research.</p><p>Based on reviews of tourism and general psychological literature, this thesis argues that international students' destination-loyalty intention are influenced by motivation, cultural orientation, adaptation, individuals' personal values and experiences arising during acculturation. It is contended that this forms the basis of preferences to revisit and to recommend a destination to others. The following is the primary objective of this thesis; namely, how do international students' destination motivation, cultural orientation, adaptation, personal values, subjective well-being and acculturation experiences influence destination-loyalty intention? This was done to gain a better understanding of international students' destination loyalty intentions. In line with this objective, the thesis had three aims:</p><p>The first was to see how international students' destination motivation (pull and push), cultural orientation and adaptation influence destination-loyalty intention. The second was to understand how the basic personal values influence international students' subjective well-being and subsequently destination-loyalty intention. The third aim was to investigate the relationship between the experiences arising during acculturation (i.e., perceived discrimination and orientation to mainstream culture) and life satisfaction on the one hand and destination-loyalty intention on the other.</p><p>The thesis is made up of three studies, and data for all studies were collected using an online survey among international students at the University of Bergen.

Your academic and moral support, patience, knowledge and constructive comments throughout this project have been of great value to me. I have learned a lot from you all.</p><p>I would like to express my gratitude to all other colleagues and friends at the Department of Psychosocial Science and the entire Faculty of Psychology. You were a great resource.</p><p>I also wish to express my sincere gratitude to Signe Knappskog, who has helped me with various administrative issues to help make my stay in Norway possible. I am forever in debt for all the sacrifices you made to bring me this far.</p><p>My sincere thanks also go to the International Students' Office at University of Bergen and Arne Magnus Morken, for facilitating the data collection process for this study. I owe them my sincere gratitude for their generous and timely help. I would also like to convey my special thanks to the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia and Universiti Teknologi MARA, which gave me their generous sponsoring. Without their financial support, it would not have been possible for me to pursue and to complete this PhD project successfully. I owe my loving thanks especially to three of the most important persons during this whole process: my husband, Rozairi Ramli and my children, Afif Zharfan and Ayra Zafreen, for their sacrifices, understanding, endless love and spiritual support, through the duration of my study. I could not wish for a more supportive partner and children in life. I would not have been able to do this without your never-ending love and support, you all are amazing and I love you all dearly. I would also like to express my appreciation to my parents <ref type="bibr">(Jamaludin Jaafar, Norizah</ref> Md Noor and Rozana Md Jaafar), my parents-in-laws (Ramli Abdullah and Rasmi Hassan) and in-laws, my brother and sisters, all my relatives and friends who offered me so much prayers, advice and excellent guidance throughout the whole journey.</p><p>Finally, I appreciate the efforts of all other individuals and groups who contributed in diverse ways to the successful completion of my PhD studies.</p><p>Nor <ref type="bibr">Lelawati Jamaludin January, 2017</ref> Bergen, Norway For a while, the learning curve has appeared almost stagnant. The social conduct I discovered in Norway was dissimilar from the one I knew, For a long time, I couldn't comprehend the Norwegian and, to be fair, they couldn't comprehend me either. My culture, my language, even how I think, set me apart.</p><p>Nevertheless, it hasn't all been sweat, tears and trials, of course. The reality has been far richer, a thousand times greater than my clichéd ideas. <ref type="bibr">Leyla, 2016</ref> the data involved the use of hierarchical multiple regression analyses and structural equation modelling with the use of AMOS -Analysis of Moment Structures. The sample consisted of 378 short-term (N=183) and long-term (N=195) international students who accepted the invitation and filled out an on-line survey questionnaire in the first study. In a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses, it was found that for short-term students, destination motivation (pull) together with orientation to mainstream, orientation to heritage and psychological adaptations were the most important variables influencing the decision to revisit and recommend the destination, accounting for 24.8% of the variance in destination-loyalty intention. For long-term students, destination motivation (pull) together with orientation to mainstream, orientation to heritage and sociocultural adaptations were the most important variables, accounting for 25.1% of the variance in destination-loyalty intention. In the second study, data was obtained from 396 (short-term, N=182) and (long-term, N=214) international students. AMOS results indicated that universalism was positively related to subjective well-being among short-term students and subjective well-being was positively related to destination-loyalty intention for both groups of students. Lastly, in the third study, AMOS results among a sample of 489 international students indicated that orientation to mainstream culture is positively related to destination-loyalty intention and it mediated the relationship between perceived discrimination and destination-loyalty intention. Although subject to some limitations, the overall results suggested that to ensure international students' destination-loyalty intentions, the suggested variables are important. Based on the reported findings, this study concludes with practical suggestions for future study abroad coordinators, stakeholders and directions for future research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Background and importance of the study</head><p>The interest of this study begins from the realisation of the importance of international students' experiences in international education. This is because, building bridges of international education and understanding across borders has been the impetus for many social and governmental programmes, including the ERASMUS<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> /SOCRATES 2 programmes (EU countries), NORDPLUS 3 (Nordic countries) and the Fulbright Act (United States of America) <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Pitts, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>In this respect, William Fulbright spoke to the importance of international exchange, It was my thought that if large numbers of people know and understand the people from nations other than their own, they might develop a capacity for empathy, distaste for killing other men, and an inclination to peace. If the competitive urge of men could be diverted from military to cultural pursuits, the world could be a different and better place to live <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Fulbright, 1976)</ref>. Senator Fulbright's statement suggests that international education programmes can have very positive consequences. However, due to various social and psychological barriers, the full positive outcomes of study abroad are not always achieved (i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Jackson et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Sandhu, 1994)</ref>, leaving some students with lower destination-loyalty intention <ref type="bibr">(Jamaludin, Sam, Sandal, &amp; Adam, 2016a)</ref> or unable to complete their sojourn <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Pitts, 2005)</ref>. Further, <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Pitts (2005)</ref> has suggested that in worst case scenarios, unprepared sojourners might further instigate international tensions and increase ethnocentrism for both parties. Thus, this thesis holds the view that it is important that sojourners (education tourists) experience a successful term abroad which will eventually bolster their intention to revisit and recommend the destination to others <ref type="bibr">(Jamaludin et al., 2016a)</ref>.</p><p>In some countries, exchange students and educational travel is becoming a stable, strongly emerging industry that outperforms leisure and business tourism in terms of its annual revenue <ref type="bibr">(Lesjak, Juvan, Ineson, Yap, &amp; Axelsson, 2015)</ref>. International students generate financial benefits for their host countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Chakma, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Gardner, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhou &amp; Zhang, 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, international students also contribute to the elevation of worldwide understanding, promoting peace and global citizenship and providing opportunities for the constructive exchange of ideas across societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Chapdelaine &amp; Alexitch, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Chirkov, Safdar, De Guzman, &amp; Playford, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Gacel-Ávila, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Gunesch, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Hail, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b219">Williams, 2005)</ref>. Moreover, <ref type="bibr">Jamaludin et al. (2016a)</ref> have argued that international students' choice of foreign institutions and their loyalty towards these institutions and the host society should be valuable to several stakeholders such as the government (and its agencies), agencies of education and community as a whole. Although international students share similar characteristics with tourists in that both groups are sojourners, little research attention has been dedicated to the possibility of the tourism industry capitalizing on the rising internationalization of higher education for economic and social gains <ref type="bibr">(Benos &amp; Zotou, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Cuaresma, Doppelhofer, &amp; Feldkircher, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Larsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b481">(2007)</ref> observed that research is lacking in the field of psychology pertaining to tourist experiences. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Geus, Richards, and Toepoel (2015)</ref> suggested that gaining a better understanding of the definition and operationalization of experiences is important to provide a better understanding on how experiences contribute to quality of life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ballantyne, Packer, and Falk (2011)</ref> found that reflective engagement involving cognitive and affective processing of the experience is associated with short-term and long-term environmental learning outcomes. Tourist experiences also generate behavioural responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ballantyne et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Kim, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Mannell &amp; Kleiber, 1997)</ref>. In this study such responses are measured by looking at international students' destination-loyalty intention.</p><p>For international students, the cross-cultural transition can be a life-challenging process because it potentially involves both a disruption of well-established social network and the establishment of a new one <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ando, 2014)</ref>. Early psychological studies focused on the challenges international students face during their adjustment (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Church, 1982)</ref>. It is only in recent years that psychology, together with other social science disciplines, have begun to contribute to an understanding of those factors that contribute to making the process of adjustment a positive, rather than a negative, factor in their personal and societal development <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Berry, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Grounded on the acculturation framework developed by Berry and his associates <ref type="bibr">(Berry, 1990</ref><ref type="bibr">(Berry, , 1992;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berry, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berry, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berry, Kim, Minde, &amp; Mok, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berry, Kim, Power, Young, &amp; Bujaki, 1989</ref>) and other relevant literature, this thesis used data from a group of international students at the University of Bergen to address one key question: How do international students' destination motivation, cultural orientation, adaptation, personal values, well-being and acculturation experiences influence destination-loyalty intention? The thesis puts forward the argument that the studied variables can be taken as a starting point in designing studies relating to central issues relevant for an understanding of education experience in influencing destination-loyalty intention. The findings can be used to guide the development of policies and programmes that can enhance the education experience of international education. This thesis concentrates on the concept of educational tourist experience as seen from a psychological perspective. It begins with the central empirical question of how the studied variables are related to international students' roles as ambassadors to the host country, measured by their destination-loyalty intention. An underlying assumption is that the students will encourage (or discourage) people in their social network to visit the country depending on their experiences during their sojourn abroad.</p><p>In three papers, this thesis investigates factors that may contribute to the understanding of destination-loyalty intention. The first paper focuses on how destination motivation (push and pull factors), involvement with the mainstream culture of the host country and heritage culture, international students' psychological and sociocultural adaptation would be most conducive to international students' destination-loyalty intention.</p><p>The second paper discusses the role of personal values, positive affect, negative affect and life satisfaction in explaining destination loyalty intentions. It draws from an elaboration of the acculturation framework and other relevant literature to outline how destination-loyalty intention can result from processes involving personal values and experience.</p><p>Finally, in Paper 3, the study further explored the possible role of perceived discrimination in influencing international students' orientation to mainstream culture and as a possible limiting factor for successful psychological adaptation. Studies on immigrants have shown that perceived discrimination is negatively related to adaptation <ref type="bibr">(Berry, Phinney, Sam, &amp; Vedder, 2006a)</ref>. Thus, the expectation is that perceived discrimination would impact negatively on international students' psychological adaptation and subsequently destination-loyalty intention.</p><p>The unique contribution of this thesis is that destination motivation, cultural orientation, adaptation, personal values, well-being and experiences have differential impact on destination-loyalty intentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Statement of problem and research gap</head><p>According to The Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI), the annual numbers of international students in Norway were 7110 in 2014 and 6319 in 2015 (The Norwegian Directorate of <ref type="bibr">Immigration, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">Immigration, , 2015))</ref>. With the significant number of international students in Norway and several European countries such as Germany are waiving their tuition fees <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bruckmeier, Fischer, &amp; Wigger, 2015)</ref>, an understanding of the psychological factors that support loyalty is critical to maintaining a sustainable international education industry for Norway.</p><p>Much of the research on student sojourners has focused on academic and personal outcomes of the study abroad <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Pitts, 2005)</ref>, but we still know very little about how destination motivation, cultural orientation, adaptation, personal values, well-being and acculturation experiences of student sojourners together influence international students' destination-loyalty intention.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">McKercher, Denizci-Guillet, and Ng (2012)</ref>, tourism is a mature field of study. They suggested that it is time for this field to develop its own theories with regard to loyalty. This is noticeable given that this aspect is central in the crosscultural literature to describe how people adapt to new cultural contexts (i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Laroche &amp; Park, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Tartakovsky, 2012)</ref>. Observations made in the literature on destination-loyalty intention indicate gaps in the following areas:</p><p>1) The possible relationship between loyalty intention and other psychological variables <ref type="bibr">(Jamaludin et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Prayag, Hosany, &amp; Odeh, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yuksel, Yuksel, &amp; Bilim, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>2) A substantive amount of studies on international students in areas such as psychological and social wellbeing, challenges when studying abroad, destination motivation, their experiences in general and a global understanding of the sojourner adjustment process <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Gaw, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Lee &amp; Rice, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mazzarol &amp; Soutar, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Mehta, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">O'Reilly, Ryan, &amp; Hickey, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Popov et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Sam, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Schroth &amp; McCormack, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Sobré-Denton, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b215">Ward &amp; Rana-Deuba, 2000)</ref>. While these generalized findings are useful, they only skim the surface of the lived experience of the sojourner <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Pitts, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>3) Most studies adopt a one-sided approach, an enterprise or destination specific focus when studying destination loyalty (i.e., <ref type="bibr">McKercher et al., 2012)</ref> instead of looking at the students' (customers') experience. Students' experience is important as it will be one of the main criteria for them either to revisit or recommend a destination to others <ref type="bibr">(Jamaludin et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jamaludin, Sam, Sandal, &amp; Adam, 2016b)</ref>. This thesis tries to fills these gaps and contributes to the literature on this topic in the recognition that both the education and tourism industries need psychological element to promote their products in the market, and the market needs psychology elements to better promote products to education and tourism. This thesis provides a ground work for both industries to understand more about the close relationship that exist between them.</p><p>To close the gap, three studies were done in this thesis based on the assumption that the desire to understand the current status of our international students' experiences at a destination is imperative to determine whether destinations are meeting their needs and, ultimately, ensuring that these students have a positive experience to support their academic persistence and mostly, their destination-loyalty intention. Furthermore, most destinations, wanting to remain competitive, will try to attract more students to study at their destination, boosting tourist industries across the world. Besides, the tourism industry has to realize that students are a powerful longterm investment for destinations because not only will friends and family come to visit them while they are there studying, but students are likely to spread the news of their positive tourism experience to other travellers and return for future visits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">DEFINING AND CLARIFYING THE MAIN CONCEPTS</head><p>A number of key concepts need to be defined and discussed for a better understanding of the destination-loyalty intention of international students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Educational tourism</head><p>Educational Tourism is a segment used by institutions as a tool aimed at making the learning process more interesting <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Gomes, Mota, &amp; Perinotto, 2012)</ref>. The concept of educational tourism is defined by Ritchie <ref type="bibr" target="#b440">(2003)</ref> as:</p><p>"Tourist activity done by those who are undertaking an overnight vacation or an excursion for whom education and learning is the primary or secondary part of their trip."</p><p>Mostly, studies on educational tourism provide information about the possibilities of future development, its economic benefits, arising problems and trends <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Middleton &amp; Lickorish, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Reisinger &amp; Dimanche, 2010)</ref>.However, earlier research largely did not cover possible consequences of the educational tourism activities (positive and negative) for the educational tourists themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">(Tashlai &amp; Ivanov, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>To date, there has been limited information regarding the psychological aspects of educational tourism participants. In particular, a very limited amount of literature dedicated to the educational tourism industry is available, and researchers have only recently focused on this topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abubakar, Shneikat, &amp; Oday, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lesjak et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Ohe, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>A study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Tashlai and Ivanov (2014)</ref> suggested that educational tourism has a great potential to become one of the most in-demand travel activities on the tourism market, and it can easily rise to a leading position among other tourism services and travel-related products. However, more comprehensive and thorough examination is required in the area of international education in order to establish well-organized and efficiently-functioning international education market. In addition, limited studies regarding Norwegian educational tourism justifies the further research covering this issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Destination-loyalty intention</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Oliver (1999)</ref> loyalty is a construct that can be conceptualised by several perspectives. The term destination loyalty is interchangeably labelled as destination-loyalty intentions and tourist loyalty <ref type="bibr">(Jamaludin et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Prayag &amp; Ryan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">Song, Su, &amp; Li, 2013)</ref>. In studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Homburg and Giering (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Cronin Jr and Taylor (1992)</ref>, the construct "future behavioural intention" was measured by using two indicators: the intention of repurchasing and the intention of making positive recommendations. In other tourism research, a similar approach is adopted and tourist loyalty intention is represented in terms of the intention to revisit the destination and the willingness to recommend it to friends and relatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Bigne, Sanchez, &amp; Sanchez, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Chen &amp; Gursoy, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jamaludin et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Oppermann, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Petrick, 2004)</ref>. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Jang, Bai, Hu, and Wu (2009)</ref> have suggested that the intentions to revisit the destination and to share positive experiences with their friends and relatives are generally considered sufficient measures of visitors' behavioral intentions and loyalty, to a given destination. In the present thesis, therefore, destination loyalty intention has been limited to two indicators: "revisiting intention" and "willingness to recommend". This is because advocates of the behavioural approach conclude that loyalty is a function of attitude manifested as behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Dick &amp; Basu, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Jacoby &amp; Kyner, 1973)</ref>. However, before behaviour can be defined, the distinctive traits of intention have to be established. Moreover, <ref type="bibr">Ajzen (1991)</ref> has suggested that measuring visitors' actual loyalty behaviour is difficult, and therefore suggested that measuring visitors' loyalty intentions to a given destination (i.e. destination-loyalty intention) may be more suitable and important. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Shoemaker and Lewis (1999)</ref>, loyal customers are more likely to act as free word-of-mouth promotion representatives that informally bring networks of friends, relatives and other prospective buyers/users to a product/service.</p><p>In the broadest sense, this thesis can be viewed as a connection of a few areas. From cross cultural psychology and social psychology, this thesis has adopted the concept of acculturation and the concept of cultural attachment <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Liebkind, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Phinney, 1990)</ref>, respectively. These two approaches are conceptually and empirically related <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Liebkind, 2001</ref>) and this has later been combined with the concept of tourist behaviour in international education by specifically looking at the concept of destination-loyalty intention.</p><p>In a progressively saturated marketplace, the achievement of destinations should be guided by a comprehensive analysis of destination-loyalty intention and its relationship with the selected variables. To bridge the gap in the destination loyalty literature, this study was done to offer an integrated approach to understanding destination-loyalty intention and examines the theoretical and empirical evidence on the said relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">International students as sojourners</head><p>Sojourners by definition are people who travel internationally to achieve a particular goal or objective, with the expectation that they will return to their country of origin after the purpose of their travel has been achieved <ref type="bibr">(Safdar &amp; Berno, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Sojourners typically volunteer to relocate for a defined period of time after which the sojourner returns home, or relocates yet again <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ady, 1995)</ref>. International students constitute one of the largest and significant sojourner groups <ref type="bibr">(Bochner, 2006)</ref>. As a sojourner group, international students continue to grow in number worldwide, prompting researchers to study their global significance <ref type="bibr">(Safdar &amp; Berno, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>International students' contributions to the general global economy and to education are well documented (i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Cuaresma et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Katircioğlu, 2010)</ref>, but very little is known about their specific contribution to the tourism sector. International students can be considered as belonging to two categories: short-term and long-term students.</p><p>Short-term international students (or simply short-term students) typically stay for a few weeks to a year mainly to get some credits that may be transferred to their home university. Long-term international students (or simply long-term students) typically stay longer than a year to complete their academic degree at the overseas university.</p><p>As many short-term students' sojourn may be longer than that of an average tourist, they have a unique opportunity to get to know the society better and to develop stronger loyalty intention than the typical tourist.

To further understand the acculturationintention relationship, this thesis is based on the contributions of John Berry and his colleagues <ref type="bibr">(Berry, 1990</ref><ref type="bibr">(Berry, , 1992</ref><ref type="bibr">(Berry, , 2005;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berry et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berry et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berry &amp; Sam, 1997)</ref>. The studies in this thesis combines the acculturation perspective with the loyalty concept to predict intentions. Tourist loyalty or loyalty intention has been treated as an extension of customer loyalty in tourism settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Backman &amp; Crompton, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Baloglu, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jamaludin et al., 2016a)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Berry (1992)</ref> acculturation framework includes the major factors that influence an individual's adaptation to a new cultural environment. As the main objective of this study is to understand destination-loyalty intention of international students', I</p><p>will specifically look at the individual process of acculturation and how it influences adaptation and subsequently destination-loyalty intention. The understanding of this association may become critical for all nations. This is because international students' acculturation experiences at a destination is vital to determining whether destinations are meeting their needs. This will eventually ensure that these students have positive experiences to support their academic perseverance and mostly, their destinationloyalty intention. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Sam and Berry (2016)</ref> have suggested that in the study of adaptation, it is essential to consider a wider range of individual variables in relation to situational and cultural-level factors. Thus, personal values were added to better understand the adaptation process for international students.</p><p>Accordingly, to better understand the relationship, theories and concepts have been propounded together with acculturation framework in the attempt to elucidate the understanding on destination-loyalty intention. A suggested framework for psychological factors influencing destination loyalty intention is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1</ref>.</p><p>Some of the theories and concepts are discussed next. However, in order to minimize replications, the overall relationship of the theories and concepts are described in papers 1, 2 and 3 attached with this thesis. The framework exemplifies a valid approach to better understanding of destination-loyalty intention conducted in a setting of education tourism. The suggested framework could form a prototypical model for future studies in the exciting area pertaining to the psychology of the educational tourist experience.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.1">Acculturation</head><p>In the 1960s, acculturation was principally defined as a process of assimilation where ethnic minorities were expected to adopt the culture of their new country of settlement and give up or abandon their native culture (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Bierstedt, 1963</ref>  1964; <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">Taft &amp; Johnston, 1967)</ref>. This perspective of acculturation is summarized in a unidimensional model, where parts of the native culture are discarded, elements of the mainstream culture are adopted (e.g., Arends Tóth &amp; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Van de Vijver, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Gordon, 1964)</ref>. The unidimensional model assumes that it is not possible to adopt a new culture while holding on to one's original culture.</p><p>However, recent work on acculturation, and in particular within psychology, contends that individuals can successfully assimilate within more than one culture, namely hold on to both the original culture as well as adopt a new culture (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Berry &amp; Sam, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Laroche, Kim, Hui, &amp; Joy, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Tsai, Ying, &amp; Lee, 2000)</ref>. These researchers suggest that acculturation is a bidimensional, two-directional process instead of only focusing on assimilation (see Arends Tóth &amp; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Van de Vijver, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ryder, Alden, &amp; Paulhus, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sam &amp; Berry, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Zane &amp; Mak, 2003)</ref>. From this, acculturation is no longer seen as a linear process, in which ethnic minorities move from unacculturated to assimilated, but instead, a multidimensional process that includes the orientation to both the heritage culture and the dominant culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Phinney, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>This means that adoption of the host culture does not necessarily accompany a decrease in maintenance of the heritage culture (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Berry, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Sánchez &amp; Fernández, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">Sayegh &amp; Lasry, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>To date, the most widely used bidimensional acculturation model is that of Berry <ref type="bibr">(Berry, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berry et al., 1989)</ref>. In his bidimensional model of acculturation, Berry has summarized the ways in which ethnic minorities can adapt to living in a new country, based on two dimensions: the extent to which the minority group member wants to maintain their home culture, and the extent to which the minority group member wants to have contact with members of the host culture group. The intersection of these two dimensions creates four acculturation orientations, or strategies, which are; assimilation, when the minority group member sees no need for maintaining their home or heritage culture, but would like to be in contact with the host culture; separation, where the minority group member maintains their home culture, but sees no need for contact with host culture; integration, a minority group member maintains his/her home culture and at the same time remains in contact with the host culture; and marginalization, when the minority group member wants neither to maintain their home culture nor to be in contact with the host culture.</p><p>However, instead of using Berry's two dimensions to get to the four acculturation attitudes, some researchers have treated acculturation as a matter of identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Hutnik, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Phinney, 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Phinney, , 2003;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Phinney, Horenczyk, Liebkind, &amp; Vedder, 2001)</ref>. They investigated whether minority members identify only with their home culture, with the host culture, or both. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Ward and Kennedy (1994)</ref> suggested an adjustment to <ref type="bibr">Berry (1997)</ref> acculturation model. They suggested replacing the contact dimension (the extent to which an individual wishes to have contact with members of the majority group) with a dimension measuring how much ethnic minority members consider it to be of value to adopt the culture of the dominant group. Further, many researchers adopted this suggestion in subsequent acculturation research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Bourhis, Moise, Perreault, &amp; Senecal, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Farver, Narang, &amp; Bhadha, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Hwang &amp; Ting, 2008)</ref>. This thesis focuses on culture maintenance and culture adoption when measuring acculturation. However, it should be noticed that both approaches are used in this thesis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Thesis aims</head><p>The goal is to better understand how international students' destination motivation, cultural orientation, adaptation, demographic information, well-being and acculturation experiences influence destination-loyalty intention. The reviewed literature suggests that there is a dearth of evidence from the psychological perspective regarding destination-loyalty intention in educational tourism. Apart from this, the literature review also suggests the need for an in-depth exploration into the actual experiences among student sojourners. Finally, the literature review suggests that there is the paucity of evidence on the global prevalence of destination-loyalty intention especially from international students' point of view. It is important therefore that further studies are conducted especially in societies like Norway where there is paucity of research in this area. In three papers, the thesis reports studies all aimed at gaining a better understanding of students' loyalty to their destination with the ultimate goal of helping them get the best of out of their sojourn and also to promote education tourism.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Destination-loyalty intention (DLI)</head><p>This thesis used destination-loyalty intention as a dependent variable for all three studies. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Kim (2006)</ref>, the most comprehensive approach to destination loyalty was shown in a study by <ref type="bibr">Oppermann (2000)</ref>. According to him, Oppermann's approach captures a deeper meaning of loyalty toward destinations. Furthermore, the literature review has shown that Oppermann's studies are valuable to the study of destination loyalty. His study has been used as the primary reference in most of the other studies on destination loyalty (i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Chen &amp; Phou, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Kim, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">Wang, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yoon &amp; Uysal, 2005)</ref>. Thus, in seeking to explain a student's loyalty intention, this study has relied on instruments as suggested in <ref type="bibr">Oppermann (2000)</ref>.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr">Oppermann (2000)</ref> scale, the three items related to the dependent variables were assessed, where two were on re-visitation and one focusing on recommendation to friends and relatives. The responses were rated on a 5-point scale (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree). Samples of the items used were: "After I have completed my course/study, I will travel to Bergen if my financial position permits it." "My overall feeling about the place is so good that I will come again after I completed my course/study." The Cronbach's alpha of DLI for Study 1 was = .62 (short-term); .70 (long-term), Study 2 = .68 (short-term); .75 (long-term) and Study 3 = .74</p></div>

Each host institution also has its own set of "pull" factors which make it attractive to students, and make it more or less attractive than its competitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(Rounsaville, 2014)</ref>. The literature review has shown that Mazzarol's studies are valuable to the study of the Push-Pull Theory and international student mobility. Their studies have been used as the main references for most of the other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(Rounsaville, 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Mazzarol and Soutar (2002)</ref> influential study was discussed at length in Yang's <ref type="bibr" target="#b481">(2007)</ref> literature review and used as a point of comparative analysis for the presentation of her data. Additionally, Maringe and Carter <ref type="bibr" target="#b481">(2007)</ref> referenced <ref type="bibr">Mazzarol and Soutar (2002)</ref> as part of their general literature review.</p><p>Thus, in seeking to explain a student's choice of an international education, I have decided to focus on instruments as suggested in <ref type="bibr">Mazzarol and Soutar (2002)</ref> to answer the two main questions that traditional Push-Pull Theory seeks to answer. 1) Why do students decide to study abroad and 2) Why do they choose certain host countries. Logically both of these questions are, to some extent, related to the topic of institutional choice and their loyalty-intention. The instruments comprise of push and pull motivation. Example of the push motivation factor were included; "I plan to immigrate in the future"; "The course is not available at my home country", etc. For push motivation, factor such as "A foreign university degree will open good employment opportunities for me"; "University's reputation and facilities", etc. was included. The responses were rated on a 5-point scale (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree) and the score were calculated by taking the mean score of the items in push and pull motivations group.

According to Kang, by proposing the independence of the two cultural identities, the bidimensional model is able to embrace not only individuals with bicultural identities but also people who are not attached to either culture. This flexibility is the major strength of the bidimensional model and brings the bidimensional model to the centre of attention for acculturation researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Kang, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Based on a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Celenk and Van de Vijver (2011)</ref>, the Vancouver Index of Acculturation (VIA) was the frequently used measurement for a bidimensional model of acculturation.

Following <ref type="bibr">Ryder, Alden, and Paulhus's (2000)</ref>, an individual's orientation to culture is divided into two categories: orientation to mainstream culture and orientation to heritage culture. The two categories are measured by 10 items, respectively, with a 5-point scale (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree) as response categories. The sample of the questions used were: "I often participate in mainstream Norwegian cultural traditions", "I enjoy social activities with typical Norwegian people", "I often participate in my heritage cultural traditions", etc. The Cronbach's alpha of COM was .70 (short-term) and .74 (long-term) and COH was .72 (short-term) and .73 (longterm).</p></div>

In their study, The Sociocultural Adaptation Scale (SCAS) was first used by <ref type="bibr">Searle and Ward (1990)</ref> to study the cross-cultural transition and adaptation of Malaysian and Singaporean students in New Zealand.</p><p>This paper describes the scale development and documents the usefulness and versatility of the measurement <ref type="bibr">(Ward &amp; Kennedy, 1999)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Ward and Kennedy (1999)</ref>, the Sociocultural Adaptation Scale (SCAS) is a flexible instrument and can be easily modified according to the characteristics of the sojourning sample.</p><p>Thus, following <ref type="bibr">Ward and Kennedy (1999)</ref>, this study used only 23 items from the 40-item scale of culture-general items relevant for international students. Average scores of the items were used to measure the overall sociocultural adaptation level.</p><p>Higher values obtained in the scale indicated greater difficulty in sociocultural adaptation. However, for the sake of easier interpretation of the results, the scores were reversed on the items so that higher scores indicate better sociocultural adaptation. A sample question is: "To what extend do you experience difficulty in the areas when staying in Norway? (1) Making friends; (2) Using the transport system;</p><p>(3) Making yourself understood," etc. The Cronbach's alpha of SA was .91 for both short-term and long-term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological adaptation (PA)</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Pavot and Diener (1993)</ref>, the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) is designed to assess a person's global judgment of life satisfaction, which is theoretically predicted to depend on a comparison of life circumstances to one's standards. They mentioned that the brief format of the SWLS means that it can be incorporated into an assessment battery with minimal cost in time. Further, their study suggests that the SWLS has potential as a cross-cultural index of life satisfaction. Additionally, informants show good levels of agreement when they judge a target person's life satisfaction using the SWLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Pavot, Diener, Colvin, &amp; Sandvik, 1991)</ref>. Thus, in seeking to explain a student's psychological adaptation, this study focuses on psychological adaptation (life satisfaction) using The Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) by <ref type="bibr">Diener, Emmons, Larsen, and Griffin (1985)</ref>. The study used 5 items by <ref type="bibr">Diener et al. (1985)</ref>. It was measured with a 5-point scale (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree). Sample question items are as follows: "In most ways my life is close to my ideal"; "the conditions of my life are excellent", etc. The Cronbach's alpha of PA was .79 (short-term) and .76 (long-term).</p></div>

The 5-item Satisfaction with life scale <ref type="bibr">(Diener, Emmons, Larsen, &amp; Griffin, 1985)</ref> described above was used here. <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">Watson, Clark, and Tellegen (1988)</ref> have presented information regarding the development of the two primary dimensions of mood; Positive and Negative Affect.</p><p>They claim that the scales are internally consistent and have excellent convergent and discriminant correlations with lengthier measures of the underlying mood factors.</p><p>In their findings, the PANAS scale has demonstrated appropriate stability over a 2month period. When used with short-term instructions (e.g., right now or today), they are sensitive to fluctuations in mood, whereas they exhibit traits like stability when longer-term instructions are used (e.g., past year or general). Moreover, Watson and colleagues claimed that Positive and Negative Affect Schedule is a reliable, valid, and efficient means for measuring these two important dimensions of mood. Further, the literature review has shown that PANAS scales are valuable to the study of international students. The scale has been used in most of the other studies (i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Du &amp; Wei, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Liao &amp; Wei, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">Wang, Heppner, Wang, &amp; Zhu, 2015)</ref>.

The proposed data analysis method for this study is hierarchical multiple regression analyses (Study 1) and structural equation modelling-AMOS (Studies 2 and 3).

The lists of international students' were retrieved with the cooperation of an officer at the International Students' Office at the University of Bergen.</p><p>2. As part of the requirement by NSD, the distribution and collection of survey questions were administered by International Students' Office in University of Bergen officers.</p><p>3.

These responses were recorded electronically and prepared for statistical analysing using SPSS 21.0 and AMOS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.2">Data screening</head><p>For Study 1, the analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS 21.0. In this thesis, the tests performed are validity and reliability tests as well as four classical assumption tests (normality, autocorrelation, multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity test).</p><p>A reliability test was conducted to focus on the consistency of the measuring instrument in supplying the results for Study 1. Despite the general acceptance on the value of 0.7 as the cut-off point of reliability measure, the satisfactory level of reliability also depends on how a measure is being used. "In the early stages of research on predictor tests or hypothesised measures of a construct, one saves time and energy by working with instruments that have only modest reliability, for which purpose reliabilities of 0.60 or 0.50 will suffice" <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">(Sekaran, 2003)</ref>. Further, according <ref type="bibr">Nunnally (1978)</ref>, all Cronbach's Alpha coefficient values above 0.6 are considered to be acceptable. Thus, Study 1 was done based on this guideline. I noted, however, that any discussion of interpretation and implication involving the variables with slightly low AVE is provisional and requires replication to further confirm the associations between variables. Next, the multivariate outliers testing were conducted using Mahalanobis Distance. An examination of the Mahalanobis distance scores indicated two multivariate outliers for short-term and one multivariate outlier for long-term.</p><p>The outliers identified in initial data screening were deleted. Study 1 then tested the four classical assumptions, as the preliminary steps for hierarchical regression models within this research.</p><p>Using the benchmark ± 2.0, Study 1 shows that no items exhibited a significant skewness, and kurtosis, proofing that the residuals are all distributed normally. Next, the Durbin Watson value of 2.18 (short-term) and 1.97 (long-term) indicates nonautocorrelation both positive and negative, occurs between the residuals in the regression models. Further, the VIF results in Study 1 prove that multicollinearity issue does not occur in this research. Finally, the cluster of points in Study 1 in this study seems to be approximately the same width all over. Thus, the assumption of homoscedasticity is supported in this research.</p><p>In Study 2 and 3, SPSS 21.0 and SEM were used as the method to analyse the data.</p><p>The data screening process for Studies 2 and 3, involved the assessment of SEM assumptions. SEM requires the sample size to be sufficiently large as covariance and correlations are less stable when estimated using small sample sizes <ref type="bibr">(Hair, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">Tabachnick, 2007)</ref>. In addition to sample size, the data set was assessed based on two categories of problems: 1) case-related issues such as data entry accuracy, missing values, and outliers; 2) data distribution issues such as test of normality <ref type="bibr">(Hair, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">Tabachnick, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Following the recommendations of <ref type="bibr">Hair (2010)</ref> and Tabachnick <ref type="bibr" target="#b481">(2007)</ref>, all respondents in the analysis who answered at least 95% (5% or less of missing values) of the survey questions were included in this study. For Studies 2 and 3, these cases were examined and a total of seven cases for Study 2 and eighty-one for Study 3 were removed as the responses were less than 95% <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">(Tabachnick, 2007)</ref>. Next, in order to accommodate the missing values for analysis, it was decided to substitute the missing responses with the variable mean responses. Apart from this method being widely used in academic research, it is also able to provide all cases with complete information <ref type="bibr">(Hair, 2010)</ref>. Following the missing values assessment, the data was subjected to outliers' examination. Using SPSS descriptives, z-scores for each case were compared. Three univariate outliers were found based on z-score assessment in Study 2 and nine cases were found to have z-scores in excess of 3.29 (p&lt;.001) <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">(Tabachnick, 2007)</ref> in Study 3. Then, multivariate assessment of outliers based on Mahalanobis distance was conducted. Following <ref type="bibr">(Hair, 2010)</ref> Subsequent to the assessment of outliers, data distribution assessment on all observed variables was undertaken. There are two ways to validate the normality assumptions that are skewness and kurtosis. In this study, both absolute and critical values for skewness and kurtosis were assessed for each variable. Based on absolute value of skewness and kurtosis, it appears that all measures were within the range of 2.0. As such, it can be assumed that the data set is distributed normally <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bentler, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">Schumacker, 1996)</ref>. However, an assessment based on critical values of skewness and kurtosis showed otherwise. All variables were negatively skewed. As the sample size for this study is more than 200 cases, so, the deviation from skewness and kurtosis is negligible <ref type="bibr">(Hair, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">Tabachnick, 2007)</ref>. The observed variables, then, were subjected to multivariate normality assessment based on the Mardia coefficient test <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Byrne, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">Tabachnick, 2007)</ref>. Based on the analysis, the Mardia coefficient of multivariate kurtosis indicated deviation from multivariate normality. In this study, the z-statistic of 19.254 (long-term), 2.722 (short-term) for Study 2 and 27.17 for Study 3 is above the recommended value of +/-2.58 <ref type="bibr">(Hair, 2010)</ref>. Thus, to moderate the effect of multivariate non-normality, the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation was applied in this study.</p></div>

CFA is considered to be a tool of theory -testing by indicating how well the theoretical specification of the factors fit with the actual data <ref type="bibr">(Hair, 2010)</ref>. Therefore, CFA is considered for this study as it aims to use the selected theory and framework by Berry and associates and loyalty theory as a basis to explain the influences of international students' experiences towards destination-loyalty intention. In this thesis, only measured items that have more than 0.5 loading were included for further analysis here <ref type="bibr">(Hair, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">Tabachnick, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Once the initial step of unidimensionality of constructs was achieved, reliability and validity of these constructs were assessed. In this study, the variables that had low Cronbach reliability, CFA were used to assess validity. However any discussion of interpretation and implication involving the variables with slightly low AVE is provisional and requires replication to further confirm the associations between variables. CFA was done based on the approach suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</ref>. For this purpose, CFA using maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) was used <ref type="bibr">(Hair, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Kline, 2011)</ref>. Average variance extraction (AVE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref> was used as a tool to determine the convergent validity, which then followed with construct reliability (CR) and discriminant validity test of the measured variables.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Study 1</head><p>The overall working hypothesis of this study was that international students can influence friends, family members or other people in their social network to visit the country in which they have studied, and that the findings may have some ramifications for the international student exchange programmes, and also for the tourist industry of the country concerned. Against this context, a three-stage hierarchical multiple regression was conducted separately for the two groups (shortterm and long-term students) with destination-loyalty intention as the dependent variable.</p><p>For short-term students, results show that destination motivation (pull) (b = 0.16, p &lt; </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Study 2</head><p>The main question here was to identify some of the predicting factors of international students' destination-loyalty intention. Specifically, Study 2 looks at how international students' personal values are related to their destination-loyalty intention.</p><p>Results for Study 2 indicate that for short-term students; only personal value of universalism was significantly related to subjective well-being ( = 0.37, p value &lt; .05). The other personal values: benevolence ( = -0.05, p value = .775), selfdirection ( = 0.16, p value = .315), stimulation ( = 0.02, p value = .904) and achievement ( = 0.19, p value = .224) were all not significant. With respect to longterm students, none of the personal values was found to be significantly related to subjective well-being, i.e., universalism ( = 0.38, p value = .344), benevolence ( = -0.07, p value = .804), self-direction ( =-0.68, p value = .385), stimulation ( = 0.73, p value = .307) and achievement ( = 0.06, p value = .639). However, the relationship between subjective well-being and destination-loyalty intention was significant for both short-term ( = 0.33, p value &lt; .05) and long-term ( = 0.21, p value &lt; .05) students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Study 3</head><p>The third and final study examined how acculturation experiences (i.e., perceived discrimination, orientation to mainstream culture and life satisfaction) influence destination-loyalty intention.</p><p>Results indicate that perceived discrimination was not related to destination-loyalty intention. In contrast, the relationship between orientation to mainstream culture and destination-loyalty intention was positive and significant (β = 0.47; p &lt; .001). The relationship between life satisfaction and destination-loyalty intention was not significant.</p><p>Next, the relationship of perceived discrimination to destination-loyalty intention was found to be improved with orientation to mainstream culture as a mediator. However, analysis indicated that life satisfaction was unrelated to destination-loyalty intention.</p><p>Study 3 found that the direct effect of perceived discrimination (β = -0.04) and life satisfaction (β = 0.05) on destination-loyalty intention were extremely low and insignificant (p &gt; 0.001). No evidence was found to suggest that life satisfaction has a significant relationship with destination-loyalty intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DISCUSSION</head><p>The main goal of this thesis was to gain a better understanding of the relationship between psychological factors and international education experiences on the one hand, and international students' destination-loyalty intentions on the other. This thesis begins outlining the model by briefly discussing the interplay between variables that trigger international students' destination motivation, orientation to mainstream culture, orientation to heritage culture, sociocultural adaptation and psychological adaptation and how the nature of the processing influences destinationloyalty intention. Study 1 shows that among all the variables, the most important predictors of destination-loyalty intention for both short-term and long-term students were destination motivation (pull), orientation to heritage and orientation to mainstream culture. This is in line with the finding by <ref type="bibr">Mazzarol and Soutar (2002)</ref> pertaining to the study of international students' destination motivation and Zea,</p><p>Reisen, Beil, and Caplan's (1997) findings on orientation to mainstream culture.</p><p>Then, of the two forms of adaptation, sociocultural adaptation was found to be related to destination-loyalty intention only for long-term students. According to <ref type="bibr">Sam et al. (2015)</ref>, individuals who perceive themselves to be socially skilled also feel confident in their understanding of the culture of the new society. <ref type="bibr">Berry (2005)</ref> found a linear relationship between sociocultural adaptation and time. Thus, the finding with respect to long-term students compared to short-term students seems reasonable.</p><p>Finally, psychological adaptation was significant in predicting destination-loyalty intention only among short-term students. It is possible that short-term students, whose academic degrees are conferred by their home institution, can afford to take life easy as they collect few course credits <ref type="bibr">(Sam et al., 2015)</ref>, unlike long-term students taking a full academic degree at a foreign university. Short-term students are also known to spend a lot of time sightseeing and touring during their overseas sojourn <ref type="bibr">(Sam et al., 2015)</ref>. It is plausible that their overall satisfaction is related to the joys of touring and sightseeing; thus, this will influence their intention to revisit and recommend the destination.</p><p>The thesis then introduces the other main tenet by looking at how the fundamental contributors'; international students' personal values -subjective well-being and subsequently, destination-loyalty intention in international education settings. Study 2 found that universalism was positively related to subjective well-being for short-term students which is consistent with part of the findings by <ref type="bibr">Özdemir (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Sagiv and Schwartz (2000)</ref> who came to similar assumptions in their studies. Other than that, subjective well-being was positively related to destination-loyalty intention for all groups which is similar with the studies by <ref type="bibr">Dagger and Sweeney (2006)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Brown and Mazzarol (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Hon and Brunner (2002)</ref> who anticipated that perceived well-being is one of the important motivations for the intention to revisit and loyalty, respectively. For all groups of international students', well-being is one of the crucial motivations for revisit intention and loyalty, correspondingly.</p><p>Lastly, the final study specifically looks into experience arising during international education by looking at international students' involvement with the larger society and how perceived discrimination influences the orientation to mainstream culture and life satisfaction process and its effect on destination-loyalty intention. Results for Study 3 suggest that experience arising during acculturation can result in poor orientation to the mainstream culture, which in turn may lead to lower destinationloyalty intention. It can be suggested that international students' destination-loyalty intention is influenced by perceived discrimination and orientation to mainstream society. Results for Study 3 is in line with findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Berry, Phinney, Sam, and Vedder (2006b)</ref> who suggest that perceived discrimination is an important predictor (positive or negative) of orientation to mainstream culture. Nevertheless, in Study 3, the relationship between orientations to mainstream culture and destination-loyalty intention is similar with the findings for Study 1. This shows that even by using more robust analysis, orientation to mainstream culture still play important roles in influencing destination-loyalty intention. Study 3 also supported the finding of <ref type="bibr">Zea, Reisen, Beil, and Caplan (1997)</ref> who suggest that well-adjusted students in the host communities are more likely to remain and have a sense of positive integration or assimilation, which arguably should strengthen their educational goals, commitment and loyalty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Implications for practise</head><p>Findings from the three papers reported in this thesis have important implications for policy makers and international education professionals in the design of workshops, assessments, and interventions that contribute to the influences of a positive destination-loyalty intention.</p><p>In sum, findings in Study 1 highlight the need of host countries government and education institutions to understand the psychological motivations behind international students' education destination choices in their strategies and promotions activities. However, most of the implications for practice have been mentioned in the three articles and for brevity, only new implications are discussed here.</p><p>Findings from Study 1 suggested that institutions of higher learning should come up with programmes that increase the degree of social participation. The university should create some programmes for local students to be student advisers/mentors for international students in the programme. These advisers/mentors could help the students with issues that they may encounter during their overseas sojourn. This may enhance their chances of "succeeding" in the new environment and subsequently their destination-loyalty intention.</p><p>Language learning (i.e., speaking, reading, comprehension, and writing) is one of the biggest concerns and problem areas for international students <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Omar, 2014)</ref>. Results from this study indicate that greater competency with culture learning and social skills will influence international students' intention to revisit and recommend the destinations to others. Different people have many different levels of language intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Omar, 2014)</ref>. Thus, the language programme should recognize these differences. Proper evaluations should be given to identify the level of language skills of a student. This will enable a proper set of training programmes to be provided to international students.</p><p>Such intervention must also take into consideration the finding from Study 2, which suggests that there is a need for industry players to strategically adjust to the different value preferences, specifically looking at the role of universalism in subjective wellbeing among short-term students. Highlighting these aspects of Norway may be important when trying to attract students to come to Norway.</p><p>Results from Study 2 also suggested that the significant relationship between subjective well-being and destination-loyalty intention can be further nurtured by education practitioners through specific interventions targeted on enhancing wellbeing. This can be done by adjusting the introduction programmes and providing support throughout the sojourn duration. Perhaps, they can do this by improving the orientation and arrival services. The university together with tourism industry players (i.e., travel agents, transportation, accommodation) can work together to make sure that they coordinate arrivals with students. Further, the university should make sure that all students have a good orientation so that they will have meaningful interactions with fellow students. This will further integrate international students' in the organization and make them feel like insiders.</p><p>Finally, Study 3 suggested that industry players should take into consideration intercultural factors such as the experienced discrimination which could leads to lower orientation to mainstream culture, which again would negatively influence destination-loyalty intention. The university and tourism industries should work together in conducting more intercultural events such as discussion groups, social gatherings, workshops, lectures, etc. These kinds of events could help international students meet local students, faculty and administrators and learn more about the destinations' life and culture. This will enable them to understand or even integrate with the local culture, have good relationship with the host country's students and possibly reduce the feelings of being excluded or being discriminated against.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Suggestions for future research</head><p>All three papers have addressed various implications for future research and for the sake of brevity, only new suggestions were discussed in this section.</p><p>Results for Study 1 suggested that further examinations are needed focusing on pull motivation to destination which is assumed would affect the ability to predict international students' destination-loyalty intention. Moreover, future researchers should continue to conduct systematic investigations of orientation to mainstream and heritage culture in order to better attract and retain international students.</p><p>Other than this, in the future, one possible approach is to aim at designing studies pertinent to the various conceptions of the educational tourist experience such as discrimination and acculturation. Perhaps field experiments can be added to investigate relationships between theoretical constructs within the field of educational tourism studies.</p><p>At the same time, a suggestion could be made that an additional qualitative research should be done. This would provide more in-depth, open-ended views and perspectives from international students <ref type="bibr">(Mahmood, 2014)</ref>. Qualitative research could provide further understanding of challenges that international students face. It helps to gain suggestions on ways to better meet international students' needs while pursuing their education in a foreign country. Additionally, future research should consider that sometimes people behave or express ideas about social concerns that are at variance with their personal values <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Campos Sánchez, 2014)</ref>. In this sense, a future line of research should focus on analysing the inconsistencies between international students' personal values and their behaviour. This is because personal values may sometimes be overridden by contextual factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Boer &amp; Fischer, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>As regards Study 3, future research should seek to observe the impact of perceived discrimination on destination-loyalty intention in other countries and/or using samples from other regions of the world. Despite there being many commonalities, Study 3 contends that differences do exist among the subgroups of international students. Thus it is necessary to further examine students' experiences and needs based on their nationalities. Future studies should also move towards a standardized scale for assessing life satisfaction tailored specially for destination-loyalty intention.</p><p>Additionally, studies should also examine the cross-cultural validity of instruments carefully when there are cross-cultural comparisons of psychological constructs, both within ethnic groups and between countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(Wu &amp; Mak, 2011)</ref>. This would provide further understanding of the acculturation-intention relationship that can be used as guidelines for universities to enhance destination-loyalty intention among international students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Strengths and Limitations</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Strengths</head><p>To my knowledge, the three studies constituting this thesis represent the first-ever investigations of destination motivation and international students' personal values and acculturation experience in influencing destination-loyalty intention in international education. The findings from the study can be used as a basis for developing human interventions such as counselling, coaching and many other approaches to creating healthier social systems for international students. Other than that, the findings from the study can also be used as a basis for future research.</p><p>Another strength of this thesis is its specificity in focusing on international education.</p><p>While other literature focuses on enterprise or destination specific factors when studying loyalty <ref type="bibr">(McKercher et al., 2012)</ref>, this research specifically examined international students who as a group constitute the major player in influencing destination-loyalty intention in international education.</p><p>Similarly, Study 1 is a pioneering exploration of the existing literature by providing an initial effort to compile and summarize relevant psychological theories and research on destination motivation, cultural orientation and adaptation among two main groups of international students in international education. As such, the present review conceptually and empirically works on this increasingly important subject related to destination-loyalty intention. Study 1 also suggested the articulation support to the importance of sociocultural adaptation relationship on destinationloyalty intention. This supports the notions of <ref type="bibr">Dorozhkin and Mazitova (2008)</ref> who emphasized that a great deal of research is still needed in understanding the level of sociocultural adaptation and intercultural interaction of international students.</p><p>Findings in Study 1 support the increasing relevance of this area of research especially in international education which is still under research. Therefore; it is argued that this research might add knowledge to the domain in the area of international education. Next, the findings of Study 2 represent the basis for future research that extends the link between intentions to revisit and to recommend a destination to well-being <ref type="bibr">(Brown &amp; Mazzarol, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dagger &amp; Sweeney, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>The use of a combination concept in the area of social psychology and tourism is the strength for Studies 1, 2 and 3. Another merit of Study 3 is the study on the intercultural elements that provide more valuable understandings on the overall international experience. The argument is that this research may add more insights into the real nature of the determinants for destination-loyalty intention from the analysis of the data using hierarchical multiple regression and structural equation modelling-AMOS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Limitations</head><p>All three papers have addressed various limitations specific to the study, and for brevity, these are not repeated here. Only limitations in general applicable to the whole thesis are focused on here. Future studies addressing the issues examined in Studies 1, 2 and 3 should aimed at using more heterogeneous samples, such as international students studying in other countries (i.e., Asia or Africa) to help ascertain the validity of the current findings.</p><p>In addition, it is important to note that the survey was answered by fewer than 500 international students in one education destination for each study. A follow-up may be necessary to track international students' process of acculturation-intention across different samples. Additionally, there are few variables with slightly low validity value (Cronbach alpha and AVE). I noted, however, that any discussion of interpretation and implication involving the variables with slightly low Cronbach alpha and AVE is provisional and requires replication to further confirm the said associations. Thus, generalization of the results for this research to other education destinations must be made with caution.</p><p>Moreover, due to the nature of the sample used in the quantitative study, not every group of personal values was included. Thus, conclusions on how other groups influence subjective well-being and subsequently destination-loyalty intention in education tourism are still unclear.</p><p>Further, the cross-sectional design used in this study does not allow for examination of acculturation changes, and impact of time in the acculturation framework. This study also assessed only direct associations between the variables in the acculturation framework with destination-loyalty intention. This study did not examine the association between the variables and the mediating variables that may have explained the associations that were found. Because culture represents a distal influence on individual-level outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Bronfenbrenner, 1979</ref>) more proximal mediating mechanisms are important to assess in future studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This thesis provides some insights into the psychological aspects of international students' sojourn in a foreign country. These students' experiences undoubtedly influence how they perceived a destination. As education becomes more international, this study helps to shade some lights on the important area to smoothen the transition across cultures for international students that can influence their destination-loyalty intention.</p><p>In sum, the research art of this thesis draws attention to the complexity of the acculturation process together with the main objective of understanding destinationloyalty intention of international students'. It started with international students' destination motivation (pull and push), cultural orientation and adaptation, and then it moves to the second study that was done to better understand how the basic personal values influence international students' subjective well-being and subsequently destination-loyalty intention. Finally, the study further investigates the relationship between the experience arising during acculturation (perceived discrimination and orientation to mainstream culture) and life satisfaction with destination-loyalty intention. A revised framework for building destination-loyalty intention is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>.</p><p>Results show that destinations motivation (pull), orientation to mainstream culture, orientation to heritage culture, sociocultural adaptation, psychological adaptation, international students' personal values (universalism), subjective well-being and experience arising during acculturation (perceived discrimination) influence destination-loyalty intention in three different studies. Only destination motivation (push) (in red) was found to be insignificant to destination-loyalty intention. The finding of this thesis hopefully has shed some light to the highly complex psychological processes related to acculturation experiences on the processing of destination-loyalty intention. This thesis concludes that optimizing the overall positive experience with the inclusion of the selected psychological variables is essential to improve destinationloyalty intention in international education. It could be argued that a complete study of international students' psychological variables related to acculturation experiences should follow a model that includes all of these aspects, but, of course, then it would be difficult to do research on these issues with the limited funding that most tourism researchers usually have. However, the overall finding of this thesis support the claims by <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">(Padgett et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Tartakovsky, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Wu &amp; Mak, 2011</ref>) that experiences and individuals' characteristics are among the variables that could further explain intentions or in this thesis specifically, destination-loyalty intention in international education.</p><p>Nevertheless, additional investigations of other acculturation preferences such as attitudes of other groups, in-group norms, and on life domains as proposed by Berry and his associates in the acculturation framework together with intention are essentials to further understand the phenomena. A qualitative study, longitudinal cohort study design and field experiment is also essential to further ascertain the causal relationship and elucidate the acculturation-intention relationship. These approaches are necessary to explore the associations between theoretical constructs within the field of international education studies.</p><p>In conclusion, the present research provides answers to a range of questions. At the same time, it has raised many questions regarding the investigation of acculturationdestination-loyalty intention. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>If you have any comments or suggestions about the questionnaire, please add your comments below:</head><p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p><p>Imagine the following scenario: someone has just come back from studying abroad at a wellknown education destination. In retrospect, he emphasizes that the destination met all the anticipated criteria, and that he had a wonderful experience, is satisfied and willing to revisit and recommend the destination to others. At the same time, he comments that there were other international students who preferred to stay at the students' hostel, showing little or no interest in exploring the destinations. They were neither happy nor satisfied with the overall experience with the locals at the destination because their initial expectations of the destination were not met. As a result, they disliked the place and were not interested in sharing their experiences with others. Neither were they interested in recommending the place to others.</p><p>This hypothetical scenario is a reflection of how the individual's decision prior to international educational and experience of local culture plays an important role in determining destination-loyalty intention. Grounded in the acculturation framework developed by Berry and his associates <ref type="bibr">(Berry, 1990</ref><ref type="bibr">(Berry, , 1992;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berry, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berry, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berry, Kim, Minde, &amp; Mok, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">Berry, Kim, Power, Young, &amp; Bujaki, 1989</ref>) and other relevant literature, we seek to understand how motivation to study abroad may influence international students' motivation to revisit and later recommend the destinations to others. More specifically, we look at the independent contributions made by motivation to study abroad, orientation to mainstream culture at the destination, orientation to heritage culture, and sociocultural and psychological adaptations at the destination in predicting destinationloyalty intention. This research is in response to the claim by <ref type="bibr" target="#b279">Ryan and Glendon (1998)</ref> that research has paid too little attention to the psychological aspects of the experience of international education. This research is also in response to the call by <ref type="bibr">Yuksel, Yuksel, and Bilim (2010)</ref> for exploration of the relationship between destination loyalty and psychological factors. To date, knowledge on how and why psychological factors may lead to destination-loyalty intention is very limited.</p><p>As part of internationalisation of higher education, colleges and universities continuously recruit and accept international students <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">(Guo &amp; Chase, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b302">Wildavsky, 2010)</ref>.

Upon returning home, they can take on a reverse ambassadors' role as representatives of the countries where they studied. Based on their sojourned experiences, they can encourage (or discourage) people in their social network to visit their previous international education destination. This latter role is linked to the students' loyalty to the country in which they studied. This is the focus of this study.</p><p>Destination-loyalty intention used in this study refers to international students' intentions to revisit and recommend the destination to people in their home country <ref type="bibr">(Oppermann, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yoon &amp; Uysal, 2005)</ref>. The objective of this study was to investigate the extent to which destination-loyalty intentions could be predicted by the students' destination motivation (pull and push), their orientations to the mainstream culture of the society they studied, vis-à-vis their own heritage culture, together with their psychological and sociocultural adaptation while studying abroad.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Projecting the differences for international students</head><p>To understand destination-loyalty intention, the present study distinguished between two types of students: those on long-term programmes versus those on short-term programmes. In line with this, it is known that individuals' motivation for pursuing exchange programmes for a semester or a year are different from those pursuing a degree that stretches over a number of years <ref type="bibr">(Jamaludin, Sam, Sandal, &amp; Adam, 2016a)</ref>.</p><p>The main motivation of short term students, according to <ref type="bibr">Massey and Burrow (2012)</ref> is to experience a new cross-cultural learning environment, followed by a specific academic opportunity, and a unique social experience. Just like their short-term peers, long-term students also have as their prime motive a cross-cultural experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">(Brewer, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr">Carlson &amp; Widaman, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sánchez, Fornerino, &amp; Zhang, 2006)</ref>; in addition to academic and/or foreign language development <ref type="bibr">(Caudery, Petersen, &amp; Shaw, 2008)</ref> Despite the similarities between the two groups of exchange students, there are more differences between the two than it may first seem to appear.

Dwyer also point out that study abroad has significant impact on students in the areas of continued language use, academic attainment measures, intercultural and personal development, and career choices, and these hold more true for long-term students than for short-term students Based on these subtle differences between the two groups of students, we assume that they will differentially impact on their destination loyalty intentions; and we explore this assumption in the study.</p><p>There were also differences among international students with regards to cultural orientation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b278">Pitts (2009)</ref> suggested that short-term visits do not offer the same level of cultural immersion and opportunities for intercultural growth compared to long-term programme visits. This makes us believe that international students on short-term and long-term programs have differential destination-loyalty intentions.</p><p>With regard to adaptation, acculturation researchers make a distinction between psychological and sociocultural adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b284">(Schachner, Schiller, Van de Vijver, &amp; Noack, 2014)</ref>. Psychological adaptation outcomes include well-being, life satisfaction, and mental health, whereas sociocultural adaptation outcomes refer to an individual's competence in mastering daily life in a particular cultural context <ref type="bibr" target="#b299">(Ward, 2001)</ref>.

Psychological adaptation in this study was measured by life satisfaction <ref type="bibr">(Berry et al., 2006)</ref>.

"Push" motivations refer to elements that operate in the home country of the student, which stimulate or literally "push" the individual to study abroad <ref type="bibr">(González et al., 2011)</ref>. "Pull" factors refer to elements of a country that "pull" a student to study abroad <ref type="bibr">(González et al., 2011)</ref> and operate within the source country to initiate a student's decision to undertake an international study there <ref type="bibr">(Mazzarol &amp; Soutar, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Lesjak et al.

In comparison, other studies found that awareness of information on the host country, personal background and financial situation, the comparability of the higher education system in the host country, and administrative and funding conditions are obstacles to participation, and do have an impact on destination choice motives (Souto-Otero, Huisman, Beerkens, de Wit, &amp; VujiĆ, 2013).</p><p>In summary, while literature has shown numerous links between motivation-destination choices and loyalty of international students, consensus on how motivation may be related to destination-loyalty intention among short-term and long-term international students' remains divided. Thus, we further explored how push and pull motivation factors may affect their destination-loyalty intention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Orientation to mainstream culture and heritage culture</head><p>Cultural orientation refers broadly to an individual's orientations toward mainstream culture and their ethnic culture and has often been indexed by their endorsement of particular cultural values <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">(Neblett, Rivas Drake, &amp; Umaña Taylor, 2012)</ref>. Neblett and colleagues suggest that <ref type="bibr" target="#b307">(Zhang &amp; Dixon, 2003)</ref>. Further, <ref type="bibr">Berry (2005)</ref> suggests that separation is the preferred strategy of individuals who place high value on holding on to their heritage culture, and low value on acquiring the host culture. These individuals choose the separation alternative. He suggests that individuals who place a value on holding on to their heritage culture also tend to turn their back on involvement with other cultural groups while holding on to their heritage culture. Thus, we assume that this will have a negative relationship with their loyalty intention to a destination. Accordingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b303">Yavas (1990)</ref> noted that Saudi tourists were concerned about the West's image and preferred to visit Muslim countries, suggesting that orientation to heritage culture does play a role in influencing intention.</p><p>Taking into consideration the orientation to heritage culture-destination-loyalty intention perspectives and observing the literature over time, it appears that they are not completely exclusive. Thus, we further explored how orientation to heritage culture may affect students' destination-loyalty intention. <ref type="bibr">Berry (1997)</ref> points out that factors such as destination motivation need to be studied as a basis for understanding the degree of voluntariness in the acculturating individuals.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The overall working hypothesis of this study was that international students can influence friends, family members or other people in their social network to visit the country in which they have studied, and that the findings may have some ramifications for the international student exchange programmes, and also for the tourist industry of the country concerned.</p><p>Results suggested that gender and age did not contribute significantly to the regression model, either for short-term or long-term students. The most important predictors of destination-loyalty intention for both short-term and long-term students were destination motivation (pull), orientation to heritage and orientation to mainstream culture. Of the two forms of adaptation, sociocultural adaptation was found to be related to destination-loyalty intention only for long-term students. Psychological adaptation was significant in predicting destination-loyalty intention only among short-term students.</p><p>Our findings concerning Hypothesis 1, on whether international students' destination motivation (push) will have weaker relationship with destination-loyalty intention for (H1a) short-term than (H1b) long-term students indicated that destination motivation (push) for both short-term and long-term students was not consistent with the hypothesis. The association between push motivation and destination-loyalty intention is a bit puzzling. The results did not show significant associations between push motivation and destination-loyalty intention. We speculate that perhaps, for international students, destination motivation (push) might offer considerable power in predicting and explaining participation in destinationloyalty intention at the initial stage prior to the actual international education experiences. We believe that in this study, in which the students are already at the destination, other factors relating to social and academic life may be more important when trying to navigate successfully in the new environment.</p><p>Hypothesis 2 on positive association between international students' destination motivation (pull) destination-loyalty intention was supported for both short-term (H2a) and long-term (H2b) students. However, between the two, destination motivation (pull) shows a stronger relationship with destination-loyalty intention for long-term students as compared to shortterm students. This support suggestions by <ref type="bibr" target="#b250">Dwyer (2004)</ref> on the stronger impact of study abroad on long-term students than their short-term counterparts. This findings is in line with suggestions by <ref type="bibr">Mazzarol and Soutar (2002)</ref> that destination motivation (pull) is more important to a destination. This is because; many countries are presently "upgrading" their supply side of international education. The "upgrading" includes host country institutions developing branch campuses in other countries that will gradually reduce the impact of the push factor <ref type="bibr">(Mazzarol &amp; Soutar, 2002)</ref>. Under these circumstances, we posit that the host countries' ability to continue to remain competitive in attracting foreign student will depend mostly on pull motivation factors. Of these, we found that knowledge and awareness, reputation, social cost issues and social links are likely to be important for international students. This is not surprising but further highlights the need of host country governments and education institutions to invest, ensuring that promotion activities are implemented in a proper way.</p><p>Moreover, results from the hierarchical analyses on temporal changes that occur between international students' destination motivations (short-term and long-term) show that in international education, students adopt fairly stable motivations during their international sojourn. The results of this investigation strongly support the effectiveness of destination motivation (pull) as a variable for predicting and understanding destination-loyalty intention.</p><p>We believe that, even though motivation can fluctuate <ref type="bibr" target="#b246">(Darby, Longmire-Avital, Chenault, &amp; Haglund, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b265">Kiemer, Gröschner, Pehmer, &amp; Seidel, 2015)</ref>, international students' destination motivation (pull) experience may offer considerable power with regard to their intentions to recommend the destination to others and to revisit.</p><p>A negative relationship was found between short-term international students' orientation to heritage culture (Hypothesis 3a) and destination-loyalty intention. Perhaps this relationship can be explained in the context of international students' unmet expectations. This is in line with <ref type="bibr">Berry (2005)</ref>, who suggests that individuals who place a value on holding on to their heritage culture tend to turn their back on involvement with other cultural groups while holding on to their heritage culture. We believe this negatively influences destination-loyalty intention. Consequently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b278">Pitts (2009)</ref> has proposed that a pre-departure training programme that includes information on how to recognize and manage external expectations is important.</p><p>We believe that pre-departure training may not only help students develop realistic expectations and goals regarding the overseas sojourn, it may also enhance their chances of "succeeding" and subsequently their destination-loyalty intention.</p><p>With respect to long-term students, a positive relationship was found between students' orientation to heritage culture and destination-loyalty intention (Hypothesis 3b). This was not consistent with hypothesis 3b. However, this findings supports the suggestion by <ref type="bibr">Berry (2005)</ref> that most people undergoing acculturation adjust positively. Further, <ref type="bibr">Berry (1997)</ref> suggests that orientation to heritage culture is part of the integration acculturation strategy.</p><p>Several studies have found a positive relationship between integration and adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">(Hui, Chen, Leung, &amp; Berry, 2015)</ref>. Evidence suggested that international students are not substantially demotivated by their orientation to heritage culture. We posit that possibly the nature of their stay (education) influences them. They find opportunities, and manage to navigate in the new society to achieve their goals, sometimes beyond their expectations. The argument and evidence presented here relate primarily to long-term international students.</p><p>However, they are equally relevant for institutional arrangements, industry players and for individuals in the wider society. Nevertheless, in the absence of conceptual clarity and empirical foundations, further research is essential to clarify these mixed results for both groups of international students.</p><p>Hypotheses 4a and 4b supported the notion that orientation to mainstream culture is positively related to destination-loyalty intention. However, between the two groups, we found that short-term students have stronger influence on destination-loyalty intention. This is not in line with suggestions by <ref type="bibr" target="#b250">Dwyer (2004)</ref> and hypothesis 4. However, the findings is consistent with past research that show a positive association between orientation to mainstream culture and destination-loyalty intention <ref type="bibr">(Jamaludin et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zea et al., 1997)</ref>. These two studies suggest that well-adjusted students in the host communities are more likely to remain and have a sense of positive integration or assimilation, which arguably should strengthen their educational goals, commitment and loyalty. Thus, international students who have a positive experience and strong relationship with the host society are more likely to return to the host destination or recommend it to others. Based on the results, we believe industry players need to accentuate the international students' experiences at a destination. We recommend that the institutions of higher learning to come up with programmes that increase the degree of social participation for international students. Future researchers should continue to conduct systematic investigations of this factor in order to better attract and retain international students. We contend that this work has the potential to advance the development of culturally informed, empirically supported interventions for international students.</p><p>Our results indicated that sociocultural adaptation has a positive influence on destinationloyalty intention only for long-term students, and not short-term students. According to <ref type="bibr">Sam (2015)</ref>, individuals who perceive themselves to be socially skilled also feel confident in their understanding of the culture of the new society. <ref type="bibr">Berry (2005)</ref> found a linear relationship between sociocultural adaptation and time. Thus, our finding with respect to long-term students compared to short-term students seems reasonable.</p><p>Language proficiency, communication competence, and effective social interaction are three major keys to sociocultural adaptation <ref type="bibr">(Searle &amp; Ward, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b301">Ward &amp; Rana-Deuba, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Within this context, we believe that enhancing Norwegian language skills will be a major breakthrough. Industry players and educational institutions should come up with programmes that are directly related to increased interaction with host nationals, giving a consequent decrease in sociocultural adjustment problems. It could result in better intercultural understanding and diminished feelings of strangeness and social distance. Furthermore, we believe that intercultural training may be effective in facilitating a student's adjustment in the foreign country.</p><p>Finally, the findings for Hypothesis 6 indicate that psychological adaptation was related to destination-loyalty intention only for short-term students. It is possible that short-term students, whose academic degrees are conferred by their home institution, can afford to take life with ease as they collect a few course credits <ref type="bibr">(Sam, Tetteh, &amp; Amponsah, 2015)</ref>, unlike long-term students taking a full academic degree at a foreign university. Short-term students are also known to spend a lot of time sightseeing and touring during their overseas sojourn <ref type="bibr">(Sam et al., 2015)</ref>. It is plausible that their overall satisfaction is related to the joys of touring and sightseeing; thus, this will influence their intention to revisit and recommend the destination.</p><p>Further, all of the short-term students in this study originated from Europe, and can travel back to their home countries for a brief period, even for a weekend if they want. This perhaps further influences their psychological adaptation and subsequently their destination-loyalty intention.</p><p>Our analyses of how orientation to heritage culture and adaptation affects destination-loyalty intention reveal a generally reliable pattern. Nevertheless, the inconsistent findings with hypotheses require further verification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and conclusion</head><p>A natural question is whether our findings can be generalized to other international students in other Western countries. We think it is too early to give a clear answer to this question, except to suggest that more studies are needed. We recommend that future studies should use more heterogeneous samples, such as international students from other places. Destinationloyalty intentions in this study were measured during the international students' stay in Norway. We do not know whether these results would be maintained when the students return to their home countries. We believe, research examining destination-loyalty intentions after completion of the students' overseas sojourn will go a long way in providing us with a better understanding of this phenomenon.</p><p>We postulate that these findings can be developed further to offer new insights into research on destination-loyalty intention beyond perceiving destination motivation, cultural orientation, and adaptation solely as predictors. Although each of these findings represents an important contribution to the understanding of student loyalty intention, a significant amount of research is still required in order to explicate relational exchanges in this context, given the competitive context in which they are presently immersed.</p><p>It can be concluded that for short-term students, destination motivation (pull) together with orientation to mainstream, orientation to heritage and psychological adaptations are the most important variables in influencing international students' decision to revisit and recommend the destination. For long-term students, destination motivation (pull) together with orientation to mainstream, orientation to heritage and sociocultural adaptations are the most important variables in destination-loyalty intention. Despite the exploratory nature of this study, the findings add insights to the psychology of international students and improve knowledge about destination-loyalty intention.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>International education is a rising phenomenon worldwide. The internationalization of higher education is one response to the driving force of globalization (Van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b368">Wende 2007)</ref>. Despite the fact that international students share a number of characteristics with tourists in that both groups are sojourners, very little research attention has been devoted to the possibility of the tourism industry capitalizing on the rising internationalization of higher education for economic gains. Meanwhile, <ref type="bibr" target="#b342">Jamaludin et al. (2016)</ref> have argued that international students' choice of foreign institutions and their loyalty towards these institutions and the host society should be valuable to several stakeholders. Studies have shown that international education generates financial benefits for the host countries <ref type="bibr">(Benos and Zotou 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhou and Zhang 2014)</ref>. Not only do international students serve as ambassadors for their own country during the overseas sojourn, they may also take on another ambassadorial role upon the completion of their studies and stay. They will encourage (or discourage) people in their social network to visit the country <ref type="bibr" target="#b342">(Jamaludin et al. 2016</ref>) depending on their experiences during their sojourn abroad. This latter role is linked to the students' loyalty to the country in which they sojourned, and forms the focus of this study; namely the determinants of international students' loyalty to the destination where they studied.</p><p>Specifically, we examine how international students' personal values may affect their subjective well-being at their destination, and how these variables (i.e., personal values and subjective well-being) again impact their destination-loyalty intentions. Destination-loyalty intention refers to an individual's intentions to revisit and recommend the destination to people in their home country <ref type="bibr">(Oppermann 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yoon and Uysal 2005)</ref>. Moreover, in this study, the interest is on international students' destination loyalty after their overseas sojourn.</p></div>

International students constitute one of the largest and significant sojourner groups <ref type="bibr">(Bochner 2006)</ref>. As a sojourner group, international students continue to grow in number worldwide, prompting researchers to study their global significance <ref type="bibr">(Safdar and Berno 2016)</ref>. International students' contributions to global society and economy are presently well documented, but very little is known about their contribution to the tourism sector. Contemporary international education embraces two categories of students: short-term students who tend to stay for a few weeks to a whole year, mainly to obtain some credits that may be transferred to their home university; and long-term students who often stay for periods longer than a year to complete their academic degree at the overseas university. While short-term students' sojourns may be longer than those of an average tourist, the longer stay offers them an opportunity to get to know the society better and to develop stronger loyalty intention than the typical tourist. Long-term students may even have a better opportunity to develop destination-loyalty intentions because their overseas sojourn is so much longer accepting that some aspects of international education may involve tourism, it may be economically prudent to understand international students' destination loyalty and how this may impact global tourism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>International students as sojourners and tourism</head><p>Although there may appear to be superficial similarities between tourists and other sojourning groups, tourism's unique characteristics contribute to distinctive intercultural experiences and interactions <ref type="bibr">(Safdar and Berno 2016)</ref>. While literature suggests that relatively few requirements are placed on tourists to adapt to the local host community <ref type="bibr">(Berno and Ward 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mathieson and Wall 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr">Safdar and Berno 2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Mathieson and Wall (1982)</ref> tourists do need to adjust and many of the responses of tourists are not markedly different from those of other sojourners <ref type="bibr">(Hottola 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pearce et al. 1998)</ref>. Arguing that international students share a number of characteristics with tourists, <ref type="bibr" target="#b342">Jamaludin et al. (2016)</ref> have shown that educational experiences of international students impact their loyalty intention to the destination.</p><p>Only few studies have to date examined the presumed links between tourism and subjective well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b347">(McCabe and Johnson 2013)</ref>. Research suggests that there are significant relationships among personal values, subjective well-being and behavioural intention [i.e., <ref type="bibr">Sagiv and Schwartz (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Hallowell (1996)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b334">Fornell et al. (1996)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b355">Ryu et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b330">Emmons (1991)</ref>]. Although links between values, subjective well-being and international students are emerging, consensus on how values may influence subjective well-being and how this in turn may affect destination-loyalty intention remains unclear. The paper highlights this gap and focuses on personal values and subjective well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mapping the differences for international students</head><p>To gain a better understanding of personal values, <ref type="bibr" target="#b360">Schwartz (2009)</ref> suggested categorizing samples according to cultural similarity and dissimilarity with the host society. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b360">Schwartz (2009)</ref>, people from Western Europe who are culturally similar to Norwegians score high on egalitarianism, intellectual autonomy, and harmony, and score low on hierarchy and embeddedness. In contrast, people from countries that are culturally dissimilar to Norway such as societies in Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East have cultures that score especially high in affective autonomy and mastery. <ref type="bibr" target="#b360">Schwartz (2009)</ref> also suggested that people in the latter cultures tend to find meaning in life through social relationships and obeying expectations from those in roles of greater status or authority.</p><p>We argue that these comparisons (i.e., comparing students from culturally similar and culturally dissimilar countries relative to Norway) will increase our understanding of personal values-subjective well-being-destination-loyalty intention among international students. However, a study making such comparisons will require a larger sample size to better understand the significant different between cultures. As the main area of interest for this study is to understand destination-loyalty intention, the present study opted not to dwell very much on cultural differences, as we do not have good measures of culture. Rather, the present study focused more on the duration of the students' studies (i.e., long-term vs. short term). In a country like Norway, many short-term students come from countries that are culturally similar to Norway, and long-term students tend to originate from culturally dissimilar countries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Duration of studies</head><p>There are several reasons for international students choosing an overseas sojourn, and these differ for students who are on short-term study programmes lasting for a few weeks to one academic year, and long-term students who pursue a full degree lasting 2 years or more. A study by <ref type="bibr">Massey and Burrow (2012)</ref> found the desire for a cross-cultural learning environment, followed by distinctive academic opportunity, and a unique social experience to be the main motivation of the incoming exchange students. These findings are consistent with previous research such as from <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">Brewer (1983)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b319">Carlson (1990)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Sánchez et al. (2006)</ref>, which found that cross-cultural reasons surpass academic and/or social reasons for studying abroad.</p><p>It is known that individuals pursuing exchange programmes for a semester or a year are different from those pursuing a degree that stretches over a couple of years. A number of studies focusing on the motives for studying abroad among long-term students have identified the desire for a cross-cultural experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">(Brewer 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr">Carlson and Widaman 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sánchez et al. 2006)</ref>; and academic and/or foreign language development <ref type="bibr">(Caudery et al. 2008</ref>) to be among the principal motivating factors for participating in a study-abroad programme. For shortterm students, <ref type="bibr">Massey and Burrow (2012)</ref> suggested that the main motivation of the incoming exchange students is a new cross-cultural learning environment, followed by a specific academic opportunity, along with a unique social experience. Acknowledging that short-term and long-term students have different motives for their overseas sojourn, we explored how short-term and long-term students' personal values may affect their subjective wellbeing and destination-loyalty intention.</p></div>

(2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Sagiv and Schwartz (2000)</ref> show that the interest in the relationship between personal values and well-being is on the rise. The notion that subjective well-being could and should be used to inform public policy is gaining momentum, and subjective well-being measures have recently been included in government programmes to complement more traditional measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b326">(Diener and Seligman 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Values are motivational goals that influence attitudes, behaviours and evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Fischer and Boer 2016</ref>). Schwartz's value theory <ref type="bibr">(Schwartz and Bardi 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schwartz and Bilsky 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schwartz et al. 2001)</ref>, describes values as desirable, trans-situational goals of varying importance, which serve as guidelines for action. They influence human behaviour, motivation and goals <ref type="bibr">(Ferssizidis et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Homer and Kahle 1988)</ref>. In other words, personal values reflect what is primarily important to a person and consequently form a central part of an individual's identity that guides their action. Moreover, well-being can be defined as an optimal psychological functioning and experience that favours both a positive hedonic state and the development of skills and personal growth <ref type="bibr">(Ryan and Deci 2001)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, we took into account both affective and cognitive components of subjective or hedonic well-being, which we considered relevant in relation to personal values and destination-loyalty intention. Hedonic well-being refers both to the prevalence of positive emotions over negative ones and to the level of satisfaction with life and its specific domains <ref type="bibr">(Bobowik et al. 2011)</ref>. It indicates how people feel and think about their lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b325">(Diener and Scollon 2003)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr">Sagiv and Schwartz (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Sortheix and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lönnqvist (2014, 2015)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">(Bobowik et al. 2011</ref>), a person's subjective well-being may depend on the person's value priorities. Thus, we assumed that values could account for some of the predictive variance associated with the destination intentions of international students. <ref type="bibr">Bobowik et al. (2011)</ref> nevertheless point out that values are not uniformly related to well-being, with variations across societies being driven by contextual demands in a functional value-fit pattern emphasizing successful adaptation to social and economic demands <ref type="bibr">(Sortheix and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lönnqvist 2014, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>As stated by <ref type="bibr">Sagiv and Schwartz (2000)</ref>, values that represent growth needs (e.g. self-actualization) become more important when a person attains the goals toward which the values are directed. Growth-need values are those that deal with realizing personal potential, selffulfilment, and peak experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b344">(Maslow et al. 1970)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Sagiv and Schwartz (2000)</ref> further suggested that priority given to growth-related values is likely to correlate positively with subjective well-being. In the personal value model, self-direction, universalism, benevolence, achievement, and stimulation are identified as growth needs <ref type="bibr">(Bilsky and Schwartz 1994)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b347">McCabe and Johnson (2013)</ref> have suggested that growth needs might include high-involvement tourism experiences, or those linked to personal and spiritual development. <ref type="bibr" target="#b365">Sirgy (2009)</ref> has also suggested that tourism goals related to growth needs are likely to contribute more to life satisfaction and positive affect (moods). We believe international students' personal values are associated with growth needs, and they have the potential to lead to satisfaction in wider life domains (other than leisure needs).</p><p>Following Sortheix and Lönnqvist (2014) assertion, we assume that for short-term students, the majority of whom come from culturally similar countries, universalism, benevolence and achievement will be positively related to well-being. We also postulated that self-direction and stimulation would be negatively related to wellbeing. By contrast, for long-term students, the majority of whom come from culturally dissimilar countries, we anticipate that achievement, self-direction and stimulation promote well-being, but that benevolence and universalism are detrimental to well-being. Results of studies between personal values and well-being are nevertheless inconclusive <ref type="bibr">(Bobowik et al. 2011)</ref>. For this reason, in the present study, both long-term and short-term groups of students were analysed to further examine whether personal values are associated with subjective well-being in different types of samples of international students.</p><p>Based on the empirical evidence and findings, the present study adopts Schwartz's value theory <ref type="bibr">(Schwartz and Bardi 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schwartz and Bilsky 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schwartz et al. 2001)</ref> with focus on self-direction, stimulation, benevolence, universalism and achievement. <ref type="bibr">Schwartz (2012)</ref> argued that people with a self-direction value orientation have more independent thought, curiosity and self-respect, whereas people with a stimulation-value orientation are more directed towards excitement, novelty, and challenge in life. <ref type="bibr">Schwartz (2012)</ref> also suggested that people with achievement value orientation are more inclined to seek personal success through demonstrating competence according to a social standard and social recognition, and that people with a benevolence-value orientation are more protective and try to enhance the welfare of those with whom they are in frequent personal contact. Finally, <ref type="bibr">Schwartz (2012)</ref> suggested that people with a universalism-value orientation are more understanding, appreciative, tolerant, and protective of the welfare of all people and of nature. We posit that for international students, these values may be a strong predictor of well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective well-being and destination-loyalty intention</head><p>Studies indicate that people who are satisfied with life are also more successful and socially active <ref type="bibr">(Diener et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lyubomirsky et al. 2005)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">Graham and Markowitz (2011)</ref>, life satisfaction influences an individual's intention to stay at a destination. They suggest that the chances of relocating are high when people are dissatisfied with their location. Moreover, a study by <ref type="bibr">Özdemir (2014)</ref> found that high levels of positive affectivity constitute a state of high energy, full concentration and pleasurable engagement with the environment. Negative affectivity refers to a general dimension of subjective distress and unpleasurable engagement, and is identified by aversive mood states such as anger, contempt, disgust, fear, and nervousness <ref type="bibr">(Özdemir 2014)</ref>. Affective experiences influence a consumer's behaviour and perception during consumption interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b335">(Gountas and Gountas 2007)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b322">Chi and Yang (2015)</ref>, if a past event was associated with an unpleasant mood, a similar unpleasant mood in a subsequent time period is likely to activate the recall of relevant information <ref type="bibr" target="#b316">(Bower 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b333">Forgas 1995)</ref>, and potentially elicit a behaviour or intention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b317">Bradburn (1969)</ref> has suggested that affectivity influences an individual's outgoing activities. Following the affective response study conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b352">Russell et al. (1981)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b351">Pike and Ryan (2004)</ref> have suggested that affect usually becomes operational during the evaluative stage of the destination selection process. It can be argued that present moods can influence individuals' decisions. Thus, affect in the context of tourism appears to be the evaluative element for destination loyalty or at least destinationloyalty intention. Nevertheless, to date, little research has documented the dynamics of subjective well-being (life satisfaction, affectivity)-intention relationship. In the present study both long-term and short-term international students populations are analysed to examine how subjective well-being (life satisfaction and affectivity) are associated with destination-loyalty intention in different types of samples. No hypotheses have been formulated here with respect to these relationships for short versus long-term students because of differences in the underlying motives for their sojourns abroad.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and procedure</head><p>This study was approved by the Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD). All registered international students at the University of Bergen were eligible to participate in the study. These students were contacted via email to participate by the International Students' Office in University of Bergen through its database. Data were collected in 2014. A total of 396 students (36.53 %) accepted the invitation and filled out the questionnaire. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">1</ref> shows the demographic profile of the respondents, which have been separated into long-term (N = 214) versus short-term (N = 182). In this study, short-term students comprise those who came to study for periods of less than 12 months and were predominantly students from Western Europe (68.7 %), which is culturally similar to Norway. Long-term students who came to study for 12 months and longer comprise students from around the world with a major proportion (more than 35 %) from Africa and the Middle East. In terms of gender: for long-term students, the number of male students (51.9 %) is slightly higher than the number of female students (48.1 %). For all groups, the majority (more than 50 %) were between 20 and 30 years old. Details of the demographic profile of the respondents can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement of the variables Destination-loyalty intention</head><p>Destination-loyalty intention as our dependent variable was assessed using three items by <ref type="bibr">Oppermann (2000)</ref>, where two items dealt with revisitation and one item focused on recommending the destination to friends and relatives. The items used were: "After I have completed my course/study, I will travel to Bergen if my financial position permits it"; "My overall feeling about Bergen is so good that I will come again after I completed my course/study"; and "I will recommend Bergen to my friends/relatives as a vacation destination to visit". Responses were rated on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective well-being</head><p>Subjective well-being was assessed throughout the two group samples using an affect balance measure together with life satisfaction. To measure this, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) developed by <ref type="bibr">Diener et al. (1985)</ref> and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) developed by <ref type="bibr">Watson et al. (1988)</ref> were used.</p><p>The Satisfaction with Life Scale includes five items to be answered on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). Examples of the questions are as follows: "In most ways my life is close to my ideal"; and "The conditions of my life are excellent".</p><p>PANAS measures positive (PA) and negative affect (NA). The instrument includes 20 words describing different feelings and emotions. The respondents were asked to indicate to what extent they have felt this way in the last 2 weeks. Examples of feelings are: "distressed"; "scared"; "excited"; and "upset". For the PANAS scale, we assessed affect balance following suggestions drawn from <ref type="bibr">(Watson et al. 1988</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b324">(Diener 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personal values</head><p>The 40-item PVQ or PVQ-40 was used in the present study. The PVQ-40 comprises 10 subscales that measure the 10 value types. Each PVQ item comprises a two-sentence short verbal portrayal of a person's goals or aspirations <ref type="bibr" target="#b359">(Schwartz 2005</ref>), e.g. "Thinking up new ideas and being creative is important to him/her"; "He/she likes to do things in his/her own original way"; and "It is important to him/her to be rich. " For each portrait, respondents answered the question "How much like you is this person?" on a 6-point scale (1 = not like me at all to 6 = very much like me).</p></div>

All the mean scores for short-term and long-term were above the neutral point of the scale (i.e. above 3), suggesting that respondents were on the positive side of the scale.</p><p>Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to test the questions arising from the theoretical model. The data analysis was carried out in accordance with the twostep methodology-measurement model and structural model test as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b308">(Anderson and Gerbing 1988)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The measurement model test</head><p>To refine all measures for the structural model, a measurement model using the maximum likelihood estimation method was applied. The initial items relating to three main variables, i.e. subjective well-being (affect, life satisfaction), personal values (self-direction, benevolence, universalism, stimulation and achievement) and destination-loyalty intentions were subjected to a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The CFA results on the remaining items showed a good fit to the data. The details of the results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">3</ref>. The Chi square was also reported to be significant. However, the hypothesized model could be accepted as providing a good fit even though the Chi square value is statistically significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b308">(Anderson and Gerbing 1988)</ref>, especially with a large sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b309">(Bagozzi and Yi 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hair et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>A reliability test was conducted to assess internal consistency of multiple indicators for each construct. Details of the results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">4</ref>. Results in indicate that multiple measures in this study are reliable for assessing each construct <ref type="bibr">(Nunnally 1978)</ref>. However, for the value of average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability, which is lower than recommended, the Cronbach Alpha index was evaluated <ref type="bibr">(Baumgartner and Homburg 1996)</ref>. We noted however that any discussion of interpretation and implication involving the variables with slightly low AVE is provisional and requires replication to further confirm the associations between variables. A construct validity test was conducted using the factor loadings within the constructs, and as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">4</ref>, all standardized factor loadings emerged as fairly high. This showed that the measurement had convergent validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b308">(Anderson and Gerbing 1988)</ref>. Finally, results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">5</ref> indicate that discriminant validity is well established. Following <ref type="bibr">Hair et al. (2010)</ref>, no correlation among the latent variables exceeded 0.9, which suggests good discriminant validity. In fact, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">5</ref> shows that the correlation coefficients among the latent constructs did not exceed 0.9. Therefore, the model is assumed to be free from multicollinearity problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b332">(Fidell and Tabachnick 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hair et al. 2010)</ref>. From the tests for reliability and validity, strong evidence was found to suggest that the constructs satisfied the requirement for reliability, convergence and discriminant validity.</p></div>

Results suggest that for long-term respondents, goodness of fit Index (GFI) = 0.91; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05; Tucker Lewis index (TLI) = 0.95 and comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.96; and for short-term respondents, goodness of fit Index (GFI) = 0.93; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.04; Tucker Lewis index (TLI) = 0.95 and comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.96; the model was found to achieve adequate fit to the observed data. Thus the proposed structural model satisfies the conditions of unidimensionality.</p><p>For short-term students, results indicate that of the five personal values tested, only universalism is significant (β = 0.37, p value &lt;0.05). The other personal values: benevolence (β = -0.05, p value = 0.775), self-direction (β = 0.16, p value = 0.315), stimulation (β = 0.02, p value = 0.904) and achievement (β = 0.19, p value = 0.224) were all not significant. With respect to long-term students, none of the personal values was found to be significantly related to subjective well-being, i.e., universalism (β = 0.38, p value = 0.344), benevolence (β = -0.07, p value = 0.804), self-direction (β = -0.68, p value = 0.385), stimulation (β = 0.73, p value = 0.307) and achievement (β = 0.06, p value = 0.639). However, the relationship between subjective well-being and destination-loyalty intention was significant for both shortterm (β = 0.33, p value &lt;0.05) and long-term (β = 0.21, p value &lt;0.05) students. The results are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">1</ref> (short-term) and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> (long-term).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Our point of departure for this study was that subjective well-being and destination-loyalty intentions may have relevance for public policy in international education. This contention however, turned out not to be as straightforward as we assumed. Many of the relations between personal values, subjective well-being and destination-loyalty intentions turned out not to be significant.</p><p>One clear finding from the analysis is the role of universalism in subjective well-being among short-term students. This finding is also supported by the notion that social-focused values (benevolence) promote well-being among West Europeans <ref type="bibr">(Sortheix and Lönnqvist 2014)</ref>. In other words, short-term international students (mostly exchange students) appear to favour conditions that promote selflessness, understanding, appreciation, tolerance and protection for the welfare of all people and for nature in order to feel good about themselves. Stated another way, international students who benefit from their stay in Norway emphasize the clean nature and the welfare society of the country. Highlighting these aspects of Norway may be important when trying to attract students to come to Norway.</p><p>Although we did not find a significant relationship between benevolence and subjective well-being, the result is consistent with <ref type="bibr">Sagiv and Schwartz (2000)</ref> suggestion that benevolence values may not necessarily be related with well-being. This value emphasizes caring   about the well-being of other people. For exchange students who feel isolated or struggle with their social adaptation, a strong emphasis on social relationships may have negative consequences. Similarly, our analysis did not show significant relationships between self-direction and subjective well-being. Self-direction refers to an emphasis on independent thoughts and actions <ref type="bibr">(Schwartz 2012)</ref>. The lack of significant relationship may reflect the fact that autonomy is not an important source of gratification for international students.</p><p>The result of stimulation value orientations-subjective well-being also indicates that stimulation is not related to international students' subjective well-being. The present finding is not consistent with the other studies, i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b354">Ryan et al. (1996)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Sortheix and Lönnqvist (2014)</ref>. It appears that in international education, and for international students in Norway in particular, the conditions of being adventurous, exciting and independent may not be important predictors of their well-being.</p><p>Finally, we did not find any significant relationship between achievement-value orientations and international students' subjective well-being. The finding suggests that individuals high on achievement-value orientation may be less concerned with loyalty to a destination, and their happiness with respect to a destination may be less relevant for both groups of long-term and short-term students.</p><p>While this study found very little support regarding the relationship between personal values and subjective well-being, we think it may be premature to dismiss the potential relationship as non-existent. Further studies on these relationships may be needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. Nevertheless, based on our findings, we recommend that stakeholders in the international education industry focus more on universalism as a personal value that enhances subjective well-being for short-term students, to further enhance destinationloyalty intention when implementing regulations, policy and promoting the destination. It is possible that the specific relationship between universalism and satisfaction is specific to exchange students in Norway. Future research should address the extent to which this association iterates among exchange students in other countries.</p><p>The second research objectives examined the relationship between subjective well-being and destinationloyalty intention. Here consistent relationships between subjective well-being and destination-loyalty intention were found for both long-term and short-term students, and these are in line with studies by <ref type="bibr">Dagger and Sweeney (2006)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Brown and Mazzarol (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Hon and Brunner (2002)</ref>. Within the context of international education, feelings such as enthusiasm, being active, being alert, having full concentration and pleasurable engagement with one's surroundings appear to influence one's intentions to revisit and to recommend a destination.</p><p>This finding may have important implications. The significant relationship between subjective well-being and destination-loyalty intention can be further nurtured by education practitioners through adjusting the introduction programs and providing support throughout the sojourn duration. Considering this along with the results of the present study, it seems that interventions targeted on enhancing well-being may influence international students' destination-loyalty intention, and this may have economic benefits in the long run. We recommend that education practitioners/hospitality managers and marketers consider incorporating into their strategy programs elements that drive international students' well-being. They should devise strategies for meaningful interactions that embed international students' in the organization and make them feel like insiders. In particular, education practitioners should make an effort to develop a distinctive service that resonates with their core customers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and conclusions</head><p>The study acknowledges the limitations of the approach taken here to analyse the total process of destinationloyalty intention. Perhaps this discrepancy between the results is related to international students following different values that are not tested in this study in relation to well-being and destination-loyalty intention. Generally, our results suggest that some of the relations between personal values and well-being are contextdependent, thereby not supporting models in which the links between well-being and values are qualified by the particular environment <ref type="bibr">(Diener et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sagiv and Schwartz 2000)</ref>. Future research should consider taking into account the psychosocial situation of the student. The contribution of personal values to well-being (positively or negatively) may depend on whether they are compatible with the values emphasized in the particular environment <ref type="bibr">(Sagiv and Schwartz 2000)</ref>. We believe the role of personal values needs to be further examined in relation to destination-loyalty intention.</p><p>Although the findings of this study help to assure extensive evidence on the relationship between universalism value domains and cognitive/affective aspects of subjective well-being, the insignificant relationship between other personal values with subjective well-being in this study has to be taken into consideration. However, according to <ref type="bibr">Bobowik et al. (2011)</ref>, values deserve special attention and consideration in research into well-being, because personal growth-related values can indeed make us happier. Thus, Bobowik and colleagues have suggested that in order to examine the relationship in more detail, it may be advisable to include measurements of eudemonic well-being. The eudemonic perspective of well-being may be more strongly associated with value domains <ref type="bibr">(Bobowik et al. 2011)</ref>. Future research should examine this issue in order to shed more light on the relationship between personal value domains and subjective wellbeing in international education.</p><p>Subjective well-being is a construct consisting of several distinct but related components or dimensions. Future research should also consider the inverse relationship between subjective well-being and destinationloyalty intention. For example, although the subjective well-being to destination-loyalty intention appears to have substantiation in the literature, this relationship is not necessarily straightforward and does not preclude the possibility that there may be a reverse relationship. Broadening this initial line of inquiry in further research on the relationship between subjective well-being and destination-loyalty intention may be translated in the long-term into areas for intervention, allowing efforts to be directed toward creating education destination climates that encourage the development and nurturance of broad expressions of international students' destinationloyalty intention across various contexts.</p><p>We also acknowledge that the data collection, which was limited to only international students in one Norwegian university, may suffer from a single-source bias and generalization of our findings to other countries due to their different national cultures. Further study can also include samples such as culturally similar and dissimilar countries, or perhaps specifically focus on less-developed countries that have not recently experienced rapid social changes to ascertain the validity of the current findings.</p><p>Besides, the presented study is correlational in nature. As a potential direction for future research, we proposed that longitudinal studies should be done to help provide clearer evidence of causal relations between personal values-subjective well-being-destination-loyalty intentions.</p><p>It is also suggested here that further work on the predictors of destination-loyalty intention is necessary. By extending the proposed model to include other constructs in the relationship between subjective well-being and destination-loyalty intention, i.e., predictors such as personality (Van Oudenhoven and Van der Zee 2002) and stress resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">(Grant and Kinman 2012)</ref>, further examination can be carried out.</p><p>We conclude that universalism values-subjective wellbeing and personal well-being-destination-loyalty intention in the short term might also in the long run prove to be a good strategy. Our study shows that the happiest countries in the world appear to be those in which universalism values are positively related to happiness and subsequently their destination-loyalty intention. Norway is arguably suited to be considered a model of these.</p><p>We argue that the current study provides some insights into the potential for personal values and subjective well-being in influencing destination-loyalty intention in international education experiences. We also believe that our approach could be developed further to offer new insights into research on destination-loyalty intention beyond seeing only personal values (benevolence, self-direction, universalism, stimulation and achievement) and subjective well-being as predictors. Although the relationship between universalism-subjective well-being-destination-loyalty intention represents an important contribution to the understanding of international student loyalty intention, much more research is needed in order to explain relational exchanges in this context, given the present competitive context in which they are now immersed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure2shows the overview of the research processes conducted for this thesis.

Findings from previous studies that focus on destination motivation (pull and push), orientation to mainstream culture, orientation to heritage culture, sociocultural adaptation, psychological adaptation (life satisfaction)well-being, perceived discrimination and destination-loyalty intention.2. Theories and concepts adopted by previous studies when examining destination-loyalty intention.Based on that information, all the research questions, research model and research hypotheses are formulated. All three papers use an on-line survey technique in data collection process. From the individual's data received, the research hypotheses and research questions are tested and answered. For this study, the research instrument is developed using measurement scales identified from previous studies. The research instrument's validity was accessed using a pilot study. The actual data collection starts after fulfilment (in terms of face validity) of the research instrument is accomplished. The data were analysed using hierarchical multiple regression analyses and a structural equation modelling (SEM): AMOS technique.

The present thesis purports that there is a need for more epidemiological investigations of personal values and subjective well-being, especially in international education area where there is a paucity of research. Moreover, due to the nature of the sample used in the quantitative study, not every group of personal values was included in the study. Future lines of research might include a quantitative analysis of the influence of other personal values groups on destination-loyalty intention.Moreover, personal values are strongly related to cultural values<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Campos Sánchez, 2014)</ref>. Possibly, the findings and results of this research may differ from one education destination to another. A cross-cultural study about the influence of personal values on well-being across education destination could make an interesting line of research in the near future.</figDesc></figure>

The two variables accounted for only 1.0% of the variation in destination-loyalty intention. Introducing destination motivation (push and pull) to the regression model explained an additional 8.5% of the variation in destination-loyalty intention, and this change in R² was significant, F (4, 190) = 4.44, p &lt; .01. Finally, adding orientation to mainstream and orientation to heritage culture, psychological adaptation and sociocultural adaptation in stage three, explained a total of 16.5% of the variation in destination-loyalty intention; this change in R² was also significant, F (8,186) = 7.78, p &lt; .001. To summarize, for short-term students, results showed that hypotheses 2a, 4a and 6a, namely destination motivation (pull) (b = 0.16, p &lt; .05), orientation to mainstream culture (b = 0.43, p &lt; .001) and psychological adaptation (b = 0.16, p &lt; .05), contributed more to the explained variance in destination-loyalty intention than orientation to heritage culture (Hypothesis 3a) (b = -0.24, p &lt; .01). For long-term students, results also showed that hypotheses 2b, 4b and 5b, namely destination motivation (pull) (b = 0.26, p &lt; .001), orientation to mainstream culture (b = 0.25, p &lt; .01), and sociocultural adaptation (b = 0.22, p &lt; .01), made a greater contribution to the explained variance than orientation to heritage culture (Hypothesis 5b) (b = 0.15, p &lt; .05) in influencing destination-loyalty intention. However, between the two groups, only destination motivation (pull) shows a stronger relationship with destinationloyalty intention for long-term students as compared to short-term students.</figDesc></figure>

Acculturation is a multifaceted process of change occurring when at least two cultures come into continuous contact with each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">(Berry &amp; Sam, 2003)</ref>. Although acculturation models focus on orientations to one's heritage culture and the culture of the society of settlement, these two dimensions are seen as independent of each other <ref type="bibr">(Berry, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ryder, Alden, &amp; Paulhus, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Contact and social ties with the host nation's residents have been shown to facilitate and enhance international students' experience and adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b240">(Campbell, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b252">Furnham &amp; Bochner, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jamaludin et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b286">Shigaki &amp; Smith, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b291">Stone, 2000)</ref>.
