<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Chromium (Cr) is a signi cant pollutant in the e uents from leather industries as well as in domestic city sewage. Cr was determined in water, sediment and different tissues (gill, muscle, intestine, liver, and kidney)  of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus harvested from wastewater-fed aquaculture (WFA) ponds situated at Bamonghata, Bantala, Chowbaga and Chingrighata of East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW), a Ramsar site in West Bengal, India. The results showed that Cr concentration in surface water ranged between 0.05 to 0.15 mg/L, while Cr was detected at high concentration (100 -300 mg/kg) in the sediment soil of the rst three WFAs and in moderate concentration (50 -110 mg/kg) in Chingrighata WFA. Average Cr concentrations in the tissues were ranked in the following sequence: kidney&gt;liver&gt;intestine&gt;gill&gt;muscle. However, the extent of accumulation of Cr in different tissues varied between the WFAs. We used Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to determine the route of Cr transfer. The tness of the model was evaluated by the performance measures. Cr accumulation pathways varied between the sites depending upon the level of Cr in water or sediment. Except for Bamonghata WFA, sediment was found as the principal source of accumulation of Cr in different tissues of O. niloticus. Cr re uxed from sediment into overlying water and accumulated in sh either through the food chain or through direct accumulation from water. In Bamonghata WFA, the role of sediment in the transfer of Cr could not be established due to the high depth of water or biological non-availability of Cr in the sediment. It is concluded from this study that sh reared in the WFAs of EKW are still not hazardous in respect of Cr, but require proper management to avoid the in ux of Cr-containing e uents into the WFAs.</p></div>

After entering into an aquatic ecosystem, heavy metals are quickly precipitated over sediment <ref type="bibr">(Ghosh et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">2018)</ref>, rendering the sediment a sink of heavy metals. In recent years, high concentrations of heavy metals have been detected in the sediment of rivers, lakes, ponds, and many other freshwater bodies in India (Antizar-Ladislao et al., 2015; Mandal et al., 2018; Mayanglambam and Neelam, 2020; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Goyal et al., 2022)</ref> indicating increasing anthropogenic uxes of heavy metals into these water bodies. Although heavy metals are quickly precipitated over sediment, there exists a dynamic interaction of heavy metals between the sediment and the overlying water. Heavy metals are accumulated in the body of aquatic organisms, either through direct accumulation from water, interstitial water of sediment soil, or through the food chain depending on the microhabitat occupied by the species as well as on the dynamic interaction of heavy metals between sediment and water <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dhamodharan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yujun et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ghosh et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">2021)</ref>. The heavy metals are persistent, do not degrade over time, and thus become dangerous to aquatic organisms when their quantities in the body of the organisms exceed permissible limits <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Renu et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sahajahan et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Little is known about the dynamics of heavy metals deposition between sediment and water and their subsequent transfer to sh and other aquatic ecosystems in East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW), a 12000 ha area of mostly sewage-fed wetlands located in the eastern edge of the metropolitan city Kolkata.</p><p>EKW was declared a Ramsar site (No. 1208) in August 2002. The untreated wastewater containing city sewage of Kolkata and e uents of an innumerable number of tanneries and other industries feed into EKW systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chatterjee et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adhikari et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mondal et al., 2022)</ref>. A signi cant part of EKW, comprising about 4000 ha, is used as the world's largest wastewater-fed aquaculture (WFA), in which wastewater is puri ed through dilution and sedimentation, and the sh is grown at the expense of dissolved nutrients contained in the wastewater. The EKW is an important freshwater sheries resource.</p><p>The WFAs of EKW produce more than 10,915 metric tons of sh annually, which are most popular among sh consumers and are thus sold fresh in huge quantities to Kolkata and greater Kolkata sh markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bunting et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kumar et al., 2023)</ref>. In recent years the anthropogenic ux of pollutants to WFAs in EKW has tremendously increased due to the expansion of Kolkata city, resulting in increased city sewage load as well as an increase in industrial activities within EKW. Therefore, it is urgent to reveal the possible rate of transfer of heavy metals from water and sediment of these WFAs to sh reared in them. Once in the aquatic environment, heavy metals are accumulated in different aquatic organisms, transferred to higher trophic levels through the food chain, and potentially can perturb ecosystem functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Colla et al., 2021)</ref>. Fish cannot escape the harmful effects of pollutants entering into aquatic environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Yarsan et al., 2013)</ref>, and thus serves as a useful bio-monitoring agent of heavy metal pollution in the aquatic ecosystem <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Rashed, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Osman, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Akila et al., 2022)</ref>. Some heavy metals tend to biomagnify through the food chain in aquatic ecosystems (Nally et al., 2023), and sh residing on the top of the food chain serves as a useful bio-monitoring agent to evaluate patterns of heavy metal transfer in the aquatic ecosystem <ref type="bibr">(Kumar et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Akila et al., 2022)</ref>. Moreover, the concentrations of heavy metals in sh bodies provide a clue to possible health hazards of the human consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ali et al., 2022)</ref>. Once the heavy metals enter into the body of sh, either through direct uptake from water or through the food chain, they are distributed across various tissues for storage and removal <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Alam et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Canbek et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ahmed et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Islam et al., 2015)</ref>. Plenty of reports are available on the pattern of bioaccumulation of heavy metals in gills, liver, kidney, gut, and muscle tissues as well as in the whole body of sh <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kucuksezgin et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lewis et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ghosh et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">2021)</ref>. The concentrations of heavy metals in gills represent the concentrations of heavy metals in water, whereas the concentrations in the liver re ect the storage of heavy metals <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Yılmaz, 2003)</ref>. It has been reported that the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in the muscle does not take place actively <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Romeo et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Sunlu et al., 2001)</ref>. But muscle is the principal part of a sh that human consumes, and therefore, the concentration of heavy metals in muscle highlights possible human health hazards arising from the consumption of such sh.</p><p>This study deals with the accumulation of Cr in the sh, Oreochromis niloticus reared in some selected WFAs of the EKW situated close to a leather tannery complex. Tanneries are one of the principal sources of Cr contamination of the aquatic ecosystem in India <ref type="bibr">(Chattopadhyay et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fahim et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chowdhury et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kokkinos and Zouboulis, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Rahman et al., 2022)</ref>. The leather tannery industry produces several kinds of waste, including trimmings from chrome-tanned leather, chromium sludge, and shavings from chrome-tanned leather, which principally contains Cr. High concentration of Cr has been reported from different species of sh harvested from EKW <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dutta et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kumar et al., 2023)</ref>.

Cr also invades mitochondria and the nucleus, resulting in DNA damage and altering cellular regulations at these sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Venter et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the pattern of deposition of Cr in water and sediment in four WFAs of EKW and the mode of transfer of the metal to different tissues, such as gills, liver, intestine, kidney, and muscle, in the freshwater sh, Oreochromis niloticus reared in these WFAs. We attempted to identify the variables responsible for transferring Cr from water and/or sediment to sh. We applied structural equation modeling (SEM) for this purpose.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Material and method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Study area</head><p>The study was conducted in four WFAs of the EKW from August 2021 to July 2022. The locations of the WFAs are Bamonghata Nalbon 2No. Bheri (BN2B), Bantala 2No. Bheri (BT2B), Chowbaga Naskar Bheri (CWNB,) and Chingrighata Natur Bheri (CHNB) situated respectively 5, 10, 14, and 20 km away from a modern tannery complex in EKW (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). While, BN2B WFAs is fed by sewage canals contaminated by tannery e uents, BT2B, CWNB, and CHNB WFAs are fed by tannery e uents and city sewage of Kolkata. The position of sampling sites has been recorded using the global positioning satellite system (GPS) using ArcGIS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Sampling and analytical procedure</head><p>Samples of water, sediment soil, and sh were collected every month from each of the WFA. Water samples were collected at random from different spots of each WFA. The samples were taken from 0.5 m below the surface of the water using plastic bottles that had been acid-washed and disinfected with distilled water. After collection, the water samples were ltered using membrane lters, acidi ed with HNO 3, and put in an ice box before being carried to the laboratory and kept in the refrigerator before analysis for Cr.</p><p>Sediment samples were also collected randomly from different spots of each WFA using a Peterson grab sampler. The collected sediment samples were transported to the laboratory in sealed plastic containers. All the samples were dried at 65°C for 24 hours before being put through a mesh screen to separate large particles. After being sieved, the samples were further heated to dryness, cooled and packed in a polythene packet, and preserved at -20ºC in the laboratory.</p><p>Fish samples were collected from each WFA with the help of the local shermen and were immediately brought to the laboratory in ice boxes. The sampled sh were put into plastic bags and were stored frozen at -20°C. Before analysis for Cr, the sh samples were defrosted for two hours and rinsed with deionized water. Thawed sh samples were dissected with clean acid-soaked scissors, and the gills, muscle, intestine, liver, and kidney tissues were taken out and dried at 60°C for 24 hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Extraction of chromium Water sample</head><p>Water samples were warmed to room temperature prior to Cr measurement. The sample was mixed well, and 50 mL aliquot of the sample was obtained in a ask.5 mL concentrated HNO 3 was added to the aliquot, and the ask was gradually heated in a water bath (temperature 98 ± 2°C). The heating was continued until the solution became transparent and was reduced to 10 mL. Later, the solution was cooled, ltered under low pressure, diluted with deionized distilled water, and kept in acid-washed glass bottles. Blanks were prepared from deionized distilled water and carried through all the above procedures (APHA, 2017).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sediment sample</head><p>The sediment samples were extracted following EPA protocol (US EPA 1996). The samples were air dried in a hot air oven at 60°C for 24 h, powdered using mortar and pestle, and sieved through a 63 µm sieve. The sieved sample was powdered, passed through a 500 µm sieve, and stored in deionized water-rinsed and acid-washed glass bottles. One gram of homogenized sediment soil samples was taken in a Te on vial containing 1 mL aqua regia (HNO 3 and HCl in a ratio of 1:3) and 6 mL hydrogen uoride. The te on vessel was kept in a 95°C hot water bath for 2.5 hours. Then the digested samples were taken in a 50 mL volumetric ask, and the volume was adjusted with distilled water. The extracted samples were ltered and centrifuged at 3000 rpm, and the supernatant was taken to determine the total Cr in the Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS). All the chemicals used were of analytical grade. The reagent blanks were included in each analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fish organ Sample</head><p>glass stirring rod, ensuring the acid wetted it. The samples were heated in an oven at around 110ºC.When the sample was dry, it was heated with a soft ame.</p><p>The sample containing the dish was then transferred to a furnace set at 250ºC.The temperature was slowly raised to 500 ºC. It was ashed at this temperature for about 6 to 8 hours. The dish was removed and cooled. If ash contains carbon particles, it was washed down the sides of the dish with water and 2 mL of concentrated HNO 3 . It was then dried on a hot plate, returned to the furnace at 500ºC and further ashed for 30 minutes. The process was repeated with HNO 3 treatment using 1 ml increments of HNO 3 until white-red ash was obtained. When clean ash was obtained, the dish was removed from the furnace, cooled and 1ml HNO 3 and 10 ml of water were added. It was heated on a hot plate till the sample ash was dissolved. The digested sample was quantitatively transferred from the dish to a 50 ml volumetric ask, heated with 10 ml of HCl, and transferred to another volumetric ask to adjust the volume with deionized distilled water (Anonymous, 2016).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical instrumentation</head><p>Agilent 240 FS (air-acetylene ame) Atomic Absorption Spectrometer was used for the detection of Cr in the digested samples of water, sediment, and sh tissues. Cr was measured at wavelength 228.8 nm. Absorbances were calibrated with Johnson-Matthey standard solutions. The precision and accuracy of determination was checked by repeated analyzes of the sub-samples of the standards and by recovery of spiked metals from the test samples <ref type="bibr">(Wachasunder and Nafde, 2001</ref>). Adopted analytical procedures yielded 94 to 97% recovery of the spiked metals from the samples tested. The minimum concentration of Cr that could be determined was 0.01 mg/l.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Statistical analyses and modelling</head><p>The main statistical analysis was performed by structural equation modeling (SEM). SEM is based on three main pillars: (1) path analysis; (2) the synthesis of latent variables and measurement models; and (3) methods to estimate the parameters of structural models. To evaluate potential causal pathways of accumulation of Cr in sh, we performed SEM as the method provides a statistical framework to explain the functioning of a whole system by minimizing the difference between the model predictions and observed data. We hypothesized that the Cr accumulation in different organs might be affected by the presence of Cr in sediment, water, or both <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Dutta et al., 2022)</ref>. The performance measures are used to validate how much an SEM ts the real data. In this study, the following performance measure were used, which were built in the AMOS program: C min /DF, incremental t (IFI), Tucker-Lewis coe cient(TLI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI),Root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and Akaik's information criterion (AIC). The computational value of these measures'ranges from 0 to 1 where values closer to 1 indicate the model with a high goodness of t <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Collins et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fanet al., 2016)</ref>. The speci c ranges of above performance measures indicating a good t of the model are: C min /DF ≤ 3,0.9 ≤ IFI ≤ 1,0.9 ≤ TLI ≤ 1.00,0.9 ≤ CFI ≤ 1.00, 0 ≤ RMSEA ≤ 0.1, and 0 ≤ AIC ≤ 0.1, respectively. The lower the AIC value, the better. More speci cally, the t model is either considered good (CFI and TLI ≥ 0.9), regular (CFI and TLI between 0.8 and 0.9), or weak (CFI and TLI ≤ 0.8), respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Steiger, 2007</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Chromium in water and sediment</head><p>Variation of the mean concentration of Cr in the surface water and sediment of four WFAs, during the study period, has been presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The results reveal that Cr concentration in surface water ranged between 0.05 to 0.15 mg/L. Although there was the wide uctuation in the concentration of Cr in water between the sampling months in all the WFAs, the BT2B WFA exhibited the maximum value of Cr in water, and CWNB WFA exhibited the least amount of Cr in water in most of the sampling months.</p><p>A high concentration of Cr was detected in the sediment of all four WFAs indicating that Cr had been deposited over the sediment of these WFAs for long periods. Relatively less amount of Cr (average 50 to 110 mg/kg) was detected from the sediment of CWNB WFA, while three other WFAs exhibited high concentrations of Cr (average 100 to 300 mg/kg), particularly during monsoon (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Chromium in sh tissues</head><p>Cr bioaccumulation pattern in gill, liver, kidney, intestine, and muscle of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus sampled from four WFAs have been presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.Taking values of all WFAs together, the kidney exhibited the maximum average concentration of Cr, while muscle exhibited the least average concentration of Cr. Average Cr concentrations in the tissues were ranked in the following sequence: kidney &gt; liver &gt; intestine &gt; gill &gt; muscle. However, the extent of accumulation of Cr in different tissues varied between the WFAs. Except in two sampling months, Cr concentration in gills and muscle was maximum in BT2B. Cr concentration in the intestine was also maximum in BT2B during the rst six months of sampling, followed by a maximum concentration during the next six months in CWNB, both BT2B and CWNB showing similar values during the 9th sampling month. Cr concentration in the kidney was maximum in BN2B during the rst six months of sampling, followed by maximum concentration in CWNB. The concentration of Cr in the liver varied between sites and sampling periods, CWNB, BT2B, BN2B, and CHNB showing maximum concentration during 5th, 3rd, 3rd and 1st sampling months, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Correlation of Cr accumulation</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> exhibits a correlation of Cr concentration between the environment (water/sediment) and the tissues (gill / muscle / kidney / liver / intestine) as well as between different compartments of the environment and between different tissues. The red indicates a weak correlation, while yellow indicates a strong correlation, green, blue and other colours show moderate correlations in between. There was a strong correlation of Cr concentration between the gill and kidney and liver and muscle, followed by a high correlation of Cr in the intestine with that in muscle, kidney, and liver in WFA of BN2B. In BT2B,a positive correlation of Cr in gill and muscle with Cr in water indicates a direct accumulation of Cr from water. In CWNB, a strong positive correlation exists between Cr in the intestine and liver and between Cr in gill and liver. In CHNB, Cr in gill and intestine shows a strong correlation, followed by a moderate correlation between Cr in the intestine and muscle and Cr in the intestine with sediment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Structural equation modelling (SEM)</head><p>We attempted to identify the mode of transfer of Cr to different tissues of the sh separately for each WFA. For this purpose, we applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to explain the transfer of Cr from the environment (water/sediment) to these tissues via different routes. We used four models to determine the cumulative difference (CD), incremental t (IFI), comparative t index (CFI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and Akaik's information criterion (AIC) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). RMSEA value of &lt; 0.05 indicates a "close t," and that &lt; 0.08 suggests reasonable model-data, while TLI &gt; 0.9 indicates a relatively good model-data t in general. The results revealed that no single model could be applied to all the sites indicating that transfer patterns varied between the WFAs. Therefore, we present four models of transfer for four WFAs separately. A structural equation model has been performed, which contains two parts: (i) the measurement model followed by (ii) the structural model. SEM was performed using the AMOS software <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Arbuckle, 2011)</ref>. We present the best-tted model in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and the corresponding performance measures in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, which clearly indicates that a particular model optimally ts a particular WFA and might not be optimal for the other WFAs. Since we consider four WFAs, the relative performance measures are also presented to validate the claim. Now for a best-tted model in a given WFA, CMIN/CD value is ≤ 3, and the CFI value is ≥ 0.95, indicating that the model presented is of excellent t for that WFA, but the same model is not t for other WFAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(West et al., 2012)</ref>. In the calculation of SEM coe cients, by using the maximum likelihood method, we have also presented the Measurement Error (RE) associated with each observed variable, which also justi es if the model is t. Results demonstrate that all models are best tted except for the model for BN2B (CFI &lt; 0.95).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The average Cr concentration in water of BN2B, BT2B,and CWNB WFAs (0.10 to 0.15 mg/L) is about two times higher than the guideline value of WHO for total Cr (0.05 mg/L) in drinking water (WHO 2020). In CHNB WFA, the average Cr concentration in water is close to WHO guideline value. A very high concentration of Cr was detected from the sediment of the WFAs. Mean Cr concentration in the sediment of BN2B, BT2B, CWNB and CHNB WFAs were found 245, 200, 265 and 79 mg/kg, respectively. The concentration of metals in water is always lower than its concentration in sediments in a polluted water body as suspended sediment particles adsorb metals from water <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Yi et al., 2011)</ref> and are quickly precipitated over sediment <ref type="bibr">(Ghosh et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">2018)</ref>. Soil sediments of the freshwater bodies are, therefore, the major sink of metals, holding more than 99% of the total amount of metals in the aquatic systems <ref type="bibr">(Doong et</ref>  Results of the present study indicate that O. niloticus reared in the WFAs of the EKW accumulate maximum Cr in Kidney followed by liver, intestine, gill, and muscle. The concentration of metals in the gill re ects the level of the metals in the waters where the sh live, whereas the concentration in the liver and kidney represents a storage of metals <ref type="bibr">(Yalmaz, 2003)</ref>.The kidney and liver are metabolically active and thus represent the target organs for the elimination or storage of heavy metals <ref type="bibr">(Yilmaz, 2003)</ref>. Although the muscle of most sh species accumulates a minimum concentration of heavy metals <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Romeo et al.,1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Sunlu et al., 2001)</ref>, the pattern of bioaccumulation of heavy metals in different tissues of sh varies with species and trophic levels of the sh (Nalley et al., 2022). Rajeshkumar and Li, (2018) observed a maximum accumulation of Cr in liver and kidney and a minimum in the muscle of Pelteobagrus uvidraco harvested from Taihu lake, China, but Cyprinus carpio harvested from the same lake exhibited a maximum concentration of Cr in gill and minimum in the intestine. The bottom-dwelling sh Channa striata harvested from river Ganga near Kanpur in India exhibited a higher concentration of Cr in the liver, kidney, gill, and muscle as compared to the surface-dwelling sh Labeo rohita and Catla catla, gill showing maximum concentration irrespective of species <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kumar et al., 2020)</ref>. The concentration of Cr in muscles of these species was higher than that of the liver and higher or close to that of kidney. Besides the actual measures, the present study represents some advances in structural equation modeling of anthropogenic pressures and contamination in Cr. Path modeling assesses the interactions through a combination of multiple linear regression between Cr in water/ sediment and Cr in different tissues. The path models establish that the signi cant route of transfer of Cr from the environment to different tissues was mediated through the food chain, intestine showing a strong correlation with many tissues, followed by direct accumulation from water to gill and muscle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). While, sediment was the principal source of Cr for transfer to different tissues in WFAs of BT2B, CWNB and CHNB, SEM could not establish a link of transfer of Cr from sediment to different tissues in WFA of BN2B, probably due to a greater depth of water or biological non-availability of the sediment-bound Cr. The strong correlation of Cr concentration between gill and kidney also indicates direct accumulation of Cr from water as the major route of Cr accumulation in different sh tissues in this WFA. In BT2B, transfer of Cr from sediment to different tissues was mediated principally through the water. Cr was transferred from sediment to water and from water to the intestine, liver, and kidney. Cr was also transferred from the gill to the intestine. But this model does not establish the principal route of Cr accumulation in gill and muscle. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows a positive correlation of these two tissues with Cr in water, indicating direct accumulation of Cr from water. In CHNB Cr was transferred to different tissues from sediment either directly from sediment or through water, indicating a strong re ux of Cr from sediment into the water, and the intestine being a principal source of Cr, the transfer of the metal was probably mediated through the food chain. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> exhibits a strong positive correlation between Cr in the intestine and liver and between Cr in gill and liver. In CHNB, sediment and water play an equal role in transferring Cr to Kidney, liver, and muscle through the gill or intestine, indicating the importance of direct transfer from water and the food chain. The depth of water of the WFAs appears to play a crucial role in the transfer of Cr from the environment to sh. Lowe the depth, the greater the possibility of Cr transfer from sediment to sh.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>It is concluded from this study that the wastewater fed aquaculture (WFA) units of EKW receive a huge ux of Cr from anthropogenic sources. The WFAs fed by e uents from tannery industries such as Bamonghata Nalbon 2No. Bheri (BN2B), Bantala 2No. Bheri (BT2B), Chowbaga Naskar Bheri (CWNB,) are more polluted with Cr than the Chingrighata Natur Bheri (CHNB), which is close to Kolkata city and fed by Kolkata city sewage. The average Cr concentration in water of the rst three WFAs was two times higher than the WHO guideline values of Cr in drinking water (0.05 mg/L), while it was close to WHO guideline value in CHNB. Sediments of these WFAs exhibit a high concentration of Cr (72 to 290 mg/kg), indicating a regular in ux of Cr into these WFAs. Since sh grown in these WFAs are very popular and sold in huge quantities in Kolkata, and greater Kolkata sh markets, the sh grown in these WFAs pose a threat of health hazards to human consumers. However, the muscle of the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus grown in these WFAs exhibit minimum accumulation of Cr, and based on the permissible daily intake of Cr by adult humans, Nile tilapia grown in these WFAs are still safe to consume, but strict management is required to stop the entry of Cr containing e uents into these WFAs. SEM is a useful tool to evaluate Cr is accumulated in different tissues of O. niloticus from water and sediment. SEM demonstrates that sediment is the principal source of Cr in BT2B, CWNB, and CHNB WFAs, and Cr was accumulated from sediment to   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figures</head><label></label><figDesc>Figures</figDesc></figure>

Nile tilapia is an omnivorous sh, and the average concentration of Cr detected in the muscle of this sh reared in the most polluted WFAs (BN2B, BT2B, and CWNB) are close to that of the omnivorous sh G. brasiliensis harvested from the polluted stretch of the Brazilian river. Kumar et al. (2023) detected 0.63 to 2.48 mg/kg average Cr concentration in the muscle of Labeo rohita harvested from thirteen EKW ponds. This is close to Cr concentration (0.41 to 1.95 µg/g) detected in the muscle of O. niloticus harvested from CHNB WFA in the present study. Dutta et al. (2022) detected Cr in the range of 0.78 to 4.78 ppm (equivalent to mg/kg) in the whole body of O. niloticus sampled from some WFAs of EKW. These authors also observed a gradual increase in Cr levels in sh from 2016 to 2018. Daily permissible intake of Cr ranges from 20-30 µg for adult humans (NIH, 2021). Muscle tissue is mostly the only edible part of sh in the human diet, and depending upon species, muscle constitutes about 35% - 65% of the total weight of a sh. Based on the average concentration of Cr in muscle in sh O. niloticus harvested from BN2B, BT2B, CWNB, and CHNB (2.5, 3.0,1.9, and 1.4 µg/g, respectively) and daily sh consumption pattern of man in and around Kolkata, it is revealed that average daily consumption of this sh is still safe.</figDesc><table /><note><p>While a portion of heavy metals deposited over organically enriched sediment is bound as insoluble organic-metal insoluble complexes (Kabata-Pendias and Mukherjee, 2007), a signi cant portion of the metals is released from sediment into overlying water enriching bottom water with metals (Jia et al., 2021). As a result, there remains a wide difference between metal concentration in surface water and bottom water. Pelagic sh inhabiting a deep water body thus accumulates metals mostly from surface water. While several physicochemical parameters of water in uence the re ux of metals from sediment to overlying bottom water (Xie et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2019; Jaiswal and Pandey, 2020), the metals are unlikely to transfer from bottom to surface water in a deep water body.</p></note></figure>
