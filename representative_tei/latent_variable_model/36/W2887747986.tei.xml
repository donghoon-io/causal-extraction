<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We investigated the development of specific mili tary skills in Norwegian cadets during the threeyear mili tary academy training as well as the impact of perfectionism and selfefficacy on the development of these skills. Latent growthcurve models were performed with perfectionism as a timeinvariant predictor and with selfefficacy as a timevarying predictor. There were significant increases in the Individual Coping Capacity (ICC) and Cooperation in Difficult Situations (CDS) subscales but not in the Motiva tion to Achievement (MA) subscale. The initial skill levels were not related to the growth of the skills. Both adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism predicted initial values of ICC and CDS, explaining 5% of the variance in the initial ICC levels and 12% of the variance in the initial CDS levels. Perfectionism variables did not explain the development of the three types of military skills over time. Moreover, self efficacy significantly predicted ICC at all time points and CDS and MA at all time points except at T3. We therefore concluded that cadets with high adaptive perfectionism scores are likely to have higher initial skill levels and that selfefficacious cadets are expected to show a greater devel opment of military skills during military academy training.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Identifying the personal determinants of performance and success as officers is a key challenge for the armed forces <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Sellman et al. 2010)</ref> and is crucial in order to optimize recruitment and the overall outcome of military training programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Fosse et al. 2015)</ref>. For many years, the major focus in military psychological research has been the study of stressors and their impact on stress reactions and impaired performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Moldjord et al. 2015)</ref>, but some studies have also found that soldiers may increase their performance as a result of experienced stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Driskell et al. 2006)</ref>. It has been documented that as a coping strat egy, social support has had a positive impact on military performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hall 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Limbert 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Milgram et al. 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Moldjord et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Overdale and Gardner 2012)</ref>. The Big Five personality factors and hardiness are also factors that have been shown to predict leader perfor mance in the military (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Bartone et al. 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Studies have further indicated that the relationship between personality factors and performance may be mediated by selfefficacy beliefs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Fosse et al. (2015)</ref> found that selfefficacy was a partial mediator for the relation ship between the Big Five conscientiousness domain and military performance. Personality traits and self efficacy have both been found to affect performance but are assumed to operate on different levels. Personality traits are regarded as describing the inherent character of a person <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(McCrae and Costa 1999)</ref>, whereas selfefficacy describes how the person regulates his or her behavior when interacting with the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bandura 1997)</ref>. Selfefficacy is assumed to develop through perceived ability, feedback, and reflection, which then regulate behavior accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bandura 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bandura , 1997))</ref>; selfefficacy may hence mediate and allow inherent personality traits to be expressed in specific behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Fosse et al. 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Specific military skills and the development of military skills</head><p>The ideal conduct of military duties requires abilities such as being able to handle stress and bearing with uncertainty in different situations. The primary focus of military training is the building of confidence and high standards of military performance to endow the soldiers with the ability to cope with combat contexts and com plete their missions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Driskell et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Krueger 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In preparations for specific deployments, military per sonnel are trained in the skills needed to cope with that particular mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Delahaij et al. 2006)</ref>. Specific military skills are thus closely related to operational and combat tasks, which often demand coping with stress and deci sionmaking skills under pressure, and specific military skills have thus been suggested to be the core elements of operational conduct <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Johansen et al. 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Solberg (2007)</ref> developed an instrument to measure specific military skills intended to measure the skills and abilities required under operational and combat circum stances. The instrument measures specific military skills by way of selfreport and is more accurately a measure of perceived specific military skills. The instrument comprises three subscales: Individual Coping Capacity (ICC), Coop eration in Difficult Situations (CDS), and Motivation to Achievement (MA). These factors are all regarded as impor tant skills in military operations. The enhancement of mil itary performance and skills can be achieved by improving either selection procedures so that individuals who possess the desirable attributes and traits are selected for military training or the training of desirable skills and qualities.</p><p>Although research on military performance has expanded during the past few years, less research has been carried out on the specific military skills needed to obtain successful performance and especially what enhances the development of these military skills. A study on specific military skills found that operational identity predicted 6% of the variance in these specific military skills, whereas personality traits explained as much as 42% of the variance in specific military skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Johansen et al. 2014)</ref>. Emotional stability, intellect/openness, and hardiness were found to be significant individual pre dictors of specific military skills. Intellect/openness was the strongest predictor of specific military skills, and it has been suggested that this reflects the importance of the ability to use creative and perhaps unorthodox approaches in ambiguous conditions with a high degree of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Johansen et al. 2014)</ref>. Since intellect/ openness implies intellectual curiosity, openness to new ideas and a willingness to try new approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Costa and McCrae 1992)</ref>, openness has been suggested to facilitate learning and adaptability, which are valuable qualities in military training <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Johansen et al. 2014)</ref>. Emotional sta bility may also contribute to the development of specific military skills because these skills are closely related to coping with stress and handling decisionmaking under stressful situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Johansen et al. 2014</ref>). In addition to predict specific military skills, hardiness has also been found to be related to leadership skills and leadership performance in both theoretical and practical military contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bartone et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Eid and Morgan 2006)</ref>. Because most studies in this field have been crosssec tional, longitudinal studies are warranted in order to make assumptions about the development of specific military skills.</p><p>Knowledge about factors affecting the training and development of military skills is of paramount importance for the armed forces in order to optimize the training in the military academies and subsequently enhance oper ational readiness. Several studies have identified both personality traits and selfefficacy beliefs as predictors of academic and work performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Barrick and Mount 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Judge et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Poropat 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Salgado 1998)</ref>, and there are reasons to believe that these factors will also affect the development of military skills.</p><p>Realistic practical training, as well as exposure, has been shown to have a significant impact on cadets' skills and ability to cope with interrogation in a simulated pris onerofwar exercise, in which those who participated in the practical training showed significantly better results compared to those with only theoretical preparations <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Laberg et al. 2000)</ref>. The positive effect of pretraining was explained by two mechanisms: the development of effective schemas (i.e., mental representations) for the sit uation and higher selfefficacy expectations that assisted them in coping. Selfefficacy beliefs have been suggested to play an important role in the actual coping ability in extreme situations in which expectations of success are highly related to the outcome in the specific situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bandura 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bandura , 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bandura , 2014))</ref>.</p><p>Previous researches on personality traits in relation to military selection have primarily focused on personality variables such as the Big Five and hardiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hystad et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Johansen et al. 2014)</ref>, although other personality traits/ variables may also have importance. One such factor could be adaptive perfectionism. Because adaptive perfectionism has been found to contribute to greater achievement and motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Accordino et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hamachek 1978</ref>), and to be associated with personal control, resourcefulness, selfesteem, and adaptive learning strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Flett et al. 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Flett et al. 1991a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Flett et al. , 1991b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Mills and Blankstein 2000)</ref>, we assumed that adaptive perfectionism may be relevant in relation to the development of military skills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Perfectionism</head><p>Perfectionism can be defined as "the striving for flaw lessness" <ref type="bibr">(Flett and Hewitt 2002, p. 5)</ref>. This trait can be viewed as adaptive in a military context, where preciseness is emphasized as extremely important (The Norwegian Defence University College 2014). In military training, in which drilling is important in order to make certain behaviors automatic and rapid <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Flin 1996)</ref>, one may expect a perfectionist to strive for more precision and to show greater endurance in the pursuit of perfec tion (e.g., to train more) and hence be able to perform the drilled exercise with greater precision and less flaws com pared to a nonperfectionist. Thus, perfectionism may be a particular adaptive trait within a military context. On the other hand, military skills often involve coping with stress and decisionmaking under high degrees of uncertainty in combat situations, so one may assume that perfection ism and striving for flawlessness could be maladaptive or counterproductive in such situations.</p><p>There has been little systematic study of perfectionism among military personnel. Among the general population, perfectionism has previously been viewed as a positive factor in adjustment or achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hamachek 1978)</ref> but has also been linked to negative outcomes such as guilt, shame, feelings of failure, indecisiveness, procrastination, and low selfesteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Flett et al. 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pacht 1984)</ref>. Most researchers in the field have now come to recognize that perfectionism is a multidimensional construct where the different dimensions have distinct prediction patterns, e.g., having positive or negative aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bieling et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Chang 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Enns et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">TerryShort et al. 1995)</ref>. Adaptive perfectionism is associated with (high) standards modified in accordance with the situation and matched to the person's limitations and strengths, striving for success, a sense of self that is independent of performance, the timely completion of tasks, and balanced thinking. These attributes are also considered to be important in a mili tary context. One type of adaptive perfectionism has been labeled as selforiented perfectionism, which is defined as unrealistic high standards and perfectionistic motivation for the self <ref type="bibr">(Hewitt and Flett 1991)</ref>. Self oriented perfec tionism has shown a strong correlation with personality traits such as achievement striving, dutifulness, and selfdiscipline <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hill et al. 1997</ref>). These factors are also considered to be important in military training. Adaptive perfectionism has further been identified as a likely ante cedent of effective coping, in which the individual's per fectionistic standards are assumed to lead to the effective regulation of one's behavior and hence more effective coping <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Gaudreau and Antl 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Socially prescribed perfectionism refers to the belief that significant others expect oneself to be perfect <ref type="bibr">(Hewitt and Flett 1991)</ref>, and this dimension of perfectionism is associated with excessive concerns over mistakes and has also been linked to maladjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Slaney et al. 2002)</ref>. Consequently, socially prescribed perfectionism is often denoted as maladaptive perfectionism. Higher levels of socially prescribed perfectionism is further asso ciated with more severe forms of psychopathology, and socially prescribed perfectionism incorporates percep tions of disturbed social relations, as well as elements of learned helplessness and amotivation <ref type="bibr">(Hewitt et al. 1991)</ref>. Maladaptive perfectionism is associated with inflexibly high standards, which are often beyond what is expected, such as fear of failure, a focus on avoiding errors, a sense of selfworth dependent on performance, and a black and white thinking pattern (perfection vs. failure) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Enns and Cox 2002)</ref>. These attributes may be assumed as less adap tive in a military context.</p><p>Based on what is presented earlier and because selforiented perfectionism is often associated with perse verance and effort and potentially with a consecutive per formance, such an endorsement might be adaptive from the point of developing military competence. If high levels of selforiented perfectionism are associated with striving for better quality on a training task and getting better at doing the task correctly without flaws, one may therefore assume adaptive perfectionism to have a positive impact on the development of specific military skills, whereas high levels of maladaptive perfectionism can be assumed to have a negative impact. However, for individuals charac terized by high levels of adaptive perfectionism, there may still be a cost to wellbeing in the striving for perfection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Self-efficacy</head><p>While perfectionism is viewed as a personality trait and is assumed to be relatively stable across time and situations, selfefficacy is a more situationspecific variable that has been shown to predict coping behavior when facing chal lenging situations and environmental demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bandura 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bandura , 1989;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Jerusalem 1990)</ref>. Selfefficacy refers to the beliefs an individual holds in his or her own capability to organize, function and exercise control over events that affect his or her life <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bandura 1997)</ref>. Selfefficacy has been found to play a key role in stress reactions and is related to the quality of coping in stressful and threatening situa tions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bandura 1988</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bandura , 1997;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Lazarus and Folkman 1984)</ref>. As military operations usually involve high degrees of stress and possibly threatening situations, the levels of self efficacy will probably affect how soldiers handle and cope with stress in military combat.</p><p>Social cognitive theory has identified selfefficacy as the most powerful selfregulatory mechanism in affect ing behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bandura 1997)</ref>, and several studies have demonstrated that taskspecific efficacy beliefs are crucial in the prediction of performance in a given situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Stajkovic and Luthans 1998)</ref>. Selfefficacy has repeat edly been shown to be related to task performance in a variety of settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Tannenbaum et al. 1991</ref>), e.g., lead ership selfefficacy has been shown to mediate leader effectiveness in military contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(McCormick 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Ng et al. 2008)</ref>. As personality research has highlighted the importance of motivational processes and selfefficacy is a central motivational construct in behavioral prediction, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Ng et al. (2008)</ref> proposed that leadership selfefficacy is a key motivational mechanism that links leaders' broad per sonality traits to leader effectiveness. Similarly, we may expect that military cadets' selfefficacy is a central moti vational mechanism in the training of specific military skills, linking personality traits such as perfectionism to military skill performance. Consequently, one may expect that both levels of selfefficacy and perfectionism will affect the development of military skills, e.g., cadets with greater levels of selfefficacy and adaptive perfectionism will show a greater improvement of military skills during military academy training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Aims and hypotheses</head><p>The aim of the present study was threefold. First, we wanted to explore the stability of specific military skills, i.e., how ICC, CDS, and MA develop during three years of training in a military academy. We hypothesized that three years of training in the academy will produce a positive increase in these skills over the threeyear period. Second, we wanted to investigate whether the initial levels of adaptive and mal adaptive perfectionism in cadets impact the development of military skills over time. We hypothesized that the cadets scoring high on adaptive perfectionism prior to training will show a greater positive development on military skills during the three years of training at the military academy.</p><p>Third, we wanted to investigate whether the cadets' levels of selfefficacy impact the levels of specific military skills. We hypothesized that levels of selfefficacy will predict levels of military skills over the three years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Sample and procedure</head><p>The data for this study were collected as part of the Norwe gian Military Academy Study, 2007-2011. Cadets attend ing the three different military academies in Norway (the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy, and the Army Academy) were selected on both physical and psycholog ical parameters, with the aim of the Norwegian Military Academy Study being to gain comprehensive knowledge about the cadet's development on a range of physiolog ical and psychological measures during their threeyear military academy education program. A total of 330 cadets from two different cohorts were asked to partici pate, and a total of 286 cadets (response rate of 86.7%) completed the selfreport questionnaire at baseline (T1) during the first week of school. The majority of the cadets were men (258 men vs. 28 women), ranging in age from 19 to 37 years (M = 23.2 years, SD = 2.92). The cadets were asked to respond to the questionnaire on three subse quent occasions during their threeyear education: at the end of the first year (T2), at the end of the second year (T3), and at the end of the third year (T4). At T2, 235 cadets had completed the questionnaire (17.8% dropout). At T3, 162 cadets completed the perfectionism measure (31.1% dropout from T2), and finally at T4, 159 cadets completed the perfectionism measure (1.9% dropout from T3).</p><p>The study was approved by the Norwegian Social Science Data Service, and participation in the study was voluntary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Measures</head><p>Specific military skills were measured by the selfreport instrument Military Skills and Ability (MSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Solberg 2007)</ref>, which comprises measures of the particular skills and abilities required under operational and combat cir cumstances. The instrument contains 20 statements rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good), in which respondents evaluate their handling of military challenges. The MSA comprises three subscales: ICC (e.g., "Keeping a cool head in stressful situations" or "My ability to handle stress and difficult situations"), CDS (e.g., "Willingness to act on command in emergency situations" or "My ability to motivate and inspire others in difficult situations"), and MA (e.g., "My motivation to participate in peacekeeping operations abroad"). The analyses were based on the scores on the subscales, and former studies have revealed a satisfactory internal consistency, with a Cronbach's alpha &gt;0.70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Laberg et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Moldjord et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Solberg 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Perfectionism</head><p>Adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism was measured using two dimensions/subscales of the Multidimen sional Perfectionism Scale (MPS; <ref type="bibr">Hewitt and Flett 1991)</ref>: self oriented perfectionism and socially prescribed per fectionism. Each subscale contained 15 items, in which respondents were asked to indicate to what extent they disagree/agree on a 7point Likert scale (1 -totally dis agree and 7 -totally agree). Examples of items from the self oriented subscale are "When I am working on some thing, I cannot relax until it is perfect" and "One of my goals is to be perfect in everything I do", while examples from the socially prescribed subscale include "I find it dif ficult to meet others' expectations of me" and "Anything that I do that is less than excellent will be seen as poor work by those around me".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Self-efficacy</head><p>In order to measure selfefficacy, a 5item selfefficacy scale specifically developed to measure selfefficacy in a military context was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Buch et al. 2015)</ref>. The use of general selfefficacy instruments was discouraged, with <ref type="bibr">Bandura (2012, p. 15)</ref> arguing and stating that "there is no single allpurpose measure of selfefficacy with a single validity coefficient" and general decontex tualized measures of selfefficacy usually bear a weak relationship to the domainrelated selfefficacy beliefs and to behavior and are consequently less predictive, respectively. Hence, this specific selfefficacy measure was developed to capture selfefficacy beliefs regarding the ability to successfully complete the military training education at the military academy. Items were designed to measure the perceived capability to manage process activities likely to be of importance, such as managing tough times, making it through one's studies and per forming well. Sample items included "will manage to complete the military training" and "will achieve a result I can be proud of". Respondents indicated how much they agree/disagree on a 7point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 7 (totally agree). Previous studies have reported a satisfactory internal consistency, with Cronbach's alphas ranging from 0.83 to 0.89 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Buch et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Fosse et al. 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Statistical analyses</head><p>Latent growthcurve models (LGCMs) within a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework (RabeHesketh and Skrondal 2012) were used to explore whether cadets' specific military skills develop during their time at the military academy. Separate LGCMs were estimated for the three skill dimensions of ICC, CDS, and MA. Our starting point in each analysis was a simple growth curve model that estimated latent intercept and latent slope growth factors. These are known as fixed effects, as they summarize the average initial level (intercept) and the overall growth trajectory (slope). To identify the intercept, all loadings from the latent variable to the observed skills variables were constrained to 1. The observed skill variables were also regressed on the latent slope variable, with loadings fixed to the time point t i (where i = 0, 1, 2, and 3).</p><p>LGCMs also estimate the variance of the fixed effects, known as random effects. These random effects summa rize the individual differences from the overall growth tra jectory and the average intercept. A significant variation around the fixed effects allows us to explore covariates that can help us explain the variation. In this study, we included selforiented perfectionism and socially prescribed perfec tionism as timeinvariant predictors of both the latent inter cept and slope. They are time invariant because we believe perfectionism to be a relatively stable characteristic that stays constant across time points. Conversely, selfefficacy was included as a timevarying predictor, thereby allowing selfefficacy to have a different effect at each time point.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> presents a diagram of our full LGCM. The LGCM analyses were performed using Stata 13 with the full information maximum likelihood estimator to be able to use all the available data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Arbuckle 1996)</ref>. Stata does not give a z-value for the variance components that can be used for sig nificance testing because of the boundary issue associated with the estimates (i.e., the variance cannot be less than zero) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Acock 2013</ref>). However, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed, which were just as informative, if not more so, as a conventional pvalue. CIs were used in lieu of pval ues in all text and tables that describe the LGCM analyses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Preliminary analyses</head><p>Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were conducted on all measures and time points to check for construct validity. Specific military skills were treated as correlated three factor models, perfectionism was treated as a twofactor model, and selfefficacy was treated as a onedimensional factor model. A summary of the results from these factor analyses is presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>For specific military skills, all indicators loaded onto their parent factor at Time 1 (mean l = 0.60, range: 0.32-0.91), Time 2 (mean l = 0.61, range: 0.31-0.94), Time 3 (mean l = 0.60, range: 0.35-0.92), and Time 4 (mean l = 0.62, range: 0.25-0.95), and all loadings were statistically significant. The fit indices shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> all point toward less than perfectly fitting models based on the usual recommenda tions of RMSEA ≤ 0.08 and CFI ≥ 0.90 <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kline 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">McDonald and Ho 2002)</ref>. The modification indices suggested that some improvements in model fit could be gained by removing some factor loadings or allowing for crossloadings. Never theless, we chose not to do any changes, because there was no consistent pattern to the suggested modifications across measurement occasions. The reliability coefficients (Cron bach's alpha) for ICC at the four measurement points were 0.83, 0.83, 0.83, and 0.84; for CDS, they were 0.67, 0.69, 0.71, and 0.75 and for MA, they were 0.78, 0.82, 0.78, and 0.76.</p><p>One item belonging to the socially prescribed perfectionism dimension did not have a statistically significant factor loading. After removing this item, the twofactor model revealed an acceptable fit judged by RMSEA = 0.079 and an average factor loading of l = 0.51 (range: 0.24-0.77). However, the comparative fit index (CFI) of 0.72 was less than optimal. The MPS is a wellestablished and much used instrument <ref type="bibr">(Appel ton et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Frost et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kilbert et al. 2005)</ref>, and for the sake of comparability to other studies, we decided not to do any further modifications. The Cron bach's alpha values were satisfactory, with a = 0.84 for the selforiented perfectionism subscale and a = 0.83 for the socially prescribed subscale.</p><p>Lastly, the CFAs with selfefficacy revealed that one item consistently performed poorly on all measurement occasions (i.e., item 4: "My willingness to obey orders in a threatening situation is …."). We therefore reran the anal yses with this item excluded. The average factor loading at Time 1 was l = 0.79 (range: 0.64-0.88), at Time 2 was l = 0.70 (range: 0.48-0.93), at Time 3 was l = 0.79 (range: 0.67-0.89), and at Time 4 was l = 0.74 (range: 0.60-0.87). The CFIs suggested wellfitting models at all time points, although the RMSEAs were less than optimal. The Cron bach's alphas for the fouritem measure in the present study were 0.87, 0.80, 0.87, and 0.82 at T0, T1, T2, and T3, respectively.</p><p>A oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare participants who contributed data on all Tab. 2: Unconditional growth models of specific military skills.

The results indicated no statistically significant difference between completers and dropouts on age (F[3, 291] = 0.30, p = 0.83). A Pearson's χ 2 test showed that a larger proportion of women (55%) than men (35%) were among the completers, χ 2 (1, N = 295) = 4.78, p = 0.03. It should also be noted that there were very few women altogether (n = 29).</p><p>The results from three oneway ANOVAs suggested that completers and dropouts differed on the initial ICC (F[3, 269] = 3.11, p = 0.03), CDS (F[3, 244] = 4.01, p = 0.01), and MA (F[3, 283] = 6.33, p &lt; 0.001). Post hoc pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni corrections showed that completers had a higher initial ICC status than those who only participated at T0 (mean difference: 1.92, 95% CI: 0.11-3.37) but not those who participated at two or three measurement points. Completers also had higher initial scores on CDS than both participants who missed two (mean difference: 1.29, 95% CI: 0.09-2.49) or three (mean difference: 1.71, 95% CI: 0.03-3.39) measurement points but not those who missed only one. Finally, the post hoc tests showed that completers scored higher on initial MA than the participants who missed one (mean difference: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.08-1.72), two (mean difference: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.26-1.72), and three measurement points (mean dif ference: 1.34, 95% CI: 0.25-2.42).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Growth trajectories</head><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> presents the results from the unconditional, simple growthcurve models for the three military skill dimensions. Except for MA, the latent slope growth factors were statistically significant in all instances. For ICC, the average growth trajectory of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.65-0.94) means that the expected increase in the ICC for each year is 0.80 points. The associated likelihood ratio of our model of χ 2 (5) = 6.735, p &gt; 0.05 suggests that this estimated linear trajectory describes our observed data well. The additional measures of fit for the unconditional growthcurve model are presented in the top row of Table <ref type="table">3</ref> (ICC model 1). Similarly, the expected increase in CDS each year was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.31-0.61). The associated model likelihood ratio was χ 2 (5) = 1.743, p &gt; 0.05 (see CDS model 1 in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> for additional measures of model fit).</p><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> also shows a statistically significant vari ance for the random intercepts and random slopes for all three military skill dimensions. The variances around the overall linear slopes are 0.49, 0.45, and 0.12 for ICC, CDS, and MA, respectively. To give this variation some context, consider that the s 2 = 0.45 around the slope of 0.46 for CDS equals a standard deviation of 0.67. An approximate 95% CI on the slope will therefore be 0.46 ± 2 × 0.67, an inter val of -0.88 to 1.8. some individuals are expected to have a negative slope, whereas others are expected to have a relatively steep positive slope.</p><p>The covariance between the intercept and slope was nonsignificant in all three simple growthcurve models, hence suggesting that initial levels of military skills are not related to the growth trajectories of the same military skills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Perfectionism as a time-invariant predictor</head><p>Given the significant variance in the latent intercepts and slopes, we included selforiented perfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism as predictors to attempt to explain some of the variations. Both variables were centered on their means to make the intercept a meaningful value (i.e., as the initial skill level for individuals with average levels of perfectionism). The likelihood ratios and measures of the model fit presented in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> (model 2) suggest a good fit to the data for all models. Both self oriented and socially pre scribed perfectionism significantly predicted the intercept for ICC and CDS but not for MA.</p><p>The estimates are presented in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> and show that a oneunit increase in selforiented perfectionism is associated with a 0.6 increase in the initial skill level for ICC, while a oneunit increase in socially prescribed perfectionism is associated with a 0.9 decrease. The esti mated initial skill level for individuals' average in perfec tionism was 25.5 (i.e., the intercept, which is not shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). This means that individuals with a selfori ented perfectionism score one standard deviation (i.e., 0.76) above the mean are estimated to have an initial skill level of 0.6 × 0.76 = 0.46 above this value, thus holding levels of socially prescribed perfectionism constant. Similarly, individuals with a socially prescribed perfec tionism score one standard deviation (i.e., 0.63) above the mean are estimated to have an initial skill level of 25.5 -0.9 × 0.63 = 24.93, holding selforiented perfection ism constant. As a result, neither selforiented perfec tionism nor socially prescribed perfectionism seems to have a particularly strong effect on initial ICC scores. This is also corroborated by the R 2 value of.05, showing that the perfectionism variables combined only explained 5% of the variance in the initial skill level. Notes: SE = standard error; CI = confidence interval; LL = lower limit; UL = upper limit; ICC = Individual Coping Capacity; CDS = Cooperation in Difficult Situations; MA = Motivation to Achievement. X → I denotes the effect of X on the latent intercept (I). X → S denotes the effect of X on the latent slope (S).</p><p>For CDS, the estimated initial level for individuals' average in perfectionism was 25.7 (not shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). A oneunit increase in selforiented perfectionism is associated with a 0.46 increase in the initial skill level, while a oneunit increase in socially prescribed perfec tionism is associated with a 1.35 decrease in the initial skill level. The two perfectionism dimensions combined explained 12% of the variance in the initial skill level (R 2 = 0.12).</p><p>None of the perfectionism variables significantly explained variance in any of the latent slopes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Self-efficacy as a time-varying predictor</head><p>In the final set of models, we added selfefficacy as a timevarying predictor. Unlike perfectionism, selfefficacy was not modeled to influence the overall growth trajec tory but instead was allowed to directly influence the mil itary skill dimensions at each time point. In this manner, timevarying predictors were allowed to have a different effect at each wave. The likelihood ratios and measures of the model fit shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> (model 3) again suggest good fit to the data for all models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>The results of the present study partly supported our hypothesis that perceived military skills improve over a threeyear period of military academy training. There was an overall significant improvement in ICC and CDS, but not in MA during the threeyear training period, with the greatest improvement found for ICC. The finding that per ceived military skills improve after three years of training also confirms previous findings that the rating of mili tary skills improves with experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Laberg et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Widing et al. 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The greater improvement related to the ICC compared to the CDS in the present study may reflect that the devel opment of individual skills is more easily facilitated during military exercises, as such skills do not depend as much on others as cooperation skills do. The fact that there were no significant increases in MA over the three years may reflect that MA is more difficult to facilitate, perhaps because ICC and CDS are more concrete skills compared to MA. The absence of improvement in the MA skills after three years of training may also reflect that the training of MA is not good enough in the military academies. Alterna tively, one may assume that the cadets were already highly motivated to achieve when they started the military train ing, so that a ceiling effect could help explain the absence of improvement.</p><p>The results further showed that the initial levels of perceived military skills were not related to differences in the development of military skills over the three years; those with higher scores on specific military skills at T0 did not show a greater (or less of an) increase in the development of these skills compared to those with lower initial values. This has implications for the selection and training of military personnel. Because those with lower initial skill values do not show a greater improvement in the skills over the three years of training, the initial skill level seems to be important for the end result. The ideal would be to select cadets with high initial scores on perceived military skills before starting at the military academy training.</p><p>The second hypothesis that cadets scoring high on adaptive perfectionism will have a greater improvement of perceived military skills over time was not supported. As perfectionism can be considered as a personality trait and such traits are assumed to be relatively stable across time, perfectionism is perhaps more relevant in relation to selection processes than training. Although levels of perfectionism did not significantly predict the slope (the development) of military skills over time, the levels of adaptive (selforiented) perfectionism was related to the initial military skill level at T0, in which cadets scoring above average on selforiented perfectionism were more likely to score higher on ICC and CDS (but not on MA). Similarly, cadets scoring high on maladaptive (socially prescribed) perfectionism were more likely to score lower on ICC and CDS. The levels of perfectionism explained 5% of the variance in the initial skill level of ICC and 12% of the variance in the initial skill level of CDS, which is not considered to be a particularly strong effect. Nonetheless, this finding also confirms that the initial skill level of mil itary academy cadets is of high importance.</p><p>The third hypothesis that levels of selfefficacy will predict levels of perceived military skills was supported. For the military skill subscales, selfefficacy significantly predicted the ICC scores at all time points and CDS and MA at T0, T1, and T2. This finding is in line with a wide range of previous research confirming that efficacy beliefs are crucial in the prediction of performance (for an overview, see the metaanalysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Stajkovic and Luthans 1998)</ref>. According to social cognitive theory, a person's expecta tions of his or her ability to perform adequate actions in specific situations are believed to be essential to their per formance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bandura 1978</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bandura , 1997))</ref>.</p><p>Selfefficacy beliefs are assumed to affect perfor mance through several intervening processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bandura 1990</ref>), e.g., affecting choices of activity or environments, affecting level of motivation, or affecting how much stress one experiences in a threatening situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Wood and Bandura 1989</ref>). One possible explanation for why cadets with a greater selfefficacy exhibited a greater development of military skills is that self efficacious cadets expose themselves to a greater extent to new and challenging situations during training. People with a higher selfefficacy have been found to undertake more challenging activities comprising new and creative practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bandura 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Wood and Bandura 1989)</ref> and to approach problem solving in a more innovative way <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Phelan and Young 2003)</ref>. Consequently, selfefficacious cadets may challenge themselves to a larger degree and thus learn more and show a greater development of mil itary skills during the three years of training at the mil itary academy. Selfefficacious cadets may also be more motivated to train and hence achieve a greater skill level. If one also assumes that selfefficacious cadets experience less stress in threatening situations, which is in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Wood and Bandura (1989)</ref>, there may a greater learning potential for cadets with a high selfef ficacy, as high stress levels are assumed to negatively affect the level of functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bandura 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Lazarus and Folkman 1984)</ref> and consequently the ability to learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(LePine et al. 2004)</ref>.</p><p>For ICC, the effect of adaptive (selforiented) perfec tionism was no longer significant when the influence of selfefficacy was taken into account. These results indi cate that levels of selfefficacy explain more of the vari ance in military skills than does perfectionism. The same was true for CDS, with the effect of adaptive perfectionism on the initial scores on CDS no longer being significant when selfefficacy was taken into account. The negative effect of maladaptive perfectionism, however, remained significant for both ICC and CDS. Even after the effect of selfefficacy levels were taken into account, higher levels of maladaptive perfectionism were still associated with lower scores on both subscales at T0. It may therefore not be surprising that socially prescribed (maladaptive) per fectionism, the belief that others have exceptionally high expectations of you, is related to a lower ability to cope with others in difficult situations. High scores on mala daptive perfectionism are related to a fear of failure and a focus on avoiding error and may contribute to excessive levels of stress. Prior studies have found that a balanced stress intensity experience is important for the perfor mance of military skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Driskell et al. 2006)</ref>. Training that incorporates no stress or a too high intensity of stress is both likely to be counterproductive <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Friedland and Keinan 1992)</ref>. Stressful experiences can hence possess an oppor tunity for positive individual growth if they are balanced with stress intensity.</p><p>The theory of planned behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ajzen 1991)</ref> can also be used to explain the link between maladaptive perfec tionism, selfefficacy, and CDS. According to the theory of planned behavior, an individual's behavioral intentions and behaviors are shaped by the individual's attitudes toward a behavior, along with subjective norms, and per ceived behavioral control <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ajzen 1991)</ref>. Subjective norms refer to the individual's perception of the behavior influ enced by the judgments of significant others, whereas behavior control refers to the individual's beliefs about being able to perform the behavior (closely related to selfefficacy). A cadet with maladaptive perfectionism beliefs is likely to perceive that significant others have expectations that are too high (low perceived behavioral control), in combination with low selfefficacy beliefs (subjective norms), which affect their subsequent behav ior (poorer CDS skills). Studies of selffulfilling prophecies demonstrate the strong effect of expectations, as well as the fact that people tend to behave in accordance with the expectations that reference group members hold for them (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Biggs 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Eden 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Eden et al. 2000)</ref>. Accord ingly, maladaptive perfectionism and the belief that others expect too much of you may result in lower performances and a lower ability to effectively cope with others in diffi cult situations.</p><p>Overall, the results from the present study showed that adaptive perfectionism is related to higher levels of selfreported military skills, whereas maladaptive perfec tionism is related to lower levels of selfreported military skills when cadets start their training (at T0). Neither adaptive perfectionism nor maladaptive perfectionism explains any of the variations in the development of mili tary skills. For this reason, perfectionism seems to have a limited effect on learning or the acquisition of new skills. On the other hand, selfefficacy helped explain some of the variations in skill development. With some excep tions, selfefficacious cadets are expected to have higher military skills at most time points than what was esti mated as the overall growth curve. This may implicate that the stimulation of cadets' selfefficacy is an impor tant component in developing military skills. Because selfefficacy is usually situation specific and may vary from time to time, it seems to be important to actively stimulate cadets' selfefficacy throughout the military academy training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Strengths, limitations, and future directions</head><p>Most studies are crosssectional and only measure sub jects' responses at one time point. A strength of the present study is the longitudinal design, in which the cadets of three military academies were followed throughout the military academy college and measured before starting the college, and subsequently after completing each of the three years, with four time points in total.</p><p>A possible limitation of the present study is that the measures of military skills in this study were based on selfreport because selfreported skills may differ from "actual" military skills. The use of selfreport measures may increase common method variance because the same rater responds to the items in a single questionnaire. However, in a study of US soldiers, a satisfactory concord ance was found when selfreports were compared with unit records of soldier performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Adler et al. 2005)</ref>, which may indicate that the selfreported skills of sol diers can be trustworthy. In order to try to avoid socially desirable answers, participation in the present study was voluntary, the cadets were assured of the survey's strict confidentiality, and the results were to solely be used for research purposes and not for future selection. Still, future studies should aim at including objective measures of military skills and performance in order to reduce the commonmethod variance.</p><p>As with most longitudinal studies, dropout was a sig nificant problem in the present study, so attrition may be a possible limitation that affected the power of the anal yses in the present study. Analyses of dropouts vs. com pleters showed no significant age differences but that a greater proportion of women were among the completers. Moreover, the dropout analyses showed that completers had higher initial scores on all military skill subscales compared to those who missed one, two, or three meas urement points, which may have affected the results (e.g., the nonsignificant overall improvement in MA over the three years). The most pronounced dropout was from T1 to T2, in which 31.1% of cadets dropped out. After the first year of military training (T1), many cadets were trans ferred to other geographical locations for additional edu cation, which may help explain the high attrition rates at this point (T2). Some cadets were also absent from the academies because they were on exercises at both sea and land; the attrition can therefore be attributed to some degree to difficulties in gathering respondents in time for testing. We would consequently recommend future research to include some means of followup for those who leave the academy or who are otherwise absent during the test periods.</p><p>The sample in the present study consisted of pre dominantly male cadets from three military academies in Norway, so the generalizability may be restricted and the findings may be specific for this population. Thus, the generalizability of the results should be tested in other cultures, countries, and contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>We conclude that training in a military academy is likely to increase specific military skills over a threeyear period and that cadets with high scores on adaptive perfection ism are likely to have higher initial skill levels, while cadets with high scores on maladaptive perfectionism are likely to have lower initial skill levels. Levels of per fectionism do not seem to affect the development of the military skills over the three years of military academy training, although levels of selfefficacy not only predict initial levels of military skills but also skill levels at the end of each year at the military academy.
