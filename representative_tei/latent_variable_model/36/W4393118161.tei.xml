<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper proposes a data-driven approach to detect damage using monitoring data from the Infante Dom Henrique bridge in Porto. The main contribution of this work lies in exploiting the combination of raw measurements from local (inclinations and stresses) and global (eigenfrequencies) variables in a full-scale SHM application.</p><p>We exhaustively analyze and compare the advantages and drawbacks of employing each variable type and explore the potential of combining them. An autoencoderbased Deep Neural Network is employed to properly reconstruct measurements under healthy conditions of the structure, which are influenced by environmental and operational variability. The damage-sensitive feature for outlier detection is the reconstruction error that measures the discrepancy between current and estimated measurements. Three autoencoder architectures are designed according to the input: local variables, global variables, and their combination. To test the performance of the methodology in detecting the presence of damage, we employ a Finite Element model to calculate the relative change in the structural response induced by damage at four locations. These relative variations between the healthy and damaged responses are employed to affect the experimental testing data, thus producing realistic timedomain damaged measurements. We analyze the Receiver Operating Curves and investigate the latent feature representation of the data provided by the autoencoder in the presence of damage. Results reveal the existence of synergies between the different variable types, producing almost perfect classifiers throughout the performed tests when combining the two available data sources. When damage occurs far from the instrumented sections, the area under the curve in the combined approach increases 50% compared to using local variables only. The classificatoin metrics also demonstrate the enhancement of combining both sources of data in the damage detection task, reaching close to 97% precission values for the four considered test damage scenarios. Finally, we also investigate the capability of local variables to localize the damage, demonstrating the potential of including these variables in the damage detection task.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is gaining importance for bridge managers and researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. In the last decades, many bridge structures have been instrumented to monitor their response during operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Instrumentation systems are often deployed in structures to track specific processes (e.g., construction steps and concrete hardening phenomena). Sometimes, these devices are removed from the structure after completing the target task and turn unprofitable. In other cases, the instrumentation systems remain installed but are inactive or disregarded. Under such scenarios, different sensor types coexist in the same structure, offering redundant and complementary information on the structural condition. From a Value of Information (VoI) perspective, a continuous SHM strategy based on measurements obtained from these devices efficiently exploits their assessment potential throughout adequate processing.</p><p>One of the most critical tasks in SHM is damage detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Civil engineering structures are subject to several deterioration processes, including material degradation, aging, and extreme loading conditions <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. Damage detection is an inverse problem that indicates the structural health condition from measurements <ref type="bibr">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr">14]</ref>. Two main approaches exist in damage detection: model-based and data-driven <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. Model-based approaches employ computational models to account for the physics governing structural behavior <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. Model-based SHM is extensively employed given its ability to reach high damage identification levels according to Rytter scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[15]</ref>, allowing to locate and quantify the damage. The Rytter scale classifies SHM algorithms based on the reached level of damage characterization, where four levels exist: (𝐼) detection, (𝐼𝐼) location, (𝐼𝐼𝐼) quantification, and (𝐼𝑉 ) prognosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">16]</ref>. These techniques require strong physical knowledge and modeling skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr">14]</ref>. Besides, the iterative procedure required to solve the inverse problem of damage identification involves running thousands of simulations with the corresponding computational expense. This situation prevents model-based approaches from yielding a fast assessment close to real-time once new data are measured <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr">14]</ref>.</p><p>By contrast, data-driven techniques assess the health condition of structures based uniquely on monitoring data <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12]</ref>. These approaches skip the need for complex models based on engineering knowledge and the associated computational cost to solve the identification problem. However, monitoring data regarding possible damage conditions is rarely measurable in real practice, and only healthy data are available. When only healthy measurements are employed, the SHM approach consists of characterizing the baseline condition (healthy) and detecting departures from this reference, which corresponds to level 𝐼 in the Rytter scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[15]</ref>. The core idea of data-driven methods is thus to characterize the reference (undamaged) behavior of the structure and detect an outlier when a novelty (i.e., damage) occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</p><p>One of the most challenging issues in data-driven methods is tackling the effect of changing environmental and operational conditions (EOCs) <ref type="bibr">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">21]</ref>. These phenomena (e.g., temperature, humidity, traffic) may mask the presence of damage and hinder the ability of the algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">23]</ref>. Numerous statistical methods have been developed to address this problem, such as autoregressive models <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[17]</ref> or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">23]</ref>. PCA is a statistical data compression tool widely employed in outlier detection for SHM <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. This method allows isolating environmental and operational variability by projecting the data onto the most relevant principal components (eigenvectors) of the covariance matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[30]</ref>. However, PCA is mainly restricted to linearly correlated data spaces, which limits its applicability.</p><p>The emergence of Artificial Intelligence introduces new techniques to handle large amounts of data and account for complex nonlinear relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">32]</ref>. Machine Learning (ML) has progressively extended to many application areas, including the identification of structural damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">36]</ref>. Neural Networks (NNs), and particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated to be powerful techniques in SHM applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">46]</ref>. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated powerful performance as image processing techniques to detect external damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[32]</ref>. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[47]</ref>, authors employ a CNN that automatically learns image features to identify cracks in concrete. It incorporates a sliding window technique to accommodate different image sizes. They design the CNN to classify images and detect the presence of cracks robust to image noise sources. Cha et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[48]</ref> propose an enhanced approach to identify different damage types (cracks, corrosion, and delamination) by applying a Faster Region-based CNN. In contrast to traditional statistical methods, NNs require a training phase to learn relationships from large amounts of data <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[31]</ref>.</p><p>In the line of damage detection accounting for varying EOCs, many DNN-based works have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[32]</ref>. One of the most powerful methods in this task is the autoencoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[49]</ref>. Autoencoders are a specific neural network type based on the same idea of data compression as PCA but include nonlinearities <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[50]</ref>. An autoencoder reconstructs the input data by following two steps: encoding and decoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[51]</ref>. The encoding step compresses the data onto a lower-dimensional latent representation (dimensionality reduction), and the decoding step reconstructs the original measurements from the lower-dimensional features <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[52]</ref>.</p><p>During training, the autoencoder learns to reconstruct data from the healthy condition of the structure. The healthy condition consists of long-term monitoring data that includes environmental and operational variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[40]</ref>. By learning the existing relationships in the long-term monitoring data that is affected by EOCs, we ensure that this variability is considered to be "normal", thus establishing a reliable description of the reference behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. The reconstruction error measures the discrepancy between a measurement and its reconstruction. When new measurements are obtained that belong to a similar (undamaged) condition, we expect that the autoencoder will adequately reconstruct them with a small error value. We assume that the damageinduced variability affects the data differently than environmental and operational phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[53]</ref>. Thus, we expect that the autoencoder yields a high reconstruction error with the appearance of damage that sufficiently affects the measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Several works exist in the literature employing reconstruction error in SHM applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">36]</ref>. For example, Bao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[55]</ref> propose a two-step damage detection approach that transforms raw data signals into grey-scale images and trains a DNN based on stacked autoencoders. The recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[56]</ref> employs autoencoders to produce two reconstruction error metrics indicative of damage. Article <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[57]</ref> proposes an adversarial autoencoder trained with vehicle acceleration responses and uses the reconstruction error as the damage indicator. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[58]</ref>, authors employ a convolutional autoencoder for damage detection on a PSC-I bridge under vehicle-induced excitation using acceleration signals. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[54]</ref>, authors propose a Deep autoencoder for an efficient dimensionality reduction and then apply a density-based clustering for outlier detection. In this work, we employ an autoencoder DNN to reconstruct monitoring data subject to EOCs and employ the reconstruction error as the damage-sensitive indicator.</p><p>Another critical aspect of data-driven approaches is to identify the variables to measure. Vibration-based are the most extensively employed data <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. In this context, raw vibration measurements (e.g., acceleration signals) are often processed through Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[60]</ref> techniques to produce the modal properties of the structure, mainly eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[23]</ref>. These are strongly sensitive to the presence of damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">61]</ref>. Avci et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[17]</ref> reviewed the extensive literature on different data-driven approaches to detect structural damage using vibration monitoring data. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[62]</ref>, authors employ eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes as the input features to estimate the location and severity of damage by applying a two-stage NN incorporating system substructuring. They validate the method in small-scale concrete slab and steel-frame structures. Particularly on bridge applications, Hongpo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[63]</ref> propose a two-step approach employing a modal energy-based damage indicator to locate damage and estimate its location with a NN. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[64]</ref>, authors employ modified modal strain energy and modal flexibility versions as the damage-sensitive features to feed a four-layer NN that estimates damage location and severity. Azim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[65]</ref> employs two parallel approaches to detect and locate damage in the beams and the deck of a bridge. They employ the modal strain energy as the feature to find a damage indicator for the steel beams and the relative flexibility change for the reinforced concrete deck. Nick et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[66]</ref> also employ a damage-sensitive index based on modal strain energy calculated from the first three bending eigenmodes to detect and estimate the location of damage in steel girder bridges. They apply a NN to quantify the damage that is trained with synthetic data from a computational model. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[67]</ref>, authors present a damage detection technique relying on the modal flexibility to design two damage indicators (vertical and lateral), which allow locating damage at critical elements of a suspension bridge. Another relevant work is <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[68]</ref>, where authors compare three modal-based SHM strategies (strain energy, flexibility, and curvature) in noisy data.</p><p>While post-processing measurements to estimate eigenfrequencies is a well-established task (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">72]</ref>), the approximation of eigenmodes (a.k.a., mode shapes) presents additional difficulties. Only a few OMA techniques address this challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">69]</ref>, yet the accuracy of higher-order modes can be deficient. For this reason, some vibration-based approaches employ only eigenfrequencies as damage-sensitive features. For example, Comanducci et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref> investigate the ability of various data-driven algorithms (dynamic regression, linear and local PCA, and cointegration) using time histories of eigenfrequencies measured in the Infante Dom Henrique bridge. Magalhães et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> also employed Infante Dom Henrique as the target structure to investigate the potential of eigenfrequencies in damage detection. However, eigenfrequencies are global variables, and their ability to provide information regarding damage location is limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[18]</ref>. This implies they reach only a level 𝐼 (detection) diagnostic in the Rytter scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Recent developments in both sensing technology and computational resources have aroused a growing interest in the exploitation of raw time-domain signals, e.g., displacements, rotations, or strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">75]</ref>. Compared to the value of modal coordinates, which are often unit-scaled, local variables own some physical meaning, and their value might be directly insightful about the structural condition. These local variables have demonstrated detection capabilities, mainly when damage occurs close to their emplacement. For example, Teng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[44]</ref> applied one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to raw short-term acceleration signals. They validated the method using a truss bridge and a frame structure in a laboratory environment. Authors' previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> presents a case of applying data-driven methods to long-term time histories measured in a full-scale operating structure. Azim and Gül <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[76]</ref> applied PCA to strain measurements to detect damage in truss railway bridges. They validated the method using a Finite Element model to simulate stiffness reductions, achieving successful detection, location, and relative damage quantification.</p><p>However, local variables lose sensitivity when the damage lies far from their location. This restricts the detectable damage to the monitored region, and very dense sensor arrays are required to cover the whole structural system. In this sense, including global variables (eigenfrequencies) seems helpful to solve the detection problem. After extensive review, the authors have yet to find any other work in the literature that addresses and analyzes the combination of global and local variables in SHM practices. Only the work presented by Alten et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[77]</ref> was found to study the detection ability of eigenfrequencies, strains, and rotations separately in a post-tensioned reinforced concrete bridge. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[78]</ref>, two local sources of data are fused, namely accelerometers and strain gauges, for damage detection in long-span bridge structures. However, no global variables (i.e., eigenfrequencies) are considered to complement the lack of sensibility of local variables when damage occurs far from their specific emplacement. Combining experimental data sources (i.e., local and global) in full-scale bridges still needs to be explored in the existing literature.</p><p>This work presents a strategy to adequately handle multivariate data from different instrumentation systems coexisting in a bridge, including local and global variables. We employ a data-driven approach based on a particular autoencoder architecture to reconstruct long-term monitoring measurements for novelty detection (level 𝐼 assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[15]</ref>) in full-scale bridges. The autoencoder learns the underlying relationships in experimental measurements affected by EOCs to characterize the reference (healthy) condition. The novelty indicator is the reconstruction error. We assume that damage affects the meaurements differently from EOCs, thus resulting in higher values of the reconstruction error. We extensively analyze the advantages and limitations of dynamic global variables (eigenfrequencies) and quasi-static local variables (inclinations and stresses) for bridge condition assessment. The main contribution of this work lies in unveiling the synergies in data from different coexistent instrumentation systems, including local and global variables, to provide a more insightful assessment. We demonstrate that the combination extends the damage detection capabilities of local-only or global-only approaches. For that purpose, we analyze the Receiver Operating Curves (ROC) and the data transformation into the latent space of reduced dimensions. We also explore the potential of local variables to enrich the diagnostic by providing location information as long as the damage occurs nearby any of the installed sensors.</p><p>We select the Infante Dom Henrique bridge as the target structure for the analysis. The bridge contains long-term monitoring data from accelerometers, strain gauges, and inclinometers. Acceleration signals are processed to obtain time series of the eigenfrequencies of the structure, which are the global variables. Stresses and rotations are directly used as the local variables. Information about the exact sensor location can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">80]</ref>. We employ a Deep Autoencoder DNN as the damage detection method. Its architecture follows the scheme developed in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[81]</ref>, where we proposed a partiallyexplainable Deep Autoencoder to outperform PCA in the outlier detection task. This work also supports the robustness and flexibility of the methodology described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[81]</ref> by feeding the DNN with data from different sources and dimensions. Three DNN architectures are built to accommodate the different input data for the analysis: (i) local variables, (ii) global variables, and (iii) the combination of both variable types. The DNN allows to accommodate a wide range of input dimensions, being adaptable to more complex problems with denser instrumentation systems. The encoding dimension of each architecture is fixed based on the level of information captured during training. The resulting compressed features lack a physical meaning but are an optimal representation of the data in terms of dimensionality.</p><p>To test the performance of the proposed methodology, we explore the capability of detecting any damage with impact on the vertical bending stiffness of the structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. This damage can appear due to long-term structure aging or extreme loading, such as earthquakes. Since real data regarding damage scenarios are unavailable, the detection ability of the method is tested by affecting the undamaged measurements synthetically. For that purpose, a Finite Element (FE) model of the bridge is employed to simulate damage at four different locations. The damage scenarios are generated by reducing the vertical bending stiffness of the affected FE model elements. From the FE model, we obtain the relative change between the healthy and damaged response for each damage scenario. We assume this shift to be sufficiently representative of the effect of real damage. We transfer the relative change induced by damage to some monitoring measurements preserved for testing, which incorporate the effect of EOCs. For each damage scenario, the testing dataset contains two subsets: undamaged and damaged. The ROC curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[82]</ref> evaluate the detection ability of each DNN and allow us to investigate the potential of combining local and global variables. The capability of the reconstruction error to locate damage is also analyzed by calculating the contribution of each instrumented section to the total error.</p></div>

It combines two elements: a pre-stressed box beam deck and a thin arch spanning 280 m between abutments <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[80]</ref>. A static instrumentation system containing strain gauges, inclinometers, and thermometers was installed to control construction and was subsequently kept to assess the structural behavior during operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[83]</ref>. This system records one measurement every hour. Besides, a complementary long-term dynamic monitoring system was installed in 2007 to obtain the first twelve eigenfrequencies of the structure. It measures acceleration signals from 12 force balance accelerometers installed inside the deck box girder. The system creates an ASCII file with 30-min time series sampled at 50 Hz every half an hour. A downsampling to 12.5 Hz removes the offset and reduces the data amount. This sampling frequency is enough to accurately obtain the desired eigenfrequencies, given that they are below 5 Hz <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The data are subsequently post-processed using DynaMo <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[84]</ref> software to obtain estimates of the first twelve eigenfrequencies of the structure: 𝐟 = {𝑓 1 , 𝑓 2 , ..., 𝑓 12 }. A full description of the monitoring system (devices, acquisition process, and obtained data) can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[85]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>This work employs three years of continuous monitoring data acquired with these two instrumentation systems. The monitoring period extends from September 2007 to September 2010. Measurements from inclinometers and strain gauges are used as the local variables. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> depicts the location of the sensors, distributed in six instrumented sections. Sections one, two, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> Instrumented sections with local variables and damage locations five, and six contain two inclinometers each, but one of the sensors in section six (𝑆61) was discarded due to low signal quality. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the evolution of the seven selected inclination signals over the monitoring period. Sections three and four include four strain gauges, but one is discarded (𝑆34) due to low signal quality. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the evolution of the selected stress time series during the monitoring period. Each sensor is denoted as 𝑆 𝑖,𝑗 , with 𝑖 indicating the instrumented section where it is located and 𝑗 being the sensor number. More details regarding the exact location of the sensors can be found in Fonseca et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[83]</ref> The eigenfrequencies are produced with DynamMo software <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[84]</ref> as the global variables. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the evolution of the first twelve eigenfrequencies (Hz) of the structure. The figure reveals that relatively small changes affect the measurements in the long term (around 0.005 Hz variation), which mainly correspond to temperature variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The identification algorithm accurately identifies the eigenfrequency values throughout the entire monitoring period. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the statistical properties of the long-term eigenfrequency measurements, including the mean and the standard deviation (SD) values.  Since the local variables yield one measurement per hour while eigenfrequencies are produced every half an hour, we compute the mean of every two eigenfrequency measurements to use data from both monitoring systems with a time resolution of one hour. After removing null values, a total of 16,005 measurements is obtained for each variable. From these data, the first 72% of the samples (obeying chronological order) are employed for training and 18% for validation. The final monitoring period (remaining 10% of the data) is kept to investigate the damage detection ability using different variable combinations.</p></div>

Besides, this strategy enhances the explainability of the neural network, since the contribution of nonlinear transformations can be explicitely separated from the linear ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref> shows the block-wise architecture of the autoencoder. Let 𝐌 ∈ 𝕄 𝑛×𝑠 be a set of raw measurements from 𝑠 variables. Since variables from different sources are used, a linear standard rescaling is applied. For any variable 𝐱, let 𝜇 and 𝜎 be the mean and the standard deviation of the variable, respectively.

Let 𝐦 = (𝑚 1 , 𝑚 2 , ..., 𝑚 𝑠 ) 𝑇 be a sample from 𝐌 at a given time. The encoder operator  𝐸 compresses the data to a lower-dimensional feature or latent space (𝐳 ∈  𝑘 , with 𝑘 &lt; 𝑠) by adding the following two terms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝐳 =  𝐸 (𝐦) =  𝑎 (𝐦; 𝜽 𝑎 ) +  𝑏 (𝐦; 𝜽 𝑏 ).<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Here,  𝑎 is an affine transformation and  𝑏 is a nonlinear operation, with 𝜽 𝑎 and 𝜽 𝑏 being their corresponding learnable parameters.

If damage alters the structural response, the latent representation 𝐳 will differ with respect to that learned for the undamaged observations, yielding a high reconstruction error 𝜌 (outlier). Given the interest in investigating the potential of combining local and global monitoring variables in damage detection, three different DNN architectures are designed to accommodate the input dimension for i) local variables (𝐷𝑁𝑁 Local ), ii) global variables (𝐷𝑁𝑁 Global ), and iii) both local and global variables (𝐷𝑁𝑁 Combined ).</p><p>The three DNNs follow the scheme sketched in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref> . All the architectures are fully-connected with only dense layers. The linear encoder  𝑎 applies the affine transformation using a single dense layer with linear activation to compress the input to the k-dimensional latent vector. The same holds for the linear decoder  𝑐 , which expands the latent vector to the original input space. The nonlinear encoder  𝑏 contains six hidden layers using the ReLu activation function and an output layer linearly activated to reach the latent dimension. The architecture of the nonlinear decoder  𝑑 is symmetric with respect to that of  𝑏 . The activation function is ReLu for all the hidden layers and linear at the output layer.</p><p>The architectures of 𝐷𝑁𝑁 Local and 𝐷𝑁𝑁 Global are identical except for their input dimension, that is, 12 (the 12 eigenfrequencies) and 14 (seven inclinometers and seven strain gauges considered), respectively. The hidden layers in the nonlinear encoder contain the following number of neurons: <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">24]</ref>. The encoding dimension is 𝑘 = 3. In the case of 𝐷𝑁𝑁 Combined , which has a 26-dimensional input, the hidden layers have twice as many units as those in 𝐷𝑁𝑁 Local or 𝐷𝑁𝑁 Global , and the encoding dimension is 𝑘 = 8. This expansion broadens the search space (more trainable parameters) when working with the combination of variables. The decision on the number of hidden layers in the nonlinerar connections determines the number of parameters of the networks. We select the encoding dimension after exploring its effect in the detection task. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref> shows the accuracy and precision metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[86]</ref> for an increasing encoding dimension within the interval <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">12]</ref> for 𝐷𝑁𝑁 Combined . This figure was obtained from a test dataset with damage 𝐷 1 with 10% severity. The testing datasets are described in Section 4.1. Similar results were obtained for the other damage cases. The curves reveal an optimal solution for an encoding dimension of 8, with an accuracy value of 98.08% and a precission of 96.31%.</p><p>The proposed architectures provided adequate results while avoiding overfitting problems. Other architectures could be employed, but optimizing the architectures is out of the scope of this work <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[87]</ref>. The hyperparameter selection founds in previous studies on gradient-based training of Neural Networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">89]</ref>. We employ Adam optimizer given its ability to prevent getting trapped in local minima <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[90]</ref>. A small learning rate may result in slow training and, in some cases, getting stacked in a local minimum <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[91]</ref>. Contrarily, a significant learning rate may cause instability during training or even divergence of the loss function <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[92]</ref>. In this work, a learning rate of 10 -03 yields adequate training and validation phases. We fix the number of epochs once no significant improvement is observed in the validation loss, preventing overfitting phenomena. We employ a batch size of 1, 024 for the three architectures, which provides an adequate trade-off between training speed and memory usage constraints. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> summarizes the main characteristics of each architecture and the training properties.  The networks are trained and validated with long-term monitoring data corresponding to the healthy state of the bridge (unsupervised learning). This period covers two years of environmental and operational variability. New (unseen) measurements corresponding to the healthy state are expected to produce a feature vector 𝐳 similar to those of the training observations and thus yield a small reconstruction error. However, if the new measurements correspond to a damaged scenario, the network is expected to reconstruct them poorly, delivering a high reconstruction error. The network architectures and training procedures were implemented using Tensorflow 2.8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[93]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows the evolution of the loss function during training and validation for the three networks. We observe that local and global variables independently reach convergence before 800 epochs. An epoch represents an iteration over the entire dataset to minimize the loss function. For 𝐷𝑁𝑁 Combined , since the number of trainable parameters is much higher, the minimization process achieves convergence after approximately 1,800 epochs, yielding a better solution.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Damaged scenarios</head><p>Let us assume that the target structure, under specific EOCs, has an undamaged response 𝐦 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑢𝑛𝑑 . This response includes the local and global variables available from the monitoring system. When damage occurs, it affects the structural response, resulting in 𝐦 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒  𝑑𝑎𝑚 . We obtain the relative change between the healthy and the damaged conditions as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">𝐝 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑟𝑒𝑙 = (𝐦 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑑𝑎𝑚 -𝐦 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑢𝑛𝑑 ) 𝐦 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑢𝑛𝑑 (6)</formula><p>However, since the damaged response is unavailable experimentally, we employ a FE model that represents the structural behavior. The model is built in ANSYS Ⓡ using 3D elastic beam-type (BEAM4) elements. It is an uniaxial element that allows tension, compression, torsion, and bending. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref> shows an extruded view of the FE model (not the real geometry of the cross-sections).</p><p>The FE model is built based on engineering knowledge and prior information but includes simplifications and assumptions that make its response differ from that of the true structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[85]</ref>. In order to reduce that discrepancy, the model undergoes an updating process to match the response measured during an ambient vibration test with specific EOCs. This approach is a standard practice in the scientific community since a denser sensor array is deployed during the ambient vibration test compared to long-term instrumentation, allowing to characterize the shape of the eigenmodes with higher resolution. The updating process is fully described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[85]</ref>, where the relative errors with respect to the dynamic response in the ambient vibration test were calculated. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> summarizes the updating results and compares the numerical response of the final model with the ambient  Accurately simulating damage demands a substantial computational effort and human expertise. These resources could be unavailable or unprofitable, and simpler approximations are needed. In this work, damage is feasibly simulated by reducing the inertial properties to represent a loss of vertical bending stiffness at small-length segments of the structure. When simulating damage, we employ BEAM4 elements, which directly modify the inertial properties and preserve the mass value (fixed area and material). In these elements, the flexural inertia for the vertical bending can be reduced by affecting the corresponding real constant of the element, i.e., without affecting the mass, material properties or other inertial properties of the bridge. For that purpose, we first alter the geometry in separate cross-section models to achieve the flexural intertia value corresponding to the damage level. The geometrical modification consists of slightly reducing the bottom slab height. Magalhaes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[94]</ref> provides descriptive information of these geometries. Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> shows the geometry modification introduced at 𝑆 3 (see figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> ) to achieve a 10% bending intertia reduction. We then introduce the new (damaged) intertia value into the BEAM4 elements of the affected sections of the bridge FE model. It was first proposed and applied to the same bridge by Magalhães et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[73]</ref> to reproduce possible consequences of aging phenomena, corrosion, or extreme events. The same damage scenarios were also employed for validation in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[81]</ref>. Other works, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">96]</ref>, also employ stiffness reductions to reproduce damage scenarios, considering reduction levels up to 30%. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> indicates the approximate locations of the studied damage cases (D1, D2, D3, and D4). Scenarios D1, D2, and D3 occur nearby instrumented deck sections, while D4 affects one column connecting the arch and deck, and it is relatively far from the positions where local variables are recorded. For scenarios D1 and D3, we affect the vertical bending inertia of two elements (one at each side of cross-sections 𝑆 1 and 𝑆 6 , respectively), covering a total length of ten meters. Analogously, damage D2 affects two elements in the central region (both sides of the instrumented section 𝑆 3 ), with a nine meters length. Damage D4 affects a 6.5 m long element in the corresponding arch-deck connection pier. We investigate three severity levels, namely 5%, 10%, and 20%, which correspond to the stiffness reduction at the affected region. As an illustrative example, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> summarizes the vertical bending inertia value at the affected elements in damage D2. The synthetic global variables are derived from modal analyses using ANSYS eigensolver. The rotations are directly obtained from static self-weight simulations. The vertical bending moments from the self-weight simulation are obtained to generate the stresses provided by the strain gauges. Then, the bending stress variations are calculated using the Navier formula for the considered inertia reductions. Analogous to Equation <ref type="formula">6</ref>, we calculate the relative differences between the undamaged and the damaged responses for the FE model as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">𝐝 𝐹 𝐸 𝑟𝑒𝑙 = 𝐦 𝐹 𝐸 𝑑𝑎𝑚 -𝐦 𝐹 𝐸 𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝐦 𝐹 𝐸 𝑢𝑛𝑑 ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where 𝐦 𝐹 𝐸 𝑢𝑛𝑑 and 𝐦 𝐹 𝐸 𝑑𝑎𝑚 correspond to the numerical responses obtained in the undamaged and damaged states, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Damaged datasets</head><p>The proposed FE simulations disregard the effect of environmental and operational variability.

If damage alters the structural response, the latent representation 𝐳 will differ from that learned for the undamaged observations, yielding a high reconstruction error 𝜌 (outlier). To evaluate the performance in detecting structural damage, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[82]</ref> are calculated. ROC curves are widely employed to measure the performance of classifiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[97]</ref>. These curves represent the rate of false-positive predictions (FPR) against the rate of true-positive predictions (TPR).</p><p>In the context of SHM, a false positive indicates healthy data misclassified as damage, and a true positive indicates a correctly classified damaged scenario. Unsupervised learning results in a single-class classification, where undamaged data belong to the healthy class and any damaged scenario corresponds to an outlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[98]</ref>. The detection ability consists of classifying new unseen healthy observations as undamaged and detecting any departure as an outlier. False-positive and true-positive rates are obtained according to a threshold value 𝛼 that establishes the maximum 𝜌 value corresponding to the undamaged state. Measurements that produce error values above 𝛼 are classified as damaged. We calculate the threshold 𝛼 as the 𝑘-percentile over the training reconstruction error dataset. For example, seting 𝛼 to the 95-percentile means that 5% of the training reconstruction errors exceed the threshold and are false positives. When building the ROC curves, we vary the threshold 𝛼 to sweep the FPR within the interval [0,1] and display it against the TPR. A perfect classifier operates along the horizontal line at TPR = 1, and a random classifier would follow the diagonal line (45 • ) that crosses the ROC space <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[97]</ref>.</p><p>Let 𝜌 𝑡 𝑢𝑛𝑑 and 𝜌 𝑡 𝑑𝑎𝑚 denote the reconstruction errors for the undamaged and damaged testing subsets, respectively. The FPR and TPR for a threshold value (𝛼) are obtained as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">𝐹 𝑃 𝑅 = ∑ 𝑁 𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝑗=1 (𝜌 𝑡 𝑗 𝑢𝑛𝑑 &gt; 𝛼) 𝑁 𝑢 , (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">𝑇 𝑃 𝑅 = ∑ 𝑁 𝑑𝑎𝑚 𝑗=1 (𝜌 𝑡 𝑗 𝑑𝑎𝑚 &gt; 𝛼) 𝑁 𝑑 , (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>Figures 12 to 14 compare the performance of the three designed DNNs for each type of damage to demonstrate the benefit of combining local and global variables. In the figures, the random classifier is represented with a grey dashed line. The performance increases as the curve moves away from the grey line and approximates the top of the ROC space.</p><p>Local variables exhibit good performance for damage scenarios D1 to D3, mainly for severity levels above 10% (see figures 13 and 14 ). In the case of damage D2, where three strain gauges are installed in the region affected by the damage, local variables yield a perfect classifier even for a slight severity level (see Figure <ref type="figure">12</ref> ). Since D3 occurs close to only one sensor (at S6), the sensitivity is lower than with damage D1 (similar damage at S1), where two inclinometers participate. But when damage occurs far from any instrumented section (D4), local variables turn insensitive and yield a poor classifier even for a high severity level (see Figure <ref type="figure">14</ref> ). Hence, the performance of local variables is adequate as long as the damage occurs nearby an instrumented section but strongly worsens for other damage locations.</p><p>Given the limited sensitivity to damage severity of 5%, we perform further analysis based on the 10% damage scenarios. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> gathers the quantitative results for a damage severity of 10% in terms of four metrics: Area Under Curve (AUC), Precission, Recall and F1-score. These are standard metrics to evaluate the performance of classifiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[86]</ref>. The AUC metric corresponds to the area under the classifier ROC curves, with value in the interval [0.5, 1]. The obtained results reveal the significant enhancement in the performance attained when combining local and global variables. Even if local variables demonstrate an elevated sensitivity to damage scenarios 𝐷1, 𝐷2, and 𝐷3 given their proximity to the instrumented sections, they are highly blind to any other damage. This situation fosters considering eigenfrequencies in the search for more global detection capabilities. We observe that the performance of global variables rises when complemented with local information, as in the case of damage 𝐷3.</p><p>We also explore the latent space for each damage scenario. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">15</ref> compares the latent space representation of local variables for a 10% severity. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">15</ref> b highlights the sensitivity of strain gauges to damage with a huge difference between the healthy and the damaged latent representation. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">15 d</ref> evidences that damage D4 barely affects local variables, making the healthy and the damaged latent representations overlap throughout the testing period.</p><p>On the other hand, global variables adequately detect the four damage scenarios when the severity reaches 20% (see Figure <ref type="figure">14</ref> ). However, the performance decays for lower severity levels, indicating a limited sensitivity to slight damage, as shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">12</ref> and<ref type="figure">13</ref> . Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">16</ref> compares the latent space representation for each damage with 10% severity for global  shows some variation with respect to the undamaged state). To explain this, the eigenmodes associated with the eigenfrequencies are analyzed. The shape of an eigenmode represents the vibration amplitude of each structural node when the bridge is excited at the corresponding eigenfrequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[99]</ref>. The curvature at a certain node describes its bending level in the mode shape. When damage occurs close to a node with a small curvature value for a certain eigenmode, the shift induced by damage will also be small, resulting in a poor sensitivity of the corresponding eigenfrequency. Thus, eigenfrequencies are more sensitive to damage that occurs close to nodes with higher curvature values. Since damage was introduced as a vertical stiffness reduction, it mainly affects the vertical bending eigenmodes. In this case, only four out of the 12 global variables represent vertical bending eigenmodes and thus participate in detecting the proposed damage scenarios. The rest of the mode shapes are lateral and torsional. Figure <ref type="figure">17</ref> shows the four vertical bending mode shapes adopted in this work. For damage cases D1 to D3, (occuring at the deck of the bridge), damage D2 presents practically null curvature, yielding the worst results. Damage D2 occurs in the middle deck (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> ) and it slightly affects global variables due to the low curvature of the involved eigenmodes at this position (see mainly Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">17 a</ref> and<ref type="figure">17 d</ref>). Hence, although global variables increase the range of detectable damage compared to local variables alone, they still present some limitations, mainly for reduced severity levels. It is worth noting that 𝐷𝑁𝑁 Global achieves the best performance for damage D4 (see Figure <ref type="figure">13 d</ref>), which presented worse results when using local variables only. Global variables result more sensitive to damage D4, which occurs at a different location (in an arch-deck connection pier, see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> ).</p><p>In light of the previous observations, it becomes interesting to combine both sources of monitoring data. The red dashed line in Figures 12 to 14 reveals that combining local and global variables outperforms the classification ability of local or global variables alone. The ROC curves denote a multiplicative enhancement of the results that goes beyond the sum of the individual contributions of local and global variables. This becomes more evident mainly for ligher damages (see, for example 12 c). In the case of damage D4, since the contribution of local variables is very low (see, e.g., Figure <ref type="figure">14 d</ref>), the combined solution practically coincides with the performance of global variables only. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">18</ref> compares the 8-dimensional latent space representations of the damage scenarios (10% severity) with respect to the undamaged condition produced by 𝐷𝑁𝑁 Combined . Results show the discrepancies between damaged and undamaged latent representations (e.g., damage D1 mainly affects the second, seventh, and eighth dimensions, whereas damage D2 affects all of them).</p><p>In general, the obtained ROC curves for the combined approach are very good for severity levels of 10% (see Figure <ref type="figure">13</ref> ). The minimum detectable damage can thus be established within the interval 5% -10%, depending mainly on the contribution of local variables. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Damage location</head><p>In addition to detecting damage occurring nearby the sensor emplacement, local variables also contribute to determining the damage location. It is expected that the autoencoder yields an outlier (𝜌 &gt; 𝛼) when an abnormal behavior that affects the structural response registers through monitoring. It is assumed that this abnormal behavior corresponds to damage at any bridge location. Once the reconstruction error exceeds the threshold value (𝛼) indicating damage, the contribution of local variables to the reconstruction error may be informative of the damage location. Here, the four damage scenarios considered for testing are investigated, whose location is known beforehand, to verify the capability of local variables in damage location.</p><p>It is assumed that if damage occurs nearby an instrumented section, it will mainly affect the corresponding local variables, and the autoencoder will reconstruct these variables more deficiently. Hence, the highest contribution to the reconstruction error would result from variables measured with the sensors located nearby the damaged region. Here, analyze the reconstruction error of local variables is analyzed using the combined autoencoder (𝐷𝑁𝑁 Combined ). For a particular (randomly chosen) observation in the damaged testing datasets, the individual reconstruction error of the local variables is obtained using equation 3. The contribution to the reconstruction error (%) is calculated at each instrumented section and results are compared. Tables 8 to 11 gather the reconstruction error at each section for each of the considered damage scenarios. When the instrumented section contains more than one local variable, the average value of the involved variables is computed. For damage scenarios D1 to D3, the error values corresponding to the instrumented section nearby the damage (see figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> ) are highlighted in bold.</p><p>Results demonstrate that damage D1 to D3, which occur close to instrumented sections that measure local variables, are adequately located even for reduced severity levels (see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">8 to 10</ref> ). The contribution of the affected section is considerably higher than those of the rest of the instrumented sections. By contrast, local variables are unable to inform about the location of D4, since no local variables are recorded close to it. This means that local variables only aid to locate damage occurring close to their emplacement. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">SHM strategy</head><p>The final goal of the methodology is to detect abnormal behavior of Infante Dom Henrique bridge during operation from experimental monitoring data. Given the successful results observed in Section 5, we employ the combination of local and global variables as the input data and thus employ the corresponding DNN (𝐷𝑁𝑁 Combined ), developed and trained in Section 3. The damage detection strategy employs control charts of the reconstruction error <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[100]</ref> to produce an alert system that early detects structural damage.  We employ the cumulative error after five measurements to reduce the risk of occurrence of false positives and produce a more robust alert system <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. This means that the detection time is five hours, since the monitoring system provides one observation per hour including the measurements of the local and global variables. The threshold value 𝛼 for the reconstruction error is established at the 97-percentile of the training dataset to obtain an adequate trade-off between the number of false positives and false negatives. Five testing subsets are concatenated: healthy, damage D1, damage D2, damage D3, and damage D4. After the analysis developed in Section 5 for three increasing damage severity levels, here we focus on a 10% severity to evaluate the performance of the methodology.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Damage detection</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">19</ref> shows the control chart of the reconstruction error. The logarithmic scale is applied to the reconstruction errors to better visualize the results. The grey-shadowed region indicates the part of the testing with damage, and the vertical dashed lines delimit the subset associated with each damage. Measurements exceeding the threshold value (blue horizontal line) are classified as healthy, with a 3.48% of false positives. We also observe that the four damage scenarios are adequately detected. In the case of damage D2, since three strain gauges exist at the affected region, the reconstruction error is very sensitive and robustly detects it. This means that lighter damage occurring at that location will be successfully detected. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">12</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">18</ref> b already manifested this sensitivity. Damage scenarios D1 and D3, which occur close to inclinometers, are adequately detected with some slack for lighter severity levels, specially damage D1, where two sensors participate. On the other hand, when analyzing damage D4, a 2.02% of false negatives is attained, indicating that lower severity levels will be more difficult to detect. Hence, when only global variables participate since no local variables exist nearby the damage, the minimum detectable severity is 10%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Damage location</head><p>We finally analyze the four damaged testing datasets to explore/investigate the ability of the method in damage location. We obtain the contribution to the reconstruction error at each section instrumented with local variable sensors (𝑆 1 to 𝑆 6 in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> ). given the high contribution of the corresponding sensors to the reconstruction error. As expected, for damage D4, which occurs far from the monitoring devices, we obtain very small contributions from all the local variables (see Figure <ref type="figure">20 d</ref>). In such case, the damage is detectable but its location is unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>An unsupervised learning approach was developed and tested to detect damage at the Infante Dom Henrique bridge in Porto.</p><p>A particular DNN based on an autoencoder with two adding blocks at the encoder and decoder was employed to account for nonlinear relationships. The reconstruction error, which measures the discrepancy between original and predicted measurements, is the damage-sensitive feature for outlier detection. Reaching a higher identification level (quantification and location) requires adopting a supervised learning strategy where simulated damaged data participates in the training phase of the data-driven model, which is a topic of interest to our research. Three DNN architectures were created to accommodate different inputs and investigate the potential of combining measurements from various sensor types, namely, local and global variables. The testing phase included healthy and damaged measurements to produce the ROC curves. The damage was simulated using a FE model of the structure by reducing the vertical bending stiffness to produce the relative change between the healthy and damaged responses. This relative shift affected a portion of the monitoring data preserved for testing purposes, subject to environmental and operational variability.</p><p>The classification performance of local, global, and a combination of both variables was compared and examined by analyzing the resulting ROC curves and the latent space representation. Some standard metrics (AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-score) evaluated the classification performance. Results revealed that local variables successfully detect damage occurring nearby the sensor emplacement but strongly fail for distant damage, such as D4, which practically yields a random classifier. Global variables enlarge the detectable space but with limited sensitivity for slight severity levels. Besides, they still present some gaps at locations where the associated eigenmodes have a small curvature that restricts the sensitivity of the corresponding eigenfrequency. It is the case of damage D2, which provides a low-performance classification.</p><p>After analyzing the combination of variables, an enhancement in the detection ability of the reconstruction error was observed, allowing us to detect lighter severity levels. When damage occurs far from local variables, the combined DNN reaches only the same solution as global variables alone since there is no contribution from local variables. Results reflect the enhancement attained when combining both data sources in terms of damage sensitivity.</p><p>We also investigated the ability of local variables to inform about the location of damage. By calculating the contribution of local variables at each instrumented section to the total reconstruction error, we attained that local variables successfully locate damage that occurs in the vicinity of the sensor emplacement. We concluded that local variables aid in the detection task and contribute to finding the possible damage location. However, the method is unable to locate damage when it occurs far from instrumented sections, which poses a limitation to the approach in locating damage.</p><p>Results suggested that an important issue when implementing SHM systems lies in the adequate disposal of the sensors. Deploying many sensors helps to improve diagnostics, but it results in inadmissible costs. An intelligent positioning strategy might yield a more efficient solution. Essential locations are, apart from those more susceptible to suffering damage (e.g., joints, pier foundations), those where eigenmodes present small curvature values since global variables lose sensitivity at these positions. Since eigenmodes can be obtained beforehand (through an ambient vibration test or numerical simulations), those nodes that are more "blind" to global variables can be identified and supported with local variable sensors.</p><p>The proposed method presents some modeling limitations that must be mentioned and addressed. The employed FE model is subject to assumptions and simplifications that introduce a discrepancy with respect to the true structural response. Although we overcome this discrepancy by tuning the boundary conditions in the model, a more sophisticated method based on iterative updating could provide more accurate results. Besides, the employed FE model disregards the effect of varying EOCs since it is updated for the specific EOCs occurring during an ambient vibration test. We consider future work incorporating EOCs in the damage simulations to obtain more realistic shifts between healthy and damaged scenarios. Using bayesian approaches both in the updating process and in the autoencoder architecture contributes to handling these variability sources mainly when combining numerical simulations with experimental data, posing a key topic for our future developments.</p><p>We also consider as future research the investigation of other damage scenarios to extend the validation of the proposed methodology and to demonstrate the potential of monitoring data in the early assessment of the structural behavior of bridges. Representing degradation phenomena in the system or subcomponents to identify performance trends and prevent catastrophic failures poses a future study of interest focused on predictive maintenance.</p><p>Finally, in line with our previous works on supervised learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">102]</ref>, we also contemplate as future work investigating the discrepancy between the experimental and numerical healthy state and its effect in the damage identification task. We will explore domain adaptation techniques to minimize the distance between both spaces and accurately classify damage location and severity.</p><p>This work was financially supported by: Base Funding -UIDB/04708/2020 of the CONSTRUCT -Instituto de I&amp;D em Estruturas e Construções -funded by national funds through the FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC).</p><p>David Pardo has received funding from: the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation projects with references TED2021-132783B-I00, PID2019-108111RB-I00 MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 (FEDER/AEI) and PDC2021-121093-I00 (MCIN / AEI / 10.13039/501100011033/Next Generation EU), the "BCAM Severo Ochoa" accreditation of excellence CEX2021-001142-S / MICIN / AEI / 10.13039/501100011033; the Spanish Ministry of Economic and Digital Transformation with Misiones Project IA4TES (MIA.2021.M04.008 / NextGenerationEU PRTR); and the Basque Government through the BERC 2022-2025 program, the Elkartek project SIGZE (KK-2021/00095), and the Consolidated Research Group MATHMODE (IT1456-22) given by the Department of Education.</p><p>Authors would like to acknowledge the Basque Government funding within the HAZITEK programme (ERROTAID project) and TCRINI project (KK-2023-0029), and the European Horizon (HE) with LIASON project (GA 101103698), and FUTURAL project (101083958).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX A</head><p>This appendix reports some comparisons of different Deep Neural Network architectures. We provide this material to demonstrate that combining local and global variables brings an important enhancement in the damage detection task regardless of the selected architecture.</p><p>We first explore sequential, fully connected DNNs without parallel connections. We design three dense architectures, one for each dataset. We use the same layers as those in the nonlinear blocks in our proposed architectures. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">12</ref> provides the number of parameters for each DNN. We consider the four damage scenarios with a 10% severity. Figure <ref type="figure">21</ref> shows the ROC  <ref type="figure">13</ref> reveals that our approach provides slightly better results. See, for example, the curves for damage 𝐷3: while the local and global datasets provide similar outcomes, the combined dataset (red dashed line) yields the perfect classifier with our architecture (see Figure <ref type="figure">13 c</ref>, whereas the sequential approach (Figure <ref type="figure">21 c</ref>) produces a considerably worse performance. The same is observed for damage scenarios 𝐷1 and 𝐷4.</p><p>We also analyze the effect of including convolutional operations. We design a convolutional architecture similar to the sequential approach but containing three convolutional layers at both the encoder and the decoder parts. The use of convolutional operations considerably reduces the number of trainable parameters. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">13</ref> provides the number of parameters for each DNN. Figure  for the other severity levels. We compare these results with those obtained with our proposed architectures in Figure <ref type="figure">13</ref> . Results exhibit a very similar behavior for both architecture types. Regarding damage 𝐷1, we observe a slightly better performance of our proposed DNNs (see Figures 13 a and 22 a). In summary, our architecture presents no significant advantages compared to convolutional transformations in damage detection.</p><p>In the considered DNNs, the architectures designed for the combined dataset require a much larger number of parameters compared to local and global datasets. This parameter increase occurs since we unavoidably must modify the input and output layer dimensions to accommodate the different input sizes. Besides, the the hidden layers must be redimensioned accordingly. Although these are the minimal adjustments to adapt the input data, they may result in very different architectures that make it challenging to fairly compare the three datasets. For this purpose, we explore two types of similarity in the architectures.</p><p>(A) Similarity in terms of the number of parameters: We employ the same architecture of 𝐷𝑁𝑁 Combined by only modifying the input and output layer dimensions but leaving the hidden layers unchanged. The number of parameters is now comparable, as indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">14</ref> . We compare the ROC curves obtained during testing for the four damage scenarios with 10% severity.  We study the results when the three DNNs share the same mathematical properties by deactivating the nonlinear blocks. By training only with the linear blocks that admit affine transformations, we can compare the three architectures and evaluate how each dataset contributes to detecting the damage. Figure <ref type="figure">24</ref> exhibits the ROC curves obtained for this linear configuration of the architectures. The results are considerably worse with respect to those in Figure <ref type="figure">13</ref> a given the lack of nonlinear transformations in these architectures. However, we observe the same effect when combining local and global variables compared to using each dataset independently. These two comparisons demonstrate that the differences in the results when using each dataset are indeed motivated by the sensitivity of local and global variables to the different damage scenarios. The combination of both sources of data enhances the detection task compared to using local or global variables alone. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 Figure 3</head><label>23</label><figDesc>Figure 2 Evolution of the seven inclinometers over the monitoring period</figDesc><graphic coords="6,95.39,57.29,404.50,211.99" type="bitmap" /></figure>
