<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The wealth of nations differs significantly due to different factors. One of the reasons identified by previous studies is the level of entrepreneurship promotion by governments. This aspect has scarcely been studied empirically to date. Therefore, this paper sheds some light on this regard through building a construct out of ten Ease of Doing Business Index (EDBI) measures developed by the World Bank and relating it with a construct shaped by two measures of socio-economic wealth (SEW), namely gross domestic product and the Human Development Index. To this end, we conduct a structural equation model analysis using partial least squares (PLS-SEM) method with a 2018 database comprising secondary data from 190 countries. As the main contribution of this study, the results show that good performance in the EDBI ranking predicts good performance in the SEW ranking. Additionally, this study is pioneer in the use of these rankings to build composite constructs (latent variables) and relate them. For these reasons, our findings are useful for both academia and governments responsible for promoting entrepreneurship, as this latter is identified as the key enabler of economic development.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Factors involved in determining the socioeconomic level development of nations are common subjects in a large number of research studies to date. However, this area still requires further analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mongay, 2018)</ref>. Specifically, a government role as facilitator of enterprises' creation is identified as the key issue for economic growth of regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ruiz, Cabello and Pérez-Gladish, 2018)</ref>. For this reason, entrepreneur abilities to modify their environment through leveraging opportunities resulted from wealth creation, as Wang (2017) pointed out, need to be strengthened, or at least not hindered, by governments serving to develop their potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Szirmai, Naudé and Goedhuys, 2011)</ref>. Therefore, entrepreneurship is considered a driver of economic change and for some authors such as Greenspan and Wooldridge (2018, as cited in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Book, 2019)</ref> both are interchangeable terms in countries like America.</p><p>Since 2002, the World Bank Group has been developing its Doing Business project, aimed at providing impartial and objective measures of national business regulations <ref type="bibr">(Doing Business, 2018)</ref>. According to their ease of doing business, these reports rank countries from 1st to 190th place. The higher an economy appears in this ranking, the more favorable its business regulatory environment is in relation to launching and development of enterprises. The Ease of Doing Business Index (EDBI) is made up by the aggregation of the scores on the ten following topics:</p><p>1 Linkages between the fostering of entrepreneurship and socioeconomic wealth of nations have been reasoned from a theoretical approach. Nevertheless, an empirical approach, involving data collection and analysis, might be needed to explore the existence of a relationship between the ease of doing business and socioeconomic wealth. Regarding this, we try to relate the EDBI with Socio-Economic Wealth (SEW) measures in order to assess a potential predictive relationship between them. Specifically, this paper carries out a structural equation model analysis through the use of partial least squares (PLS-SEM) with a 2018 database comprising secondary data from 190 countries (see Appendix section). This study is pioneer in the use of these rankings to build composite constructs and relate them. The following sections will present the conceptual model, methods used to reach our objectives, ending with the results and conclusions sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">LITERATURE REVIEW</head><p>As pointed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ruiz, Cabello and Pérez-Gladish (2018)</ref>, investment location decisions may entail the entrepreneur to focus on those countries where such investments seem more accurate, wiser and secure. In this vein, effective and transparent business regulatory systems developed by governments that enable entrepreneurship is a research subject requiring a deeper analysis. However, this is a rather complex topic, taking into account the diverse array of factors that might influence an entrepreneur choice (i.e., business atmosphere, the human development level, political and macroeconomic stability). This topic has been deeply addressed from a theoretical point of view framed within the Austrian School of Economics. Recently, based on the ideas of entrepreneurial spirit and spontaneous order <ref type="bibr">(von Mises, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hayek, 1960</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">), Huerta-De Soto (2010)</ref> defines entrepreneurship as a dynamic process of discovering, recognizing and seizing opportunities to achieve an end or obtain profits, and act accordingly to take advantage of these opportunities that arise in the environment. For instance, as stated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Szirmai, Naudé and Goedhuys (2011)</ref>, socio-economic development needs continued and shared escalations in GDP per capita jointly with progressive fundamental changes in the settings and productive structure of economy towards goods manufacture. Consequently this leads to higher value-added and the introduction of more efficient production techniques. In this vein, entrepreneurs might foster a country's economic growth by enabling the rearrangement of resources to more productive applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acs and Storey 2004)</ref>, carrying out essential economic functions (e.g. reducing costs, filling market gaps, completing inputs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Szirmai et al., 2011)</ref> and upholding structural adjustment <ref type="bibr">(Gries and Naudé 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Several studies are based on the World Bank Group's Doing Business database (i.e. <ref type="bibr">Schueth, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">Schueth, , 2015;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cooley, 2015)</ref> and pointed out the existence of certain significant methodological flaws. Furthermore, an independent evaluation study suggested the need for developing more informative rankings <ref type="bibr">(World Bank, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ruiz et al., 2018)</ref>. Thus, the relationship between the ease of doing business and socio-economic remains unclear as prior research has conducted to inconclusive results. As suggested by <ref type="bibr">Szirmai et al. (2011, p. 28</ref>) "At the top of the agenda, remains the question why in some cases the institutional environment effectively stifles innovative behaviour, while other times entrepreneurs can find a way around the obstacles". Hence, scholars ought to address efforts to analyze and understand the interplay between the fields of entrepreneurship and development economics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Conceptual model</head><p>In light of the above, this paper attempts to narrow this gap by analyzing the extent to which EDBI empirically predicts socio-economic wealth. For this purpose, this paper empirically assesses the causal relationships between the exogenous variable, EDBI, and the endogenous variable, SEW. Both composite variables shaped by ten and two dimensions, respectively. We empirically test our research hypothesis assess in a sample comprising 190 countries by the use of Partial Least Squares -Structural Equations Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. 3. METHODOLOGY</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Data collection</head><p>This study is based on secondary data belonging to diverse data repositories. Precisely, the data corresponding to the EDBI indicators was obtained from the World Bank 'Doing Business Ranking <ref type="bibr">' (2018)</ref>. Regarding the data indicators shaping the socio-economic wealth, GDP per capita ranking indicators were taken from the International Monetary Fund (2017), and HDI ranking indicators came from the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report <ref type="bibr">(2018)</ref>.</p><p>Assessing the Ease of Doing Business essentially bears on the enterprise day-to-day activities jointly with the facilities or obstacles they have to face while observing national, regional or local business regulation. GDP per capita comprises the total aggregate value of the goods and services produced within a nation in a year, divided by its number of inhabitants. Instead, the HDI is a composite statistic shaped by life expectancy, education, and income per capita indicators. A country scores higher HDI when the life expectancy at birth is longer, the education period is longer, and the income per capita is higher. Likewise, it is used to distinguish amongst developed, a developing or underdeveloped countries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Data analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Descriptive statistics</head><p>We carefully checked the data in terms of its descriptive statistics, correlations and normality. This way, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> comprises information regarding the missing, mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness values. The hypothesis test regarding normally distribution of the dependent variable was performed by Shapiro-Wilk test of normality through JASP package (2019). As it is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>, The p-values are significant, meaning there is statistical reason for endorsing the deviation from normality of the dependent variables. Finally, Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">6</ref> and<ref type="table">7</ref> (Appendix section) comprise the raw data and indicators correlations, respectively.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">PLS analysis</head><p>To empirically test the hypothesis posited within this study, this paper relies on the use of Partial Least Squares (PLS) path-modeling, a variance-based structural equation modeling (VBSEM) technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Roldán and Sánchez-Franco, 2012)</ref>. The main reason underlying this decision refers to the composite nature of the two constructs under assessment in our research model. Although Granger causality statistical hypothesis test would have been equally useful according to our research purpose of predicting causality, this study works with composite constructs that consequently requires a different approach. Prior studies endorse the use of PLS when a composite measurement model is supported <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Felipe et al., 2017)</ref>. Both theoretical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Rigdon, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Rigdon, Sarstedt, &amp; Ringle, 2017)</ref> and empirical simulation works <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Becker, Rai, &amp; Rigdon, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Sarstedt, Hair, Ringle, Thiele, &amp; Gudergan, 2016)</ref> endorse and advice the use of PLS-SEM for models comprising composite constructs. In addition, this study is primarily focused on the prediction of the dependent construct -SEW- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hair, Ringle and Sarstedt, 2011)</ref>. The exogenous construct -EDBI-was modeled as a composite and was estimated in Mode B (regression weights), while Mode A (correlation weights) was chosen for measuring the endogenous construct -SEW-. Furthermore, SmartPLS 3.2.7 software was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ringle, Wende and Becker, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">EMPIRICAL RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Evaluation of the measurement model</head><p>The assessment of the PLS measurement model displays satisfactory results. Firstly, regarding the Socio-Economic Wealth construct, it has been modeled as a composite construct in Mode A. This requires that the evaluation of the measurement model may comprise the following assessments: (i) individual item reliability, (ii) construct reliability, (iii) convergent validity and (iv) discriminant validity. The indicators meet the requirement of individual item reliability, since the outer loadings are both over the 0.707 threshold (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Besides, this construct satisfies the requirements of construct reliability, as its Cronbach's Alpha and Composite Reliability are greater than 0.7 (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>), and convergent validity, as its average variance extracted (AVE) is over the 0.5 critical level (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Finally, Table <ref type="table">3</ref> discloses that discriminant validity is attained, according to the heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT) criterion <ref type="bibr">(Henseler et al., 2015)</ref>, which indicates that values ought to be under the threshold of 0.85 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kline, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Secondly, the ease of doing business construct has been modeled as composite construct in Mode B. Therefore, it must be assessed in terms of (i) potential multicollinearity between items and (ii) weight assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Roldán and Sánchez-Franco, 2012)</ref>. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Petter, Straub and Rai (2007)</ref> variance inflation factor (VIF) values that surpass the threshold of 3.3 denotes the existence of high multicollinearity between items. Nevertheless, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ringle, Wende and Becker (2015)</ref> suggest that multicollinearity should be a serious concern when VIF values are over the critical level of 5. In our case (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>), the maximum VIF value for indicators ascends to 2.537, standing below the thresholds proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ringle et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Petter et al. (2007)</ref>. Thus, multicollinearity is not a concern in our study. Subsequently, it is necessary to examine the magnitude and significance of the weights (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Weights provide information concerning how each item contributes to the respective composite <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chin, 1998)</ref>, enabling to rank the indicators on the basis of their contribution. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Evaluation of the structural model</head><p>As suggested by <ref type="bibr">Hair et al. (2014)</ref>, this study applies a bootstrapping (5,000 resamples) technique to generate the standard errors, t-statistics, p-values and 95% bias corrected confidence intervals (BCCI) that permit the evaluation of the statistical significance for the relationships hypothesized in the conceptual model. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> presents the main parameters that are obtained for the structural model under assessment in this paper. The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) is employed as the main criterion for measuring explained variance -the extent to which exogenous constructs explain endogenous constructs-. The outcomes contained in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> show that the structural model attains acceptable predictive relevance for the endogenous construct, given that the R 2 coefficient is equal to 0.638 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>). Moreover, the direct relationship hypothesized between EDBI and SEW is shown to be positive and significant. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Evaluation of the predictive ability model</head><p>This study also assesses whether this model entails predictive ability. In this line, Shmueli and Koppius (2011) label a model's predictive performance as its ability to generate precise predictions of new observations, whether they are temporal or cross-sectional. Furthermore, Shmueli (2010) posits that explanation and prediction involve two distinctive purposes that could be combined in a research study. Such view is also shared by <ref type="bibr">Dolce, Vinzi and Lauro (2017, p. 169)</ref>, who argue that "The predictions of path models should be sensitive to the theory. In particular, the theoretical model represented by the structural equations and prediction should not be separated".</p><p>Hence, this study assesses the predictive ability (out-of-sample prediction) of the proposed conceptual model by using cross-validation with holdout samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Evermann and Tate, 2016)</ref> focusing on the key endogenous construct (SEW). Concretely, this paper makes use of the PLS predict algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Shmueli et al, 2016)</ref> available in the SmartPLS software version 3.2.7. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ringle et al, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>To evaluate if the model entails predictive ability it is required to check the Q 2 value. Q 2 values greater than 0 imply that the prediction error of PLS results are smaller than the prediction error of merely using the mean values. Therefore, reaching positive Q 2 values implies that the proposed conceptual model attains appropriate predictive ability. The conceptual model proposed within this paper fulfills this criterion both at the construct (i.e., SEW), and at the dimension (Ranking GDP pc and Ranking HDI) levels (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>As it was pointed out before, not many studies have empirically attempted to test whether there is a positive relationship between the ease of doing business and socio-economic wealth. This paper sheds some light upon this research gap and empirically analyzes the extent to which EDBI predicts socio-economic wealth. Results derived from the use of Partial Least Squares -Structural Equations Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique reveal that there is a positive and significant link between the EDBI and the socio-economic wealth of nations. This could be considered an important contribution, bearing in mind that previous studies were unable to set that relation. However, not only the positive relation could be demonstrated but a predictive ability of the model. Therefore, it is possible to establish that the EDBI is a predictor of SEW. Consequently, it seems likely that the more obstacles to free trade a government introduces, the lower its socio-economic wealth level will be.</p><p>In this line, the Austrian school of economics, firmer than any other school of economic thought, has disapproved almost all forms of governmental interference in the market -particularly inflation, price controls, barriers to free market and schemes for redistribution of wealth or income-, arguing that such interventions typically contribute to erode the incentives, to generate distortions in production, as well as shortages, demoralization, and other undesirable effects. Moreover, Friedrick A. Hayek remarkably argued that those grand and ambitious governmental plans frequently lead to unintended consequences. In fact, such view became the intellectual rationale behind Ronald Reagan's and Margaret Thatcher's economic agendas of the 1980s and 1990s <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fukuyama, 2011)</ref>. In his work "The Constitution of Liberty", <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hayek (1960)</ref> develops further this view of the limits of human cognition and claims that governments are not able to discern sufficiently about a society to be able to plan accurately.</p><p>Among the main practical implications of these results, it is important to note that a government's more suitable role should be somehow more modest, limited to the creation of laws that generally and equally applied may represent the ground upon which spontaneous interactions among individuals might happen <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fukuyama, 2011)</ref>. It is only within this social order that Hayek delimits the role governments should adopt in society. Thus, governments must merely exist to deliver a ground or structure within which human collaboration is maximized <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andrieu, 2010)</ref>. Finally, it would be useful to perform confirmatory tests of these results through a longitudinal study or other methodological approaches.   </p></div>
