<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Deep generative models like VAEs and diffusion models have advanced various generation tasks by leveraging latent variables to learn data distributions and generate high-quality samples. Despite the field of explainable AI making strides in interpreting machine learning models, understanding latent variables in generative models remains challenging. This paper introduces LatentExplainer 1 , a framework for automatically generating semantically meaningful explanations of latent variables in deep generative models. Latent-Explainer tackles three main challenges: inferring the meaning of latent variables, aligning explanations with inductive biases, and handling varying degrees of explainability. Our approach perturbs latent variables, interprets changes in generated data, and uses multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce human-understandable explanations. We evaluate our proposed method on several realworld and synthetic datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance in generating high-quality explanations for latent variables. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating inductive biases and uncertainty quantification, significantly enhancing model interpretability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and diffusion models <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, have become a state-of-the-art approach in various generation tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. These methods effectively leverage latent variables to learn underlying data distributions and generate high-quality samples by capturing the underlying structure of high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional semantic space. As the latent variables represent all the information in a lower dimension, they can be considered as an effective abstraction of key factors in the data. Therefore, it is critical to develop methods for automatically decomposing and explaining meaningful latent dimension semantics given a pretrained generative model and its inherent inductive biases, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Inductive biases are often enforced over latent variables in deep generative models. For instance, disentanglement is a rule of thumb which enforces orthogonality among different latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Moreover, sometimes latent variables can be grouped, leading to combination bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. More recently, the desire for controllability in deep generative models, where latent variables are associated with specific properties of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, has given rise to conditional bias. Incorporating inductive biases aligned with the actual facts can reduce the hallucination in explaining the latent variables in deep generative models <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has extensively investigated the interpretation of machine learning models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. However, interpreting latent variables in deep generative models remains underexplored. Machine learning model explanation, a.k.a., post-hoc explanation, can be categorized into global and local explanations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Global explanations focus on elucidating the entire model, while local explanations target the reasoning behind specific predictions. Global explanations are more challenging, with existing work mostly emphasizing attributions to identify which features are most important for model decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The missing piece is understanding the meaning of features when they are unknown, which is very common in deep generative models. More recently, one category of global explanation methods, called concept-based explanations, aims to generate more human-understandable concepts as explanations <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. However, current concept-based methods often rely on human heuristics or predefined concept and feature space, limiting the expressiveness of the explanations and falling short of achieving truly automatic explanation generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>Despite the progress in XAI, interpreting latent variables in deep generative models presents significant challenges. First, these variables are not grounded in real-world concepts, and the black-box nature of the models prevents us from inferring the meaning of latent variables from observations. Second, explanations must adhere to the inductive biases imposed on the latent variables, which is essential yet difficult to ensure. For example, in disentangled latent variables, the semantic meanings should be orthogonal. Third, different latent variables have varying degrees of explainability. Some may be trivial to data generation and intrinsically lack semantic meaning. It is crucial to identify which latent variables are explainable and which do not need explanations.</p><p>To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose LatentExplainer, a novel and generic framework that automatically generates semantically-meaningful explanations of latent variables in deep generative models. Specifically, to explain these variables and work around the black-box nature of the models, we propose to perturb each latent variable and explain the resulting changes in the generated data. Specifically, we perturb and decode each manipulated latent variable to produce the corresponding sequence of generated data samples. The trend in the sequence is leveraged to reflect the semantics of the latent variable to be explained. To align explanations with the intrinsic nature of the deep generative models, we design a generic framework that formulates inductive biases on the Bayesian network of latent variable models into textual prompts. These prompts are understandable to large foundation models and humans. To handle the varying degree of explainability in latent variables, we propose to measure the confidence of the explanations by estimating their uncertainty. This approach assesses whether the latent variables are interpretable and selects the most consistent explanations, ensuring accurate and meaningful interpretation of the latent variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Deep Generative Models. Deep generative models are essential for modeling complex data distributions. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are prominent in this area, introduced by Kingma and Welling <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. VAEs encode input data into a latent space and decode it back, optimizing a balance between reconstruction error and the Kullback-Leibler divergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. They have diverse applications, including image generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, and anomaly detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Diffusion models, proposed by Ho et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, generate data by a diffusion process that gradually adds noise to the data and then learns to reverse this process to recover the original data. These models have achieved high-fidelity image generation, surpassing generative adversarial networks (GANs) in quality and diversity. Latent diffusion models allow the model to operate in a lower-dimensional space, which significantly reduces computational requirements while maintaining the quality of the generated samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Advances have made them applicable to text-to-image synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and audio generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Latent Variable Manipulation and Explanations. Manipulating latent variables in generative models like VAEs and diffusion models is an important technique for editing and enhancing generated images. A key method is latent traverse, which involves traversing different values of latent variables to achieve diverse manipulations in the generated outputs. This technique allows for precise control over the attributes in generated images, enabling adjustments <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. For example, latent traverse has been effectively employed to disentangle and control various attributes in generated images <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. However, latent traverse is often used for visualization and editing purposes. It has not yet been widely explored as a tool for explaining the underlying latent space. Their explanations primarily rely on using predefined training attributes as text labels or manually adding explanations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. Some concept-based models control latent variables in generative models using category concepts to generate data <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. However, these approaches cannot automatically generate free-form textual explanations.</p><p>More recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) integrate diverse data modalities, enhancing their ability to understand and generate complex information <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. Notable models include GPT-4o, which extends GPT-4v with better visual capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and Gemini that is a family of highly capable multimodal models <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. We envision leveraging MLLMs to automatically generate explanations for latent variables and incorporate their inductive biases to reduce hallucination. Our work focuses on: (1) how to decompose the inductive bias formulas to automate the manipulation of latent variables, (2) how to develop prompts that are aligned with the underlying inductive biases of generative models and can be easily understood by MLLMs, and (3) how to evaluate the quality of the generated explanations for latent variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Preliminaries and Problem Formulation</head><p>Deep Generative Models. These are a class of models that learn a mapping between observations x and underlying latent factors z.  These models are widely used in deep generative models such as VAEs and latent diffusion models. VAEs, for instance, introduce a probabilistic approach to encoding data by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L ELBO = E 𝑞 (z|x) [log 𝑝 (x|z)] -KL(𝑞(z|x)∥𝑝 (z)),</formula><p>where KL stands for Kullback-Leibler divergence. Latent diffusion models further refine the generation process by iteratively refining noise into structured data <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. These models effectively capture the underlying structure of data in a low-dimensional semantic space. Latent variable manipulation of diffusion models aims at transversing the latent variables z along the semantic latent direction z i . The perturbed vector z</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= z + 𝛾 [G(z + z i ) -G(z)],</formula><p>where 𝛾 is a hyper-parameter controlling the strength and G is a diffusion decoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. An image sequence can then be generated by G( z). The perturbations in the semantic latent direction lead to semantic changes in the generated image sequence. Inductive Bias in Latent Variables. Inductive biases are usually imposed on latent variables to enhance the performance and interpretability of deep generative models. These inductive biases in deep generative models can be categorized into three common types: Disentanglement Bias: It enforces orthogonality among different latent variables, ensuring that each latent variable captures a distinct factor of variation in the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Combination bias: Sometimes latent variables are grouped, leading to biases in how they interact and combine to represent complex data structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Conditional Bias: It emphasizes the relationship between specific properties of interest and the corresponding latent variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Problem Formulation. We assume a dataset D, where each sample consists of 𝑥 or (𝑥, 𝑦), with 𝑥 ∈ R 𝑁 and 𝑦 = {𝑦 𝑘 ∈ R} 𝐾 𝑘=1 as 𝐾 properties of 𝑥. The dataset D is generated by M latent variables 𝑧 𝑖 , where 𝑖 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝑀 }. 𝑧 𝑖 can be an individual latent dimension in 𝑧 in the VAE models or a latent vector in the diffusion models. Suppose we are given a generative model with a set of formulas F with respect to 𝑧 𝑖 , where F represents an inductive bias that the generative model must satisfy. Our goal is to derive a textual sequence that explains the semantic meanings of 𝑧 𝑖 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Proposed Method 4.1 Overview of LatentExplainer</head><p>This paper focuses on the tasks in explaining the semantics of latent variables {𝑧 𝑖 } 𝑀 𝑖=1 in deep generative models. To interpret the semantics of latent variables and work around the blackbox nature of deep generative models, we propose to perturb each 𝑧 𝑖 and explain the change it imposes on the generated data. To solve these challenges, we propose a novel LatentExplainer scheme. The pseudo-code of this whole scheme can be found in Algorithm 1. When explaining latent variable models, it is crucial to fully leverage and align with the prior knowledge about them. To do this, we design a generic framework that can automatically formulate inductive bias of generative models into textual prompts. Specifically, we have summarized three common inductive biases and designed their symbol-to-word one-on-one prompts P (Section 4.2). Our scheme can adaptively convert a user-provided inductive bias formulas F into a corresponding prompt P to provide more accurate explanations of the latent variables in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(b) (Section 4.3). We decompose the inductive bias to guide the perturbation of 𝑧 𝑖 and subsequently decode the manipulated latent variables into generated data that are perceptible by humans such as images. Through a series of perturbations on 𝑧 𝑖 , a sequence of generated data samples can be obtained to reflect the changes in 𝑧 𝑖 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(a) (Section 4.4). Eventually, the explanations are selected through an uncertainty quantification approach to assess whether the latent variables are interpretable and select the most consistent explanations in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(c) (Section 4.5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Inductive-bias-guided Prompt Framework</head><p>4.2.1 Generic Framework. In this section, we propose a generic framework that can verbalize the inductive bias in deep generative models into prompts for better latent variable explanations. The prevalent inductive biases in deep generative models are categorized into three types: disentanglement bias, conditional bias, and combination bias.</p><p>Our framework proposes a principled, automatic way that translate the mathematical expression to textual prompts. The prompts include adaptive prompts and a fixed ending. The adaptive prompts  <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. The formula representing this bias focuses on ensuring that different latent variables correspond to different independent underlying factors.

This function traverses the formula to identify the mathematical symbols.</p><p>Next, the algorithm initializes an empty dictionary semantics to store the semantic representations of these symbols (line 5). For each symbol, the pre-trained LLM 𝜋 𝜃 extracts its semantic meaning based on few-shot examples H and the optional input symbol information I (lines 6-9).</p><p>Finally, the algorithm generates the prompt P using the formula F , the few-shot examples H , and the gathered semantics (line 10).

The coding agent then tests and refines the generated code to effectively perturb 𝑧 𝑖 . Through a series of perturbations on 𝑧 𝑖 , a sequence of generated images can be obtained, capturing the variations in 𝑧 𝑖 and reflecting its influence on the generated data. Finally, all image sequences generated from the relevant formulas are aggregated to generate explanations about 𝑧 𝑖 . The implementation details are in Section 5.4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Generative Models under Inductive Biases</head><p>We explore the latent space in generative models that satisfy the aforementioned three types of inductive biases. For each type, we present the relevant generative models that align with the corresponding inductive bias: (1) Disentanglement Bias: 𝛽-TCVAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> explicitly penalizes the total correlation of the latent variables to disentangle the latent variables. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> adds Gaussian noise independently at each timestep in the forward process and eventually transforms into pure Gaussian noise, in which the covariance matrix is diagonal. This assumes the latent factors are independent; (2) Combination Bias: CSVAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> has two groups of latent variables 𝑧 and 𝑤, where 𝑧 and 𝑤 are uncorrelated and the latent variables within the group are correlated; (3) Conditional Bias: CSVAE also satisfies conditional bias because one group of latent variables 𝑤 is associated with the properties while the other group of latent variables 𝑧 minimizes the mutual information with the properties. Stable Diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> is a latent diffusion model to generate images conditioned on prompts.</p></div>

Otherwise, r will be "no clear explanation".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Human Annotaions</head><p>The ground-truth annotations of explanations are performed by three annotators from the United States and China. All annotators are students that had at least an undergraduate degree. Annotators were presented with the same images and the prompts as MLLMs and were asked to annotate the pattern of the images. If there is no clear pattern, just write "No clear explanation". The annotations are then aggregated as references to calculate the automated evaluation metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7">Quantitative Analysis</head><p>For the quantitative explanation evaluation, we use BLEU <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, ROUGE-L <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, SPICE <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, BERTScore <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, and BARTScore <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> as the automated metrics to assess the generated explanations. BLEU, and ROUGE-L are n-gram-based metrics that measure the overlap between generated and reference texts. SPICE compares scene graphs derived from the generated and reference texts. BERTScore and BARTScore utilize pre-trained transformer-based language models to compute contextual embeddings of the generated and reference texts. These metrics together provide a comprehensive assessment of both the lexical and semantic quality of the explanations.</p><p>We evaluate the performance of Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o across all diffusion and vae models and datasets. Our proposed LatentExlainer method is a model-agnostic module and the inclusion of LatentExplainer consistently leads to substantial performance improvements on all MLLMs -Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o. Across diffusion-based models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, LatentExplainer delivers significant improvements across all datasets and metrics. Notably, when integrated with GPT-4o on CelebA-HQ, BLEU improves from 5. For VAE-based models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, LatentExplainer achieves even more striking gains. On the 𝛽-TCVAE model with GPT-4o, performance on 3DShapes sees BLEU increase from 5.51 to 25.40, and SPICE from 7.92 to 22.78. Across dSprites, the BLEU jump from 0.00 to 12.55 and ROUGE-L from 16.19 to 37.30 further demonstrate the utility of our approach. In summary, LatentExplainer consistently boosts the interpretability and textual quality of explanations for latent variable models across settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.8">Ablation Study</head><p>To understand the impact of various components in our proposed LatentExplainer, we conducted a comprehensive ablation study on GPT-4o across different models (DDPM, 𝛽-TCVAE, Stable Diffusion, and CSVAE) and inductive biases (disentanglement, combination, and conditional). Specifically, we compare the removal of inductive bias prompts (IB), the removal of uncertainty quantification (UQ), and the full model against the baseline GPT-4o. The results for each dataset are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>. Removing inductive bias prompts leads to a substantial drop in all generative models. Their consistent results demonstrate that inductive bias is the most important and necessary component when explaining the latent variables of generative models. The removal of uncertainty quantification also results in a slightly decreased performance in all generative models, indicating that uncertainty quantification is also effective, though not as critical as inductive bias prompts. The full model, which incorporates both inductive bias prompts and uncertainty quantification, achieves the highest overall performance, and outperforms all baselines across all models. This confirms the necessity of both inductive bias prompts and uncertainty quantification in our LatentExplainer framework, demonstrating their significant contributions to improving explanatory performance across various generative models. It also shows that our framework can effectively design prompts for different inductive biases in generative models to improve the accuracy and reduce hallucination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.9">Qualitative Evaluation</head><p>To analyze the explanations for DDPM under disentanglement bias, we manipulate the latent variable along a latent direction and compare it with the one that first traverses along another latent direction and then traverses along the same latent direction. The disentangled latent variable would be invariant with respect to the variations in another latent dimension. In Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, for each latent direction, we pass two image sequences and an inductive bias prompt based on the disentanglement formula to the MLLM to obtain a common latent explanation. In comparison, the explanations generated without the inductive bias prompt as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> tend to show "no clear explanation" or wrong explanations as they only align with one image sequence but do not reflect the common pattern in both image sequences in view of the inductive bias. The addition of the inductive bias prompts can assist with ruling out the variation effects of other latent variables to capture the actual meaning.</p><p>We also qualitatively evaluate the explanations for CSVAE under combination bias. We transverse a latent variable and compare it with the one that first traverses another latent variable in another group and then traverses the same latent variable, which is similar to the disentanglement bias. We then compare with the one that first transverses another latent variable in the same group and then traverses the same latent variable. As Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> depicts, our model can clearly show the explanations of latent variable 𝑧 1 , 𝑧 2 , 𝑧 3 as the color of the ground, the background color, and the shape of the object. The effect of removing inductive bias prompts leads to no clear explanation like the disentanglement bias in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref>, we provide the "young appearance" prompt to Stable Diffusion under conditional bias, and the explanations of all three top latent directions reflect the meaning of youth. The addition of inductive bias prompts can better identify the relation with the property of interest to capture the actual meaning of latent variables. In comparison, the one without the inductive bias prompts in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8</ref>, cannot find clear explanations or simply describe the characteristics in the image sequence, lacking an abstract generalization. More qualitative evaluation results can be found in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">9</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we introduced LatentExplainer, a framework designed to generate semantically meaningful explanations of latent variables in deep generative models. Our work makes three key contributions: (1) Inferring the meaning of latent variables by translating inductive bias formulas into structured perturbations of latent variables through a coding agent; (2) Aligning explanations with inductive biases by converting mathematical formulations into textual prompts in MLLMs; (3) Introducing an uncertainty-aware approach that assesses explanation consistency. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple datasets and generative models demonstrate that LatentExplainer significantly outperforms baseline methods. The incorporation of inductive bias prompts leads to more structured and meaningful explanations, while uncertainty-aware filtering further enhances consistency and reliability. Our findings highlight the importance of inductive bias prompting and uncertainty quantification in bridging the gap between generative models and human interpretability.</p></div>
